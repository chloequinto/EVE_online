1/1/2009,"um, i'm not refusing to put any cards anywhere. my cards are on the table entirely. you're just refusing to look at them and believe what the hand was. it's certainly your prerogative to decide i'm doing some sneaky backdoor thing, and given that all of this is public before and after the fact at the end of the day either i'll have presented exactly what i'm saying i am, or you'll be right and i'm a sheister and you can crow about it on the forums.ultimately my proposal is purposely open ended to give the devs room to be devs, and you can believe what you will about it as you'll know in the end how it turned out.my plan's only got two points and if you somehow think that trying to bring more people to 0.0 won't provoke fights then cool. if you prefer a system of 70 moon systems where there's a month of buildup before a single fight then fine. if you want to go all or nothing with whatever's in your head then sorry, that's just not what's on the table here. removing posses entirely may very well be the desired end result, but what i'm proposing is a transition, as nobody and i do mean nobody has a workable mechanic for the end game at this point."
1/1/2009,"i don't think you're a bad at all, i think you're doing what most people do. you want your plan to work and you're trying to put it out there in it's best light. i just feel it's not being examined for it's merit and people are just bandwagoning on change because they hope it'll work. i want people to go out there and examine the changes and be sure they'll work before implementing them, because we've all seen how long it's taken to even get this far, god help us if we have to start again.you're own people are hurting the cause by stating on the forums that they're supporting this b/c they're told to w/o examining it, and sadly, i'm betting that's true for most of em.if we're gonna make this work, it's gotta be a full out revamp of the existing system, because we all know rewrites are less likely to go through with the devs than revamps are.i'm not against your changes for the most part, i'm just saying their not enough and the idiots out their blindly showing support for something they know nothing about are hurting every measure of this.if me being a loudmouth is what it takes for the system to get a fair look at, then so be it, i'll play that role well. i'm just not gonna be satisfied with the ""this might work"" approach.i do think you're completely wrong about 0.0 value though, and the devs have had a record of reducing empire value in the past per your previous arguement. so i don't think it's beyond reason to ask for more devaluation of empire and stagnant value in 0.0. coupled with that, the rewards of 0.0 need to be countered by 0 insurance or at the very least, basic insurance limitations. risk v reward, i risk more cost of ships and space, my reward is the fruits of 0.0."
1/1/2009,"i have absolutely no clue what you're saying or trying to say. though if pos were designed for small scale goals then that is a laugh. they will be offlined more and faster. this makes it easier for an enemy to attack because mostly do not care about you repping it up when they are not there but not using it when they are. what stopped station ping pong? yea, that was terrible.started ""big nap fests""? ah ha ha ha. it didn't start them or even propagate them.when has ccp reduced the value of empire?also it is a pretty unreasonable thing since its likely to lose them subscribers. you aren't saying that at all, you're going back and forth between saying work work as advertised and saying its not enough. you've no clue what you're talking about in either instance.edit: oh i forgot, you're the ""its the economy"" person. no wonder."
1/1/2009,"nobody would believe us if any one of us claimed otherwise, so we don't bother and poke fun at it. this subject is being discussed in considerable length on our own forum, even by those that simply posted ""because they were told to.""granted the posts are generally cynical because it all hinges upon ccp doing something, but that's the nature of the beast.anyway, i'm supporting the general idea of a 0.0 revamp, which is the rather open op calls for. and another another 0.0 round table, perhaps one held in game or irc with moderated discussion, until the next fanfest."

1/1/2009,"as for empire nerfs. agent movement, mission rat devaluation, and removal of ice belts and standard asteriod belts just to name a few of the big ones."
1/1/2009,a lot of that had to do with spreading people out though to relieve some congestion in a few systems (except they just moved the problem to other systems).
1/1/2009,"those were not nerfs. agent missions, ice and asteroids moved to relieve congestion, there was no loss of value. all that happened was the people spread out to cause less of a drag on the server.and if you consider lag as a cost that people have to pay when they partake in an activity[a reasonable conjecture], then those spreading out of resources would have actually increased and not decreased the value of empire space.as for the oveur quote: yes, moving guns outside of pos shields did indeed lower the barrier to entry to attacking a pos. but you made no mention of the rev 2 changes in your statement. you referred to pos in general."
1/1/2009,"agents have been consistently moved to lower sec areas as a risk v reward issue. it's been a gradual move over time, but most high quality agents have moved to low sec or border areas, and i'm willing to bet the remaining few will over the course of time find their way there as well. dev's have consistently stated that it is as much about traffic as it is a risk v reward thing.asteroid belts have been tweaked in several ways; only one of them was the removal from 1.0's to relieve traffic. same with ice mining. spawn timers, changes in rocks found in sec status areas, etc have all been tweaked in less profound natures over the course of time to withdraw wealth from high sec. mission rat devaluation was the biggest and most notable as it came with very harsh cries of ""i'm quitting"" when it happened. mission rats were devalued on a level of upwards of 70% of their original values which were on par with 0.0 rats or better. the loyalty point system was a setback to this even though it was designed as a feature, not a counter to that huge nerf. it has unfortunately re shifted more weight back towards the profitability of the remaining empire locations for agents as much as it has benefited all agents.another thing they've done with agents is a revamp of where their missions send you. there are quite a few missions out there that attempt to send you into lowsec regions. missioner's found a way around this by buiding up their status enough to allow refusal of most missions like this.the point is, developers are not against throwing the hammer at empire rather than increasing the value of 0.0 just because the balance isn't there yet for the average player. i mean really, what makes more sense from a logic standpoint, devaluing empire on current game mechanics because it's out of whack, or creating new game mechanics with new potential bugs and exploits so that 0.0 can be just that much better. i'd rather they spend less time fixing empire so that that extra time can be spent elsewhere."

1/1/2009,"added message ""as we are there, your lp and isk were given to two random characters across eve"". sure, constantly saving a ""damsel"" in distress is repetitive, but that is a common problem in missions. the point is that she is the mission target and you need to deliver her to complete the mission. that allow all the for of ""griefing"" that can be done with a mission target item and the chance of losing it to accidents, loss of ship and so on. making this mission a targetless mission will change it a lot and not in a positive way."
1/1/2009,"the idea is simple, funny and makes sense. removing the damsel is not a problem, since the info about the damsels location has to be delivered to the player as clearly shown by this image. just bring that thing back to the agent for further questioning and you have your mission item. you could easily even make an epic mission arc that involves you traveling through space trying to rescue the damsel by raiding pleasure hubs and drug labs. you quest would end with a final boss fight with bowser and you would get a kiss from the damsel and tons of coins as a reward."

1/1/2009,"just hashing this problem out with a corpie, and our thoughts turned to changing the bonuses, since the current ones just don't work - active tanking is too good in pve and too bad in pvp to be modified, and the damage bonus just makes it feel like a wannabe megathron. the alternative we considered is a bit outlandish, but what if you took off one of its current bonuses and gave it the kronos/paladin web strength bonus? 90% webs in these days of 60% max would make it actually feel like a blaster boat, and it'd give it something it was actually better at than a mega while justifying its five mids. this is f+i stuff, not assembly hall, but it's the answer that comes to mind. and yeah, i agree, something needs to change somewhere. i've got a hype kicking around, rigged and all, and it just feels like a waste of time even considering flying it. it's just inferior at everything.edit: after reading the posts from gou below, i'm pulling my thumb. it's not good at things i'd personally use mine for, but the numbers do work, and it's no worse than a score of other ships i'm fine with. i still think the web change is amusing, but it's not a serious proposal(and never really was)."
1/1/2009,"no, please. in my opinion the hyperion is the only gun based gallente bs usable for missions (i really hate the kronos, it has no real advantage on the hyper and ""feel"" bad when used in missions). changing the gun bonus to a web bonus would make it totally unsuitable for missions (rails at web range? ugh ) with little use in pvp too (unbonused blasters? probably at that point ac or pulse lasers would be better)."
1/1/2009,"like i said, it's a half-finished idea at best. also, i lean more to stripping the tank bonus for it, not the gun bonus - if we're going to have a blaster ship, it ought to blast well. that said, what's your mission fit? i haven't found one that feels any good. also, the kronos advantage is mostly in the fact that it's a hyperion that salvages as it flies, though the tracking bonus is nice too. if someone can come up with a decent role for the hyperion as it exists now, i'll let this drop, and probably go fit one up. i just don't know what it'd be."

1/1/2009,"currently synth boosters are worthless. if they were removed from the game tomorrow i dont know that anyone would even notice. essentially, it takes the same amount of work to make a quality booster as it does a synth, but the synth doesnt give nearly the same returns for obvious reasons. a 3% bonus for 30min is only something a fool would take seriously. at 1.1-1.5 million per unit i really can understand the point. though i can understand the price. i assume the existance of synths mean that ccp would like to see boosters in high sec to some degree. yet, 3% isnt really grabbing anyone's attention....at least not at 30min. after all you can hardwire from lp and do better. this is what i propose:1) change the effect entirely to either a 1-2 attribute bonus limited to 30min or increase the current from 3% to say 6-10%.2) an extenstion of the effect. im thinking 24-72hrs. this could be done by research on the part of the manufacuring corp or just attached to the biology skill when applied to synths and only synths. though i would perfer it be based on the corp and not the player. 3) increase the prodution runs possible in order to drive down the price.4) move synth production out of low sec. take away the risk of synths and, thereby, lower the price of synths.the point is there should be somekind of real advantage to synths or they shouldnt even be in the game. what you give up in product potenecy you should game somewhere else. you either have to make the product more useful or bring down the cost/risk of production. especially the latter since this is suppose to be a ""legal"" drug. if is so legal why can it only be made in low sec? not to mention the raw materials can be moved anywere...i believe. that forces high sec corps looking to get into the maket into low sec to produce and sell a legal product back in high sec. which doesnt make sense to me especially when were taking about a 3% bonus."

""out of whack"" is a relative term that can be fixed as easily by increasing the value of the other space which is not valuable enough.4. if you believe that 0.0 is dense enough in its individual production capability then you really must not have spent much time there. even if you don't want to increase the value of individual production you need to increase the production density because systems only supporting a handful of people is one of the larger causes of sprawl in eves 0.0."

1/2/2009,"black ops are highly specialised ships, and should remain so. however, they are currently too limited to be of practical use.given their very high cost, fragility, and limited practical application, i would like to propose the following changes:1) fuel bay, seperate from cargohold2) use of covert ops cloaking devices3) a slightly longer jump range (perhaps 1-2 light years more)4) enable use of covert cyno in cynojammed systemsgiven that these ships have very limited grid/cpu, and often require faction fittings to get a workable setup, it can cost more to lose one than a carrier or dread. they are exceptionally fragile and not being able to utlise a covert ops cloaking device means most stay in hangars collecting dust. that, combined with the chore of a very limited cargobay for fuel, means that black ops in their current form need a major buff. this will not make them overpowered, but will hopefully get people to start using them as more than a curious, and expensive, novelty item."
1/2/2009,"i do like that ccp introduced them pre-nerfed, but it's about time they got something extra.1) fuel bay not really needed anymore since you can bring a transport ship with you. still it's a viable argument though.2) many ships traveling with black ops (combat recons, stealth bombers, transports) can't use covert ops cloaks, and i would never want to make black ops a solo ship. however as 'advanced' as they are maybe it's worth giving it to them.3) it should never be longer than capital jump range. that just doesn't make sense. less or equal, but not greater.4) this is good. cynojammers are really only to prevent capitals, not all jump-based travel.they're main role should still remain sub-capital jump logistics and shouldn't really be awesome solo ships. their usefulness and survivability should still come from the gang that they support.i'll wait for more discussion to throw my support out there."
1/2/2009,"possibly change the covert ops cloak to a black ops cloak. 0% scan res 0% speed penalty only able to be fit on black ops. no warping cloaked and possibly the ability to bridge/jump cloaked? would also like to see a lil more hp like 5% (these things are technological epochs) then the t1 variants and possibly some increased resists. like the 2nd poster said the fuel bay is somewhat a moot point at the moment due to the transport change. i have never used my widow for jump bridging into anything other then a gank (i did not even get on the km due to the scan reso and forgetting my scan script><).. and then back out, so i can not comment on the cyno jammed systems (also as a transport for lute). i would like to see the bops possibly be able to pull anything smaller then a cruiser hull through the portal rather then just covert ops and recons. limited numbers (20 tops per ship). thoughts."
1/2/2009,"to address your concern about them becoming 'solo ships' if they had a covert cloak...this simply would not happen (unless the pilot was exceptionally wealthy and stupid).black ops bs are weak battleships, they have limited grid and cpu, and as a result limited dps/tank. that, combined with their prohibitive cost, makes them exceptionally poor solo ships. the lock time is also dreadful (20 seconds to lock a battleship if you fit a faction cloak).if you're going to solo, you would use a pilgrim or such, and find its much better for it. allowing them to use a covert cloak makes sense, given how fragile they are."
1/2/2009,ban em. to heck with the economy they cheated and thats that. it is after all a game it will survive.
1/2/2009,"bumptybump, they still haven't read it."
1/2/2009,you get my support on this one.
1/2/2009,can't take a hint?
1/2/2009,"if you train learning v, basic learning skills @ v and advanced learning skills to 4 it takes over a year for you to catch up to someone who didn't train any learning skills. you want even more advanced skills that means even more insane times to wait until you get actual payoff. if you actually knew how learning skills worked you would know this already.you suggestion is idiotic and you didn't put any thought into it. what you want is a trap to waste players training time. skills have a basic and advanced version, nothing really gets a third tier. you get cruiser to v and then each t2 cruiser goes to v. you get a gun/missile to v then the specialization to v. it doesn't continue forever and ever, it ends.skills that do not give you any benefit ingame are the worst, they make players quit the game and don't give people reason to log on and play. if you get mining barge v, you log on and can't wait to play again. if you get learning whatever to v, you switch the skill and go play something else.i troll stupid ideas, this is a stupid idea."
1/2/2009,this.just give everyone +10 to each attribute and take this godawful mechanic out altogether.need a button to actively disagree with this terrible post.
1/2/2009,jesus no!
1/2/2009,"i'm against the nano nerf.give webs and disruptors alternative bonuses, and all be ok."
1/2/2009,oh yes... lets add to the pile of petitions for mission running harassment...the same petitions you claim that are broken.... which is hypocritical in itself.
1/2/2009,"changing the repair bonus to a web bonus would again kill the hyper as a mission ship, but maybe could make it a better pvp ship. my fit it is a pve fit based around the ship repair capability. with gallente bs at 5 and marauders at 4 the hyper still has a edge there, increased by the larger number of rig slots and higher base armor hp.the kronos, with the lower base hp and limited difference in resistances has problems fitting a similar set up as it will have a lower hp buffer, so less time for the repper to do his work. so:5 350 mm rails, 3 425 mm; currently they are a mix of prototypes and dread guristas guns, i prefer the slightly longer range and less cap use against the gallente/serp version. the dread guristas are equivalent to caldari navy and cost less. 2 tracking computer ii, cap recharer ii, heavy cap booster f-rx, pwnt target painterlar ii, and, depending on mission, 2 or 3 hardeners and 3 or 2 mag field ii.rigs: auxiliary nano pump, nanobot accelerator. the one i gave aways as a gift had 2 auxiliary nano pumps and the nanobot but so far i haven't felt the need to add the third rig.the ship use a lot of cap, but a ammo load and a load of 800 boosters will keep up for a whole mission normally (barring ae, that will require to reload before the last room). the ship kill easily bc and up and decently cruisers, the drones kill from frigates to cruisers. the salvage on the fly thing: sure i have seen that using a golem and it is wonderful, done with the kronos it don't work so efficiently. hard to finger why, maybe because you are spending more attention managing the guns and ammunitions for the different ranges and keeping an eye on cap/repper cycles and so on, so checking tractor beams and salvager is more of a bother than in a golem. naturally for a lot of missions the domi is still the best gallente ship, but it is nice to have the alternative of using a gun ship. so, to cap it up, i prefer the hyper to stay how it is today."
1/2/2009,do not touch the hype's bonus. one of the few ships that gives active tanking a chance in this game in pvp vs static tank gheyness. if you go after the dmg bonus it becomes even worse.you have an extra midslot over the mega for a second web or eccm. no ship is going to be able to perform every role in eve to 100%. the hype is a fine pvp ship and even missioning.... leave it alone.
1/2/2009,"that's more or less what i was thinking. wow, your mission philosophy is totally different from mine. ewar, magstabs, injector-dependant, and 1 lar? yeah, i won't be adapting that any time soon - i fit 2 lar and natural cap stability on a kronos, never mind a hyperion. if it works for you, great, but it just looks weird to me. also, who cares about hp? there's not a battleship in the game that doesn't have enough hp buffer to do a mission tank and not care. keeping an eye on cycles? i think that's the different mission fits cropping up again - i turn on my tank when i jump into system and then spend the whole mission shooting and salvaging. works quite nicely imo. it's a fair position. i mostly threw my idea out for discussion - i didn't claim it was necessarily good. it'd make the ship better at pvp and worse at pve, which i figure might raise its overall utility, but clearly you disagree. that's fine, i can't exactly claim you're wrong. just curious about what people would think, plus i enjoy theorycrafting."
1/2/2009,"i cannot help but wonder how in the world this got produced... the hyperion is a pretty good ship and the only thing that could really work to make it better in a reasonable fashion would be for an entire shift in the tanking bonuses across all the races[amarr/caldari would go to ehp, gall/min would go to resists]1. the hyperion can easily active tank and fit a full rack of guns.8x ionmwd, injector, web, web, scramlar, 1600rt, eanm, eanm, dc, mfsrep amt, rep amt, rep cycle2/2/1+5 warriorsstd exile.1000 dps, 663 dps tanked, 86k ehp, 2 webs, 1250m/s overloaded. its more efficient than a megathrons passive tank until about 2400 incoming dps, an abaddon at about 1400 incoming dps. if you take one of the webs and make it best named, you can run 2 mfs(drop the plate) where your tank is better than the megathrons until about 1600-1700 incoming dps and you will actually do more raw dps(4 dps less in the hyp if you don't have spare lights and are assuming di 5] . your reps will overload for 3 and a half minutes and they should be running like that pretty much any time you're taking damage in excess of 550 raw uniform dps.if you're going for full on crazy tank, 2 lars is a massive tank and can fit with 8 electrons an mwd, and two heavy injectors. though i do not recommend this.2. there is nothing wrong with active tanking. in fact, with rigs, overheating, drugs, tier 3 bs(i.e. high base hp bs with bonuses to either) active tanking has increase in strength relative to passive tanking. the break points for where passive tanking are better have gotten higher since the hp boosts which contrary to popular belief were neutral with regards to the balance between ehp and active tanking.especially if you're seeing an increase in smaller ships due to the web nerf which will typically lower incoming dps, active tanks get much stronger compared to ehp tanksfor some of the math behind this and the actual break points see herelinknote, this is using a tier 1 bs in its comparisons which has a pre-disposition to plates due to a low base hit point values and the ship has no bonus to tanking.3. the extra med slot on the hyperion is crucial in differentiating it from the megathron, utility med slots are more important than ever now[not that it ever changed] and the ability to fit more webs, a sensor booster, or supplementary ewar cannot be understated. 4. you should be missioning in a dominix anyway, gallente do not need a mission battleship.you're just plain wrong, the hyperion is a pretty damned good blaster ship. ironically, if you take a standard plated hyperion vs plated megathron you end up with these numbersmega: 115,436 ehp, 1085 dps, 822 m/s. (4 ogres, 2 mfs, neutrons, 2 plates, eanm, anp(can't fit eanm due to cpu), dc) heavy injector(going to medium does not allow 2nd eanm)hyperion: 113,795 ehp, 1160 dps, 852m/s.(2/2/1, 2 mfs, neutrons, 2 plates, eanm, dc) medium injector keeps everything running for 3+ minutes. and if you're running your mwd that long you've got problems. hyperion gets an extra web/med slot with which to play around. the extra web will make its effective tracking better than the megathrons though it may have a relative disadvantage the mega would not depending on the target ship.if you run 5 ogres on the mega and 4 on the hyp your dps numbers are 1204 for the hyp and 1148 for the mega. megathron gains 1.4% ehp and the hyperion gains 6.9% dps(with full drones its 4.8%) . this makes the hyperion a strictly better passive dps boat than the megathron before you consider speed, utility meds, and overloading potential. even if you add a c-type anp to bring the megas ehp up to 120,060(+5.5% over the hyp) the hyperion is still more efficient though only slightly. all hail the tier 3 bs hp bonus.to reiterate. i'm sorry, you're wrong."
1/2/2009,"working as intended, etc./unsignedjust because you can't figure out a use for it doesn't mean it hasn't got one."
1/2/2009,"the problem is that api only works where your corp/alliance has the killing blow.if the api could be used to draw down all kills you are involved in, i'd agree entirely."
1/2/2009,"the api thingie have already solved this.it is the killboard admin own fault if he accept unverified killmails from unreliable sources. this goes 2 ways , do not give your api to an unreliable kb admin. if no one will trust you with their api , try to sync with the killboards that got the apis."
1/2/2009,i still fail to see the value of any kind of kill mail.it's almost as if it wasn't really the original intent of the game....it's nothing more than a ego trip.... if you where going to track kills... it should be simplified.but that's me.
1/2/2009,"because if you kill someone with the help of another group and a member of that group gets the finishing blow, they get the km. meaning they can edit you off it, meaning you can't prove your kill.personally the only change i'd like to see to killmails is for everyone on the km to get a copy, even though this would probably mean we have to wait till downtime for the km to arrive."
1/2/2009,i have never understood the obession with kill mails.
1/2/2009,"fyi this rumour is rife within eve, i have not started it, or would never have dreamed about saying such rumours myself ,i am voicing what many players within eve have heard. isnt this what this topic board is all about ?what i object to so strongly , is that the topic was blocked / censored so quickly, would this not in its self add suspicion and fuel to the flames of rumour?"
1/2/2009,"well, i did heard that rumours to be honest, bob always had new tec items from no where apparently, i do believe there is some people provide them, your last topic been closed, so i asked myself, what is the point of worry about a little topic, why should ccp administration close it in such panic?"
1/2/2009,"you weren't censored, the topic was closed. censoring you would be removing your posting priveleges for putting up an idiotic topic in an inappropriate place. since you were able to post a second idiotic topic in an inappropriate place, you haven't been censored."
1/2/2009,"with foresight, yes this topic would be idiotic, but i am just voicing what is circulating within eve, if the moderators wish to remove these topics, then so be it , shoot the messenger comes to mind !"
1/2/2009,"not an idiotic topic at all, but i don't see anybody else who have heard that rumour..if it is true, then it makes unfair game with the advantage for band of brothers of course.."
1/2/2009,the mod answered your question.
1/2/2009,"the only basis for fact in this is that a couple years ago bob got a few t2 bpos illegitimately, which were later taken away. other than that, there's no truth in it. the stats on what devs play in what corps are not public, but the claim at the time was that there were more goon devs than bob devs. the cheating was one idiot, not any kind of sinister conspiracy. let it die."
1/2/2009,"what makes this an idiotic topic? given current events, and historic events, coupled with monotonous rumors shared on teamspeak/ventrilo/skype/etal., this is definately not an idiotic topic. granted it is not the most comfortable to ccp, but what the heck, they can pretend it isn't like they do with so very much else."

1/2/2009,"what question was answred?there wasnt any question obviouzly..in 2005 bob did get some new tec 2 modules for a battle ship which were not released yet, of course i do believe there is administration workers who supplie illegaly masive corps or alliences with future modifications.i am sure in ccp there is not only bob which got their worker there, but others large corporations or alliences"
1/2/2009,this is a quality thread right here
1/2/2009,"to be honest, i missed the early days of eve, but i'm pretty sure that they were awesome, since noone would play today if they weren't. unfortunately it is true, that small scale pvp does not have any strategic purpose nowadays, still it can be a lot of fun, but the current soveregnity mechanics encourage players to create bigger powerblocks and more epic battles and of course even more lag. i'm not saying that jump portals, cynos, capitals should be removed, since they've been part of this game quite some time now, but their purpose could change.i have a vision if we would define jump portals, as corporation/alliance owned/built stargates, that would be much more interesting. everybody could seen them on the everview, camp them, they would work the same as stargates except their usage be standing based as jump bridge's are. and of course capitals couldn't use them, for example to drop 4 titans defending a cynojammed system againts a fleet of subcapitals."
1/2/2009,this has already been pushed through during the first csm. ccp said they didn't see anything wrong with the design but would look at them more in depth during an upcoming capital review.
1/2/2009,"i'd like to see plexes turn into more precious elements to capture.essentially, many plexes are spawned in order to spread out forces so that we don't get the super-blobs in 1 place. i totally agree with this.however, if you make plexes challenging and more valuable to take, there will be fleet commanders who will take up the challenge to capture them.the philosophy behind plexes shouldn't be, ""well, if we just make it easy so it's easy for people to take so they get involved more easily, and we'll just play to the lowest common denominator, and expect pilots to be lazy"". if that is the reason, then you're diluting your responsibility as game designers to make enjoyable, challenging games. if you make it, they shall come. make the plexes challenging and people will take up the challenge.so, it's supposed to be a challenging involved and fun part of the game. it has been said many times faction warfare is for new players to get used to low sec so that they can go out into 0.0 less afraid. so ccp doesn't want people to get trapped into faction warfare... except there are people who truly just want to enjoy faction warfare, it's what they want to do in eve. some of these people may never want to go out into 0.0 for alliance sovereignty battles. so there is an obligation to make it interesting and involved for those who want to stay, who will train the new players who will become comfortable to go out into 0.0, and so on."
1/2/2009,"can anyone enlighten me and other players within eve , wether or not this urban legend is true or false; many rumours circulate that bob have modules and a certain advanced titan, and various skill books that yet have not been released; if true , this points to the fact that high level bob members are actually ccp employees , if true, this gives a serious exploit of the game and unfair advantage to bob corp.comments, input , and banter welcome ."
1/2/2009,"let me quash this rumor now - the answer is no.bob do not have advanced titans or unique skill books given by ccp devs. if you have evidence to the contrary, please alert internal affairs at internalaffairs@ccpgames.comthank you."
1/2/2009,maybe if he know that about 3 day in advance. so stop whining on a false premise.

1/2/2009,i'm pretty sure they use some sort of fuel...

1/3/2009,"and how often do they play, what is the barrier to entry, and secondary costs of their operation?how dense is the production?because, iirc, exploration where we are is not nearly that productive(and its boring, mind numbing, requires large swaths of time concurrent and is very sparse in the amount of people it allows partake) are there gas pockets out there?yes, there is a value to risk in this game. unfortunately that value is for the most part very negative. you've shown yourself to have a good misunderstanding of ""value"" in the past(see: its the economy linked in yaay's post above. yaay == luckyduck) complaining that inflation was occurring when it was simply an increase in wealth. why are we to trust you now without evidence?"
1/3/2009,"changes are usefull by definition, since people have to adapt, learn, and face new challenges./signed"
1/3/2009,"actually, enjoi posted later exactly the same thing i said. incase you don't remember, he said that the deflation in the game was actually masking inflationary pressure and the roles should reverse in time.we've also come to learn recently that a big pos scam was contributing heavily to faulty t2 market prices which in turn aided deflation in the game. without that scam, more of an inflationary move would have been seen. as a result, the markets are now slowly catching up and within the next 6 months, we'll likely see some heavy inflation in t2 markets that are more of a marker than the panic adjustment that's already occured.those markers will still be negatively affected by unreasonable environmental factors like the faulty insurance system.so if what you mean was, i was right there i must be right here, i'll take it. thanks for playing, next!"
1/3/2009,"so what you're saying is that you don't know what you're talking about and aren't going to back up the 7b/day claim.got it. note: the pos scam is not deflationary. deflation and inflation are purely monetary phenomena. the pos scam was a supply shift for a single good, not inflation or deflation. similarly t2 price level increases which would have been ""caused"" by it would have been a function of increased demand for a single good and not inflation or deflation. whether or not there was going to be inflation would have been entirely determined but whether or not the money supply and velocity were increasing or decreasing, not whether or not supply of a specific t2 good that doesn't increase t2 prices all that much hit a fairly inelastic section of the curve.inflation is when the money supply gets higher without the amount of stuff being traded getting higher."
1/3/2009,"oh this is good. ok let me make some guesses since you for some reason don't want to tell us this invaluable piece of information that would actually make your argument not look weak as **** and if it really wasn't **** you'd spurt it out since you're ****ing yaay for ****s sake and you cant shut up about anything since you're borderline ******ed. unless it's an argument made entirely out of ****, and you'll be laughed out of the forum when you actually present it in its full form instead of hey guys this guy i know told me he made hella isk, why u not making isk? perhaps u nub?!?i mean it's not like you're related to this isk scheme since you're hella rich from being the big mercenary fc and ****. how did that go anyway? i heard the last alliances that hired you promptly disbanded. maybe you're just some secret alliance hitman? no wait, you're too ****ing incompetent to do something useful unless its a sheer ****ing accident.but i digress, my guesses: you're not doing anything with farming missions or the cosmos, since those are obviously unique to npc fountain so it doesn't apply anywhere else. you're not doing mining, since there wouldn't be a 30m a month cost for just running some macro hulks. you're not doing ratting since the one system you have isn't big enough to keep 20 ratters. and if you've managed to get 20 guys to click 'scan' every 180 secs for any period of time long enough to be worth making an argument over, then yeah, you're totally better than me.so, with that out of the way, what is it you're doing in fountain that makes 7bn a day? and if all of bob is making 7bn a day, not even counting the moon mining or taxes, why aren't you all in titans? why aren't you even able to pos spam a single backwater goonswarm system?and most importantly, why are half the ****ing people in motsu bob or gbc if 0.0 is so profitable? as my homie sun tzu said: to ask that question is to answer it"
1/3/2009,"acutally, while it's obvious that yaay doesn't know what the **** he's talking about, inflation is generally used to simply describe a rise in prices*, unless speaking specifically about monetary policy or some gay ****. of course, the only prices that have risen enough to be worth talking about in jita are some raw material prices, but others have gone down, so overall the prices are, statistically, mostly the same.*actually, it's more commonly used to distinguish ******ed ***gots posting on the internet about some **** they dont even understand, but used to try and add sophistication so they wont be called out on their ******ed ****."
1/3/2009,"actually, you got me really interested here. what exactly can be so profitable, yet boring enough to be called 'work', that it's worth doing? i mean, 7bn in timecards, that's not ****ing much unless you work at burger king or something. then again, you guys keep saying the 10 usd for sa.com access is such an extortionate sum, so perhaps you really are that poor? interesting nonetheless!"
1/3/2009,"a general rise in prices. not a rise in specific prices. this is why inflation measuring techniques use a basket of goods and not a single good, because the pricing of single goods are more subject to supply and demand disruptions which would otherwise throw that off.edit: i should note that yaay claimed that inflation was happening without the price increase and now is claiming that a single instance of a price that rose due to a supply disruption means that he was right about inflation."
1/3/2009,"actually, it was 20 guys, ratting, mining, plexing and low end moon mining and reactions. as for the entity, it really doesn't matter who it was.hell, i've spent 1 day ratting solo and made 450 mil... 150 off bounties, 150 off loot, 150 off rigs approximately. and that was't even a full day nor did it include 1 rare spawn.... at the end of that day, i made an additional 70 mil off a hauler spawn."
1/3/2009,"when t2 ships become more expensive, they'll effect the rest of the economy b/c other ships will become more viable. heavier use of other ships means more increases in prices. inflation is the devaluation of money. there are about 20 different definitions on what inflation is, it's very hard to say exactly and most economist will tell you just that. ultimately, the markers of inflation are more money leading to higher prices. what that means is that my money is devalued and i'm more willing to spend extra on goods since the cash means less to me.deflation is the increase in value of money. in the us right now there's a big concern that deflation is about to hit heavily because everyone is so concerned about spending cash. ie this dollar's more precious to me today because i might need it tomorrow.you are taking half of my equation and saying the answer doesn't make sense. enjoi stated the whole equation just as i did and both of us were right, and contradictive to you. both of us said inflationary pressure being overshadowed. either way, if you want to argue this, take it to the other thread or convo me one day in private."
1/3/2009,"i like what i saw on the first page.. and i am sure if anything useful had been posted in the later 13 they would have been added :pi prefer industrial pos stay on moons and sov pos get moved to planets.. only difference being that pos anchored to planets can add to sovereignty and industrial pos on moons can not. leave they way pos are fueled, fitted, manned, and gunned alone.as for planetary resources.. i do think having lightly protected defenses and destructible objects be anchored on them in areas around the planet is a good step. its a new income stream and isk sink at the same time.they make good goals for roaming gangs. but.. their should be some effort required to destroy these items tho. something that a well fitted and select hac gang of 10+ can do with some level difficulty. but... imposable to do with anything smaller then this. their should be some logistics required in taking these assets.. like blockade runners needing to follow the gang to carry the loot.my fear is.. if its made too easy then small gangs could rip billions off alliances while they sleep. doing it in small hard to catch gangs. other ideas..yields should not be hourly but maybe daily. these new anchored structures should be player build-able. making it easier to replace once destroyed. new planetary silos should not be restricted to the warp in.. possibly set a range limit on them. they should also be scan-able. this would require some searching for planetary silos by not making it a very easy warp to 0 search of planets.things the planet could offer... well i hate fling to empire to get ai offered parts to use.. so how about planets yielding ai offered pos parts.enriched uranium / oxygen / mechanical parts / coolant / roboticsalso having a manufacturing force living on the planet that could build things only ai offer depending how you setup the planet..starbase structures / random ai items / probeswhy not small yields of moon materials since they would also be available on planets. the mining technique being less invasive on the planet would thus be slower with lower yield.these are all good fixes. as for making 0.0 more profitable my hopes are pinned on artifacts, unstable wormholes, and tech 3"
1/3/2009,a good way to revamp the nullsec/lowsec is by introducing some kind of new materials that can only harvest/process in null/lowsec before transporting them to somewhere else. this way it will help the inhabitants of null/lowsecc and promote people moving to the area.

1/3/2009,"i flew a panther for a while but wasn't too impressed with it in it's current form. the cargo bay is definitely too small, and they're just too expensive for their capabilities.1) adding the fuel bay is a great idea. everyone that goes through a covert portal uses your fuel, and often there just isn't enough to go around. having to refuel from a blockade runner just isn't the same as having a decent fuel capacity.2) i've put some thought into letting the blackops use the covert ops cloak. i don't think this is overpowered, as they cannot stand up to a conventional battleship and yes it's crazy to try soloing with one. expensive ship to lose that being said, the force recons aren't really major combat ships, and covert ops frigates have practically no combat ability. the idea behind the covert ops cloak is to have the ship scout ahead of a main fleet, and cyno through the blackops. if blackops had the warp-while-cloaked ability, it really would change this dynamic. a more through investigation of this change is warrented. if it is allowed, it should be harder to fit the ship with things like weapons and such. 3) they really do need a longer jump range. probably not too far, maybe another lightyear or 2.4) using covert cyno's in cynojammed systems seems logical, but i haven't done enough 0.0 operations to comment further on that. bottom line: they need more ability to justify that price tag."
1/3/2009,"this isn't enough, you're turning them from the worlds worst taxi's to a very limited taxi.they need something that will make people want to buy them other than wanting someone to move a few ships for them (something a carrier does better, for a similar price while still having huge offensive and logistic benefits and way better insurance). i say give them cov ops cloaks and a base speed increase while cloaked then make their second bonus a range bonus making them easily engage to 200km+."
1/3/2009,"i would think that having to bring a hauler with you is a smart game mechanic that is more fun than just adding a fuel bay. makes you bring more people with you. yeah adding the covops cloak would change it's role completely. if you do this, you really have to take the full step and make it's primary goal covert jump logistics. it won't break the ship, but it will definitely change the ship. no big problem with either of these (changed my mind on the jump range).slightly off topic, but adding more gang-sized objectives by decoupling industry pos and the sovereignty system would create a larger niche for this ship class. maybe the ship doesn't need a boost, but rather a boost to the scenarios the ship was designed for, which at the moment are nearly non-existent."
1/3/2009,/me thumbs upblack ops not having covert-ops dosne't make sense.the whole point of black op's is to be heard but not seen is it not?hell... even if you removed the speed bonus... still would be a sweet niche to have.

1/3/2009,"learning skills are a novelty in themselves. people attempt to use them as a means to a end but they fail to recognize that perhaps, to some, the learning skills are a end. myself, for example. i have trained all my learning skills to level 5 and several of the science skills to level 5 not because i am using them to fly a titan but because itt is part of my character. i am a academic by trade in real life and learning is the crux of my eve online character. i would gobble up any science or learning skills that would help me become a better ""academic"". but aside from role playing 'it is not as if anyone is making you train the learning skills'. the current situation of learning skills, as put by some of the more 'advanced' (or 'older') players is that there is a tradeoff when deciding to train learning skills or other nonlearning skills. if ccp were to implement the new learning skills, then how would the situation change from where it currently is? most people would still not learn to level 5. yet, the option is there. while i am, in general, not a fan of the skill system, i see no impediment in offering higher rank learning skills to those that want to train them.

1/3/2009,eve needs game type specific recruitment channels. currently.. with over 6oo members actively looking to recruit or join corps very little can be easily read in the channel. adding channels would for one help as a filter and second would reduce the total channel count by a factor. with the number in channel reduced the amount of spams would be lower and would be easier to read.types of channels may be..industrial / pve / pvp / empire / outlawwe should keep the original channel and only add three to five specific channels. looking for other possibly channel names. new all-around corps could continue to recruit in the recruitment channel to appeal to players of all game types. maybe changing the current recruitment channel to general.

1/3/2009,"so, let me get this straight, a plate hyperion is better than a plate mega? i would hope we're going to compare a tier 3 bs to other tier 3 bs's else i just say that the abaddon is good since it can melt an apoc in a ****ing contest unless it's at range...so we have a 5% bonus to hybrid damage to make up for not being able to fit a full rack of guns the ship should have been designed for? these aren't rails. these are blasters, and the ship doesn't have enough grid to really use either.for gang shyt, the mega outperforms by miles. in falloff, a mega can hit things that are just mind-blowing. this quickly becomes a ""the hyperion has an extra midslot to make up for not having a hardwired tracking comp"" argument. i'm not going to pay 30m extra for a bs that requires me to use up the extra slot i gained to make up for the lack of utility of it's tier 2 counterpart.i don't recommend it either. those breakpoints are nothing when five or six bs's are involved. hyp quickly becomes useless except as a solo ship, where it's inability to catch anything meaningful becomes more the fatal flaw.if those bs's are using rr's, they either have another bonus that is helping them or get a bonus to the effects of incoming rr. hype in an rr gang is some kind of sick joke where you don't do anything better as compensation for your useless self-directed repper bonus.my argument is very, very simple: making the hype use one of its bonuses in a way meaningful relative to other bs's requires it to gimp its ability to utilize its other bonus. it's almost as bright as the the typhoon layout, except the phoon gets lots of niches in damage/neut roles.you can fit rails, but no active tank under any circumstances. you can fit a full rack of neutrons, but only by giving up tank/speed. you can tank maybe better than a passive drake for a time, but only by giving up almost all your damage.hyperion does not have the tools it needs to actually make itself noteworthy for anything, and certainly not the things its bonused for."
1/3/2009,"wait, you're saying that tier matters when discussing role?it does not. what matters is whats the best. and the hyperion is better. its even better when repping, but that does not mean that it cannot perform as a plated gank ship.i have no clue what in the world you're trying to get across. you can fit a full rack of guns the ship was designed for. you cannot fit a full rack of neutrons and a rep, so what? you can fit a full rack of neutrons and plates. you can fit a full rack of ions and a rep and a plate and a heavy injector.yes, its not surprising that the gang ships are better when you have a good sized gang. amazing that. that does not mean there is something wrong with the ship. it means that the ship does not do what you want it to. but it still has a perfectly viable and useful role.if you want to fly in gangs, train railguns.fly a dominix. its the best rr ship in the game.last time i checked, 663 uniform dps tanked, 86k uniform ehp, and 950 dps was not ""giving up almost all of your damage and tanking only as well as a passive drake""for gang stuff yes, but only with rails. the extra med slot fit with anything else is much more useful than the tracking bonus which is really not all that great as ranges increase. eccm? sensor booster? tracking disruptor?also, the hyp does not cost 30m more.and my argument is even more simple and backed up by mounds of data:it does use its bonuses in a meaningful way."

1/3/2009,"unfortunately, it's the primary method alliances use to audit their members to ensure they are participating in necessary ops.i would love to see killmails include not only the victim and those who inflicted direct damage on him, but also:anybody who performed logistics help (i.e., remote repping) on both damage dealers and victimanybody who used ecm, webifiers, and warp disruptors on the victimanybody who used any other kind of targeted beneficial action on both damage dealers and victimanybody who used any kind of non-targeted beneficial action (i.e., gang bonuses) on both damage dealers and victimthis way, the alliance leadership gets a better idea of who was helping out on the kill without everyone having to scramble to attempt to fire at the victim before it pops. especially those who are fit specifically for logistics or electronic warfare, it's very difficult to get on a killmail, despite having helped.back to the op: i somewhat agree with the poster who mentioned the api helping out a lot with the problem of unverified killmails. however, i would also like a way for others (perhaps even just ceos and alliance leadership) to verify the kill mail via a link, in-game our out-of-game.related to that issue, perhaps ceos/alliance leadership could have an option to ""view kill and loss mails"" in the context menu when right-clicking on their members."

1/3/2009,any form of aggression gets you on a kill mail.. only thing is.. remote repair modules don't cause aggression. you will never know if your target was remote reped.it would be nice that players and corps could receive mails on kills they were involved with.. as for accuracy... easiest thing you could do is require ceos or directors give api keys.. this way all mails for each corp are properly posted. this removes manual entries from the process all together. no manual entries no forging mails.. no hiding mails as well.most alliances don't do this tho.. it ends up making the kill board a intel board for hostile alliances.
1/3/2009,"introductioncurrent wardeccing methods are one-sided, as the agressor basically pays off concord to look the other way for a week. several fixes were suggested, but i believe only one way will make highsec wardeccing balanced. basic proposali suggest the corporation/alliance being decced being able to stay the war by meeting the same isk required to start the war, if the payment is done within the first 24 hours of the wardec, no hostilities may be started between the two sides. otherwise there will be the usual 24 hour cooldown.examplealliance a pays 100 mil to start the war with alliance b, alliance b now can pay the 100 mil to stop the war at anytime.sidenotesthis will be another way for players to interact with each other by fighting with their isk and not their ships. a determined attacker can still attack but no longer gets a cheap war against a defender that's willing to pay the cash.ofcourse there could be other variants of this which might work better, such as a bidding war, where the deccing corp can respond by paying additional cash to concord, and the defending corp can again bid. could make an interesting isk sink."
1/3/2009,"so, all you'd need to be completely safe in empire is gtcs?"

1/3/2009,"ummm no..such a change would not really change anything, newer corps composed of new players would not be able to buy their way out of a war and thus would still be targeted.big power block alliances however would have enough resources to buy their way out.throwing isk at a problem is never a good game mechanic as it favors gtc sellers and wealthy players. terrible idea, not supported"

1/4/2009,against itwhy? because war deccing carebears is super carebearish!we have more regions in this game where you can fight everyone even without a war dec and a sec hit than we have empire regions. so don't be such carebears and move your butts to the real action.
1/4/2009,noobz r not our targetz of choice. there are other targetz in hi sec than noobz. anyways thanks for the bump!!!!

1/4/2009,sounds like a reasonable first step to getting non-laggy fw working.i presume that ccp's present send us an email notification of fleet wars system is going to be made dynamic for allocation of servers. in fact giving systems with large fleets in them a server automatically would seem reasonable to me.
1/4/2009,"why not offer text-mode eve then? there's no point in going into a fight if you can't see anything, who is giving you how much damage (i generally prefer simple damage notifications).. who's drones are on you.. what are your drones attacking (drone ai, sigh)..i support this cause."
1/4/2009,"i would like to see the time required for learning skills cut significantly. if it really was a mistake and too late to remove them, the least ccp could do is greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to raise those learning skills. all other skills are fine as is."
1/4/2009,"currently you take a mission. you decline it because it's a stupid mission(mining misappropriation). you then get the next mission, enemies abound, which you dont do. you just go mission focked. if you decline that mission... you take faction hit, corp hit, and agent hit.only option is to move to the next agent. how far away is that next agent is really important.dodixie... 2 agents in the same system. motsu... recently got messed up but is 3 jumps from most.how about we fix that... make it so u dont need to be in dodixie or motsu for missions to be done consistently.first an agent can offer you say 10 missions. these show up in your journal. you do the missions you want in that batch. you still can only decline 1 every 4 hours. so instead of declining 1 and getting stuck on the next bad one. you can decline 1, do a few, even if there's another bad one there; it doesnt get you stuck.the 10 missions dont allow you to cherry pick because it's the same 10 missions that you get anyway. you still decline 1 every 4 hours. so either you get stuck in the long run or do the missions slowly.1. casual players dont get to cherry pick neither. they have to go through the same 10 missions regardless. 2. you only get new missions once all 10 are done.3. the # 10 isnt a real # lol... it can be 5 or whatever.what this fixes is the need to move agents and getting stuck.it also fixes the bug and necessity of making petitions over declining a mission and getting the same mission.you can get 3/10 of the missions being enemies abound. decline one... and the next isnt stopping you.thusly this ends the necessity of bother gms with petitions."

1/4/2009,"balance around is not equal to benefit. with this idea you try to introduce something damaging for large organizations, but you forget that the effect will be even worse for small organizations.i.e. your meter for balancing is what it will do to bob, goonswarm and so on, but you forget to consider what it will do to a 20-30 man corporation without an alliance."
1/4/2009,"ok, let's consider what will happen to 20-30 man corporations with no alliance.they will get steamrolled. same as they do now. do you see any 20-30 man corporation with no alliance on the sov map on tranquility? no, you don't. they don't exist. they put up a pos and the big bad alliance drops 30+ dreads on it and one cycles it. i'll tell you this, a 20-30 man corp has a much better chance vs a 200 man alliance then they do vs a 2,000 man alliance or a 20,000 man coalition.as for wah wah my poor high sec pos, you get at least 24 hrs warning in the form of a war dec. poss are meant as alliance assets, if you 20 man corp can only manage one guy to log on for 2 hours a week, then poss are not meant for you, so sorry. high sec pos alone should never be in the game in my opinion so arguing for them is a moot point really. a faction large pos in high sec is virtually invulnerable and nothing in eve should be invulnerable.as for the original ideas they are good, nerfing cynojammers and jump bridges in the same system is a sound plan that i believe we will see in the next pos update."
1/4/2009,"i'm going to go with supporting this discussion, but not the proposed changes because i think the problem with pos warfare is the same as it's always been, it has too many effects on too many aspects of the game. from a caldari industrial pos standpoint to the minnie deathstars...i would be very interested in a redesign that would allow small alliances the capability to make grabs for territory (ie: the large powerblocs, consolidating themselves due to defensive needs or etc) right now there are many organizations within eve, new and veteran alike that strive toward the 0.0 endgame, but tbqh what can a small to medium alliance due with a handful of caps and a decent support fleet when placing the first tower gets a 4 titan 23/7 lockdown.i agree that the large powerblocs should be able to competently defend their space based on participation from their memberbase. but at the same time, small and medium sized alliances have to have headroom. people can say ""go to lowsec"" but to be honest lowsec has been worthless and impossible to secure since warp to zero was introduced.lowsec industry is not really viable, minerals aren't much better than highsec, risk is much higher, the lack of bubbles, dictors, and hics prevents any kind of regular industrial back bone. while the rules around gcc, aggression, timers and sec status force security/pvp pilots from being able to secure the system.now as a counter point yes it is possible, with scouts, good fleet coordination, intel channels, and other assets to complete a successful mining op in lowsec. the difference in nullsec, the ""lawless"" space of eve. is that it is much easier to shut down a system for a major profit, while lowsec is more difficult to complete a successful op while being worth only marginally more than the same op in a highsec constellation (without security/pvp pilots) and also if in highsec and you had the same participation levels you could have the pvp/security pilots hauling or running lvl 4 missions increase total operation profit.obviously there are ways to pull off lowsec ops, and lowsec life. however not long ago, lowsec was the breeding ground for alliances to build themselves up and prepare for npc 0.0 and later to make a grab for claimable 0.0pos warfare, lowsec's lack of profitability and daily operation, warp to zero, the rise of the multi titan powerblocs, and increasing profitability of highsec, have turned small alliances into ""empire alliance"" and ""renter alliance""an increase to the vulnerability of poses, and sovereignty defence, would hopefully pull the powerblocs in closer to themselves, allowing for more groups to populate 0.0 in between them and hold their own. but with the current mechanics in place it's either rent or empire for most non affiliated alliances.some people may see this as a whine post it's not, i'm just pointing out things i've noticed when i hear some 2 week old character pipe up in alliance chat asking ""why don't we go carve out our own 0.0"" or something to that effect. and in response with the present state of things, there's no point, there's no endgame in watching your medium fleet attempt to defend your 1 system worth of towers while being titan blobbed and outnumbered 3-1 in local.also as a disclaimer, this has not happened to my alliance i'm not whining about some big alliance ruining my day. over the years i've been in a lot of different alliances and fought with many different accounts in some of the major wars eve has seen. the instant reaction to a small unrecognizable name in nullsec is blob, blob, blob some more, and then they'll go away.should small alliances be able to attack the heart of delve and pull it off? no of course not, but a small active alliance of say 100 pilots (not characters) should be able to hold a system or small sub constellation without the 75 dread pos bashing fleet and 5-6 titan blob coming piling through at any moment.grammar editjust my thoughts, fly safe all.--mcfly-"
1/4/2009,"i can overheat almost every other active mod i have... it would be amazing if i could overheat a damage control. especially for those that love those close fights that end with someone dead and someone at like 10% structure this could make or break in pvp.i dont think it would be tooo overbalanced, its not a racial mod. those least likely to use it are shield tankers, and even then a majority of them still use it.as far as what the overheated stats would be... that can still be up for debate, but this is just a forum to bring an idea to ccp, and let them work from there. really, anything but lesser cap usage would be win ;-p"
1/4/2009,supporting my own topic
1/4/2009,"after ccp atropos' trolling in this thread, i've decided to post here and hopefully bring a long-standing problem with the game to light.the problem is this:if you dc, any drones you have out are dead, as npcs will happily shoot them in your absence. if it's in pvp this isn't much of an issue, as there are more serious problems, but in pve this can become a huge isk sink, especially to those with less then spectacular internet connections.the simplest fix i can think of is make it so that drones cannot take rat aggro if the owned is offline, so that pilots can at least go and pick up their drones, rather then having to buy a whole new set.it would be a change that hurts no one, and benefits everyone, as everyone dcs now and then and every ship bigger then a cruiser fields a set of drones."
1/4/2009,"i'd support a disconnect automatically issuing a ""return to bay"" command, so that if they get back before you align and warp, they're okay. i'd also like to see a solution to the problem of coming back in 50 km from your drones - either the ability to re-assume control, or a system where they at least fly back to any beacons around if you failed to pick them up. i just hate watching them die once i'm back in the mission zone because i have to slow-boat my way to scooping range. it's not a huge issue - i've lost my share of drones, but i don't mind too much. that said, these are easy fixes, and they seem reasonable.edit: one thing i forgot to say - why are you referring to atropos' posts as ""trolling""? that generally implies bad faith, which doesn't seem to be in evidence here."
1/4/2009,"i'd also like to support this.or at least the timer idea, for 30 minutes, if you log back in, your drones return to your control with no scooping needed.. coupled with the fact that the scooping process is bugged (sometimes, drones don't get your skills applied to them if you scoop them from space), i think this is a really needed change."
1/4/2009,full support.
1/4/2009,"this is how it would work : - as you make a ship active, you are given a randomly generated licence (like - cmv89xu for instance) and thereby registered and added to a database with your name attached to shiptype - this licence is how your ship would be visible on scanner - shiptype and licence instead of current shiptype and shipname.agents could be persuaded for a reasonable sum to give up the name of the pilot when provided with a licence, if you have the nessecery standings and the agent in question is in the same region as your target query.custom shipnames can still be used, however they would not be for public viewing.to prevent exploits - licence to a ship would only be given once per pilot upon ship activation, that is - you do not get a different licence every time you activate. *will add more later."

1/4/2009,i dont get this idea one bit now that you editted it in. what does it even change?
1/4/2009,what??why??
1/4/2009,"clarification : if you have ever used a scanner you would notice shiptypes in range / direction and their names - these would be replaced with a static licence plate, the result of this change would effectivly remove the choice for individual pilots to remain identified / anonymous while visible on long range scanners."
1/4/2009,have you considered the effects on the database?and what would happen if you repackage a ship?
1/4/2009,"if you repackage a previously activated / registered ship your licence would then be suspended - still attached but not active the same way as with the ship - activation of said ship on another client would then re-register it with a new licence.database will ofcourse need to reserve some of its resources to this, shouldnt be alot."
1/4/2009,personal attack removed. navigator
1/4/2009,"are you aware of how many changes that need to be done to support this?when items get repackaged, they lose all their (unique) instance attributes, and that's how they become stackable (that's why you can't repackage a damaged mod/ship/drone for example), stackable items inherit their attributes from base classes in the database, so that simply means that the current db architecture is not adequate to handle such a task.i could elaborate further on this concept, but it would take pages to describe it properly.conclusion: impossible to do it that way.even disregarding the above, another issue would arise, unique id generation, let's say i assemble my ship, the server has to make it a brand new license id, programatically, this is done by picking a random id, checking it versus a list of all ids already present on the server, if a match is found, generate a new id and repeat the process until a valid id is generated.a valid alternative would be prefetching.. a separate computer generates a huge list of valid unique ids (very lengthy process), then they are integrated into the current database (during downtime, etc), in a new table that includes two fields (or maybe three/four), one would be the id itself, the other one is a boolean field that determines if it is already taken, and the optional third (not too optional if the agents idea is implemented) would be a reference to the character using that ship in the character table, and then another field would be needed to reference the ship itself or to hold a reference to it's classname.in the case of running out of valid id, the server has to revert to the first method of picking ids (just the image of players assembling their new ships at jita all day and night long scares the crap out of any db designer, nonetheless with this mechanism introduced in place)in both cases, the ship records will also get a new property, id#. (let's count how many ships roam eve every day)next case, ships blows up, ship is repackaged and sold, ship is transferred through contract/trade/etc to another character, the server has to amend all of those records with a new id and delete the old one, or if optimizations are in place, at least alter the records on the fly to change them to their new values... how many ships blow up per hour in the eve universe, and how many new ships get assembled every minute?good luck with your suggestions, although due to technical limitations and all the db overhead i mentioned above, i don't think it's likely to be implemented any time soon."
1/4/2009,"this is a valid point, however - it does not have to be a database nightmare - licences could be registered in a continuous nummerical translation - that is : player activates ship - licence number 124566 is assigned - translated into a set of numbers and letters representing total count of activated ships - so you always get the last number and therefore the database would never need to recheck with existing licences.tracking individual player activated ships is already taking place, so im assuming it would not be a difficult task to translate existing protocols into a system that lets players identify for instance a wartarget on scanner.in addition - locator agents are currently only providing location of a named character - it shouldnt be alot of hassle to add ship designation to that system as well."
1/4/2009,"the problem is, with your mechanism, ids are not reusable, ids that were used then discarded are not going to be ever used again (unless the server does a full iteration of all entries and re-indexes them), and that brings us to a condition where what you describe here will inevitably cause an overflow.regardless, it is all a problem to the person who integrates this into the current system, there are always workarounds, what i was merely explaining, is how this affects the current system, and what consequences it has, if ever implemented, from a technical point of view.and from a technical view, the effort greatly exceeds the expected gains from this, cpu cycles and db space could be put to many a better use.edit: actually, a more straightforward solution to the matter at hand would be removing the ship name from the scan window altogether.a smart player would change it to something like ""cargo container"" anyways"

1/4/2009,by empire implants i mean the learning implants. the +1s to +5s.1. 0.0 has the disadvantage to high sec that carebears will be able to train faster because they dont get podded.2. allow pirate implants to continue existing.removing these learning implants means being in 0.0 doesnt mean the carebears are training faster and eventually will have more sp then you do just because they are safe in high sec. also by leaving pirate implants ingame... it creates a giant demand for them. which in turn boosts 0.0 even more.

1/4/2009,"now that the blockade runners can come along; and a proposed fuel bay.. which idealy the blockade runners can be droping fuel into... plus the ability to jump into jammed systems using cov cyno... this essentially balances the ability to move ships around and such... but it doesnt change the ship's ability to pvp. which they are horrible..now with the new ability to jump into jammed systems.. these ships could be used in conjunction with steath bombers.the ability to drop a high alpha dmg, with reasonable dps.idea being.. uncloak, fire, recloak.now pos are pretty slow at locking ships. if you do it correctly... you should be able to strike and cloak before the pos locks onto you.take sin(gallente blackop) you could adjust the ship to allow xl hybrids. with a respectible dmg bonus also. it gives the ship pretty good dps and capability. with proper balancing it would make it quite good."
1/4/2009,"this is a great idea, except for the fact that black ops were never designed to be damage dealers. if you want that, fly a marauder (and they can even fit cloaks too!).a black ops is a logistics assistant/utility vehicle. while it could stand to take some more damage, it was never designed to deal it. unsigned."

1/4/2009,"every mmo that i have played has had a serious problem with <ingame currency here> sellers, and, while nowhere near as bad as some, eve still does have them.i have thought about a soloution for a while, and looking through the common features of this highly irritating spam, 90-100% of them always have a link to a website, and is done by bots.my proposal to fix this is simple. a block list for just the urls of the isk selling websites. so, whenever the url in complete form or with minor modifications (ie spaces in between the letters, or any punctuation aswell) is contained in a chat message, the message simply will not allow itself to be posted in the chat channel, with an error coming up explaining which word is censored.to clarify, only urls of isk selling sites should be censored, nothing else, this should please everyone and maintain eve's sandbox feel while cutting down on annoying lag and spam from a service that is a breach of the eula.to stop this being a lag generating feature, this list should possibly be in the client, not the server, and updated in patches.for ease of use, possibly another section of the petition function designed for the input of urls to be censored, where the dev's can go through the suggestions and add the urls to the censoring list."
1/4/2009,"how about a right-click option to both report spammer and block?wow has that and it's a good feature. took them years to get around to doing it, but still a good feature."
1/4/2009,"it could work, but most spammers are just on trial accounts, so reporting wont do much. all they would do is just come back with another trial account.maybe make it so trial accounts cant send messages quite as often? it shouldnt affect most people all that much but it will hurt the spammers.. possibly restrict the amount of times trial accounts can repost the same message in a chatroom, theres lots of ways you can go around slowing down the spammers but i'd like to see them gone completely."
1/4/2009,"this. not perfect, but certainly helpful. also, op's proposal won't work, they'll just switch to tinyurl. try censoring those. also, lowering speech rates for trials seems like a good way to make newbies nonfunctional at asking for help. it's not like spammers send three messages a second, you'd have to limit them to like one every few minutes to make their spamming even somewhat less functional. that seems like a terrible thing to do to trial accounts."
1/4/2009,"problem with filtering links is they evade the filters. i.e. wow had a problem with ""peons4hire.com"" for a while, they blocked the url so they started using 3-line spams with ""(peons)"", ""(4hire)"" and ""(com)"" at the start.throttling chat in rookie help, based on character count, not line count, would be a good start since they tend to shovel the whole sales pitch into one line.also, disable external website links in rookie help."
1/4/2009,"what long-term solution do you propose? as for the idea itself, reasonable enough. it's not a perfect solution, but it doesn't hurt anything, and it'll clean things up somewhat."

1/5/2009,"caveats: 1. blackops were released pre-nerfed, true. this was intended to prevent them from completely overshadowing their t1 hulls. in terms of game balance, cost is a minor concern and must be ignored. a statistically equivalent/superior t2 geddon, with a jump drive, simply obsoletes a t1 geddon, thus the statistics and fittings of the blackops battleships were scaled back below their t1 parent hulls.2. the hulls chosen for blackops ships vs marauders seems an arbitrary decision which consider which ships would be better at pvp vs pve, so i've corrected them. dominix > mega for missions, mega > domi for blackops, so make the domi the marauder and megathron the blackops, etc3. blackops lack the ability to fit a covert ops cloaking device. this was an intentional design decision, which follows the well established rules concerning the raw dps available on cocd usable ships. this is completely unrelated to the aforementioned pre-nerfing of the ships stats.4. a covert ops cloak is quite literally useless on a battleship sized hull, especially on a battleship hull which has it's own jump drive and ability to lock on to covert cyno fields. while this is the most requested ""improvement"" from the masses (all of which admit they do not actually fly the ships in pvp, due to the lack of a cloak, thus they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about). it's also the most ridiculous request for an ""improvement"" which players with zero experience piloting blackops ships would readily trade class destroying nerfs in order to ""balance"" the addition of said covert ops cloak. this suggestion is laughable and should never even be entertained.all blackops: +40% base scan resolution to counteract fitting a cloak.+60 cpu (cost to fit a t2 cloak)+50% native sensor strength (opposite of marauders)t2 resists (racial flavor as appropriate on t2 ships)jump range increased to 3ly base (6.75ly with jdc 5, 6ly with jdc 4)500-2000m3 fuel bay added (whatever developers feel is balanced)covert cynos changed to be usable in cynojammed systemsall cpu/pg listed before skills, includes +60 cpu from abovesin:hull > megathron. developer > duvolle. 7h:5m:7l, 5 turrets, 610 cpu, 13,500 gridgallente bs: 5% large turret dmg/lvl, 7.5% large turret tracking/lvl.5% agility per level of blackops bonus (highly useful pre-qr, worthless now) becomes a third turret bonus, perhaps optimal, 2nd damage, or falloff.panther:hull > tempest. developer > boundless creation 7h:5m:7l, 5 turrets, 660 cpu, 13,500 grid5% speed per level of blackops bonus (highly useful pre-qr for an entirely different reason, worthless now) removed. the panther is thukker (like the vagabond), this doesn't work for battleships. the panther needs to become boundless creation and given a 3rd projectile bonus (such as falloff).redeemer:hull > geddon. develop > viziam. 8h:4m:7l, 6 turrets, 565 cpu, 17,000 grid (the only change is +60 cpu)with the above changes that all blackops need, the redeemer is fine.widow: most people do not realize this, but the widow is already: hull > raven. developer > kaalakiota. 7h:8m:4l, 5 missiles, 820 cpu, 8800 grid (the only change is +60 cpu)both caldari bs bonuses come from the raven, however the fitting & bo bonus comes from the scorp. unfortunately, players seem enthralled by the ecm bonus (no idea why), so you kinda have to leave it exactly as is (other than +60 cpu).currently:the redeemer (geddon) and panther (phoon) are -1 low, +1 mid. the sin (dominix) is -1 low, +1 mid, +1 high. the widow (raven) is -1 low, +2 mid, -1 high. if you compare the widow to the scorpion, the widow is simply +1 high/missile hardpoint.changes:redeemer (geddon) -1 low, +1 mid > marauder = apoc (no change)panther (tempest) -1 high, +1 low > marauder = typhoon (with torp bonuses)sin (megathron) -1 high, +1 mid > marauder = dominixwidow (raven) -1 low, -1 high, +2 mids > marauder = raven (no change. 500m-800m t2 scorpion? useless)"
1/5/2009,this is probably the most intelligent thing you've ever said.
1/5/2009,"switching around the hulls seems like a major task, but i can't disagree with the reasoning behind the move. as for the overall improvements to the class, i agree 100%. counter the penalties of the cloak, give better resists, slightly better jump range and bypass cyno jamming and you've balanced the class."
1/5/2009,take away 1 lowslot on the widow? are you serious...?i like the ideas but if anything give the widow 1 more lowslot
1/5/2009,he doesn't like ecm.
1/5/2009,"i edited the op to clarify that my proposal changes nothing about the widow other than giving it +60 cpu. i was merely saying the widow is a raven with -1 low slot, +2 mids, -1 highslot. the slot layout on the widow follows the same pattern as the other blackops (-lows, +mids).with my proposal, the blackops balance out as follows (note: i'm using the redeemer as the baseline ship for balancing purposes):redeemer = 4 mids, 7 lows, 8 highs, 6 turrets (1 less than geddon)widow = 8 mids, 4 lows, 7 highs, 5 missiles (1 less than raven)panther = 5 mids, 7 lows, 7 highs, 5 turrets (1 less than tempest)sin = 5 mids, 7 lows, 7 highs, 5 turrets (2 less than megathron)*this balances out their slot layouts. technically i should give the sin 6 turrets and 8 high slots to match the megathron, however, this would mean the sin loses either a low or a mid slot, neither of which it can really afford to give up. i could give it the same layout as the redeemer, but then it would be overpowered compared to the redeemer if it were given 2 damage bonuses, which i feel both the sin and panther need. not fitting a 6th gun free's up alot of grid for use in lows or their extra utility midslot.my feeling is with 5 utility mids, 3 turret bonuses and 5 turrets, the panther and sin should balance out with the redeemer, who also has 3 turret bonuses but of course being amarr one of his bonuses is -50% cap use on lasers, bleh. basically the comparison is:panther: 5x 800mm ii's with 5% rof bonus, 5% damage bonus, and 5% falloff bonussin: 5x neutron blaster cannon ii's with 5% damage bonus, 7.5% tracking bonus, and either another 5% damage bonus. (maybe 10% falloff bonus/10% optimal bonus if that's too much damage)redeemer: 6x megapulse ii's with -10% capacitor bonus, 5% rof bonus, 7.5% tracking bonuswidow: 5x siege launcher ii's with 5% rof bonus, 10% missile velocity, 20% ecm strength.the difference in torps vs guns has the widow matching/slightly outpacing the redeemer but only if using a target painter, otherwise they are pretty close. the panther/sin get 1 less turret but both get double damage bonuses vs the redeemer so they should balance out as well. this way *all* of the blackops can actually have a sane slot layout in order to fit tank/damage mods/etc."
1/5/2009,"um no... how many people can fly a geddon? compared to the black op version?? months of training difference. secondly... cost is a huge concern. tech 2 isnt insurable. while tech 1 is,which would make sense... but it breaks it. domi as marauder would be epic. this obviously wont change now.same reason stealth bombers dont have cov-op. would be overpowered.i dont have a clue what ur talking about tbh. cov-op cloak wouldnt even be that much of an improvement. it would be overpowered... but also a doubleedged sword.pretty fair... but you really dont have to fit one.honestly not an issue for me. all my fits have no issue with fitting.nice but not necessary; as it isnt the problem with black ops.already going to happen.in conclusion... tbh i think the redeemer-panther mostly needs the logistical boost; perhaps an optimal/falloff bonus on their weapons but they are good.widow is kind of crappy but i guess it does what it does.sin is the real sad one who really needs a massive boost. i cant get the thing to actually work until you use tuvan's modified lars + t2 rigs. which is ridiculous.in my opinion they need to fix targeting range such that it is > plain domi... or build into the ship one ccc. that alone will mitigate the fix."
1/5/2009,"the hull changes are bizarre. the slot layout and bonuses can be changed, but all of the black ops need to use the tier 1 bs hull. that is how all tech 2 ship lines work and there is no need to change it now.scan res bonus, fuel bay and usable in cynojammed systems are desperately needed.jump range bonus would be nice but i don't think we'll get it.t2 resist, sensor strength and +cpu would be nice but i could live without them."
1/5/2009,"well, it's been just short of half a year now since we last heard anything. what's the status guys? we gonna get a skill queue in the foreseeable future or not?"
1/5/2009,"absence of skill queue results in either of these two things:scenario 1: you waste precious skilltime, unlessscenario 2: you're a no life that wakes up during the night, misses school and does other silly stuff to change skill."
1/5/2009,"wow, reading comprehension ftw?also, supported!"
1/5/2009,bump/support
1/5/2009,.
1/5/2009,"considering the eve wiki is in the process of being created and fleshed out, i see no reason for someone not to start up a known exploit page on there. if ccp doesn't like it they always have veto power on it and can remove it. personally, i don't think it's necessary for the csm to look at this considering that avenue is available, but if it came down to it, i'd probably support the idea of listing known exploits and the link to the relevant eula section."
1/5/2009,it would get removed from the wiki on grounds that discussing/mentioning exploits is not allowed.
1/5/2009,bring it up just to make sure we have ccps permission to make the list.
1/5/2009,"hey ignit, i think the biggest problem with this is that you'd either have an insanely overpowered mod due to its cycle time (beaten only by jump portal generators, cynos, and ice miners), or you'd have to make it so that heat damage would wipe out nearly every single low slot within 1-2 cycles, thereby making this a shield tanker's dream and an armor tanker's nightmare."
1/5/2009,"say if it added 20% of the current bonus to shield n armor so an overheating dc ii would be: (12.5 x .2) + 12.5 for shield = 15% remember these resists are unstacked(15 x .2) + 15 for armor = 18% armor(60 x .2) + 60 for structure = 72% hull.so 72% hull is alot of omni resists but then again this almost brings hull tanking back as a viable option. also remember overheating is only as effective as skills train for, as well if a mod burns out, you have to be in a station to fix, and if a mod is partially damaged you have to turn it off to repair with nanite paste.ninja edit: also cycle time doesn't coicide with active time. as long as the mod is active its overheating, and the heat can be turned on and off while the mod is still active. so cycle time really doesnt bother me as gamebreakingi really cant see that being all that game breaking. granted almost all lowslots are genrally passive in nature allowing them to be natural heatsinks... so what armor tankers dont have an omni tank mod that can be overheated and its not gamebreaking (see invuln field)but yes as much as i would love to overheat it, i do not want this idea to cause an imbalance."
1/5/2009,"unless i'm somehow even more ******ed than i feel, overheat is done on a per cycle basis. hence why you can't overheat a mwd midway through (very annoying when rushing back to a gate or speed breakout from a gatecamp) on a side note, let people overheat modules when jump cloaked or cloaked, so first activation is overheat!"
1/5/2009,"i probably am wrong... lul since i was going off the stupid cycle circle which is never the right timing anywayswell then fix the dc so the mod doesnt take the time that it does and reduce its cap usage so its the same per second usage but allowed for a much more manageable overheating.like i said, idea.... would like to hash it out ;-p"
1/5/2009,"i don't think overheating a damcon would be particularly unbalanced tbh, considering how much damage it'd put off in that 30 second cycle, you'd probably burn out your entire low rack."
1/5/2009,"considering that dc is pretty much mandatory on many ships, it doesnt need another boost imo."
1/5/2009,"more resistance on hull? oh, i see what you did there:real men hull tank"
1/5/2009,"seem a good solution.that would require to resolve several issues with drones that are at least partially resolved in one patch and return the next, for example the drones not using mdw to return to your ship, failing to dock even if ordered and so on. then there is the effect of increase in the length of firing cycle for drones done some patch ago (one of the need for speed initiatives). before the drones start to move toward your ship they could wait up to 4 seconds while completing the firing cycle. that make it improbable getting them in before the emergency warp from a dc. and then don't resolve the problem for a sentry drone."
1/5/2009,"again this is an isp/network problem of the person self. if you would try to go this way then also by default replace ships of people who dropped connection, and many more things like this.and again its a problem on your side.and yes other races lose drones as well on connection loss ow and switch to gunnery as primairy might be better for you.ow and did i allready mention fix ur internet"
1/5/2009,"i support this only if they auto scoop to drone bay due to ship leaving grid due to emergency warp, can't be a warp you initiate.this would prevent it being exploited in pvp, because if your ship is pointed or bubbled prior to losing connection it won't emergency warp."
1/5/2009,support. just to have the drones automatically return to the drone bay when you get back into the grid would be nice.
1/5/2009,"your village called... they want there ""self proclaimed expert"" back.ahem...yep... i'm in favor of this... there's nothing like having a full set of heavies out there and finding out you foolishly forgot to watch your cap and you warp the heck out leaving behind several large bits of your ship and you realize.... you forgot to recall your drones.. doh!!!you come back... and they are 100km's off.... (cause you where kiting x o d )try scooping them in a malestrom... with no ab.... even then... its torture./signed"
1/5/2009,"i like the hyperion, it is big and shiny. however, it lacks pretty heavily in comparison with its main competitor, the megathron.not only is the hyperion a good 55~ million isk more expensive than the megathron, but the drone ability of the ship is actually *weaker* than its tier 2 counterpart. while 100 bay/bandwidth certainly compares well with the other third-tier battleships, the hyperion remains a gallente bs unable to field a full set of heavy drones. the description of the hyperion promotes both its lethality and versatility. however, due to the dual bonuses and extra heavy drone of the megathron, the hyperion is almost certainly *less* lethal than the much cheaper ship, and certainly less versatile.my proposal is this: increase the hyperion's bandwidth to 125, and its drone bay to 200. this would put the hyperion on a more comparable level to the megathron, increase its versatility, and ultimately give it the drone power it *should have* as the top-of-the-line gallente battleship, and, indeed, the most expensive battleship in the game."
1/5/2009,"supported, why not. it's probably unbalanced, but it's not like blaster ships are uber at the moment.the 200m3 drone bay might be a bit much, though."
1/5/2009,"125 would be bare-minimum acceptable (for a set of heavies and parity with the megathron), 200 was suggested because it'd give the hyperion a good boost in versatility, allowing it to field several different drone types effectively."
1/5/2009,"i think 125m3 would be a lot more suitable (drone-space) so it can either field a few waves of light/mediums or go for a full rack of sentries or heavies. the dominix is the drone-boat, not the hyperion. just because it's a tier3 battleship doesn't mean it should be the best. although that doesn't mean i don't like the idea, i agree, it could do with a dronebay boost, but only to 125m3 or 150m3 imo. any higher would be a bit too much."
1/5/2009,"let's look at rokh and raven then, shall we? rokh is more expensive, has less drones then raven and is probably less lethal then torp raven even with blasters.no reason to boost hyperion then if situation is same with other races' ships"
1/5/2009,"its not, the rokh is an effective fleet sniper, which is its intended role. not a close range blasterboat. the problem the op is pointing out is that the mega does the hyperion's job (close range blasterboat) nearly equal or better than the hyperion. i think thats what he is trying to say...i don't think his fix is going to change it all that much though."
1/5/2009,"i had a hyperion up near my thanatos. literally it's as big as the thanatos on length and width. except it's larger... odd for such a large ship to be so crappy.anyway so yesturday i was checking out how to fit a hype... tbh hadnt ever fit one for anything other than mining.i found out... it's really designed for blasters... u cant fit 8x 425mm rails + lar... that's pretty sad tbh.then you have a crappy slot layout.. you lose on dmg mods if you were fitting 350s... that's all around fail. and then crappy drone bay. what it does do well is fleet operations and such sure... but jeese why limit the ship when clearly it could have good potential. actually it kind of does... more training and higher cost = better. or the ship is broke. reference black ops150 is fine. gives you 6 heavies. 1 replacement.one is missiles, and one isnt. stop comparing apples to oranges. rokh fails entirely on the fact that caldari rarely use hybrids. if you're caldari... you train missiles... that's all there is to it."
1/5/2009,"without a constructive point of argument, your ""no"" only shows ignorance - and therefore has no value."
1/5/2009,you really didn't put a lot of thought into this did you?no for the op being ignorant and stupid about database structure and game mechanics.obviously biased towards easier scanning down of ships which is already very easy with probing.learn to play the game or grow a brain.. either way... forgetaboutit.: o p
1/5/2009,"this would not add strain to a well designed database at all, you are adding a field to the ship.if you were worried about strain you would ask ccp to disallow naming of ships because that causes the exact same amount of strain as this 'license' system (actually it would cause more than the license system if ccp uses the suggestion below, instead of the one in the op). if you want to do this you could simply use a reversable encryption algorithm to create a unique license from the itemid field (all flown ships are unpackaged and thus would have a unique itemid). remove the repackage nonsense though, if i wanted to clear the license there would still be a go around repackage -> contract to friend -> friend contract back. i oppose this because it doesn't add anything significantly meaningful to the game. there are features more worthy of the devs attention."
1/5/2009,"and what do you realy know about database issues ?what is obvious is that most of the requests in assembly hall are baised toward some form of game improvement or addition that benefit primarily the poster - the effects of ship licence plates being helpfull in scanning was not the reason for this proposal, the main objective of this change would be to properly track ships on killmails and perhaps later add an ingame kb. about putting enough thought into this, which is another reason for posting - any constructive arguments would further the idea itself and make it more structured - and this is where you fail to contribute - your reply is nothing but feeble trolling attempt - which represents you as a whiny ****** crying for attention."
1/5/2009,"apparently i know more than you do about database structure.first off... what your talking about is adding an entirely new series of database tables/columns that involve tracking individual ships.taking into account the obscene number of ships... and the number of ships tied to each individual user which frequently change hands on a daily bases... topped off with fittings... starts to reach exponential numbers.and you want to tag a unique id on each and every frakking ship.so yes... i say you are stupid and brain dead and not to mention a jackass for presuming out of sheer ignorance and aragonace that you know nothing about database structures.nothing is ever that simple... if it was as easy as tacking on a new table or set of tables... we would have a far easier time dealing with any number of problems that plague the it world.they are not... uber-db's deal with joining tables... inner joins.. outer joins... keeping them normalized... and stable not to mention properly keyed and indexed.this whole proposal is adding ""fluff"" which do nothing but stroke the epeen's of someones kill mail according to what you just said... its pointless.. and does nothing to further the growth or improvement of the game.however... teaching you the insight of database mechanics is like talking to a child... and hence... is a total waste of my time.if the database was ""young"" brand new... a few months... perhaps... but a well engraved/rooted db would require a ton of debugging and possibly rebuilding the whole damn system.move along... move along."
1/5/2009,"failing other 0.0 incentive proposals, i'd like to see that rather than banning implants from highsec, they are creatable in 0.0, or only +4s and +5s can only be gained from 0.0, thus increasing the incentive to run pirate missions, albeit at a lower lp cost than what's currently available."
1/5/2009,because a bunch of thugs are so much better at learning than those living in an organized society that respects property rights and is able to set up infrastructure like universities.
1/5/2009,"a) logic has never ever stopped any single argument from being implemented in eve's history, don't let it start now. i see your property rights and raise you ""extensive illegal testing is required to make implants above a certain grade, with mortality rates in excess of what the empires are willing to tolerate""b) in terms of game balance, it would not effect new players in the slightest, as a fair bit of training is required for +4 implants. but, it would increase the demand upon +4 implants, making the incentive to go and farm them that much higher. a correlating means to improve pirate faction standing outside of missions would be required (besides failing storylines) so as not to disadvantage long time npcers, but it would increase the populations of many of the npc regions, which are sorely lacking in much besides very niche game play (station game syndicate, blob warfare curse, very desolate venal) c) provides a strong incentive for players to move to 0.0, especially if agents in outposts is implemented."
1/5/2009,"i would suggest that you (a) don't get podded, and (b) read up about jump clones."
1/5/2009,i need to stop reading anything jason edwards says... its hurting my brain.
1/5/2009,geez :')

1/5/2009,"you are by far the worst poster and clueless noob in the eve universe.you want xl hybrids on a sin? you do know that xl guns do about the same dps as large hybrids without siege mode, yes? you also cannot hit anything except a pos with xl guns, right? turning black ops into a really weak pos attack ship is by far the worst idea ever."
1/5/2009,"yeah capital guns on a battleship isn't a good idea, they're.. terrible. i do support the idea of increasing their survivability though, wouldn't say no to increased resistances."
1/5/2009,"how the heck did you become a csm delegate? with such blatantly misguided responses like this, no wonder virtually no one has any faith in this council or process."
1/5/2009,oh wow.

1/5/2009,"small ships and warp acceleration - tuskochatlog: [ 2009.01.03 18:02:37 ] the proposal was based on the assumption that the increased warp speed of interceptors and other fast ships do not give them sufficient edge in chasing slower targets because their acceleration into and from warp are not better than those of other ships. some csms did not agree with the assumption and were kind of happy with the current paramterers. votes: 4:5 - failed supported by: ankh, issler, lavista, tuskoagent qualities and mission hubs - tuskochatlog: [ 2009.01.03 18:10:00 ]the original proposal was about changes to agent qualities in order to get rid of laggy mission running hubs. during the discussion it turned out that csm1 has already discussed most of this proposal and it would not make much sense to resubmit it, so it did not come to voting. furthermore, ""epic story arcs"" were promised for the march expansion, which might fix agent hubs, another reason against raising this issue. despite this, csm members were curious about what ccp is planning to do about agents so the council agreed to ask ccp in iceland about their progress regarding the dynamic agent qualities proposal csm1 has presented. pos fighter bays - tuskochatlog: [ 2009.01.03 18:21:55 ] the proposal was about adding a new pos structure housing defense fighters, which can be controlled by pos gunners. csm members expressed concerns about the development time, lag caused by new drones and the general effectiveness and price of fighters. some csms did not like the suggested implementation either so the proposal was a big fail. votes: 1:8 - failed supported by: tuskoreliable and safe ways of transportation and small gang warfare - tusko chatlog: [ 2009.01.03 18:33:35 ]this general discussion type proposal was about discussing the effects of new transportation technologies like the jump drives on the mobility of players and their ultimate effects on the usefulness of roaming gangs. the proposal contained some ideas about possible jump tech nerfs as possible ideas, which then resulted in heavy resistance from virtually every csm member. votes: 2:7 - failed supported by: lavista, tuskoincentivizing 0.0 - dariuschatlog: [ 2009.01.03 18:44:09 ]this general discussion type proposal is based on the 0.0 roundtable discussion we had at fanfest 2008. its main topics are sovenerity mechanics and the risk vs reward in different kinds of 0.0. it touches ideas like decoupling sovenerity from posses and getting the possibility to ""upgrade"" player owned 0.0 space. as this is a discussion type topic, the csm unanimously agreed to bring it to ccp.votes: 9:0 - escalated supported by: everyonegeneral discussion on mining - bunyipchatlog: [ 2009.01.03 18:54:57 ]this general discussion proposal is a the re-raising of the ore redistribution proposal that was discussed on the 5th csm2 meeting on dec. 20. it proposes a general discussion session with ccp on the topic of asteroid mining. the issue was passed without discussion. votes: 9:0 - escalated supported by: everyonemeeting endminutes compiled by tusko hopkins. any errors or omissions please contact him.

1/5/2009,"solitude is actually quite a popular place for fledgling corps and alliances to try and build up in. the only reason it is empty and lifeless is due to us keeping a vigil over the lowsec parts of the region, terrorizing any group who tries to move in and destroying any ship which enters it. we've kept solitude clear of carebear infestations for over 2 years now, however i'll note that last year we moved to curse for about 3 months. as soon as we left syndicate, the population of the region exploded with life and activity. in the three months we were absent easily 5k players had come to inhabit low sec solitude and the bordering ta constellation in syndicate, my god there was even macro-miners operating in low sec, 2 jumps from 0.0. it took us a week or two to eradicate them all, but we restored the natural order of things in solitude and carefully maintain it.there are a few pockets of lowsec tucked behind a few highsec systems, such as straloin/toustain, the aeter triangle (aeter/harner/sarline), etc. these are wonderful because they give the carebears a false sense of security, which enables us to do things like this.solitude is perfect the way it is."
1/6/2009,please support this proposal.
1/6/2009,"i support this.theirs already a million ways for people to scam, this won't make much of a difference. i like the idea of having a name tab like the one for employment, plus limit it to 2 times. this would give tons of people a second chance who didn't put much thought into their character's name without starting over."
1/6/2009,"no you chose your name live with it,bought your account tough,should of had the patience to create your own character."
1/6/2009,"obviously people already live with it. just because you don't want to change your name doesn't mean someone else wouldn't like to. just because you don't care about your character's name doesn't mean that everyone else doesn't care about their character's names.once again i'll say that we should leave the limit to name changes up to ccp or their balancing team. why limit it? if they charge money for it, that would limit some people. depending on implementation ccp/gms could view names that were changed to prevent people ""one upping"" one another.pretty common request to create a ""name tab"" or some other method of tracking the character name. once again, i am only requesting the ability to change my character name not spell out exactly how it is implemented, the fee, or anything of that sort. all of those tasks should fall on ccp to determine what is fair and balanced.here is another example of where it would be nice:in your corporation you have a rank structure (or faction warfare?) when your character was created you created a ""lt bob"" but as far as your corp is concerned you're a colonel, it would be nice to make your name match right? or you just want to add that to your character name ""general evilphoenix"" anyone?"
1/6/2009,"not supported, that the work of players like that ruin, who do not stay in the game because of rl"
1/6/2009,there are already mechanics in place to remove said pos's from the game why not use them you dumb ass
1/6/2009,supported - hack or destroy and salvage!
1/6/2009,"and when he come back to play from holyday, he lost the personal property, when you stealth, because you dont like working."
1/6/2009,a big thumbs up for this idea. hacking an offline tower or demolishing it with rigged charges... brilliant!
1/6/2009,then take down your tower or have someone else keep it fueled. if a tower isn't fed it should become vulnerable to be taken over or the mods stolen or something.
1/6/2009,"i do not support this idea unless the ""long time"" is over three months.i currently have a pos that someone wanted to randsom it.i took everything off and now the pos sits waiting for me to unanchor when they get tired of watching. that can take a long time."
1/6/2009,"not supported, because the eve not just 0.0"
1/6/2009,"no, they can't. you don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about."
1/6/2009,"missiles are not useless, amarr is just op atm because they got a tracking bonus during empyrean age, and then ccp slowed everything down in qr, which means they can hit a gnat flying circles with artillery now.once laser tracking is fixed, all will be good again.do not support."
1/6/2009,"i'm sorry. i don't like the idea of having a to train a skill to compensate for things that are usually out of the game's scope (internet spike, electrical outage, kid/sister/brother/spouse hitting reset). there should be some sort of memory on the drones saying ""oh, he's back within 10 minutes, i'll go back to him""would also give a huge advantage in node/server crashes."
1/6/2009,dig it.
1/6/2009,signed
1/6/2009,not to mention that that's only 1 person making that amount (whether it's 75m or 20m) per system. that's not really all that useful or interesting given the number of people you actually need to hold space or even maintain a presence in 0.0. killing pirates in belts does not scale.
1/6/2009,"not supported, because the eve not just 0.0"
1/6/2009,what? since eve is not just 0.0 we should not make 0.0 better?
1/6/2009,"empire players equal with 0,0 player.not less or not more. this is an another thread, where the csm want to give more economic and another advantage/prefer to smallest group of eve (9% population of eve live in 0.0)enough from the favouritism somebody, anyone else plays too with the game, so wrong, if discounts, when provided to one of the sides only any of the reasonable requests of the other side are rejected."
1/6/2009,"yes, not supported too"
1/6/2009,"why do you think only 9% of the population lives in 0.0?i would say its because the average individual can make more money running lvl 4 missions in empire. most 0.0 dwellers have empire alts as well just do do business in empire without trouble (even mission), so be careful with your statistic. just because 9% of the characters are out in 0.0 does not mean that only 9% of the people who play eve play in 0.0. and also would that be an indicator to you that 0.0 is actually not balanced with empire? if 0.0 was balanced wouldnt you expect to see half of the eve population out there (or maybe at least 1/3rd). 9% to me is a problem. you might as well argue for the removal of 0.0 hun.what people in this thread want is increased rewards for their increased risk, not favoritism for 0.0 players. right now under the current system the average 0.0 dweller makes less isk/h than your lvl 4 missioner with the added risks and obligation of 0.0 living. yes you might be able to make 20m and hour or 75m an hour, but then you spend 6 hours an an alliance op to defend your space losing 2 battleships in this fight or that one (costing you 40mil after insurance, or 22b (hi molle)). and every hour you spend fighting to defend your space, someone in empire is still doing a lvl 4 mission, maybe to be annoyed once or twice a year by a suicide ganker."
1/6/2009,"i've ratted in fountain, curse, stain and other areas doing the same. oh and it was a 17 belt system with multiple ratters in system.of the 4, fountain was by far the worst hitting only about 56 mil/hr, but in fairness, it was a 12 belt system."
1/6/2009,"yaay:i would like to see documented proof, which includes the # of accounts you were using to achieve this amount. in addition subtract profits gained from manufacturing rigs, the only value that should be included is rat bounties, and market value of the loot and slavage recieved. for your time quotient you have to include the time it takes you to get to a station with it. also you must include the time in percentage form to which you were not ratting on average due to hostiles. a snapshot of your wallet with 1 hour of ratting would help as well. if you are going to keep repeating this, you might as well back it up with a bit more than our trust in what you say on a forum."
1/6/2009,"ok i am going to suggest something that i think a lot of people are going to hate, some will like but i have not seen on the forums so far but maybe it has. make soverenty linked to kill mails. ..... this way you take soverenty away from poses and force pvp. kills would count towards your alliance and your corps hold on the system. like capturing a flag in other games. let the surrounding systems give bonuses to holding your current system. so say you have your one system and it is connected to 4 others those 4 give bonus to the current system to keep it from falling. this way you are not constantly fight with an empire that is dying from the inside out but the bigger you get the harder it is for you to maintain the borders.have influence based on what you are flying the size of the gang and what you kill. you get more influence for killing things while in smaller gangs, ships ect. and less for the other way around. like accumulating points an a kill board. the intended purpose would be to stop pos spam, get people back into smaller ships and gangs. making pvp cheaper for everyone. hopefully poses will be used more as staging grounds, ocassional safe spots and more for industry instead of what it is now.i am hopefull that the proposed minning changes of moving belts to the dungeon system will help to fix some of the profitability issues. but i also think that for the long run yields are going to have to be increased in ores/refinable materials so that as eve grows the supplies can keep up with demand. perhaps these higher yield ores need to be restricted to just low/null sec.coming from someone who has 1 acct and has yet to fly one, i beleive capitals are a royal pain for there use. and are to vulnerable by themselves. i beleive 0.0 will benefit if they were allowed to be more versitile and were more self sufficient. weather that by changing how they move around or how much they can carry or a change in there fundamental purposes. but for some reason i don't think it is right that i should need alts, multiple accounts, and a corp support system so that i can afford the fuel needed to hide until i am in a fleet to fight. just does not seem right to me. and it excludes so many players because they do not have the time to spend all day on a game. i do not have to have multiple accounts for other games to enjoy everything they have to offer, why should i for this one? (sorry for the sidetrack)back to soverenty, (my info is a little hazy here wheather they currently do or not) but have capitals help towards soverenty on top of the fights, but only while in space and visible. and the larger the capital the more it counts so titans would be the most the mom's and then the carriers and dreads. this way they could be used to stengthen one area or hold onother that is about to fall.just my suggestions/observation/rant"
1/6/2009,"i could see this working, given that its access is limited and has some sort of security (mail the directors of executing corp) when something moves. you could limit access to ceos ? or ceos plus one chosen member.also, i think the logistics don't need to be complicated. limit to 3 tabs, could even be pre-named (fuel, ships, other). might be limiting for some, but limiting the use will also limit the work involved in making the feature from the get go."
1/6/2009,"there is a function in pos corp hangers that allow corp hanger access to alliance. its kinda broken at the moment tho.if it could be set to allow read only for one way use.. like depositing ore or ice from a alliance level operation that would be nice. or give and take for alliance level logistics.but still.. access still comes down to the corp level ""hanger access other"" roles.to prevent thieves pos managers can password shields and give passwords out to those that need to have access."
1/6/2009,"only a neutrality concept would work here. for example you contract caldari navy to protect you in caldari highsec. means no war dec is valid unless you leave caldari highsec but you have to work for it (missions, mining, ship building for that corp without rewards in isk).good idea. also the victory condition idea has merit. i would not like to see the possibility of terrorism or hit and run attacks disappear but its gotta be harder. i don't get why a corp is held punishable by default because of the crimes of the individual. imo if the bounty hunting system is worked on if could replace the war dec system. individual grievances could be solved individually, unless of course the war is agreeable then let the corporations fight on happily."
1/6/2009,"how about a simplier approach ? - for instance, a corp declares war on another - they set original surrender cost (much like a ransom demand ) which should increase by the amount that the war costs (this should be 2mil a day at least tbh) - retracting a declared war should be possible only by meeting the same cost / condition of surrender.* payment of surrender condition cost would be transfered to the agressor and retracting a war vice-versa - trafered to the agressed.* mutual war would cost equally for both parties until victory conditions are met.* when surrender conditions are met there could be a cooldown period implementd with the effect of rendering the agressed immune to being declared a war by the agressor corp for a limited amount of time (a month ?).* the same principal should be applied to the retractee(sp?) or agressor.i do aggree with the op that wardec mechanichs need to be readressed / changed.edit : added details."
1/6/2009,didn't i already vote on this...
1/6/2009,yes please.
1/6/2009,technical game engine things are meant to be fixed. i support the op.
1/6/2009,i support salvage drones and tractor/tug drones.
1/6/2009,i support anything that makes the salvage profession more viable. +1 to having salvage drones.
1/6/2009,"i've supported this in another thread, providing you can give me a frigate with a drone bay capable of holding my new drones."
1/6/2009,would do nothing to advance salvaging as a profession and would do everything to advance it as free lootz for npcersnot supported
1/6/2009,"current situationthe cyclone is an active shield boosting ship with three utility slots in the highs. this was a perfect combination prior to the nos nerf. you burned a lot of capacitor fueling the shield booster, but you were able to recover that loss by nos'ing your opponents cap.neutralizers are not a valid replacement on the cyclone like they are on many other ships, because the cyclone has the smallest base capacitor of all the tier one battle cruisers to begin with. it needs every fraction of that capacitor to power the shield boosters, so fitting three neutralizers is not an option unless you gimp your tank even further by fitting two cap injectors.switching the extra utility slots from nos to missile launchers is also not an option. the cyclone was a close fit with three medium nos that only take 20 cpu each, and simply impossible to fit with three heavy missile launchers which take 55 cpu each.when ccp raised the cpu of invulnerability fields to 44 each, this ship became a nightmare to squeeze anything on it. if you want a halfway decent tank you can only maybe manage 180 ac's and light missiles or maybe assault missile launchers. of course you might as well be flying a rupture at that point, at least the signature radius will be a lot lower.what i propose1) remove a high slot (utility)2) give it an extra mid slot3) increase the base cpu from 425 to 500"
1/6/2009,"...or you could try some other ship :) i had cyclone once, didn't like it, but i really don't see how it's so much worse than most of other ships in a way."
1/6/2009,"the eve community is funny. if i trained for fotm ships everyone would ***** at me for flying fotm, but if i stick to the race i love (which i do) then they tell me to fly fotm.can't win for losing."
1/6/2009,"since they added another turret slot to the ferox the cyclone is the worst bc. it gets crap dps, hard to fit, and the active tank won't stand up to another bcs punishment (well maybe the passive drake, but about anything can tank those)."
1/6/2009,"those utility slots are suppoused to be used for gangmods, however fitting med noss should still be viable for sustaining cap coupled with a med capbooster, or assault missiles to shoot drones / frigs perhaps."
1/6/2009,the cyclone needs some attention. at the very least more cpu tbh.
1/6/2009,"posting to support.i realize that this game has moved on from using normal ships and is now fully in the throes of being capital ships online, but a few thumbs ups could bring about some necessary changes for the 2% of us that still prefer to fly non-caps."
1/6/2009,i'd like a little more love for all the tier one bcs personally. they pretty much only work as noob cruiser killers these days.
1/6/2009,"just to make things clear, i support the op and this poster."

1/6/2009,"1) fuel bay, seperate from cargohold <- yes they really need that2) use of covert ops cloaking devices <- no, they're not force recons, or cov ops. nearest thing to black ops are combat recons and stealth bombers.3) a slightly longer jump range (perhaps 1-2 light years more) <- not really necessary if jump fuel bay is added.4) enable use of covert cyno in cynojammed systems <- this would be improvement but it isn't really that much of help in general and would, imho, take blackops out of their intended use. (as in not for blobbing stuff)separate fuel bay would help traveling but also high price and crippled scan resolution are problem for blackops too. in my opinion blackops are most fun while flying solo or in small gangs and those things would need boosting. jump portals and stuff like that are not even so useful for this kind of stuff. in small gang you don't really have enough people for cynoing ships around etc. and high price is really last ""nail in the coffin"". it's just too much.yes for generally making blackops real pvp ships. no for making them big force recons."
1/6/2009,"current situationlasers rely on having the best tracking in the game to increase their damage, and each weapon in a class has better tracking.hybrids rely on doing heavy amounts of damage within their optimal, and each weapon in a class has a higher optimal.projectiles rely on fighting within their falloff distance to get the most hits and do the most damage, however all projectiles of the same class have the exact same falloff range.proposed changesgive each class of projectiles a range of falloff distances.example180mm ac ii - 8,000m220mm ac ii - 10,000m425mm ac ii - 12,000m"
1/6/2009,"not interested in a witch hunt/ naming names (although one game that caught cheats used to crucify the characters in public and you could throw rotten fruit at them ), but would like to know the extent of the problem and a detailed account of the action taken in light of it."
1/6/2009,"__mission-runners should be quite familiar with this particular mission (available at all levels afaik).the demands of the mission are quite simple (and always the same for a certain level), fetch a certain amount of a basic ore type for the agent (veld for l1, scor for l2, omber for l3, kernite for l4).in return, you get some token bonus cash and a random +x attribute implant (where x is the level of the storyline mission).the problem with the mission lies in the fact that the requirements are way too easy to fulfill, and you know them well in advance.the typical scenario is player gets his industrial, goes to pick up the needed ore from the market, goes to the agent with ore in tow (if he didn't already have a big chunk of it at the agent), takes the mission and turns it in almost instantly after.as a result, this mission has an abysmal average completion time, with the ""bonus timer"" so small no other mission can possibly match it.the troubling thing however is that a small average completion time means a very small standings increase reward, and a quite high likelyhood of people getting that specific mission from their storyline agent.some of you might consider it a minor annoyance, but for most others (myself included) it's borderline nerve-wrecking.personally, it is my belief that something must be done about this particular mission.now, exactly what is a matter of debate.possible solutions1. removing, or at least temporarily disabling the mission (at least the l3 and l4 versions).it's the most drastic, yet very low ""cost"" (coding-wise) effective solution... i daresay, almost no cost at all.there are plenty of other interesting storyline missions, and basically all lp shops sport learning implants, so any negative side-effects from its removal would be minimal.2. bottom-capping storyline mission rewards (at least for this one) to a much higher value than normal.this would mean that even if the mission remains unchanged, it will no longer suffer from the current issue.it's a band-aid solution, but has no significant noticeable (to me right now, anyway) drawbacks, and should also be relatively low-cost in its implementation.it's certainly a more desirable alternative to the mission's removal, but might still have some unintended consequences i didn't think of. however, i am quite sure any possible drawbacks will be far outweighed by the overall benefits of this change.3. randomizing the mission and hiding the objective before taking the mission.by randomizing, i mean not asking for raw ore, instead asking for t1 modules, empire-specific - the mission could even provide you with bpcs for the needed quantities so you can build them in case you can't find them on the market. peronally, i believe this makes more sense given the title and description of the mission anyway.and by hiding the objective, i mean you being unable to just fetch the items beforehand, you would need to accept the mission first.the problem with this however is that it would need some (probably large) coding work in the way missions are handled. not a bad thing per se, but this means it might take a while to finish, and the problem is way past due for a solution.this last version is the most desirable one in my opinion, but also carries the highest ""cost"" in terms of ccp workload.new! 4. change it into a mining mission.we already have several ""alternate mission-only ores"" for the mining missions, this mission was supposed to be somewhat a mining mission from the start, so simply changing it from a ""trade"" mission with common ore into a ""mining"" mission with mission-only ore would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak... and be reasonably easy to code.__well... feedback ? opinions ? suggestions ?"
1/6/2009,"remove it. fetch missions are the most boring in eve. storyline missions are supposed to be cool, plugging in a bpo or grabbing a hauler is not really cool. i believe they are planning epic story arcs to replace storyline missions so i think this is moot."
1/6/2009,"it makes little sense to have a storyline mission that spans over 16 missions itself, that would kind of be counter-productive if a new storyline would be triggered by the previous storyline's first arc before it even finishes, so i think the ""epic"" arcs are supposed to be regular missions, not storyline missions.but i might be wrong (doubt it though) and some of them are planned for storylines too, no idea how they would plan to handle the ""infinite storylines"" loop that could form then.p.s. added support for op"
1/6/2009,"how dare you attempt to ruin my ore reselling business!!!/end emo nerd rageyeah i got to agree that these missions are just too easy to do, not very imaginitve and just plain suck.i will miss the easy isk though of selling to people to lazy to fetch their own ore though.--editapparently my thumb broke the first time through"
1/6/2009,"option:4: substitute the normal ore with a mission ore like in the other mining missions. change the agent text so i say that he want the mineral for testing purposes and development of new alloys, et voil<U+FFFD>, you have a mission that require you to spend the time mining after you get it. your option 3 is interesting but it is a idea for a new mission."
1/6/2009,"and then what? i assume you'll still have to get that ore by some method. like for instance mining??? i'm a miner myself, np. but getting 8k kernite for instance for someone without any decent mining skills??? it's a faction mission. shouldn't be dependant on skills other than 'missionrunning' type skills.better disable it for now and change it to retrieving some 'minerals', something like the the quafe retrivial mission 'cargo delivery'. but nastier."
1/6/2009,"just disable it tbh, it's way to easy lol..oh it's this mission, > market > buy > accept > finished > leave station."
1/6/2009,"just disable it. last year i ran lvl 4 missions for a few days to buffer up my wallet and this pos(not player owned structure) mission was the only storyline i got. the station that gives the mission is full of people selling of the required ore, so it's just one extra implant at reduced price and then back to grinding the same missions. storyline missions whould be something more interesting anyway."
1/6/2009,disable this abomination or set a fixed reward and rig the timer.
1/6/2009,"this mission isn't wrong by any extent. even in normal mission running, you have your petty missions (alluring emanations, duo of death, et al). this is kind of the 'booby prize' storyline mission, as it doesn't improve your standing much at all.if you remove this mission (which, mind you, i'm not saying that it would be a bad thing), you should also remove the other childishly easy missions (surprise surprise, cargo delivery for people who know the blitz, etc). if you make the mission harder, you should also improve the rewards (both isk and standing wise).while i'm kinda riding the fence on this one, i see no real reason to remove the mission, but it could stand some improvement."
1/6/2009,"as akita said the biggest problem is that:""the troubling thing however is that a small average completion time means a very small standings increase reward, and a quite high likelyhood of people getting that specific mission from their storyline agent.""if the completion timer didn't effect things, i wouldn't have much reason to complain, since i do trades on the dirt cheap implants these missions provide. i do understand your point though."
1/6/2009,"why? we have mining missions, so why not have mining storylines?storylines you don't want or couldn't do aren't so uncommon.i have several alts with standing for level 4 mission for r&d and they are happy to get the material for war or the courier storylines. but when they get a combat storyline they are screwed, ad the whole combat skillset is racial frigates iii to get the industrial and some small gun. if that will not damage my main standing i will use him to do the mission and then deliver it with the alt. similarly a non miner getting a mining storyline mission can use an alt to complete it and then deliver with the character getting it. or even ask a corpmate to do it for a compensation."
1/6/2009,"trivial storyline at best. everytime i was given this mission, the ore was available in-station. the hard part of the mission was actually getting to the agent's system. on auto-pilot. in a shuttle. yeah, it's that hard.remember when you started doing missions for standings (like for research agents) and you're grinding the little lvl1 missions. then you get a storyline. w00t. open journal. materials for war preperations. okay, what's the reward. +1 charisma.*facepalm*either make it harder (like the modules-based mission mentionned above) with better compensation (remove charisma implants ?)."

1/6/2009,"the current limit isn't too bad i think, although it would be great if they raised it to 5 or something like that."
1/6/2009,we really need no limit to war dec number and the fees removed.
1/6/2009,this issue is in dire need of csm / ccp attention - add your support / disaproval / trolling / whatever.
1/6/2009,"it's an interesting idea you have there, but let's look at what happens if we go through with your idea. will the players who built this item as an armor rig suddenly lose money as the components are cheaper to make the new formula? that would not be good for the manufacturers or the market (as they'd have to take a loss to compete).while i agree that it is an electronics rig, it doesn't seem to be that hard to sell for salvage vessels (destroyers, marauders, exequors, etc). this is an issue where you have to look back, say 'oops', and continue going."
1/6/2009,"that is the thing - it goes way way beyond ""oops"" - if it isnt fixed now - further on this will do more damage, and as for leaving it as is - not an option - devs should realize this and hopefully this issue is still nagging at them to be changed."
1/6/2009,"it's an odd place for it, and a fix might be justified. should probably be looked at, but i doubt a change is correct. tentative thumb."
1/6/2009,"yes, but salvaging is a mechanic skill which is with the armor tanking skills. also, salvaging is basically just breaking up clumps or metal or armor which fits in with armor skills and armor rigs. it is not a perfect fit i admit, but makes some sense.are you new to eve, or did someone sell a csm account to the stupidest troll ever? i mean ccp changes things that changes the prices of player manufactured goods all the freaking time. you never get compensation. i am always stunned at how little you know about eve bunyip, you are truly a noob in every sense of the word."
1/6/2009,"same crud allover again tonight. please for the love of god....addon: we do optimize our clients with mos tof the stuff you said up there. some, like me do all of it. it's making no darn difference."
1/6/2009,"god dammit!!! another ******ed ass lag fest, this time in abune... this bull**** has got to be fixed!"
1/6/2009,well if you pc can't handle it why blame ccp and call it server side lag? assigning a blade to your system isn't going to help lag if its fps based and not server based. i dont see how complaining to ccp about your fps problem will help when they have given you tools to manage the problem.. do you want that server to do some your gpu processing for you over the interweb?now if anyone that has responded to this thread about lag and has 100% of the new fps saving features ticked and still have the problems raise there hand..
1/6/2009,this lag makes the game unplayableif ccp didn't intend for massive fights they wouldn't have put everyone on the same serverfix this soon - i'm sick of paying 15 bucks a month to watch twenty seconds of slideshow then waking up in station
1/6/2009,"i believe this to be the best idea yet regarding server lag during large scale faction engagements. oh, and raising hand."
1/6/2009,signed.. i hope something can be done about it. i'm playing the game for these big engagements. if i want small isolated fights ill go play wow.
1/6/2009,"could a csm please explain what ccp is doing about macros and why there has been no visible response to petitions filed about macro miners? im not interested in players opinions on macros, or player solutions. i want my representatives to ccp to get an answer why macro miners, ratters, and mission runners continue to exist in this game.i would like to know what happens when someone files a petition turning in a macro miner, and why that macro continues to mine week after week regardless of petitions filed. in short, why are petitions not acted upon?"
1/6/2009,"i've never filed one of these, but i wonder...do you get an auto-reply asking you to clear your cache when you file one of these ?that'd be awesome."
1/6/2009,i have noticed trit in eve has gone from 1.5 to near 4 isk a unit.. now if that is not through the removal of macro miners then i don't know what could cause it.

1/6/2009,personally i would like to see lvl 5 make it a simply 12 hour turnaround.
1/6/2009,"simple - corps who declare war on another can set a surrender amount. if amount is paid, war stops. if no compensation is paid, war goes on as usual."
1/6/2009,awesome how exact same ideas appear to be mirrored in the minds of multiple individuals at the exact same time check last post - page 3this could only mean one thing - proposed system / mechanics change could actualy work.
1/6/2009,"assuming i was aiming for extortion, this would just simplify the process, and would probably result in more payments. i win!if i decced the corp for being smacktards or for some other reason, when i declared the war, i'd just be sure to set a suitably unreasonable surrender fee that empire tools couldn't acquire. i win!i like this idea."
1/6/2009,"you can already do this. just contact the corp and say ""i'll pay you to stop"""
1/6/2009,"yeah, but if they had a button in front of them all day while they watch their assets quickly evaporate, it would make the whole decision a little...easier for them."
1/6/2009,"why?and if so, why not just send an eve-mail to their corp officers explaining the ransom? or have a chat with their diplomat?it seems like an awful waste of developer time to code in something that you can already very easily do."
1/6/2009,no.this would turn in a giant fluckflest of people war deccing everyone they lay their eyes on just to set ransoms.
1/6/2009,"good, we need more pvp."
1/6/2009,read here :
1/6/2009,"this already exists. a lot of wars are for extortion, and they have explicit terms on them as-is, set by the war-starters. most of the rest wouldn't use this option. there's no need to code it in."
1/6/2009,no...victory conditions are needed to prevent abuse of this system.it's bad enough someone could demand a ransom of astronomical proportions... jailing them without a backdoor other than praying the dec'ing corp is rational enough to be reasonable is not what i call a good idea.ps: this does not count as a victory condition.... you need more than this... like number of kills... time length...etc..etc..
1/6/2009,"wait, you petition this? how in the name of god is it petitionable? if you don't want to do the mission, either wait four hours, take the standing hit, or be less of a pansy and just do it. that's not petitionable, and it doesn't need a fix. it's lame sometimes, but it's hardly oppressive."
1/6/2009,"no.the can of worms this one would open has too many worms to even count. plus i dont even see where the point is to make a mini poshy thingy, when most (if not all) of what you wrote as the purposes of this 'structure' can already be done using a small pos as well.also.. from your words i figure you think cruisers / battleships should be used for the base of these structures. what exactly is the point in bringing a bs down to somewhere in no-mans-land, deploying it as a pos wannabe, and staying there in your pod looking at it in awe: ""yes.. i did it.. now i just have to figure out what i can do in this shuttle around here"". you will require a transport to get a ship there, as no ship of any use will fit the cargo hold of your battleship or cruiser. so if you already have to use logistics to get a ship there.. why not get your ship there on foot, escorting the logistics that brings the components for a pos?and finally, the biggest joke of all: cloaking.. do you think that reducing scanning chance to 20%, or even 1% for that matter will stop people from locating something they know is there, when that something is anchored in place? it can not log to prevent you from probing it.. it will just stay there and with the godlike patience people have it will be probed within an hour or two of being detected. once that happens, your nice investment will go poof sooner than you could say: ouch.no, no and even in caps: no. the idea just does not make sense."
1/6/2009,"while i'm not sure about the particular mechanics of this idea - i like the concept and i think it's worth more discussion. smaller, more mobile bases of some sort could encourage more small groups to venture deeper into 0.0. power to the independents!"

1/6/2009,"petition body considering the modern mechanics of fight of fleet, there is an artificial inequality of pilots of class battleship, pilots dreadnought, and others to a lesser degree. one die at once as soon as fight is started, others can shoot many hours and receive the fan, and a difference between them only in the first letter of a name of the character. i will explain, in the fight beginning battleships the opponent are attacked on nickname in alphabetic order, a similar situation and with dreadnoughts (which possibilities to recede from fight at all have no), as a result players with nicknames begins a, b, c, always die the first, is frequent in enter grid lag. as the game mechanics does not allow to change nickname.the essence of my petition that has bothered me to die the first, that my nickname begins on a. thus that there is a simple solution of this problem. to clean names of unfriendly pilots from overview, or to remove a column nickname from overview at all, that there was no possibility to sort people by nickname. it is logical to present that the size, a class and a ship name is a maximum that can learn about the opponent sensors of you ship, but noway a name of the pilot. it is important to keep possibility of identification in fleet that does not contradict logic of friend-or-enemy system. there is a problem, to game lose interest for many people. it is interesting to anybody to fly through half of a galaxy to guaranteed die first minutes of fight? <U+FFFD> to nobody.. hotkey target broadcasting, ( shift+click )compensate voice nickname target calling. unfocusing fire: shipclass-target broadcasting only by squad leader + inscree squad size to 15 peoples."

1/6/2009,why not fly support ships that would leave out of the battleship filter all together. or.. only fly battleships in groups where remote rep is used.but hey thats just me..if you emo quit can i have your stuff?
1/6/2009,"no, this will have negative effects on target calling in small gangs as you cannot differentiate between two enemies of the same ship type.someone has to die first. you should try to increase your play so you don't always die or wear it like a badge of honor instead of whining ""oh noes, my k:d ratio backbone""the problem with hotkey target calling is that these situations you are talking about are filled with lag. so most of the people will not receive the broadcast or will get it too late, etc etc. so this just won't work. the other problem is with gathering intel. if two dominix jump into a system, are they friendly, same corp, are they fighting? you won't really know because you can't see the pilots name so you don't know what is going on.hate the blob, don't hate the game."

1/6/2009,the type of range and cycle that it would likely give would be of little help. normal t2 modules only give 5-15% boosts over t1 parts depending on the bonus. more interesting would be a new ship class dedicated to salvaging with good storage and tractor beam bonus range. oh wait that have that don't they.. its called an orca. :d

1/6/2009,"the mega and hype do have very similar jobs: close up dps output. the difference is you can put a decent local tank on the hype, where the mega really wants to be plated. the hype is fine, it does what it needs to do."
1/6/2009,"this.it isn't that the hyperion needs to be a droneboat. being the only drone-deficient gallente bs is just another knock against it in the long list. for the pricetag (and i must stress again, it is competitive if not outright winner for most expensive bs in the game), it needs to be impressive at *something*, not merely runner-up dps to the megathron with the ability to fit a tank."
1/6/2009,"good god, just because it is tier 3, that does not mean it has to have more drones than tier 1 and tier 2. versatility is fine with 5 mids and more cpu than the mega. lethality comes from its high gun dps compared to other gallente blaster boats. if you want drone versatility go for the domi, if you want a fast, in your face blaster boat that can actually tank, grab a hype. i don't see a problem with a ship just because you want like more drones."

1/6/2009,maybe because ccp thinks the faction war office space is more valuable and limited? why should they go at 10k a office?
1/6/2009,"office pricing is fine. onnamon is a hot spot because it is a high sec -> low sec jump off and a lot of corps/alliances use that to jump stuff into 0.0. also it is a high sec -> low sec for factional warfare.if you can't handle the price, then move. or war dec the corps who have offices in onnamon and take their space.but whining on the forums for 30m/month? your whole corp cannot raise 30m a bleeding month? please. gtfo gtfo gtfo"
1/6/2009,"an outpost arena that can be built very similar to that of outposts; perhaps even using the same skills.the arena will be allowed to be built in high sec given appropriate corp standings.the arena will play host to anyone willing to pvp 1v1, 2vs1, 2vs2, etc... without concord interference or any other interference perhaps due to a war. this system also will spring up the ability to host even the big alliance tournaments. to compete; you bring your ships and modules to such an arena. you then challenge someone. once everyone agrees. the combat begins.to the victor goes the spoils.also for the owners of such stations. they serve 2 functions. 1. they are high sec stations. these only are built in systems with no stations already. so there is that factor.2. you can set an arena rental cost and max match time. say i set it to 1mil per use for 30mins max. they can be very quick uses or up to 2mil per hour. whatever. you set the values such that you earn the most isk possible.ofcoarse there would need to be multiple arenas per station."

1/6/2009,posting with your alt to get more support on the thread. you're a classy guy.
1/6/2009,as it stands if you want to research a bpo it is likely to take a very long time in a queue before your job is even started unless you trust someone with your bpo. a system whereby research slots could be made public and displayed in the normal science and industry window would be good. this could possibly be implemented by the owner of a pos making the research slots public and setting a price for the various slot types. once this is done the bpo owner must have scientific networking trained to the normal relevant level and if he has the bpo it can stay in his hanger and he can make use of the slots without giving the bpo to the pos owner or being part of his corp/alliance. if he takes a pos slot and has the relevant skill trained the isk is then transferred to the pos owner. does anyone else think this would be a good idea
1/6/2009,there are already game mechanics for this. there are research alliances that you can put an alt's one man corp in that gives you access to me and pe research. the only thing that is missing is the ability to make bpcs (they end up still in the pos instead of back in station). i don't know if invention works from the corp hangar or not.
1/6/2009,the current game mechanics require you to trust either the pos owner or the player you are letting join your corp to give access to the pos. in either case one or the other could rip the other off royally. you can do invention etc from the corp hanger using the skill i mentioned (scientific networking). what i am proposing is to make them like any other research slot if the owner allows it and the user has the skill trained.
1/6/2009,"yes, this should be fixed somehow. unfortunately, the fix you propose has already been nixed by ccp. some sort of workaround would be good, but this particular proposal is not an option."

1/6/2009,"from the last two posts - it is apperant that eve database most sertainly already uses an id for each item in the game, including ofcourse ships - and there is a registration with the same database upon client ship activation - so connecting these two elements into a licenceplate is not going to swamp / lag / fail the much needed server resources.i do agree this change would not add anything of significantly valueable or nessecery to the gameplay, however it is most surly a step into the right direction - a cleaner virtual world reflection, licence plates visible on scanner instead of personal interchangable shipnames simply makes much more sense."
1/6/2009,"from this point, you know little about eve's item database structure.its all spelled out in the features and ideas discussion forum under the make bpo/bpc distinguishable topic. there is already a unique id for each and every ship that is flying around. the item database is heavily nomalized already, the suggestion in the op would either go into the metadata (non normalized data joined to the normalized table, which it already is in order to get the ships name) or just used the itemid field (normalized data). i find it quite funny that you see fit to lecture about a database structure you obviously know nothing about."

1/7/2009,i know the topic was brought up but the answer was very unsatisfactory. we would like ccp to know we would really like this. its too hard seemed a bit of a cop out when why was never even mentioned. we see all the stuff they have and are doing and know this should have been done along time ago. we respectfully disagree and feel that this should be done even if it is a bit hard.
1/7/2009,"how we got the point that pretty much every player in eve knows the nag does poor dps, has the worst tank, costs the same amount of money and requires more training than any other dreadnought without a fix ill never know. i guess it just sneaks up on you .probably discussed before but i think its also important to mention that dreadnought is a natural progression for a lot of pilots that are serious about flying a good well skilled, well fitted battleship. needing awu 5 for a lot of fits bs 5 and the opposing gunnery/ missile skills to be a very good battleship pilot means youre already some of the way there. i would hate to see people seeing turning away from high end minmatar battleship skills because they feel they are wasted skill time in regards to long-term progression. full support for a buff."
1/7/2009,"csm members, stop slacking, we have a job for you."
1/7/2009,"i was in the ff 0.0 panels about this and after with darius. i think these ideas are key but also adding in a few other things missing detail in the op...sov improvements, simple upgrades, add modules to the sov-holding poses that improve the value of the space with sov-level prerequisited.. maybe ""deep space scanners"" that improve the quality or number of belts... or increase the number and/or respawn of explorables and encounters.. maybe ""convoy beacons"" that attract more pirate activity to the area lowing the systems true-sec.having these as modules for the sov-holding poses means that if you lose the sov-poses then the improvements go boom... this is important because it encourages people to hold the sov for longer (maybe even have 10 levels??) and really want to defend it... make these upgrades very expensive as well meaning alliances will likely focus on developing their core areas and all their peripheral space become less important. potentially opening more areas for other alliances to move in.a lot of these assumptions would need to be proven out with metrics that probably only ccp has based on gameplay patters and so forth... but improvable space means less of a need for vast reaches of space, usually empty, unoccupied, and sitting idle.... thumbs up darius for posting the op."
1/7/2009,linking sov to killmails will lead to abuse. people will be killing their own alts in noob ships by the dozens.
1/7/2009,"well yes i suppose people would. the only idea i can think of is to keep people of the same alliance gaining points towards soverenty through kill mails. giving even more importance to capitals in soverenty.but that still leaves alts out of the alliance and all i can say to that is that make it unprofitable to do so. i mean if its truely an alt all the isk comes from the same person.hmmm... but i can see both causing problems with corps leaving alliances and newer players. because i think the only way to keep it unprofitable would be to alter insurance, why outfit the noob ship you are going to kill.how about scaling it so that the smaller the 1vs1's are the less you get while still getting more for be smaller than the other guy. say like frig vs. cruser = bc vs bc that way abuse is undoable while still incouraging(sp?) smaller ships and fights."
1/7/2009,"forget it, the whole idea is rather shaky and won't be considered seriously. i'm not in favor of itsystem sov should definitely be about anchored structures. there are many different paths to take in that direction"
1/7/2009,would add more opportunities to an alliance.
1/7/2009,"i like the idea of having a primary training skill and a secondary training skill, so that if both are going at the same time it trains them at half pace, but once one finishes, it switches the other to full sp usage. or even a 1 skill queue i would take.other then that i'm not so into the skill queue thing."
1/7/2009,yesterday i had to relog in the middle of a fleet op because i was sitting at 3 minutes till my skill ended and my character sheet wasn't displaying anything (a common bug)a skill queue would of meant that i could of stayed in fleet.

1/7/2009,"this is a good idea, along with anything else that would give minmatar heavy ships a boost in game rather than their current on paper ""parity"""
1/7/2009,"like missiles, weapons should have a scaling zone of engagement as well.smallest gun - designed for lesser size classes (bs v/ cruiser, cruiser v/ frig, et al).middle gun - designed for equal size class.largest gun - designed for larger size classes (cruiser v/ bs, ect).tracking should scale commensurately, but falloff should remain relatively static to give the larger ship an improved engagement envelope versus a smaller (and shorter range) ship; ostensibly."

1/7/2009,the question is how come ship navigation system is to stupid and only warp at 15 km and a pilot without any skills is so good and always warp to 0ccp should make this distance a random value (imo this have more logic) or this distance be changes by some basic navigation skill without prerequisites so any player can train this skill btw if you look in any sci-fi movie you never see a ship that comes out of warp exactly on dock position push this frontward if you want your station pew pew back
1/7/2009,nogo back 2 years and get 10k+++++ bm's(i had 40k+ entire gate to gate map + extras) so u can point warp...basicly u want to create the problem that ccp got rid of whit warp to 0
1/7/2009,if the distance is random the bm's are useless
1/7/2009,"orly...do u know that the actual jump range of a gate is around 7km and at a usual station its around 30-40 km...meaning if i get a bm 2km behind the gate center(not actualy the distance from the gate but from its center) in line to the other gate and ""warp to 0"" u need a margen of 0-9km and will still be able to instajump...it is the same as the old bm's this wont solve anything as u already warp in a 2.5km range from the actual spot ..remeber that u warp to 0 from the gate not the center of it..i still say no and i explained why...people will just return the bm's and get a hell lot of stress on the client and server"
1/7/2009,so ccp should spend coding time and server time to randomize the warp to 0 command so you don't actually warp to 0?you don't warp to 0 now. its a random 0-2500 meters as it is. unless your hoping you can set warp to 0 to some how be 0-20k off the gate.. then that's just in hopes to gank more people. all that will do is cause even more people to avoid entering low sec at a time ccp is trying to get more people to move in.
1/7/2009,"warping to anything will always randomly land you within a 2km sphere of the object/player/etc you warped to, the only reason you land in dock/jump range is because of how large stations/gates are."
1/7/2009,say the farmer
1/7/2009,we got the code only need a small change then
1/7/2009,"you mean the autopilot warping to 15km? that is to add some risk to the useage of the autopilot, else you could afk jump everywhere without worries if you are in a reasonably agile ship and don't meet any warp bubbles."
1/7/2009,"strongly against it.-fleet movements would take longer!-hauls, nm if in high sec or in 0.0 would take longer.-prices in low sec, or lets say the general availability of items in low sec would change, prices higher and item count lower because of the higher risk.-we have a huge majority of players who never leave high sec and this would make the number even higher-every noob without a clue about fleet tactics would be able to get his shot"
1/7/2009,"no reason to have bookmarks back with the removal of wtz. make the maximum accuracy 10km (doesn't have to be random) and simply not allow any bookmark within 110km of a gate/station. problem solved. if you want an accurate 0km warp in, have a gang mate fly to the gate and then warp to him at 0km. oh look, scouts in frigs are useful again."
1/7/2009,instead of removing wtz a compromise could be making so that you can lock&shoot ships that are entering/exiting warp.
1/7/2009,"you obviously have no idea of what goes on when you warp to zero.warping to zero is never really zero.... its relative so to speak... its always close enough to trigger whatever even you want to do... jumping... docking... etc.as for the randomization.. thats so completely stupid its not even worth attacking.and the sci-fi movies always use a metaphorical navigational method for any number of modes of transportation... ones that don't are usually crappy movies.exit points need to be closely calculated or you could end up a smear on the perveribal wall. eve online may not be precise as you don't really ""collide"" but the idea is quite obvious.i suggest you do a little research before you make off the wall ideas./thumbs down"

1/7/2009,"agreed. there is a danger that what appears to be a macro might be a semi-afk/asleep player. mining certainly puts me to sleep.however, if the player name is ""asdgthjjk"" then ccp should terminate with extreme prejudice. t."
1/7/2009,"if youve ever dealt with macros, you would know its obvious when there is one. no one is arguing ccp should ban people without proof. but is is their job. i pay money, i follow the eula. i expect everyone else to, and i expect ccp to enforce their own rules.if you want to see a macro mission runner, head to ingunn, where the pirates destroy hundreds of autopilot couriers a day. every single day. there are litteraly hundreds of shuttles or industrials streaming into and out of the stations in the system 23/7, even after being blown up. they all are in npc corps, random names, never respond to chats or player action. you explode them, they dock, get into a new ship, and resume course. usually their pod finishes the script first, which is funny to watch.but again, my main concern here is why ccp isnt dealing with petitions."
1/7/2009,"that there is a prof there human controled and not scripts m8 i understand ure frustation ...beleave me ive been there...and had to deal whit macro miners alot...but im teling u from expierience in servers and macro(server admin on a web based game) ....the server simply can not tell the diference in actions...they move,act exacly like a person would...only diference is they do stupid stuff like try to haul whit there pod...but that alown can not prove of a macro...so ccp can not ban someone just for that...even if u report it...basicly and realisticly speeking macro miners can not be banned(because there is know way for the server to know if someone is using a macro or not)...but furder up the chain when isk are involved it is a nother matter...and that is why those guys get banned...that is what i was tring to explain...ccp cant ban miners even if they want to...even if u petition them...for lack of proof...but petitions will help them get a new chain on investigation...and ban the end linksso even if u dont see the actual persons that u petitioned beeing banned...there will be someone furder up the isk chain being banned...and i know that because as any company ccp wants to make $...and making $ meens making happy players...but i do agree some changes in there company-client relations need to improveonly way to actualy detect of a macro is to implement a safe in the client itself...that would delog/report to server if a keyboard/mouse mover(aka macro) is detected...but then u can get in a hole new range of problems because of all the diferent programs used and also because of privacy policy."
1/7/2009,"i didnt mean its that simple. the bot has to be started by a human at some point and has to be supervised at some point. but if you sit there and watch, you can tell its mechanical precision, not human. ccp has so much more data to tell whats going on also, and all we are asking is that they prove to us that they are listening to our concerns, and explain why they are not acting upon them."
1/7/2009,"okay, here's what ccp needs to do:once per month there should be a report showinga) number of petitions issued by field on bannable offenses.b) number of accounts banned by field on such offenses.no naming and shaming, just a report.ex:petition - macro use: 3000banned accounts by petition: 2"
1/7/2009,"it would be nice if they stayed a little longer on the screen then for that. other than that since the pictures remind me of instant messenger interfaces where you can click login announcements to initiate a conversation, so it would make sense they were made interactable."

1/7/2009,"except for the sin, the parent hull ""changes"" part can be ignored. i'm not really concerned about the ship model themselves they could be left the same (it just looks weird when they're missing turret points). when it comes to offensive ship design, the widow is already a kaalakiota developed raven hull. the panther is already a boundless creation developed tempest hull. and of course the redeemer is already a viziam developed armageddon. this is apparent from the bonuses given from the racial battleship skill as well as the number of weapon hard points. each of them, (except for the sin) has 1 less weapon hardpoint than it's true parent hull and dual weapon bonuses.however when it came to fittings, the developers suddenly remembered that they had to be based on the tier 1 battleship and that's when things got mucked up. they applied the same -1 low, +1 mid formula to each tier 1 battleship, additionally they removed an extra highslot from the widow in favor of another mid. the sin was given an extra high slot to give it the same number of slots as the rest, but for some reason it cost them a turret hardpoint (sin should be 5 turrets based on the domi's 6). this doesn't matter that much since it's fittings come from the dominix hull so it lacks the grid to fit a 5th turret anyway.the blackops skill bonuses are just weird. the widow was given an ecm bonus as a throwback to it allegedly being based on the scorpion, the sin and panther got agility/speed bonuses, and the redeemer lucked out since it atleast got a 3rd turret bonus (although tracking is completely out of left field, typically the 3rd bonus for viziam is 5% damage or 10% optimal per level, but understandably that would have been too powerful)the changes i suggested were to correct the ships since half of their design is based on the hull i suggested anyway, they just need a more reasonable slot layout and fittings to actually take advantage of it. so, with the sin being the exception, you can just move the slots around, change the first blackops bonus (agility/speed, would love to change the ecm bonus but people would scream nerf) and boost their fittings and still call them t2 phoons or t2 scorps all you like (though everyone should know that they actually aren't).however, even if you made those changes, the sin will still lag behind the rest. the problem with the sin is that drones do not work for the style of play that blackops are designed for. drones take time to deploy, to be given orders, not to mention the time it takes to actually travel into range and begin attacking. most of this is just ui lag but it results in 5-10 seconds before the drones respond. the only instant damage available from drones comes from sentries which a: still lag due to the previous sentence and b: do not travel, which severely limits the sin's options (or results in leaving drones behind).the dominix is a drone ship and it's 3rd bonus would most likely be another drone bonus in line with the creodron line of ships, which again doesn't actually help. if needs to be a megathron instead."
1/7/2009,the black op is a t2 support ship.. not a tier 2 pvp battleship! its subpar pvp fitting and skills should reflect this.. why must you all try and make every new ship class into the new wtfpwnmobile.that's what tier three ships are for :d

1/7/2009,agreed.
1/7/2009,really?...its a bit uh star trek voyager :p
1/7/2009,sounds like an funny idea.
1/7/2009,would realy like to see this in a form...not necesaraly the one u describe but dekoys could be great...
1/7/2009,"thats subjective, and easily can be argued over for weeks on end.pointless argument..."
1/7/2009,"i heard back in the day ccp had all missiles do splash damage ie area effect damage to multiple targets. for what ever reason... after time ccp took the splash damage out.short explanation of the problem ....the problem i think that is plaguing missiles is ccp left this ""explosion velocity"" in the equation and they still do area of effect damage, but to only 1 target. this is not very effective way of dealing damage and not very realistic at all. it has plagued ccp own attempts to balance them with other weapon types as well.fix?....missiles need to enter the new century.. err go back to the 21st? most of the standard missile in the world today have shaped charges. this directs damage and decreases the area of effect. all damage is dealt in a cone shaped area upon impact, no splash damage at all is given. this should help missiles behave more realistic. it will also make tweaking the missile speed and damage for ccp in the future much less of a problem and more straight forward. if the missile can catch the target it should do its damage regardless of the size or speed. similar to turrets, if the turret can track the target to a degree it will do good damage even critical hit damage types.balance?....if these changes means missile damage, range, and most of all speed needs to be tweaked then so be it.. i totally give them the green light to do any balancing they think is necessary to keep missiles inline with other damage types.other problems possibly fixed?....if ccp nerfed splash damage then it should revert to the other obvious missile format that does not take explosion velocity into account, the shaped charge. this will remove several odd and unfair effects we have now that have plagued balancing.target painting - is suppose to make it easier for turrets to tract a target.. this has very weird effect of physically making the target bigger so they fill more of the explosion radius and thus takes more damage?damage vrs class - when ever there is a miss match turrets always do better damage... a cruise missile will never hit a cruiser (most common hull size for pvp) for full damage even if it is stopped. where, large turret ships when firing on the same stopped ship will get bonus critical damage hits. when the smae target is moving, the missile damage is reduced a huge amount compared to turrets. turrets still tend to do damage good damage beyond a point that missiles are hitting for single digits.please post support and constructive responses, people who want to rant or troll can go else where."
1/7/2009,"i can see this bringing defender missiles back into play.also i can see the speed, range, damage, and hp will need to be tweaked.heavy/long range missiles would need to slow down but increase fight time and hp boost to prevent them being used on smaller ships or just being smart bombed away.some medium class missiles might need a damage reduction as you can't slow them down or they wont hit the correct class ships that have speed mods fitted.hit points of most of the smaller missiles might need a reduction or a reduction of their rate of fire to make defenders more useful against them.just like in large turret ships that receive critical hit levels of damage against webbed targets.. when the target is webbed and larger missiles can hit the target they should melt under the damage. not just be totally nerfed because the ship is small."
1/7/2009,nice idea.
1/7/2009,"yeah, go for it, but at the same time we should lose optimal range for guns...this is vacuum we're talking after all, so bullets shouldn't slow down once they get out of the gun.so as long as you can lock and track your target you should be able to hit it.../sarcasm off"
1/7/2009,"i am sure the optimal range has nothing to do with the projectiles ability to reach the target.. it has more to do with targeting computer's accuracy to a set point. your ammo doesn't have built in tracking computers does it? its kinda the benefit to missiles.. missiles self track after they leave the tube. so, as long as it has enough propellant and speed to reach the target they always will. like i said i would be willing to see balancing done to the missiles that doesn't turn every missile boat into a wtfbbq machine."
1/7/2009,"balance issue - ship mod, energy grid rigs; lacks a drawbackhello,the majority of the ship modification modules have drawbacks.for example...armor rigs, have speed drawbacksshield rigs, have sig radius drawbacksenergy weapon rigs, have cpu drawbacksastronautic rigs, have armor hp drawbacksmissile launcher rigs, have cpu drawbackshybrid weapon rigs, have cpu drawbacksprojectile weapon rigs, have power grid drawbacksdrone rigs, have cpu drawbackselectronics superiority rigs, have a shield hp drawbackhowever ...electronics rigs, lack a drawbackenergy grid rigs, lack a drawbackwhy do these have it special?"

1/7/2009,you forgot your support thumband yes.... when going 1vs1 (sadly more and more of this is gettting phased out by nerfs) nothing says thank god i finished that skill to 5 instead of lvl 4 like winning a fight at sub 10% hull left on my shipreal men do structure tank. those that fit a dcu newayz ;-p
1/7/2009,"although everyone fits a damage control, overheating is only a bonus/edge for those who train for it."
1/7/2009,"i would go along with that idea if overheating it effected only shield and armor resists, but did not effect hull resist"
1/7/2009,"hull tanking should be brought back as a viable method of tanking (after all, gallente were originally designed to be hull tankers).primarily, reduce the cycle time of hull reppers to bring them into accord with armor & shield systems (they take a mid slot, remember, forcing some thought to be put into outfit).you can overheat invulns & armor harders, so why not overheat your dc? +15% effect (not 'total, but 'effect') won't be terribly much, but it might swing the tide of your living or dying."
1/7/2009,"the reason that's bad (hull tanking boost) is cause it benefits battleships and cap ships much more than anything else.even a 15% increase to hull tank is 60% -> 69%, which means you reduce damage intake by nearly 25%buffer tanking is already very strong in the game and doesn't need additional boosting. too much buffer tank encourages blobbing, as it requires more firepower to kill people efficiently"

1/7/2009,i did not know npc seed drops of ai sold items in bpo format. wtb minmatar control tower bpo :doh wait... maybe there justification for that? maybe because you can't possibly move station warehouses from empire to player created outposts. but... you can do that with secure containers. on that basis i can't see them offering up the bpos.you or your corp could always jump freighter them on mass from empire and sell them yourself. heck any time the jump freighter is moving stuff he can boost his base cargo by using gcs and then shrinking warping them in courier contracts. if he did that for every trip he made... you would have an insane over quantity in a week or two.more then likely the cans were remarked by a marketing alt. you should ask around for someone willing to sell cans locally.
1/7/2009,just because you can doesn't mean you should have to.
1/7/2009,yes. there is no reason for a basic commodity item to be available only through npc sales.and make the bpos fully researchable as well. i'd like to be able to invent t2 gigantic secure containers with 15000m3 capacity.
1/7/2009,"ofg yes! seed bpos for all containers!no bpos for towers tho, plz. let's keep those as fixed commodities."
1/7/2009,"currently there is a major flaw with certain exploration signatures; most notably gravimetric.people who locate one of these, generally in empire but not uncommonly in lowsec, they have discovered that if they leave one or two rocks they can completely screw with another explorer's entire day because the gravimetric flag remains for the full 72 hours.this needs to be eliminated.fix:once discovered, the 'flag' shown by multispectral probes should be removed on short-duration sites such as radar/mag. the site itself should remain in place until the despawn trigger is met.with gravimetric (ores) and ladar (gas) the flag should be removed only once 50-80% of the material in the belt/cloud has been removed. this will put an end to the anchored gravimetric flag exploit, but leave enough behind that while the flag is still active that someone seeking them out can recoup at least a little of the prodigious time they typically put in to find it."
1/7/2009,"exploit? hardly..leaving a grav or gas cloud with only a few bits left is a vaild tactic for slowing down the competition, no different than pushing down market prices on goods for traders and manufacturers, or stripping the asteroid or belt that someone else is mining. remember eve is a pvp game, not all of it involves shooting others. not supported"

1/7/2009,"oh yes, it'd be nice to have more advanced tractoring & salvaging modules, and commensurate ships to take advantage of them (rather than bastardizing fighting ships for the job).t2 exploration vessels actually capable of taking on what you find would also be a boon (t2 tier2 battlecruisers would fill the slot perfectly). same scanning bonuses enjoyed by covert ops frigates, no weapon bonuses, no cyno generation bonuses (replace with hacking/arch bonuses or somesuch).they would have to loose the ability to warp cloaked, however, to prevent them becoming oversized covert-recons."
1/7/2009,"the key here is, everybody wants to have a salvager for mission runners, when there is the ninja salvager component to remember as well. so thus, i'm all for your little 'tractor/salvager/cargo' bonuses, but i want them on a nice, fast frigate and/or interceptor class as well."
1/7/2009,ah so we see the real reason for the request.. you want uber mods to ninja salvage :plike i said t2 isnt going to get the kinda bonus your looking for. t2 only give mild increases with a increase in fitting cost.
1/7/2009,yes please.
1/7/2009,noit will make ninja salvagers work more easy...aldow i would like to see it..its already to easy whit all gain and no risk at all

1/7/2009,"well...im not the one wining ..u are :p but anyway why u need a t2 salvager...if we are on this part why not get t2 tractor beems,t2 caps and t2 titans...answer is still no for the ovious things...u can fit as many salvagers as u want on a ship to speed up the salvage proces...there are no staking penalty or any drawback to fit a distroyer whit 8 salvagers and mwd..also the fiting recuierments are extreamly low...so its a waste of coding time..just fit more on your ship..or train up some skills...whit lvl4 i salvage a wreck in max 2 turns whit 1 salvager...so stop winingalso if u cant stand people not agreeing whit u then simply gime all ure stuff and go back to wow"

1/7/2009,"read my op and tell me where i'm whining.other missing t2 items are not the point of the thread.i do that, thanks.hmm. you don't comprehend much, do you? a destroyer is not the proper salvage vessel for the aspiring ninja salvager. a frigate or an interceptor are.ok. when they release salvaging vi, i'll get right on that. with my salvaging v, specialized salvaging implants and rigs, i'm still looking for that added improvement in speed. salvager ii modules are an obvious improvement.good for you, although i don't buy it.you're the one speaking at a fourth grade level, so either man up, or gtfo of my thread."

1/7/2009,i calls shenanigans.
1/7/2009,"i can think of lots of reasons why they wouldnt want to do it...- increase in 3rd party programs that hack / keylog- support burdon for ccp based on things not working because of 3rd party mods- huge risk of botting and macro use- removal of ""level playing field"" esp for new players or those not used to using or writing mods- ""lots of free coders"" does not mean ""lots of good coders with the same common goal"". i personally would not be a fan of a mod that would let me visit battleclinic, get a fitting and wack it straight into game with a few clicks like you can eft. perhaps the mod could even buy the items in game and fly my ship around to pick them up (tongue firmly in cheek). where's the skill in that? the api or scope for modifications would have to be carefully controlled to prevent problems.having said all of this, customising the ui would be a great plus from my point of view. its a great suggestion."
1/7/2009,"i think you're confusing open gui with macros.open gui means gui customization, or taking the same functionality that eve has right now and making it better, not automatic.automatic would be a macro script.afaik a lot of mmogs have xml based layouts, data access, and limited supported scripts.giving full access to gui layout and customization is harmless in itself. giving full access to the data that is by default already available to the player is in itself harmless.what you are worried about is automation, and that is not in any way a valid assumption when talking about open gui. you shouldn't assume ccp would provide such access like automatically buying/selling/mining/ratting. that would be the job of a macro program, which is not what an open gui is."
1/7/2009,"open gui or not, i don't care how it's done but something needs to be done because jeesus there are so many stupid things with the gui as it is"
1/7/2009,"in a case where the gui customisation is limited to window size, colour, position etc then your point is entirely valid. i also accept your example of an xml layout file to control the user interface being a fairly low risk as there will probably be no active code in there.i get the feeling, however, that users wanting to mod the gui would perhaps be after a little more than simple look-and-feel tweaking? lets suppose that ccp were to provide some kind of simple read-only access customisation access to the market area or even the chat window of the game. perhaps to allow users to write a mod that would allow them to write click on a player in chat or an item in the market and add a custom option like ""add to my wish list"" or ""search for player info online"", something like that.example exploit: a mod could conceivably be written that reads and monitors the user list in the ""local"" chat and compares this against pirate kill boards or battleclinic. if a ""high risk"" player or ""pirate"" enters local then the user is instantly notified. this would provide an unfair advantage. ok, its not a macro in the conventional definition but an exploit?i appricate that i am picking a rich example here but i think that my point is valid that providing access for customisation presents a potential risk of exploit."
1/7/2009,"in that case you could simply not provide read access to local chat, while still allowing access to it, if that makes any sense.allowing a string to be assigned a value doesn't necessarily allow interpretation.you could create a protected string datatype that could accept a value you give it, but can only be accessed by friend function.so say a character enters local, you can take that anonymous character and do stuff with his image and name and alliance info and all of that, without ever being allowed to analyze the data."
1/7/2009,"that sounds fancy - lets hope the gui has vb interface so you can write to it like that :psounds like you got it covered. although if you has their ""name"" then you could do what my example said. but it was just an exameple so lets not get into that. without going any further into this (i dont think we need to?) i hope that they can produce a gui customiser while keeping things safe. :)"

1/8/2009,!
1/8/2009,"eve is a game that goes through many balancing changes for many different reasons. recently there was a large change in the mechanics of speed. in order to balance out this change the agility of ships across the entire spectrum was increased significantly. this change has had some unintended consequences. not since the original implementation of signature radius and scan resolution has there been a such a shakeup in the ability of ships to target and force another ship into combat. the nature of the shakeup is that it is now much more difficult to force targets into combat because they enter warp much faster than they did previously. especially if they are smaller than your ship.this ability is at the heart of what makes eve a pvp game. without it low-sec and empire presence is unable to seriously hamper enemy movements. empire and low-sec gate camps lose their strategic and tactical purpose. and belt production becomes even easier than it was before.this can be shown by some numbers produced by james lyrus relating to the new warp times against current lock times.the supporters of this issue are not asking for a massive change or revert of any particular change, but simply that one thing happens. that the ability to lock a target before it leaves the grid be restored to its previous values.as i see it this can happen in one of two ways without impacting the recent speed or agility changes: either, lock times can be reduced to correspond to the agility changes. or the speed at which a ship is required to be traveling before entering warp can be increased such that general ""in space"" maneuverability is unchanged, but the time it takes to warp out is increased to previous levels. changing lock times is imperfect because we're already hitting a ceiling in terms of agility on smaller ships where locking a target can become entirely dependent on latency. changing warp speed requirements is imperfect because some ships did not have their agility increased. however, whatever is chosen, something ought to be done.thank you for taking the time to consider this as important enough to raise to the developers.edit reason: spelling"

1/8/2009,"awesome idea. smaller craft need a particularly large boost (say 25-30%). even with max skills and a sensor booster, it's hard to most frigs/cruisers"
1/8/2009,you should not be able to point frigs/destroyers before they can warp away. or cruisers if they are fitted for align but you are not fitted with sensor boosters.current stats work fine.

1/8/2009,"wow someone got a valid point, oh wait there is none like in the rest of this thread"
1/8/2009,"exactly. if someone comes with a bs/bc you should be able to point him before he can warp away, because he should have scouted first. so what ships are for scouting?yeah you can say that recons and covert ops but thats a lot of skill for a new player ,so give them ability to scout and skip gate camps with frigs and destroyers. he wont be able to do anything other than warp off anyway or you could just point and kill him easily.just imagine a new player who would like to visit low-sec , with your idea he couldnt do much other than die to your boring blob gate camps, until he cant fly a covert ops ship. because most of the gates would be camped 23/7. and that would realy help moving players into low sec as it is already empty except some systems and faction war territories."

1/8/2009,"y'know, i really put quite a bit of work into my proposed colonial structures, and i am genuinely wondering if my structures would be a good way to go about colonizing a planet. i would really like it if someone would pick apart the numbers, prices and quantities, and give me some feedback in regards to these structures, with possible revisions. like i said in the first post, making the planetary warehouse raidable is not a bad idea, although there should be 2 areas of the planetary warehouse: shipping, and recieving. recieving is where supplies are dropped off from off-planet, and shipping is where the products created by the colony are stored. shipping should be raidable, recieving not. this allows raiders to steal export supplies, and not allow the mass starvation of a planet due to a few raiders stealing. if you want access to both, pony up the marines and take over the place."
1/8/2009,"another idea a rl friend brought up would be the addition of slaves for a colony. there would be a few differences in how they work however.1) they do not have a monetary daily wage, unlike colonists (they are slaves after all)2) they only produce half of what a colonist does.3) they require twice the police presense to keep loyal.this should make slaves a viable option for a planetary colony. however, you would still want regular colonists in the more vital industries such as essential services, power production, and medical. slaves would be useful in pos fuel plants, and mining operations. this would be especially true if you want to cut labor costs at the expense of a lower production rate.since slaves are contraband in certain empire regions, there may be an added risk in transporting them to your colony, however.another idea was to add military facilities to a colony. these would be stockable with colonial marines. the marines would produce nothing for the colony, not even loyalty. and they would cost as much as a colonial police unit as far as wages go. however, in case of planetary invasion, each marine will destroy 2 invading marines before being expended, with no collateral loss of colonists/slaves, making them an outstanding defensive force. another possible use of the military facility could be a bonus to defending against a planetary raid, giving the colony a 10% chance per facility (max 50%) to resist a raid attempt, provided that any raiders must wait one day before attempting another raid. this makes a planetary raid an unsure thing if the owners decide to spend the isk to make their colonies resistant to theft."
1/8/2009,"i do not see any problems in transition from vocal target calling to target brodcasting.the correct target calling is just to what the ccp aspires and it is not necessary to refer to a lag problem if it is a question of small gangs. absolutely clearly that target broadcasting will not add the lags.has not understood polemic about two ships. if they are friendly, names are displayed in an overview. also i did not write that it is necessary to clean names at a clique on the ship. only from an overview."
1/8/2009,"already saw this idea a few times, most as a solution to break fleet focus fire :-)it has a huge negative effect because of 2 things:1. an alternate method of target calling in eve is quite clumsy (target tagging etc).2. character names are also significant because of their reputation ... a good fc shoots enemy leaders or known good pilots first if available, so he can reduce the effectivnes of the enemy fleet by as much as possible with the least effort."
1/8/2009,obviously not an alt of the op.
1/8/2009,"1.the correct and comfortable target broadcasting, gets absolute fleet focus fire.also it is necessary to solve a instapop problem.(i wrote earlier ""shipclass-target broadcasting only by squad leader + inscree squad size"")2.it is right, when the enemy fleet receives the major tactical information about ommand of your fleet, by default, without any investigation?"
1/8/2009,"i agree. possible to adapt, but it is not correct."

1/8/2009,sounds like a good idea to me. will put it on agenda on one of the meetings... together with the align to one.
1/8/2009,i'm sure if you thought about it for a bit you could figure out all kinds of drawbacks that would be fair.
1/8/2009,the balance issues are mainly with these two rigs signal disruption amplifier and egress port maximizer that are both race specific ew rigs and belong in the category - electronic superiority rigs.missplacement of rigs is not exclusive to those two - this thread shows another obvious missplacement./supporting the issue of placement of sertain rigs to be readressed.
1/8/2009,"so you created a repeating system that actuayl does not improve anything :-)anyway i have to say i did not quite get the mechanics detail. in what way will the meta level scale down ?example we start with a t3 print, then it is researched to a t4 print and gets new bonuses. then the limit is reached and this t4 print is scaled down again to t3. will it lose the additional bonuses it had as a t4 ? will the item produced from it stay t4 or also shift down to t3 ?if that's what you want to implement then you implemented technological regres and not progres. or better said, you imposed a maintenance cost on the top of technology line."
1/8/2009,"yes that is basically what happens. when the quota for top tech items has been produced, the next one that is produced bumps all tech items above tech 2 down one tech level. so tech 3 blueprints would become tech 2 blueprints.there absolutely is a ""maintenance cost"" on the top of the technology line. but a ""maintenance cost"" is no more special than any other cost when you're in more or less constant production. it really comes down to a very basic concept that is absent in eve.in eve, pretty much all commonly used goods have high variation in who controls supply. the manner in which production happens means that no entity can achieve a production advantage against their enemies. when tech 2 was first introduced, an entity could corner a market on tech 2 items and then that advantage could be passed on to its members.that is what i want to recreate here. but without the downsides. the downsides in the original t2 implementation was that any time someone accumulated that advantage it would never go away. there was nothing your enemy could do to knock that advantage out of your hands. it created mega empires which had entrenched advantages that no one could shake.with this regression system you can have your cake and eat it too. you can have a situation where a production base researching can give you or your organization unique advantages over an enemy, but you also have a situation where keeping that advantage is going to be very difficult as everyone fights for the top spot.(and more fighting for the top spot in any specific area is going to open up more profitable areas in other modules as it reduces the ""maintenance costs"" of doing that research by extending the time between when the bpos are knocked down a peg)i.e. its a way to simulate research advantage without all the problems that a real research advantage would create for eve in terms of database use or player dynamics.if you're worried about a ""maintenance cost"" then you can always have a ""buy back"" for the tech 2 bpo's implemented. since t2 bpos are going to be an end product (and are likely to be created without hindering your ability to continue research) you could have npc buy orders which would recoup some of the ""maintenance costs"" of researching new items"
1/8/2009,"the basic concept absent from eve is material atrition ... the items do not lose quality unless destroyed completely, you can repair anything no matter how damaged to 100%.also speaking about player alliance production, the largest issue is the non-localised production system.if you want to hit the enemy on his production lines, there is actualy only one option - kill his miners. however that still has a minor impact as 90% of 0.0 equipment is either empire or lowsec import.what you want to do is to put an export regulation on empire produced goods. some ship classes/modules once built in empire are not allowed to leave empire borders (or at least not in packaged form). this would force some localised production in 0.0 which creates targets of war. or the supply lines from empire would get very inefficient and thus slow the import. violation of the export regulation would set you to -4.5 standing towards the empire navy.i would suggest you word your proposal more accurately and not disguise it as some form of technological progres, as it is actualy very far from that.i cannot support this idea in the current form."
1/8/2009,"wait, you can't support it because of some wording? what wording specifically?(i mean, hell, i mention ""regression"" pretty explicitly)this is not true at all. an export regulation is ridiculous and does not have the desired effect. the idea is to have advantages via production and not simply add vulnerabilities into production. even if you made it so no empire produced items could leave it would not affect any ability of one entity to have a production advantage over another. all it would do is (aside from flatly end the ability of new players to enter 0.0) give players the ability to physically attack infrastructure.that is not anything to do with the proposal, which is a big picture goal to make production advantages real and exploitable.it has nothing to do with 0.0 production being unassailable. i don't know how in the world you read anything like that into it."
1/8/2009,"you said something about mega empires that could not be moved ... maybe i misunderstood :-)anyway ... there are 3 things in your proposal that are wrong:1. there is no actual technological progress2. the system is more based on regression, your best bet to best your enemy is to actualy regress the top most line by overbuilding/overresearching3. item degradation introduced that the actual owner has no impact onthis means you actualy do not improve the situation but only add significant resource overhead.the practical impacts of the above points are:you have a short term advantage but once the next regression round happens, it is gone for good. unreliable item value. once the next regression round happens, your items devaluate significantly while the input materials do not. if you do not introduce item regression, one can simply build for a large supply, which invalidates the proposal a bit. with item regression, actual value of above t2 items is highly volatile (not to speak about usability as your ship stats may change from one moment to the next). i guess your proposal has no practical value based on the above."
1/8/2009,"1. you can't make ""actual technological progress"". there is no system which will not either break the game or break the servers. 2. actually there are a number of ways.a: expend effort to control the means of research production to reduce the ability of the enemy to continue researchingb: over researchingboth of these will not be easy. the first because controlling the inputs to production when the inputs are spread out is difficult. the second because over-researching reduces the amount of research inputs are available to research the rest of the stuff. gaining and holding a specific instance and locking your enemies out might be reasonable, but you're going to extend the time that anyone else has to research other goods.3. three is quite funny combined with 1. since they complain about mutually inclusive things. yes, your items might get worse if that method is decided upon. no, that will not be a problem since its just another way of gaining an advantage over someone else. its like complaining that you got blobbed and that it was unfair the other guy had better battleships. everyone's items will go down in value except the people who made the breakthrough to get the advantage.yes, short term advantages are the entire idea. and once the regression round happens its not gone for good, its just simply not as strong until you research and start your production again.if you do not implement item regression then you can indeed ""stockpile"" items. but if the usage of the items is properly balanced(i.e. produced at such a rate that sink and faucet are about even or faucet is smaller than sink) against supply you will not gain any benefit from doing so. and if the usage of the items is not properly balanced holding onto them stockpiling will reduce your profits.item value is not that volatile. it will be very easy to track for those people who know what to look for for when regression is bound to happen, and minimum regression times will be present in the system(i.e. after the last, no regression can occur until a set amount of time due to how fast research occurs)"
1/8/2009,"you cannot do a unless you buy out all the lab slots in empire, similarly you can do b to a limited extend (need to specialise on a given type of items). so b is the better option.item value will be very volatile, since you cannot rely on the item being the same and performing the same. would you buy a t2 gun over the best named version if you knew that after some time your investment will have lower functionality and thus lower value ?"
1/8/2009,"you can do a without buying out lab slots. as per the op. research requires an input item. control the input item(or enough of it) and you can control the research. the distribution method of the input item is up in the air.item value will not be volatile. volatile means it ""changes a lot unpredictably"". but if you know when(or close enough to when) and how its going to devalue then there is very little change in its value.e.g. would you buy a car if you knew that once it rolled off the lot it was worth half as much? of course you would, people do it all the time. would you buy a t2 item if you knew it was going to become a best named item within 2 weeks, but at least not for a week? certainly you would. especially if you planned on using it for a week.and of course there is the end issue that there is a stipulation that the differences between the items be made small(e.g. overloading bonuses for secondary attributes)"
1/8/2009,"this is probably crazy, but the thought just occurred to me. don't do this with tech 1-5, do this with meta 0-4. the modules already exist, the idea of having an arbalest blueprint isn't that crazy, and the balancing is easy. it also lets us remove minerals sourced from missions cleanly. this would have a huge economic impact, of course, and it'd have to be evaluated in that context, but it's an alternative you might want to consider.as for the proposal itself, fascinating, but it feels like a bad idea to me. t2 is well-established, and messing with it yet again, especially by providing a near-unlimited number of bpos, seems like a bad plan in many ways."
1/8/2009,"you can do it with meta 1-4, but i used t2 because there are some ulterior goals here revolving around the skill requirements of pilots. i think we have gotten away from the old balance where there was only a little advantage that could be gleaned from specialization to a point where specialization is required to be effective in a field. rather than say ""you have to spend tonnes of money and still not be very effective until you have finished training the full t2 mod set"" fitting advantages would go back to being money and supply issues.in the end, with meta 1-4, there just isn't enough need of new supply except maybe in a very very few instances. you couldn't make any money out of this type of system on meta 1-4 modules. standard invention prices have t2 as cheaper and better(or just as good) for nearly all modules in the game. as well, meta 4 items confer no current ""special advantage"" for a group to exploit, so that side of the game, research for combat advantage, simply doesn't work."

1/8/2009,"photon scattering field ii bpo - 100 runs at a time.invented bpc - 10 runs at a timethose numbers right there should tell you something is wrong.also, why the % chance to invent a item? just wastes lab time."
1/8/2009,"the difference is, bpos are worth some hundreds of times as much as bpcs. they ought to be better, i'd imagine. costing 20-70% more materials and requiring an invention process is not unreasonable. also, you fail to note that you can run 10 bpcs at once but only one bpo - there's a reason invention was brought in, and that was because it's a much higher-capacity production system than bpos. an inventor can actually make more money on many items than a bpo owner, unless said bpo owner has invested several billion - sometimes several tens of billions if the items are especially good - in owning a large number of bpos. the system is fine."
1/8/2009,"meh? i've got nothing against griefing, but implementing new items, and presumably a lot of them, for the sole purpose of griefing is a bit much. there are better ways of doing this - decoy ships, for example, would have real tactical utility."
1/8/2009,"i believe she was making a joke.i've lost count of the number of times i've been scanned, and shot at, while flying through empire even when i'm warping to zero. luckily none of those attempted suicides has proved successful (i fit a tank, not for max cargo, and have always survived).i'd be more than willing to carry around a bunch of space hogging cardboard fakes just for the lol factor of watching the attackers waste their effort on nothing but a bunch of pulpwood. though i currently lol when they go pop and i don't."

1/8/2009,sorry but jesus op where are you getting this funky ideas from?please do what this man said..
1/8/2009,"that's why i included this sentence, which must've been missed:this would be an optional way to enhance the yield of lasers. your afk mining ops could continue on without harm. this idea would only give people a reason to be at the keyboard, if they wished to be, and make the activity more interesting as well."
1/8/2009,"while i appreciate the sentiment behind the idea, the idea itself is utterly horrible. no, no and no. if ever there will be micromanagement during mining, it better be in a sensible, non-annoying way. this is not it."

1/8/2009,i'm not so sure this is good...containers tends to be cheap as it is.... if we start manufacturing them like crazy... prices could skyrocket.i'm gonna sit back and watch this one for a bit.
1/8/2009,"what?the value of transporting control towers and containers is drastically different.large control tower: 360m isk / 8000 m3 = 45,000 isk per m3gsc: 275k isk / 3000 m3 = 91.6 isk per m3trit: 4.15 isk / 0.01 m3 = 415 isk per m3it is roughly 3 times more efficient to import freighters full of uncompressed tritanium than gscs, and almost 500 times more efficient to transport control towers. in addition, a jump freighter with maxed skills can only haul about 120 gscs per run; that's only 33m isk, which is less than fuel would cost for the trip.freighters cannot transport unpackaged gscs. this is well-known, and it makes obvious that you don't know much about how empire-to-0.0 logistics works.due to the mentioned poor isk/m3 ratio, almost everybody importing containers adds a heavy markup.either i'm missing something important about this post, or you're fundamentally confused about how markets work. additional supply does not cause higher prices."

1/8/2009,stats in eve = no added value
1/8/2009,"the problem is that the amount of veld/trit in nulsec is insufficient for heavy industry unless you mine out every system in a large radius. importation is a must for modern alliances to maintain their capital and battleship fleets. increasing the potency/availability of lowends in nulsec would not only add value to the currently crap areas where you currently don't get any better then hed/hemo, but would also make it economically feasible to mine locally without requiring trit to spike to 6 isk/unit--trit is already way out of balance with the other minerals.its not a simple market issue. its a nulsec/lowsec/empire value issue coupled with a volume problem."

1/9/2009,"my eyes glazed over reading the post you linked(seriously, that guy makes me look laconic), but from your summary, this looks like one of the best general mining overhauls i've seen to date. this isn't 2003, inter-region mineral movement is really easy, and thus there's no reason to keep regional mineral types. all mineral types everywhere at varying concentrations, and mining crystals let you pick and choose what to mine more of. you don't even really need varying grades, you just need varying concentrations - if a highsec roid only has 1% arkonor, you're not going to get all that much out of it, no matter how much it's worth on paper. and it makes mining scanners useful, which is also a plus. in sum: i like."

1/9/2009,"why would we be spoiled children if we tell them, this is something we want even thou it will be hard. also i read the minutes it went basically funny pos thing: too hard ok clarify ""its too hard"" what? why? if you aren't going to give us an answer that satisfies the customer then the customer has the right to ask for clarification. or the customer can say, i know it will be hard but do it anyways. neither of these things make you children, a child accepts the answer ""because i said so"" an adult doesn't.what you are saying is if ccp says no, we should roll over and never question it. what kind of adult relationship is that. grow a backbone and do what the csm was set up to do. represent the player base."
1/9/2009,"i agree with last post completely. ""this is just too hard"" should not be in ccp's vocabulary. also, for a csm, there should be no conflict of interest of trying to appeal to ccp. you are supposed to appeal to us. you represent us. the players. we are not spoiled children (most of the eve player base anyway). we pay for this game. if that does not disqualify us for being spoiled i don't know what will."

""i'm better than you"" continues to not be evidence. so lets do math, because i like math and it gives us a better ballpark. the only figure i'm going to take in account is bounties. you made 150 mil in 6 hours is your claim. which is 25m/h in bounties. this is a bit highball for what i get in feyth/estoria but most of the regions you listed are npc 0.0 so they behave like -1.0 truesec. the biggest question is if you used another account to haul the items around and clean belts as you ratted for this would save you a lot of time. because you have ratted recently getting a screenshot of an hours worth of ratting wouldnt be hard would it? although i can extrapolate from the approximations of how much you make per hour when we look at fountain ratting. if you make 75m/h in delve/stain/curse and only 56mil/h in fountain if we divide by 3 we get ~18.7m/h off bounties which seems reasonable for a well setup system.lets put it a different way:9% of eve's characters are in 0.0, 0.0 feels empty.how does yaay encourage people to venture in 0.0 for more fights?fighting takes time, time is isk. how can 0.0 support the individual pilot over time (i include pvp time) better than empire?i think the reward has to be worth it that empire corperations would be willing to fight or slip by gatecamps to get out into 0.0 for isk making operations. not just to stay in 0.0 but to venture out in it from empire. i don't think that venture is worth it in the games current state, unless your corp has a presence in 0.0."
1/9/2009,nothing more to say then yes please.
1/9/2009,"i know hardly any alliance or even if there is one that has died in the past year due to financial ruin and an inability to muster ships for fights.i make less in fountain because of the lack of nearby stations whether npc or alliance owned where i rat. the salvage is also slightly less valuable because honestly, the drone rigs are worthless. for any 0.0 entity, that issue is or should be a non issue. 25 mil an hr for rat spawns is an average day for anybody with a clue, properly chained systems reward upwards of 40 mil an hour per 1 person they can hold. typically 8-10 belts sustain 1 person who's not totally emo selfish. i ratted in a system with multiple people, so those numbers declined down to what probably was around 25 an hr.looting in a sac requires all of 2 seconds since it's a close range ship that maximizes it's damage on npcs the closer it gets.... defenders have no effect inside of 5km. i've also never claimed to loot everything when solo, only those things of value, although when i do run 2 accounts, i tend to bounty farm even faster, and make more from all the loot. salvaging has the same luxury of being in range already with that ship. t2 bs are just naturally ranged well and can salvage/tractor/loot better while dealing more damage, hense that comment about their profitability.per 1 salvage on the proper targets, i typically make about 800k. in stain it's more like 1.2 mil. in fountian it's more like 4-500k. good salvaging skills speed up the process considerably.another consideration of 0.0 is salvaging fight wrecks, which tend to pay out enormously and which 99% of 0.0 people ignore. in 1 fight against the monkeys, i salvaged about 140 million. and most of the wrecks were either lost to time or other people. granted, you have to actually win a fight to even get to that point... god forbid. where in empire can you do those sorts of things, and in timely fashion. a considerable collection of agent missions take more than a 15 minute window which 0.0 ratting allows. empire lacks moons, legit loot, faction spawns, commercial value, renters, and a considerable number of other valuse that 0.0 already holds. 0.0 does not need a boost, although empire does need a nerf.that said, if the devs ever, for any reason, actually listen to the general consent on insurance failures, i'll be all for a more profitable 0.0, as the rewards will start to match the risk more appropriately."

1/9/2009,"what about not having a queue, but instead having a back-up skill, or secondary skill that you can assign that trains should the first finish?esentially, you can easily burn off those small skills, albeit one at a time, without worrying about getting up at 0300hrs to set a skill. then again at 0328hrs. you then only have to worry about having at least 8-9hrs skills laying about. as it stands, i sometimes have to remote desktop my pc from work to set small skills to burn off, which can be a pain in the ass. a little queue would go a long way!"
1/9/2009,if you want to create a skill train tree till the end of time then never bother with skills again i don't see a problem as long as its only 1 character per account and it only trains while the account is active. but it would require some sort of area on the website for you to import your skill list.some people have mentioned using the new certificates system as built in skill tree training.. but why not go as far as ship train trees. some may be wanting to train to fly a raven. it would automatically train all the recommended certifications for that ship.
1/9/2009,i'd say a 24 hour skill queue is more than enough.edit: forgot to check support.

1/9/2009,while i dont trust the #s presented... i thought the boost to agility in qr was crazy. didn't make sense. you can no doubt find my post in gamedev on it.they should have decreased agility of battleships and such. not increase. such that they have harder time to get away.raven 50km from 0km warp in of belt. the interceptor pre-qr would tackle in say 10 seconds. post qr the interceptor would take say 12-15 seconds. thusly agility has to be adjusted to increase warp away 2-5 seconds. or whatever #s are right. post #10. i made this very point months ago.

1/9/2009,scrap the mission and replace with something better thought out ...

1/9/2009,talking to a lot of friends in the industrial side of eve. most of us think its kinda silly you can manage 100's of sales orders but can only handle 11 research or manufacturing jobs at a time. how about a new level skill for both:expert mass production - rank ? (adds ? slots per level)expert laboratory operation - rank ? (adds ? slots per level)wont eliminate crap alt building/researching accounts but would ease the burden on folks in this worldwide financial crisis....

1/9/2009,"apart ftom the price difference is there much point to the covetor.it takes pretty much the same amount of time to train for a hulk, so if they have the isk people will go strait for the hulk, which as most people have a second toon then they probably will.i think that the training time for a covetor should be reduced so that they are more of a stepping stone then just something for people with no isk.even just reducing the astro lv5 skill to a lv4 would be good enough.p.s i already have a hulk"
1/9/2009,"the covetor's skill requirement was set up when exhumers didn't exist, and it was fine in the era when they cost half a billion. nowadays, it's a bit of a joke. either give the covetor an advantage over the hulk(probably a bad idea), or drop the skill reqs a bit. like you say, astrogeology 4 is probably about right."

1/9/2009,this seems like a good idea!
1/9/2009,"align to was designed specifically not to be for bookmarks... because of the role play factor of ""aligning to is only for celestial bodies""or something like that. honestly though? who does it hurt by leaving it like this? pvpers? who benefits? carebears?i do believe i would like to hear why they have to side with rpers rather then the greater good."
1/9/2009,.
1/9/2009,supporting this.
1/9/2009,oh certainly.
1/9/2009,"i find that when mining it is hard to maximise you yeild when mining ore, the main problem is trying to remember which mining laser is on which rock, the other is the mining run meter. i will first say that it has been mentioned within the corp i am part of that other games and even military hardware give you the ability to see which weapon is focuseed on wich target, to solve this i propose a numbering sytem that would also apply to the pvp weapons, if you have two laser each on a different roid and each roid with different amounts in it, eventually the lasers will switch positions several time from left to right or right to left. if each slot had a number and each icon on the target had a corresponding number this problem could be solved. my second suggestion is a trickle rate for ore coming into the hold. if you had the ore coming in one unti at a time but the asteroid amounts remaining the same you would be able to mine more efficiently as well as ensuring that there is little afk mining. the only change will be that you can see how much has been mined and turn off your lasers sooner. or have a mining list where you would lock onto two or three asteroids set your lasers mining and then when the roid was empty they would move to the next, for this it would only reqquire you to click the laser button just before the run had finished to confirm you are there and not afk mining if the button is not clicked then they will stop.i would appreciate any comments and thoughts about this matter and accept all critisisms so long as they are polite.many thanks.silverswann."
1/9/2009,"when i'm mining, i use the survey scanner and check how many is left in the asteroid, if it is less then i mine in a cycle, i check where the cycle is currently at. if i know which strip is mining which asteroid, it's not hard to decide when to stop the strips :) so i don't think it is necessary to show the amount you mined, but it would be really nice to see which strip is mining which asteroid."
1/9/2009,or you could just move the pointer to the top of the screen and turn off that particular laser on that particular asteroid.simple really.
1/9/2009,"if you remember which strip is mining which asteroid, yes, that's the case. the problem is when you mix up the strips :) it would make it a bit easier, that's all."
1/9/2009,"if you highlight the asteroid that was low you'll automatically select that one in space, plus the view changes to the direction of the rock itself as well.i've not had any problem with this issue and it doesn't really need numbers on the icons either."
1/9/2009,"/signedi think unlimited is a little overboard, i think a 24 hour queue fits very well."
1/9/2009,"and that's bad, how?oh, yeah, care bears, something about high sec being completely safe, yadda yadda...newsflash: people dec and ransom people anyway - constantly. having this feature would make it less painful for both parties. and nothing is preventing victims from hiding in station and waiting out the week if they don't want to pay - something that won't change, ever. (unless ambulation allows us to carry crowbars in station...)maybe i should clarify: by ""war goes on as usual"" i meant under the current mechanics - as in one week length of war, which must be renewed or it will expire."
1/9/2009,"i think this is the start of a good idea, as it is there is no gaurentee that the corp won't turn around and start a new war dec but if this fuction was used along with the meet up you could then introduce a cntract term of say two months or more in which they can not be war decced again. by that corp or that ceo should he decide to disolve his corp create a new one and then try again."
1/9/2009,"time ago acceleration gates were 'tweaked' to make them bigger, they are the same gates they've got all the same, but you dont have to reach the beacon to activate them. they are easier to operate now.i'd want the same process for normal stargates, this way ships will reach activation range without having to literally crash into the gate, or get caught inside and make the screen and ship 'go nuts' while jumping.no more bumping stargates, i know freighters will lose their ability to reach 1km/s during normal gameplay but i think its for the best.now, this by itself wouldn't be much of a problem to implement, jumping manually to the gate will leave you at the same distance and autopilot jumps will behave the same.but, this little change has tactical repercussions over the honest job of gate camping.it will mean that an incoming vessel will have a chance to be more far away from the campers, and increase the area that needs to be covered to defend the gate.actual configurations of bubble deployment will have to be revised to adapt to the new size.(some people really works hard not to leave unscrammed space around gates)"
1/9/2009,"the reason they changed the radius of accel gates were that people were getting stuck. you can't get stuck on a stargate - it's not a warp, it's a jump, meaning even if you are stuck in normal space, you can still get out. as such, there's no need to change this."
1/9/2009,"if you take into account the enormous effort ccp has made to date to make the graphics of the game, i think that yes there is, bumping into gates and getting stuck in them is not a nice sight, at the current exchange rate of bumping, stargates should already be out of their place long ago.i understand what you say about jumping, but what if im in a freighter, stuck at a gate, and i warped to it by mistake? what? 5 minutes of trying to get out, 2 or 3 more to realign to the real destination?"
1/9/2009,"description: some character spends hours just hanging cloaked somewhere in system with no visual actions (seeding probes etc). player leaves this char unattended every day for hours, this happens in low sec system. this was acceptable if there was something in action, but this is just a harassment, that can be considered as abusement. the invisible char is invincible because of it. that makes his opponents helpless and unable to make counteractions against that actor.there must be created some instrument for cloaked chars not being so comfortable for spending hours in hostile environment. users should be given a chance to defend themselves. let that instrument not be quick and smooth. let it be hard to detect, but give it a 1% of success, it is better than 0% at all."
1/9/2009,"why do you need to defend youself against someone who you say isn't doing anything?how is someone who isn't doing anything to you harrassing you?get a grip, put your big-boy pants on and get over it. if the invisible, inactive person scares you that much - leave the system. it's a big galaxy and you can go to safe space if you are nervous. no support."
1/9/2009,"the same thing i told to gm, but he insisted me to post that here as a ""good idea"".i dont like being blamed for ""carebear whining"", but gm is an authority.his unprediction harasses. noone knows what happens in the next sec. he can probe you in any sec and throw a gang on your head.and the invincibilty of cloaked harsses. this is an exactly the abusement of the feature. any action can have counteractions to be balanced. only cloakers are ubers in that option. nothing can be opposed them.for sure, we all have big-boy pants and can easily give **** on him, but give us a chance find him. after one hour, two hours of scanning, but there should be a chance to get cloaker."
1/9/2009,"in-game harassment is legit in this game. i agree a cloak change of some description is probably a good idea, but the above poster had a pretty good suggestion for you."
1/9/2009,"not really, no. the cloaking mechanics are still a very large problem in that they allow an individual to project power without being at his computer or incurring any cost or risk to himself.the reason that they can do so is because everyone else cannot simply treat the cloaked individual as if they are not there. they have no way of determining that. they have no way of determining if they will come back, or when they will come back.because of that, they must treat them as if they are actively hunting at all times or they are going to be taking inordinate amounts of risk.the big irony here is that the guy who want to sit in space with no assets at risk away from his computer for long periods of time in a position that requires every other person in space to assume they are active and modify their behavior accordingly is not the one being called a carebear and derided for not being ""man enough to deal with it""."
1/9/2009,remove local and the problem is solved.
1/9/2009,agreed. then everyone could stress out equally; or not stress out equally - whichever they prefer.
1/9/2009,"it's called mind warfare.... get it?""works as intended""removing local while may be a good idea could actually make things rather difficult in the terms of intelligence... you'll throw a fit about cloaks even then....count on it."
1/9/2009,except people who were cloaked of course... their stress level would be more or less unchanged.removing local is a monumentally stupid idea
1/9/2009,that is the reason of the icon. but there aren't plenty of guys screaming for a removal of local? at least they would be happy.
1/9/2009,i think system scanners should find cloaking ships. yes these are sov modules that wont help those in low sec. but this forces the cloaker to stay active and stay moving. he cant just move in one direction afk because repeat scans would reveal the direction he is moving and players can just mwd gangs in that direction and decloak him.as for low sec meh you don't control the space so no cool decloakie sov mod for you :p maybe a limited au chance based probe could be created that would allow the hunting of cloaked ships?this idea would only allow the capture of inactive cloakers who would be doing nothing but griefing locals witch i don't see a problem with. it would be impossible to capture an active cloaker as he would see incoming ships or see launched probes and warp to a new position.
1/9/2009,"i understand what you're saying. there are a few small, independant, groups that wander 0.0. the cloak is the only technology that makes this possible. i do not accept that by doing nothing (possibly afk eating lunch) that i would be ""griefing"" anyone. i'm just flying and living free. nerfing the cloak would further gridlock 0.0 even more than it is now. we need more freedom of movement to revitalize 0.0 - not less. this proposal would equal less freedom of movement; when so much has been lost over the last few years already. keep space free - leave a fighting chance for the ""little guy"" to move through the lands of giants."
1/9/2009,"afk? then log.. grief by sitting in a ship with a cyno for hot drops, as scout for hostile fleet, or intel gather, then you should be able to be hunted...the ideas i give would be easily counteractable just by simply changing the direction you fly every few minutes. you can still hover over hostile outpost or jump bridge or gate. everything should have a counter balance. currently there none for a cloaked ship. we propose a very limited counter that can at the least... make staying in hostile 0.0 or low sec mean you need to stay at your keyboard."
1/9/2009,"i can't accept that someone's mere presence in the same system can be considered as equal to greifing. sorry, i just can't."
1/9/2009,"you do realize how big space is, right? in the 23 hours between downtimes, a ship moving 40 km/sec(which i don't think is even possible anymore) can cover 3.312 million kilometres. that's about 0.02 au. you would need most of a year just to get out to on-board scanner range, if you were flying a pimped claw 23/7. put differently, if you'd been doing that the entire time since eve has launched in 2003, you'd have covered 44 au, which is a mid-sized warp. you'd cross a big system by sometime in the 2020s. mwds are a joke for this task."
1/9/2009,"it's things like the covops cloak and local that set eve apart from other mmos. intelligence, counter intelligence, and using ""black ops"" ships to disrupt an enemies economy just add to the already impressive depth of the game. and fyi there are ways to deal with those players. just have to be creative."
1/9/2009,up
1/9/2009,"to be quite honest, i'm not very bothered that my name starts with ""a"", but then again i'm not all that often in ""fleet pvp"" situations so i might not be the best judge of that.howeverremoving the ability to sort by the pilot name column would be enough, you don't need to remove the pilot name column altogether.of course, that would mean that the pilot name needs to go on a completely different/separate column from everything else so far (a column which would be empty for all object except piloted player ships).this does have the advantage of minimal disruption while eliminating the main grievance."

1/9/2009,"i don't see why stealth bombers can not use a covert ops cloak. i would think it would add to the list of useful functions for the stealth bomber (able to warp in cloaked, fire a salvo and warp out). right now it seems like the stealth bomber is more of a sniper or gatecamper, both roles are already filled by more effective ships."

1/9/2009,"short and simple suggestion, add the ability to sort items(*) by the volume they take up. handy when looting to find out what is hogging all your cargo space and could be left behind in favor of looting a bunch of smaller items.

1/9/2009,"support, this would be a boon in trading especially i think."
1/9/2009,"it doesn't serve a purpose any longer with all the nerfs that ruined it. i'm primarily talking about the station re-docking range increase, the undock bookmark warp, the stargate enlargements, the statis webifier nerf, but there are others too (logoff).empire is like a seperate safe pve shard already."
1/9/2009,"posts like this are impressive in some ways. pvpers claim to be the ones who suck it up and deal with it, and yet they can be just as big of whiners as any carebear. yes, wars could use some changes. ""zomg they ruined eve, fix it!!!1!"" is not a change."
1/9/2009,"aside from guns(which certainly do require serious specializing) and ships(which i don't think you meant to include in your proposal) t2 skill requirements are pretty trivial - most can be gotten in under a day, and i can think of exactly one offhand that takes more than a week(rcu ii). also, a desire for increased specialization is natural with the gradual aging of the player base and wealth accumulation in the economy - people can fly better and afford better, so the expectation is that you'll be better. i don't see any real way to fight that. the reason why i proposed meta items is that your proposal talks about giving out bpos. you could make very good money on an arbalest heavy bpo, for example - since the module has exactly the same mineral costs as meta 0, it would actually be *very* good money. you'd have to dramatically lower the number of bpos you allow, since one can produce hundreds of modules a day when we're talking t1 build times - maybe a cap of ~10 of them in existence? - but that's tweaking. and you're right, no special advantage, just money. that said, last i checked, people liked money. besides, it's not like there will actually be exclusivity for anyone important in flying with t5 gear - you don't think every alliance going will have someone doing this stuff?and just as your proposal was as much a way of tweaking t2 skill requirements as anything, mine is as much a way of removing item drops in a sensible fashion as anything. if they want to make meta items build-based, this would be how it ought to be done imo. i don't think that's a goal that's practical at present, but if it's to be attempted, this provides a good model of how. i just don't like the idea of tech 5 items, because i don't think that they can be made to work in any sensible fashion."
1/9/2009,"value reflects functionality ... thus a car loses value as it ages, becasue there is a perceived loss of functionality (or new and better gets introduced). in your proposal, all the manufactured items would continualy lose functionality without the owner being able to do anything about it (i.e. good treatment/servicing in real world). also the loss of functionality would be in steps all of a sudden and not a continuos degradation ..."
1/9/2009,"hersh, i'll get to you later today:1. ""the real world"" is not ever a valid argument for balance2. since the devaluation is known, pricing will move to reflect the changes in its usefulness before that change in usefulness occurs.3. it doesn't matter if the degradation is continuous or not.(also, as a note, devaluation is always continuous while degradation is almost always, even in the real world, discrete. this does not change, devaluation occurs continuously as it becomes more likely that the item will be degraded)"
1/9/2009,"i'm a bit ambivalent about it, but i'll give you this... it's at least a half-decent idea.now, the problem with this idea is how to make people stomach it.and there's also the issue of research slots (and research type) that needs discussing.practically, it's a lot like your initial idea. the only difference would be the presentation.personally, i'd do call it somewhat differently, ""backstory"" wise. you call it ""technology progress index"", ""technology inflation index"" or other somesuch pompous sounding nonsense that ""index"" would be a float number which rounded off would be the current bpo metalevel right after an adjustment (but can vary afterwards, before the next adjustment).this index will very slowly increase whenever you do me/pe research on the blueprint, and a new type of ""general improvement"" research would be added into the game (using invention-related skills and maybe even invention slots) that would do nothing else but increase this ""tech progress index"" on the bpo.instead of introducing new techlevels or whatnot, you simply work with existing metalevels.t1 blueprints can oscillate from meta 0 to meta 4, t2 blueprints can either be meta 5 or meta 6 (navy version only), and that's it.officer and deadspace modules are not affected by anything at all, ever.the changes to blueprint metalevel would only occurr once a week at most (say on the monday downtime), in order to prevent too much volatility (but the trend of the change next monday would be updated each downtime, just not applied).the changes would be made in such a way to maintain the average ""tech progress index"" across all blueprints of the same category existant in the game within a certain agreed-upon interval.basically, you ""downgrade"" some of the items and blueprints one metalevel... they ""are"" the exact same old items they ever were, but that the entire measurement scale has shifted (easy to picture in case of hitpoints added/repaired, less easy to picture in case of turret optimal ranges or reisists values, and almost impossible to picture in case of rof changes, but it's... well... barely within ""suspension of disbelief"" levels). they would keep their current me/pe levels, but lose one metalevel. some items would remain the same stats (backstory-wise, they're actually better than before, but the same compared to the ""technology inflation level""), with a very small me/pe level drop (they are better, so they take longer to manufacture and cost more to produce).at the same time, very few items get ""upgraded"" to the next metalevel, and they will lose a massive portion of their me/pe research levels.sounds complicated, but it isn't"
1/9/2009,"i know industry has to be changed, but this proposal is ridiculous.first you're saying that the items created by said highly researched blueprint original or copy should reduce to a lower level at a certain ""imaginary"" level, and on top of that the blueprint should change as well.what half way through a production run when some one else ticks over the imaginary maximum number? what do you get half and half or 100% of the old or new?you've put a lot of thought and effort in to this proposal but it's just too damn annoying, exessive and not to mention expensive. eventually people will get fed up having to research the same things all the time and hope they've still got time to produce items and, yes and get them to market that we'll all end up using civilian guns and newby ships.it's all very well having a dynamic market, which is what we already have, but introducing any mechanic that resembles this will make eve online die. exageration? possibly, but people enjoy doing a repetitive task up to a point, and that point is that they know when it's all going to be over in terms of researching, of course copies and products will have to be made and marketed, but that's what industrialists and researchers do.i hope this doesn't even make it on to the csm agenda unless it's extremely re-written without the massive nerfbat damage.edit: just read akita t's wall of text. you explain it wonderfully and it's still a bad bad very bad idea. statistics shifting every week, you don't know if you're going to be average, below average or back to where you started from because a few fools researched the snot out of hmmm let's say 10mn afterburner i's, or even ii's if the idea applies to t2 bpc's as well? okay read my post and see if you can see the light at the end of the tunnel which in this case is a very heavy fast moving train on a very steep down gradient with no brakes."
1/9/2009,"well, for sanity's sake, only the bpos would ever change metalevels (bpcs and items would be frozen at their current metalevel), and most of the time, your bpos will remain at the current level, just losing a couple me/pe points, and seldom drop a whole metalevel instead (and you'd get a pretty decent daily advanced warning as to how exactly the shift, if any, would occurr ""next monday"")."
1/9/2009,"so for example on the sunday the producers will know certain bpo's would lose a few me/pe points, or indeed gain them magically.this is not what was originally intended by any means, and even that idea doesn't work either.personally i think production is fine the way it is. if there could be some sort of branding or customer loyalty that might work and the market place will help with that, at least people can pick a supplier, regular or irregular as that may be."
1/9/2009,"however, i see a critical flaw, at least with the bpos that start off as t1 bpos.on one hand, you want to have the heavily researched blueprints to ""push down"" the rest, and give everybody a reasonably fair chance of getting something other than metalevel 0 t1 bpos... this means that the ""higher"" blueprints need to be a percentage of total blueprints, otherwise you have the same old ""t2 bpo monopoly"" story, with the only difference being that pumping more research into it shifts the ownership from one person to the other more or less equitably (so it's basically just a big dissapointment anyway, since the needed effort would far outstrip usefulness, and you'd better just have the demand filled from dropped mission loot).on the other hand, the supply of t1 bpos is infinite, so what's stopping people from simply buying hundreds or thousands of t1 bpos, and only researching a couple to maximum levels, while using the rest as a ""global sink"", effectivelly granting everybody a perpetual ""arbalest manufacture machine"".either way, this doesn't end well...the more i think about it, the more i realize this whole approach is sadly doomed from before it started - too much effort for way too little results.a much better effort instead would be to implement an economy of scale instead. that would not only be much easier to code, but easier for just about anybody to understand (making 1 single car costs much more than 1/1000 of what it costs to make 1000 cars, and so on and so forth).sure, you no longer compete research-wise, but you do compete (quite fiercely) in the industry department."
1/9/2009,"this is actually a better idea. the more you can build, the more minerals you save (up to a point of course), so it will now be a good idea to build max runs in one go rather than a handfull. of course if you can't make max runs for whatever reason, well that should be reflected in your market price as they'll have a higher margin of minerals to produce.i'm sure they've done it before but it got changed in the opposite direction."
1/9/2009,"it does work just fine if you use a quota system and have a common input good that is scarce.e.g. lets say you want to get a constant monopoly on a certain item.you need to a: be the first in line researching the top tech level. then, immediately after everything is downgraded, you have to start researching on an entire quota of the item.this will let you produce that item for the research time and cost you x times the research cost where x is the quota.but it will also use up some of these scarce necessary resources.e.g. lets say that you have only enough input materials to research 1 bp per item per week. if the quota is 5, then by holding a perfect monopoly on that item, all the other items must necessarily take longer to downgrade. the key that makes it work is the limited input material.except that doesn't change anything. it doesn't allow item quality production advantage. all it does is make it so that big producers produce cheaper.all you have to do to do it is increase the install cost of jobs. longer jobs become much more profitable. its really a separate and much simpler issue.i find this similar, but not quite ""the same"". your idea hinges on a fixed degradation, doesn't have unique player produced items and doesn't really allow anyone to ""out tech"" someone else. it has merit in a method to allow players to produce named items, but beyond that it doesn't offer the competition present in the other option(in either the scarce resource, or the valuable item metrics)"
1/9/2009,"as noted, all jobs get kicked out and any unused materials refunded in full.(research jobs get reset and all materials refunded in full).there is no reason that anyone has to be punished for starting a production job or research job at the wrong timenot really no. we have a market with a number of barriers to entry and we have production with costs measured in risk. we do not have a market where anyone can secure an advantage against a competitor.we have no competition for ""who sells the best item"".what?i can almost see how it could be considered ""annoying"". but there is no reason that you cannot just sit and continue to invent, or continue to produce tech 2 items, or run a research job once and then sit on a t2 bpo if you found it annoying.i do not see why you consider it ""excessive"". i really do not see why you consider it ""expensive"" when no measure of required costs is discussed and mitigating factors(such as npc buy orders on t2 bpos) can easily be built into the system to reduce costs.eventually people will get fed up having to re-invent t2 items and... oh wait, no, people aren't going to get fed up having to do research to stay ahead of the curve because they are doing that right now and aren't quitting eve over it. right now people have no problem completing two step production with a risk based initial system. why would they get fed up at doing a two step production without a risk based initial system? there is no reason anyone would end up using civilian guns since there would be no changes to tech 1 production(which goes on), invention(which goes on), and the end result of the new system is tech 2 bpos which makes tech 2 production even easier than it is now for the masses if people so choose."
1/9/2009,"this suggestion is to expand one of the best features (imo) in eve. dynamic pricing in the npc market. i believe this was originally done to force players to spread out and add depth to something that is normal static and stale in mmosas you will know, excess demand for offices in a station means the prices for offices rises and will continue to rise until demand falls. low demand causes the price to fall until it too reaches an equilibrium (with a min charge). this also already occurs with some other npc product (skill books leap to mind). what i would like to see is this being expanded to all npc services where possible. the most logical to me, is also the most contentious. the broker fee. making the broker fee dynamic would encourage sellers to spread out over stations, then systems and maybe ultimately constellations and regions. from a flavour text point of view, the brokers working in the busiest systems (jita 4,4 for example) would demand the highest prices as they would naturally be the best there is.the consequence of such an action would be deep and far reaching, but in a good way as far as game world and market dynamics are concerned, and would change the face of the eve markets forever."
1/9/2009,"i don't see why everybody constantly wants to break up jita. maybe it made sense when it was wrecking servers, but that's more or less basically fixed now. amazingly, people don't just flood until the server breaks again - peak seems to have stabilized around 1000. jita's working fine. and even with the electronics level of the modern rl world, differential broker fees don't exist. if anything, it's cheaper to trade on the nyse than joe's stock exchange, because there's more competition among brokers. maybe it would have worked that way pre-computers, but nowadays volume of the market is not an issue.i like dynamic pricing for goods, where supply and demand is an issue. but for services, especially electronic services, where locality is virtually irrelevant, it's a bad idea."
1/9/2009,"remember back when ccp was nerfing bookmarks 3 ways to sunday?since the warp to 0 has come in, i have not heard whether ccp has unnerfed bookmarks.i am posting here to see if a csm will bring this up at the next meeting. - does ccp have any intentions of unnerfing those bookmarks, and allow us to move and copy hundreds of bookmarks at the same time? - has this already been done? either partially or fully?"
1/9/2009,i remember a ccp employee talking about fixing some things on the evemail system. but his changes were nothing like what i have suggested here. who was that guy again?what is this cosmos project? does it include the changes i have suggested?
1/9/2009,"i have only been playing eve for a couple of months now. and like many of you could not imagine a life without it. however i have experianced a few downsides to the game, the main being it's numerous bugs. now i don't profess to have any knowledge of how this game is created or maintained but i do know that if i was build a wall i would try to ensure that all previous levels were flawless. at the moment i can't help but worry that this game we have all called home for many years now is doomed to fall. i have talked to sseveral players (and don't ask me who as i have forgotten and would not say if i new) and have found each in turn have subbmitted petions for varios bugs only to recieve a reply stating that they were unknown. i also feel that for a game of such an age the interface should have a greater simplicity to it, my main hangup is that there is not a single button you can click to collapse all the market dropdown menus. with this in mind as well as others i am sure have been mentioned by others i would like to ask if there is the possibility for some action to be taken to improve these problems. i must stress that i do not mean to offend and i do not haveany desire to get into a debate, this posting is merely a means to be heard and if somehow a result come of it i will be very pleased.many thanks silverswann.ps: i would like to mention that i have heard other mmog's tend to reimburse you for time lost due to unnexpected downtime or errors, i do not know if ccp do this but i would hope if not they will attempt to in the future, after all we have payed for that time and it is their responsiilty to ensure we get it."
1/9/2009,nice small enhancement.
1/9/2009,remote repair and refine would both be very handy to have.
1/9/2009,can flipping is even easier then mining. there is no risk other than the risk that the owner sends a drone at u or tries to jam u. then u get to not only take their can but then u get to come back and blow them up. ive done it many times and i used to mine. they could at least make it somewhat challenging.
1/9/2009,"i was hoping this thread would die, but sadly here it is on the front page again.the whole premise of this proposal is under false pretenses. jet cans were never meant to be used for mining as i have shown before. gsc are in the game and ccp says if you must mine into a can, use a gsc, but gsc are not meant to be a way to jet can mine. for the record, gsc are used for freight while hauling or for deep space storage of valuable materials. not an easier way to jet can mine.while the hacking idea sounds ok, it requires a lot of skills to hack while almost nothing to anchor. failed hacking attempts should not give you a flag since you did not take anything. attempted stealing is not the same as stealing. the penalties shouldn't be the same and it gives too much control to the jet can miner (which shouldn't exist in the first place)furthermore, miners do not want this. is this wanted by the players? no. the players wanted the orca and while it was not the dream ship (no ship ever is) it certainly can be used as a giant can or hauler in mining ops and is fully intended to be such. miners that do not have friends or an orca and encouraged to find friends or a corp to work together.this is clearly not needed and not demanded by the playerbase. it puzzles me why you would want to add in a feature to eve (jet can mining) when the developers have been very clear that they never intended for jet can mining and do not support it or recommend anyone do it."
1/9/2009,"if your rational is ""nobody cares"", that's fine. you made it sound like you thought it was useless because you wouldn't use it. i imagine that we'd all prefer some decent search functions attached(fat chance, i know), but yeah, that's what i took the proposal to mean."
1/9/2009,"i remember this. it was pretty cool.no... it wasnt ""search privateer's wardecs""tbh i think we can bring it back now. before it was abused to find weak targets."
1/9/2009,"maybe yes.if it could be sortable as to region, size of participant corps, then yes i would love it back. would be a great addtion for mercernary corps for example as they have an easier time finding likely corps to hire them (big ones more likely to pay well, blah, blah)"
1/9/2009,"are you aware that those number mean simply that you can put up a run of 100 consecutive construction operations from the bpo and only 10 from the bpc, not that you produce 100 and 10 from each run? just to point it out: the difference in materials used between a unresearched photon scattering field ii bpo and a invented photon scattering field ii bpc with -4 me is:1 unit of isogen, 2 units of megacyte, 2 units of morphite, 104 units of pyerite and 14 units of tritanium. about 24k isk. make it 35k at perfect me. each invention attempt 1 million, 50% success rate. i.e. 2 millions for 1 10 run bpc. so inventing your cost are higher by 235k for each module but your investment is lower by several billions. cry more."
1/9/2009,no changes are necessary. just the creation of a highly highly expensive method of inventing a very very negative me/pe t2 bpo. that way those who are 'lucky' to have won the lottery. aren't forever sitting on a golden egg. just because they were lucky with no risk at all.risk vs reward.they get multibillions in profit vs no risk at all?
1/9/2009,"that was my first thought, but i can't think of a serious use for these. if that's their only purpose, then it's not a joke, whether comedy was intended or not."
1/9/2009,i now have nearly all my learning skills to level 5.any attempt to remove them will lead to me demanding my several months sp training time back.no support.
1/9/2009,they should stop seeding the skill book.so eveyone who already use there time training it won't be lost
1/9/2009,does anyone else find the eve forums the most childish place on the internet?honestly i haven't seen this kind of 'haha i don't like this so you're a dummy' since i was in preschool and it's in every single thread on these forums.fcking pathetic.
1/9/2009,i cannot accept the argument that there is not sufficient minerals available in 0.0. almost every 0.0 system is full of roids the size of moons because no-one mines it. if anything hi-sec should get the new ore as there is nothing left in the belts! i wonder if its not the case that people prefer to sell gtc for isk to fund cap ships than get involved in the gathering of resources. do any real industrial mining corps exist in 0.0 and low sec these days? what ever happened to fighting for resources?
1/9/2009,"is there enough veld out there to support a battleship program? sure. do you know how much trit goes into a single dread though? you have to strip mine entire systems to support a capital construction program. now add in battleship rats and roaming hac gangs. lots of risk there; you'll need a decent sized gang to make sure you aren't surprised and destroyed and have your hours wasted.for those exact same resources, you can sit alone in 0.5+ and mine afk in relative safety. why on earth (or new eden) would you even consider moving heavy industry out to deep 0.0? see whats broken there? the people who do choose to reach out and live in the ""end game"" areas--ostensibly the richest in the game--can't be self sufficient. you can get megacyte and zydrine easy (in some areas), sure. but you need hundreds of millions of units of tritanium on a very regular basis. the only economical and practical way to gather this is to do so in empire space. the risk/reward on gathering the requisite amounts of veldspar is just too ludicrously tipped to the risk end (not to mention the mind-numbing tedium). i'm not saying to make it easy to collect lowends in nulsec. i'm just saying to make it easier."

1/10/2009,"the thing i do not understand is with the impending release of wis which bare in mind is probably 100x ""harder"" to design and develop then the proposed pos changes. it actually worries me somewhat that wis wasn't even something that is widely wanted by the eve community nor does it actually add much to the game other then fluff. yet currently is being developed and soon to be implemented, but an idea thats been kept alive for almost 3 years is immediately shot down without reason other then ""to hard"".acrel"

1/10/2009,"1. you just claimed that your numbers represent the final culmination of a full days ratting in an already properly chained system.you cannot then come in and claim that ""0.0 ratting allows production in 15 minute windows"". it takes a lot of time to properly chain a system. certainly more than 15 minutes. if someone is chaining in front of you, they're doing work for you that you have to consider into your calculations of profitability. 2. empire does not lack ""legit loot"". though i have no clue what it means3. faction spawns: only in delve4. commercial value: are you actually saying that there is more profit to be made in 0.0 selling than there is in empire? seriously? there is a reason that the markets are larger in empire.5. renters are not personal income. nor is it income that draws people into 0.0. its its actually a cost that they have to pay to the people who already own the space.6. ""other values not defined""... because they don't exist7. saying that empire needs a nerf is the exact same thing as saying that 0.0 needs a buff. after all that time bloviating about how its so easy to make money you turn around and say ""oh yea, but you totally don't make enough more money than in empire and it doesn't support enough people"" which is what everyone else has been saying this entire damned time!so what you're actually saying is that your real production wasn't 56m isk/hour or 75m isk/hour as you previously claimed, but it was actually one half to one third of those claims?addendum:i am going to guess that you don't consider hauling time into your profit calculations do you?"
1/10/2009,i don't even spend serious time in 0.0 and want to see this improved (perhaps because then i might). supported.some time ago i suggested one mechanic that might work for this. it might be food for thought for someone.

1/10/2009,double
1/10/2009,"i believe i said bounty times. and as for hauling, you mean to that station in system where i sell things. 0.0 markets ftw. not everyone relies on jita for profits. team work allows for system chains, so yes, 15 minutes of time logged in is feasible if your team is working that system all day. again, teamwork, not i pwn selfishness.whether the system is or is not properly chained does not negate the fact that you can log in for 15 minutes and do something, where as most empire agents require more time.0.0 markets have higher profit margins due to scarcity. empire markets offer quicker turnarounds. if you're not a price gouging git, or even if you are, 0.0 markets are nice k.last i checked, moon mining and renters often go to alliance programs such as capital replacements. so while the income is not directly in your wallet, the effects are certainly significant to the average 0.0 player. not to mention that renting opens doors to smaller empire entities that could not practically hold space for themselves while reaping the rewards of 0.0.other values include things like complexes, 0.0 agents and pirate faction gear/ships ""hello phantasm/nightmare, rattlesnake... etc"" and those in space cosmos areas that pay out quite well. not to mention mining, drugs, and trade routes into 0.0 space that pay the most of any in game. empire getting a nerf isn't the same as saying 0.0 needs a boost. one forces more inflationary pressure (not inflation you ******ed gits i'm sure will comment) and outrageousness into the game, the other does not. this game cannot sustain it's economy forever if the faucets do not get turned off rather than increased. this is an age old problem in all mmos that has truely ruined them. when everyone becomes wealthy, it loses meaning, there is a reason to have class warfare."

1/10/2009,"they died for many reasons, money for the average player wasn't one."
1/10/2009,"do you understand the concept of ""cost/benefit"" do you?. you see, if you're benefiting from your corp mates work, then the guy who initially started the chain is paying for your increased profit. not that he would do anything else, but he is still paying for your increased profit.goods still need to be moved within 0.0. unless you only rat in station systemsyes, the prospect of rending space will certainly endear the alliance subsisting of 0.0 production income to go and move into 0.0...oh wait.so ""other values"" is ""delve""...""inflationary pressure"" is ""money supply increases that create inflation"" or ""stuff supply decreases that create inflation"".... you git. though nerfing empire would likely cause inflationary pressure through a reduction in production since more of empire based production is in items rather than isk.now, boosting 0.0 by increasing the amount of isk produced there might be an inflationary pressure, but you don't have to increase the amount of isk produced you could instead increase the amount of stuff produced... which would be deflationary pressure.also, i do not believe that ""outrageousness"" is a quantitative measure of anything that can really be increased...yes it can. the age old problem in mmos is not that people get wealthy(if people get wealthy in eve they will simply pvp more... which was good the last time i checked). the age old problem in mmos is that they create a lot of currency faucets but there are no continual currency sinks.eve doesn't have this problem because you can always trade isk directly for minerals via npc sell orders just as you can always trade minerals for isk via insurance fraud.game crippling hyperinflation simply cannot happen because if it starts people will turn all that isk into materials with the push of a button. it also cannot happen because there is constant requirements for new stuff when people blow it up. edit: eve is not a loot grind mmo, stop treating it like one because you haven't the foggiest about how economies work."

1/10/2009,"eve has drastically grown over the past two years. battles with up to 1,000 players are now taking place quite regularly. over time, ccp has taken steps to improve the cooperative aspect of this multiplayer game by improving on the gang system and turning it into the fleet system we know today. however, in these great battles of today allied forces are being held back by a very legacy aspect of the game.fleets are limited to 256 players. any players who are not able to be inside this 256 player fleet are severely hindered by the lack of the ability to warp to another player for strategic position. the csm must push for ccp to further develop the fleet system to accommodate more players. the means to do this could be as simple as doubling the number of players/slots leadership skills affect or introduce command specialization skills that mimic the effects of warfare specialization skills. perhaps the chain of command could be expanded so there can be a maximum of 5 squads per wing, 5 wings per fleet, and 5 fleets per [whatever it'd be called].it is absolutely horrible when a fight is going on and you cant get a warp-in because the fleet that's there is full.edit: changed title name to be more descriptive.edit #2: i have begun a new thread in the features and ideas section of this forum. if you have an idea on how to improve the maximum number of players in a fleet, please post there."
1/10/2009,"yes, this would be cool. ccp released the sovereignty skill for large corporations and i imagine they could do something similar for large fleets."
1/10/2009,fidonet was limited to 250 nodes initially too but had over 35000 eventually
1/10/2009,supported. either change the bonus of the leadership skill to allow 3 or 4 people into a squad or change wing command and fleet command to allow for 2 more squads or wings respectively.
1/10/2009,"maybe they should set the limit to 128 players, that way fleets are more tactical and require strategic planning across multiple fleets."
1/10/2009,"sounds sensible to me. if you can actually get 300 or more people organized to fight on the same side, you should be rewarded for it, not screwed."
1/10/2009,"hmm yes, reduced capacity to handle large numbers of players is exactly what this game needs. dufas."
1/10/2009,"this is necessary, absolutely necessary."
1/10/2009,"yes, agree -- though the fix doesn't have to be increased fleet size. letting people turn on warp-to for themselves if in corp/alliance (similar to fleet invites) or something would also be a way to fix this."
1/10/2009,make fleets bigger.
1/10/2009,i think the best option is to just up the number of players in a squad to 20 or 15.
1/10/2009,mucho gusto
1/10/2009,"next level needs to be called ""armada""."
1/10/2009,"dealing with two fleets at once is annoying as hell for the average pilot in the fleet, much less the leadership. supportin' dis."
1/10/2009,support
1/10/2009,yeah.
1/10/2009,i support this fine idea
1/10/2009,don't support more skill less blob in 0.0
1/10/2009,"20 to a squad, 10 squads to a wing, 5 wings to a fleet. that'll last a while."

1/10/2009,agreed. fleets have been getting bigger and ccp needs to keep pace.

1/10/2009,do dis.

1/10/2009,another goon who thinks more people need to be allowed in fleets posting here.
1/10/2009,this would help a lot.
1/10/2009,"yes.it made me laugh to hear ccp say something like ""please let us know first before engaging in a large fleet battle or else there will be consequences"". that should never ever happen in an mmo."
1/10/2009,don't see how this could be anything other than a good thing.
1/10/2009,granted i will likely never use such a function as i have a distaste for flying in fleets larger than 5-10. i can see the merits.supported
1/10/2009,.
1/10/2009,please please please.
1/10/2009,aye.
1/10/2009,"i vote no to this.making the formation of larger blob fleets easier will go completely against what the csm and ccp have stated they want/are looking at, in trying to make 0.0 warfare more fluid/fun/mobile/etc.also, with the lag monster that is still out there, making blobing easier and larger will only make the lag worse."
1/10/2009,begging for it.
1/10/2009,dude the situation already exists. not putting in larger fleets won't somehow fix the stategic issues of large scale warfare. those issues exist because of the objectives of the game not because of the infrastructure of fleets. it's not like we're going to stop using fleets of 300 - 400 people just because it's inconvenient when the alternative is losing the battle. we just figure out awkward workarounds.in any case kudos to ccp for actually making fleet battles reasonably fun (though they could still be better). please add this.
1/10/2009,"i support this, it should happen"
1/10/2009,"oh hell yes, about time!if you're in a small corp/ally and think this doesn't apply to you - think again, when several mid-sized alliances get together for important ops this is just as important!"
1/10/2009,do it!!

1/10/2009,"i, too, support this."
1/10/2009,fantastic idea
1/10/2009,"gs member in ""supporting this"" shocker!this needs to be highlighted. even if ccp don't want to or can't increase fleet sizes or add more command levels (afraid of balance issues for bonuses, for example), just allowing characters to be ""alliance warp beacons"" would solve most of the actual problems caused by needing multiple fleets."
1/10/2009,i have created a thread in the features and ideas section of the website to augment this proposal. details and a link can be found in the op.
1/10/2009,this would be okay but still ****ty for fleets with allies in it. the op's suggestions is an overall more practical idea
1/10/2009,agreed
1/10/2009,"i was in a giant fleet. i had this problem. it felt artificial and kludgy. please fix, thanks."
1/10/2009,supporting.
1/10/2009,"yea this will never happen. you have to remember that while most game companies take steps to improve their game over time, ccp has actively been making eve worse. therefore, this good idea will never come to fruition because ccp hates its customers.remember, you can't spell incompetence without ccp!"
1/10/2009,yes yes yes
1/10/2009,support.
1/10/2009,supported. i would also like to request that fleet have a general fleet window like it does today but also add a second fleet chat for only wing commanders/boss.
1/10/2009,yase
1/10/2009,"not supported...rather, we need limited sized fleets with some option of exchanging tactical intel. so when you need a warp-in-point, the fleet who's in the field of action should be able to broadcast location to fleets that are in the same group.this should give rise to more interesting ops imo, and put in place the tools needed for future efforts to split up blobs."
1/10/2009,yes!
1/10/2009,not supported unless the current fleet system was scrapped and redone first.fleet window causes horrible ui lag and that needs to be fixed before cramming more people into it.
1/10/2009,that really needs to get fixed.
1/10/2009,"i take it you like posting without reading threads, this complaint is bogus and demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the issue.supported"
1/10/2009,"supported, this would be very helpful."
1/10/2009,against it.a couple of activated sensor boosters + a properly set overview + a scram pre activated and blinking = instant lock
1/10/2009,"with respect thesonarnet, i don't see why people should gimp their mid slots for a rack of sensor boosters (even harder for amarr) just to tackle somebody - though as olzi points out, in some situations it doesn't matter what your scan resolution is, they are in warp and safe before your client has registered they have decloaked because of inherent background lag. we're not asking for tackling to be made easier, we just want it the same as it was before qr. at no time did ccp state ""we're going to make tackling much harder and make it much easier to travel around while you're at war or in low sec"", so it would seem the qr changes had these unintended consequences which is what we want looked at.captain thunk"
1/10/2009,"lock times didn't change. and you can find align times by looking at an old version of eft.for the most part, ships cruiser sized and above had significant decreases in their align times.e.g. align time for a raven was something like 15.3 seconds without an mwd pre qr. now its 10.5 seconds(15.8 with an mwd activated!)fake edit: i went and got an old copy of eft(eft 2.8.1 taken from gripens eve files index) and these are the align times. this is using top tier amarr(slowest align usually) and lowest tier caldari(fastest align usually) with the exception of interceptors where caldari and minmatar are used. everything else is going to be in between the two numbers. i can do entire sets of ships, it just takes more time and isn't much worth it.none of the ships are set with plates, agility modifiers, or mass modifiers(pre-qr only). the numbers below are ""align times"" which means that its how long it takes the ship to get into warp from a dead stop(75% of its velocity). :battleships: qr pre-qr mwd-qr mwd-prescorpion: 10 14.9 14.8 21.4abaddon: 11.9 17.5 17.7 25 :battlecruisers: qr pre-qr mwd-qr mwd-preferox: 7.4 10.6 10.1 14.4harbinger: 8 11.4 10.9 15.7 :cruisers: qr pre-qr mwd-qr mwd-precaracal: 3.7 5.3 5.1 7.2maller: 4.7 6.7 6.8 9.4 :frigates: qr pre-qr mwd-qr mwd-precondor: 2.1 3 3 4.3punisher: 3 4.2 4.4 5.7 :interceptor: qr pre-qr mwd-qr mwd-precrow: 2.1 3 3.1 4.5claw: 2.3 3.4 3.4 4.8as you can see, pretty much everything has received a massive increase in agility, so far that some ships are more agile with an mwd on after the changes than they were without an mwd on before.pretty much everything is getting into warp 30% or more faster than they were before.as was said earlier, the actual agility of the ships doesn't need to change, just how long it takes them to get into warp.looking at those numbers it seems pretty clear to me that the solution is to increase the speed necessary to get into warp to compensate for the agility changes."
1/10/2009,"supported - plz ccp deal with this, it is ruining the game.oh and thanks to goumindong for doing the math."
1/10/2009,one can have an insta-lock but it does not help when overview update interval is 1 second and module lag 2-3 seconds.
1/10/2009,"what i find disturbing is that i need 2 lock time scripted sensor boosters in order to catch a cruiser with my broadsword. thats just too much! before 1 was enough, meaning you still sacrificed almost 150 dps tank, now its just plain silly."
1/10/2009,"supported. hmm, me supporting a goumindong thread. is that hell freezing over that i hear? o.0"
1/10/2009,"good points raised. personally i'm leaning towards option 1 or 2 purely on the basis that there's some chance ccp might do it - 3 has potential, but much harder to get right, which reduces the likelihood of implementation any time soon.either way, a good thing to fix."
1/10/2009,"storyline missions should feel important, and raise the character's faction standings by a substantial amount. this mission should be changed to be a mining mission at the very least - ie, instead of kernite bought off the market, you have to go mine the ore from a mission deadspace."
1/10/2009,"i just had an insight lately as questions rises about scheduled logistic movements. people in corp where asking when the next convoy starts and i figured out the there is nothing in eve where your corp can put in schedulded tasks visible for it's members. this has to be done outside eve what is, at least for me, a bit annoying. so i suggest to implement a type of calendar what is accessible at different levels like alliance ( maybe only ceo's of the member corps as example), corp and/or directors only to show scheduled tasks to the corp members like mining ops, convoys, roams, pos bashing etc.and please forgive my bad english, it's not my natural language."
1/10/2009,"all apologies accepted, this would be really good for op planning, as i know when you have people in 3 major timezones (au, uk and us) things get confusing when setting dates and times.so a calender where you can plan things and have a time left display (like skill training time remaining display) would be extremely useful and shouldn't be to hard to implement.great idea!"
1/10/2009,"the number of corp management tools that ought to be added to the game and haven't been likely numbers in the thousands. that's why i go for modding - ccp can't and won't code all of that, but the players will. that said, if modding isn't going to happen, a few of the basic ones should. this is pretty basic.edit: whoops, forgot that they mentioned this at fanfest. no need for ccp to raise it. thumb removed."
1/10/2009,"inventing a useful marketable world timezone calendar is a disturbingly good idea. it really should be part of my os... 3d rotatable realtime...with attachable bookmarks that rotate with the earth and let you know say how many pilots are going to be available in two hours.as for in game it would be real handy to select ""display manufacture completion dates"" or research or whatever you care to measure. great idea and a chance for eve to show off some great artwork and create immersion in that the player does not look at an rl calendar but their char does in game."
1/10/2009,supported
1/10/2009,i've heard that this will come for sure. ccp presented that on the fanfest.
1/10/2009,"ccp had a nice presentation at the fanfest about some plans adding social networking features to eve, accessible from both ingame and out of game. i think the presentation even included a calendar app. this op sounds pretty much like something they are already working on so i see no reason to raise this issue for now. indicating the desire to have such a calenadar app in faceeve could be useful but i think this feature is so basic in any social networking site that i do not think that they forgot about it.i like the idea tho."

""well i unplugged the old cpu and popped in a better one but it was too hot so i have to attach liquid cooling and then i used salvaged junk to modify my power conduits that gave me a boost to laser strength..."" i was kinda put out when my mechanic and engineer skills couldn't be traded. i wanted to buy a ship attach parts and sell it... but that doesnt work because pilots cannot use ships that they do not have the skills for which kills potential professions.big no from me... no no no please no. leveling is bad. actual player skill is good."
1/10/2009,"i'm not entirely sure you grasped the exact proposal. were not talking about making builder (a) able to build cheaper than you were talking about allowing a single character to build or research more items simultaneously instead of having to make an army of alt characters for the sole purpose of sticking a manufacturing job in a slot or a research job in a lab. most builders both new and old utilize alt characters to be able to build/research more than 11 items at any one time. this proposal would alleviate that need somewhat and perhaps allow those ppl to make a few more pvp or pve characters and actually experience the other facets of the game on a limited real world budget.i don't see how this skill addition would segregate players, it just gives you a chance to play the game more fully on a limited budget and if anything would let newer players compete more in the market without having to shell out more real world money just to train a second third or fourth or more building alt on separate accounts at the same time. maybe i am wrong here and ppl can show me why, i'm up for discussing it at least and thanks for contributing to the thread in favor or against."
1/10/2009,"yes please, managing multiple manufacuring/research alts is a pain.it is strange that i have one trade alt easily handling the output of my 4 production/research alts."

1/10/2009,"mr. ceaon, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard. at no point in your rambling, incoherent thread were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. everyone in this forum is now dumber for having read it. i award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul./thumbsdown"
1/10/2009,"what i want to see is possibly a different policy depending on what you are warping to. if it is a gate i would love to see it drop you off in a ""cone"" shape around the ""entrance"" so that you sort of shoot through the gate. also it would be a nice thing to see ships moving in orderly lines when in high traffic regions... say you are in a frigate and are on auto pilot you get warped to the frigate lane which is moving fast and if you are a slow freighter you move to slow lane. and if you warp to zero you appear at the 0 to 2000m radius as standard but out of the way of the lanes. also if you warp to okm and appear inside an asteroid you should explode! that way miners can ""hide"" in low sec fields and bookmarking barracuda must take a huge risk to warp into the field. but they can reduce the risk by training precision warp skills and using clever bming. could be looked at.supported"

1/10/2009,i am currently between retriever and hulk...and have to say that the cost and the skills present a problem for me. but it only seems right that the skills differences are on par with the price differences even though i know nothing about the expense of manufacturing either vessel. the astrogeology train is like a brick wall to me at the moment i have other more important skills training. not everyone who uses a retriever is a hell bent miner. it is a useful tool that comes almost as a bonus to the industrialist.i thought the opinion of a player currently facing these questions would be useful to the discussion... tbo the covetor does not factor into my thinking. there is what i can use and there is the hulk. also the astrogeology v train is far more interesting to me because of the deep core mining it allows which is useless to barges but interests me.
1/10/2009,.
1/10/2009,the covetor skill req is wrong imo+1
1/10/2009,"agreed! currently the canon is to train for retriever, then go straight to hulk since there's only a day or so training over flying a covetor."
1/10/2009,honestly the training times for a covetor should be shorter...... if you where to nudge that ship a little further back on the skill tree and widen the gap between hulk and covetor... it would make more sense.the only reason i'm going to park myself on the covetor is due to cost and the fact that tech 2 ships usually are a little expensive to replace... and most people don't bother insuring them.
1/10/2009,agreed.nice idea.

1/10/2009,aye
1/10/2009,thumbs up for thumbs down
1/10/2009,"i copy pasta'd the gist of this from another thread i'd made on those forums, yeah. i realize what a ship needs for it to be balanced with the rest of its class, doesn't necessarily mean that there's any chance of that actually happening. the problem with leaving it a domi, other than drones not working well at all with how blackops are used, is that it still lacks the grid to fit a 5th turret (that it definitely needs), so giving it a 5th turret slot that was denied to it because it's ""a drone boat"" doesn't actually help all that much. and if you were to give it a 5th turret and made the blackops skill bonus another turret bonus (another 5% damage, or 10% optimal, maybe even 5% rof), it would still need to have the 7:5:7 layout i proposed for the megathron version of the gallente blackops. (in pvp that is, for pve, the sin makes a great ninja exploration site runner in non-friendly 0.0 space) otherwise, all those changes are a waste since you lack the slots to fit proper damage mods.and if you give it double turret bonuses *and* the drone bonus now, give it the 5th turret hard point along with the grid and slot layout to utilize it, while leaving the domi's drone bay on it (remove the drone bay and drone bonus, and grats it's the megathron version i asked for), then it becomes a very good ship in most encounters (such as when the drones aren't that viable), yet insanely overpowered in other situations that aren't really blackops related (see the panther pre speed balancing). if there's one things players are guranteed to do, it is find those situations where it's overpowered and specialize the ship specific for those circumstances to take advantage of it (again, panther). this would give the sin and only the sin a new perspective and people would start flying them for those specific situations, leading to a nerf, resulting in pilots using the ship for its designed role, who finally equal their peers, to once again fall behind.the problem with making the 3rd bonus into another drone bonus as it's design indicates it should have, is that in all likelihood it would get a useless bonus to control or drone bay that does not help it whatsoever. even if they gave it something crazy like +20% per level to drone mwd velocity/drone optimal to allow it to compensate for the sluggishness of heavy drones (would help sentries as well, leading to bouncer ii snipe fits, etc), the real problem is mostly due to the crappiness of the drone ai and lag/response times dealing with the drone ui. the sin already has decent dps in eft, the problem is well over half of that dps is difficult to apply in combat and even when you do, it takes too long to start kicking in.so to ""balance"" the drone dps they need to be buffed enough to compensate for the difficulties with utilizing that dps. it won't fix them, but it's the best the devs can do to mask the problems with them. giving the sin a 2nd drone bonus, it should be another bonus to 10% dmg/hp per blackops skill level. at all level 5 skills without rigs/whatever, this would result in:394 bouncer iis becomes 591386 berserker iis becomes 579475 ogre iis becomes 713450 garde iis becomes 6755th turret hardpoint needs to also be added. unless it also gets a grid boost, this really only allows a 5th electron blaster cannon (with a tight fit). nothing short of comedy tank/mids leaves it enough grid to fit 5 ions or larger. for those with rail fits, electrons = dual 250s grid wise, slightly higher cpu costs but they should still fit. 350s are even harder to fit than ions though so no luck there. that would give it at max skills ~435 turret dps (1 dmg mod) plus the dps from the improved drones above, 1147 eft dps with ogre iis, in reality less, but good dps when drones can be used, and subpar but respectable dps when they can't."
1/10/2009,seems reasonable that empires would control t2. but i like the idea of players being able to control resources. if it gets too constricting it should be loosened but i don't hear very many people complaining.

1/10/2009,"i have to agree with that. it needn't be proactive ('here's a list of all the exploits') but rather when they make announcements that indicate specific activities are an exploit, it should be logged in some suitable easily found place (like say, the new official wiki).it makes life a lot easier when you can explain to new players that a given activity is most definitely not allowed and point them to official info on it.on that subject - said list really ought to get a forum area equivalent to the info portal or part of it where questions can be raised about precise wording. i've seen announcements of exploits that left a lot to the interpretation of what was said - nothing worse than ambiguous law that can't be clarified."
1/10/2009,"there's an invisible ghost in the corner of by bedroom. he doesn't do anything, he doesn't move, and he doesn't talk.waaaaaaaaaaahhhhh this is harrassment!!!"
1/10/2009,terrorism = valid tactic. absolutely no support ever.
1/10/2009,gl with that also let it be once again stated that anything you numbnuts ***** about in a cloaking thread i could do in a t1 frig
1/10/2009,"pro itthe whole gathering intel through sitting cloaked in a system for hours needs to be overworked at all. atm you can't prevent someone from entering your system unless you have a 23/7 gate camp somewhere and even then it's possible to get one in with a little luck and once your alt (and that's the next you don't even need a lot of skills for that eng1neering v + cloak 1 = 10 days max) is in then you can't do anything. now imagine me starting a corp which has only one reason, selling intel to whoever has the isk + wtb 50 cloaking 1 ready chars to provide corp mates with the right equipment(they're cheap) and a couple of weeks later every 0.0 system with a station would have a cloaked alt in it you can't do anything to prevent that.i'm sure no one would like to have that situation."
1/10/2009,"you misunderstand what is going on.if some guy cloaks his recon and jets off into the distance (no mwd, just flying) anyone who lands a 0km hit result on him will end up on a grid with a cloaked ship that is flying in some random direction.this is because the cloaked ship that is supposed to have a cloak will be traveling fast enough that it will clear 2km before the probing ship lands.so, in order to find the cloaker, the probing ship needs to probe again and then approach the new hit result with a propulsion mod on. this will align themselves on the cloaker and then you will run into him, decloaking him.you can do similar things if the cloaker is orbiting point in space. now, this only works against afk people because anyone not afk will notice someone landing on grid and burning to them. this will allow them to change direction and warp out to a new location. this occurs whether or not the ship is able to warp cloaked, since any ship that has a bonus to cloaking devices is able to warp instantly after uncloaking.with such a system present on all probes(as it should be, a system that only had pos system scanners would be an unfair advantage to sov holding entities) then normal cloaking would have its uses, since you could hide from directional scanners(making it harder to figure out where to scan you down from.) and set up ambushes. and ships with bonuses to cloaking devices would maintain pretty much their entire functionality so long as they were not afk. it actually kills the ""afk cloaked person has no risk sitting in our space making us assume he is active"" problem and (half of) the ""raven ratter warps to a safe spot and cloaks the instant anyone enters local"" problem in one fell swoop.give me a bit and maybe i'll write something a bit more formal and readable on the subject that can go in as an issue rather than the unreadable op."
1/10/2009,"and add the ""the cloaker is within the bubble, so no chance of living"" problem. what is the max range of a hic bubble? 30 km? the cloaker running at 500 m/s will need 60 seconds to clear it and can be scanned in 20. so as soon as you warp in a small squad: cov ops, hic, fast ship to decloak it, the cloaker has lost its advantage and kept the drawbacks. at a gate with anchored bubbles it would be even easier."
1/10/2009,"so you require a cloaker to jump into a bubble at 0km from a hic(which would not allow the cloaker to cloak anyway). not turn on its mwd before cloaking(standard procedure). a scanner to start scanning at the right time on the gate. the cloaker to not change direction at least one time.yea, when a cloaker jumps into a camp all of these things minus the scan are already done and people are going to be swarming all over it.the scan doesn't change things in this instance."
1/10/2009,ever wonder why that hasn't already happened? it's completely viable with the existing game mechanics. because nobody cares enough to bother; except the anti-cloak whiner crowd. if this was an issue it would already be happening - you're not the first to think of this i promise.

1/10/2009,because paying for the service is foolish when you can do it yourself.
1/10/2009,"as it was a reply to your post 1 post above mine about scanning cloakers, i did thought it was pretty clear, but to make it clear, step by step: 1) scan the cloaker with the cov ops2) warp to the cloaker with the cop ops squad3) deploy probe and scan while the hic active the bubble, unless the cloaker is extremely fast or the scanner ship war very far away the cloaker is well within the range of the hic bubble, on the other hand the ship with a speed bonus cloaked can't warp cloaked;4) when the scanning ship get the current cloaker position the whole squad can chase it. it require very fast scanner, but it can be done. against a ratting ship with a cloak it will work wonderfully as those ship are very slow.so it will, as you put it but it will add problem as i said."
1/10/2009,"it isn't harrassment it's reconnaissance, a very useful tactic. it always helps to know what is going on in the systems around you wether your pvp'ing, mining, or getting ready to do whatever. i oppose changes to cloaking."
1/10/2009,"what is the point in flying a cloaked ship if people can see you on scanner and probe you down easily?if a cov ops is easily probed, that means i have to warp off every 30s or 60s. keeping normal intel on the enemy becomes much more difficult.the whole probing/bubbling and reprobing sounds like a real tedious process that will acheive no ""action""why don't you just nerf afkers instead? idle for 30 mins = kick from server? i know there are ways to get around this, but not everyone is willing/smart enough to make a third party program."
1/10/2009,"scan takes 20 seconds + 10km.warp takes 20-40 seconds + 10/20km...you can still just change direction after they get the second resultyea, you're going to kill a ratter. you should kill a ratter."
1/10/2009,"no, this will have negative effects on target calling in small gangs as you cannot differentiate between two enemies of the same ship type. i like that ""negative"" effect (such black and white thinking) try pinpointing a single herring in a school, safety in numbers has always been a defensive tactic. its a good idea and if at anytime people do get to ""pimp their rides"" you'll be able to call based on makings. supported: people should be able to hide their identities and also people should be able to block identities. i get irritated and close my overview when in high sec because i get sick of seeing what idiots have named themselves, many have done it simply to irritate the reader. there doesn't appear to be any problem with people hurling all sorts of abuse at each other so the lack of identity would not cause many problems that i can think of. also it might be irritating to be a z character stuck down the bottom of every chat window...but that really cant be helped unless you have a search for char field for every chat box."
1/10/2009,"issue: eve has become small in real terms which in conjunction with sovereignty and pos mechanics has forced the game towards more a numbers game (big fleets rather than meaningful roaming gangs) and helped cause a general stagnation within 0.0.reasoning: eve used to be a very big place, now it is relatively small and although yes there are small pockets of useless 0.0 space which are not used generally most of 0.0 is generally cluttered. it is appreciated the drone regions was added but i do not think it has gone far enough. space should be big with large expanses of emptiness in regards to population. i like many, remember when there was 5-10k people on server max which enable room to roam. now if you go out roaming generally speaking you will generally hit the blob.potential contribution to a solution: [*]increase the number of regions / systems dramatically (this could be hooked in with a storyline, new gate technologies, new npc factions , extending fw in to 0.0 for alliances, etc) what i am thinking of here is dramatic, treble the number of regions / systems. this will make eve big again and also gives eve room to grow or floor space as it were as it continues to grow from a population stance (45k pcu record so we are getting busier) [*]revise local mechanics: instead of having a local count with names of who is in local change it so chat can still be done but numbers in system and who is in system is not shown. introduce a mechanic though the scanner which enables you to get that information. this would also help to build the scout role more whether that is through cov ops, captor or perhaps new ship class / modules with supporting skills) ie more meaningful data on who and what is in said systembenefits[*]this does not impede the current large scale fleet warfare[*]this does enable roaming to become fun again from a pvp sense in regards to small scale fights[*]provides the opportunity for storylines and way of adding additional content (both player driven and storyline driven)[*]provides some opportunity for role specialisation[*]provides additional opportunity for industrial and exploration side of the game[*]helps enable what made the game great before while supporting what still makes the game great todayno matter what political group in eve one is affiliated with bob/gbc,nc ,goon, super friends, etc etc i have had chats with peeps in most entities and these are the type of things that have come up time and time again in conversationit is appreciated that some of these changes may not be in the art of possible now due to ccp resources, current plans, etc but would like to submit for consideration."
1/10/2009,ya got my vote
1/10/2009,signed
1/10/2009,"your ideas do not address the issue (which as you stated was with sovereignty and pos mechanics), thus it cannot solve the problems created by it.as long as true 0.0 maintains the same pos based sov mechanics, and as long as those sov mechanics make both logistics trivial for coalitions to maintain their vast regions of space, as well as make travel so trivial that they can move their massive numbers to attack anywhere else on the map with ease, then the fate of any new regions added are clear to anyone who'd be interested in living there. thus, the way players choose to deal with the repercussions will remain the same, be a member of a large powerblock or get steamrolled. this remains true regardless of the number of new regions added. adding more regions adds more space to be inhabited, thus will allow the same coalitions that exist now to add more pets/vassals/allies/farmers/etc, ie numbers, to their existing coalitions, and unfortunately they will continue to try and use those new and improved numbers to attack the same pos/grid in the same system at precisely the same time that another equally overwhelming coalition will use their new and improved numbers to try and defend said pos.the space that currently exists is too much space for so little political blocks which control them all already. if you want to change that it needs to be much more difficult/impossible for so few groups to control so much space (a region, at most), and make traveling so difficult/inconvenient that blueing your neighbors results in none of you getting any pvp whatsoever. the ""south"", ""north"", ""southwest"", ""drone regions"", etc should not be coalitions, they should be zones your group can conceivable attack (the one you live in)."
1/10/2009,"i agree with the concept that 0.0 needs a massive reworking, and ccp likely has a group working on that very thing right now. the mechanics of sovereignty needs a good hammering, and the benefits of sovereignty could also use work.i do believe that the cyno generator modules for poses need a real change, such as every alliance having no more than 1-5 (based on a skill perhaps) and only being able to use the generators for that specific alliance. likewise, ownership of regions could use some work, but not in the way you described (hard limits), but rather increasing coo (cost of ownership) for poses further away from the alliance capital.as far as the increased systems, i strongly disagree. this is the biggest mmo out there (over 5k systems to explore), so by adding systems you really won't improve things. the mechanics are the broken part, so fix those first and society will expand."
1/10/2009,"it saddens me that people see these as the only two options. i am part of an independent corp that has roamed 0.0 successfully for over two years without membership or support from any of the ""powerblocks"". in fact, we face direct opposition from the ""locals"" almost constantly - yet we have survived and profited the entire time. creativity makes things possible. don't believe all of the limits that you are told exist. get out here and learn to thrive in free space. the powerblocks can be reduced through intelligent, independent pilot and corp actions. it is the fear of risk and preference for easy empire isk that keeps this from happening."
1/10/2009,"couldn't find your alliance name to confirm myself, could you point it out for me here? thanks.assuming it's not listed, could you indicate the number of high end moons your corp owns poses on? no need to give away locations, just a number of dysprosium and promethium moons you claim.if you don't hold sovereignty in any systems, much less station systems, and don't hold any of the real resources which are fought over, you have no claim over any sov 0.0 space. ""roaming"" sov 0.0 is pretty futile and typically a fruitless endeavor, you'll get more engagements roaming low sec and npc 0.0 regions, and once you're done roaming, no need to fly home 40 jumps, just dock at the nearest station and you're home.but i don't think you mean roaming in the pvp sense, it sounds more like you've discovered how to fit cloaks on a raven. that's not living there, and it's certainly not thriving, it's more like scratching a living doing what sweatshop workers in other countries do simultaneously with 8 different characters during their 12-16 hour work day. they're bringing far more isk than you are and converting it directly to real world currency and even they wouldn't mistake that for ""thriving"" in sov space."
1/10/2009,as a general idea thumbs up.
1/10/2009,"as stated - we're not with an alliance. my corp name and character name are exactly as listed here - pretty easy to find with the in game search. we have no ravens in our fleet, not a single battleship actually. we don't ""fly home"" - we live full time as nomads - home is where we park our ships. we don't set up poss or claim to own any space. we don't mine moons. we make our living as we move. and yeah, if/when it comes to pvp - we tend to take more ships than we lose. being outnumbered most of the time; we choose our battles with care. i fly with a small team of good folks who share my outlook. we make a living that's more than good enough to keep ourselves well equipped with top of the line ships and equipment. we're quite successful in a niche that many people don't believe exists. like you. :) the galaxy has more options than the standard approaches. i've done the alliance / sov thing before - got tired of it. the nomadic lifesytle has been far more rewarding for the past couple years. we maintain a public channel; it's in the corp description. you're again welcome to check it out in game if you like. oh, this might help. i took a screenshot of the my bookmarks setting on the map. i make custom bookmarks everywhere we go. if it's green, we've been there and probably made some isk there:"
1/10/2009,"hell, why not.add scripts to project other ship classes for bonus points."
1/10/2009,"if you want realism... the idea of a non atmospheric missile is quite laughable. firstly the icon for the missiles themselves are like atmospheric missiles and that is funny. what good are fins in space? secondly if you did want to build a bomb that could track a frigate it would almost have to be as large as the target. i think drones are ridiculously manoeuverable and damaging. there should only be ""rockets"" (unguided and fired from turrets) and missiles that have crap tracking and can only hit large slow targets.thumbs down."
1/10/2009,"it just doesn't seem right that a rig in general should not have a drawback while the others do. the scales of balance would suggest this shouldn't be.if you wanted they could make a mechanic skill, that profoundly hampers the drawback."

1/10/2009,"hi everyone, you may have seen me commenting here about various things but for those who haven't met me or flamed me (oxy goggles) i am axel vindislaga ceo of a baby corp called unitive manifestation. this corporation was founded to create a corp. that had fair internal trading. so far after recruiting a few players some old some new. we have begun a corp. business but have hit a snag. only a small snag but quite irritating.it appears that ceos and directors cannot claim their own corp.'s contracts. why you might ask. well as the ceo of my corp. i do not want to exclude myself from working for the corporation. i insist on transparency and the contract history (i think) would allow me to work as a member of my own corp. as i do not view the corporation wallet as ""my"" money. what i am doing is very simplistic.... there are many features that people are probably wanting that make far more sense that this. there are other things also that would possibly help people organise their corps. one feature i could use is a automated pay facility that pays members automatically weekly or monthly. some of the tasks assigned to members have no way for me to include their share of the profit so i need to pay them directly and if i could simply type a figure into a field and have that payed to them at regular intervals. i would like the csm to quiz as many ceo's as possible and ask them what features are missing or are wanted and see if you can blitz them into the march expansion. there are probably many far better ideas out there and i am really hoping to see some greater flexibility in my abilities to organise the corps. internal financial flow."

1/10/2009,no. sbs don't need a covert ops cloak. if you think that then you don't understand them. --isaac
1/10/2009,i personally like how the stealthbombers are atm - and i don't think they need a covops cloak. they just need skill and good bookmarks what also requires patience to make them. i more wonder why they are not included in the different races weapons. caldari uses missiles so the manticore is ok. but why does the amarr sb not uses large lasers?minmatar could use arties and gallente railguns instead of cruises.....i don't know if this had been suggested before and if i'm posting wrong here please inform me.
1/10/2009,recently eve reached an all time high on players currently online. now iam curious on the csms feelings toward the current size of eve? is things getting to crowded or is it just fine as it is? some points to consider:crowded:-alot of complaints recently about the status of high sec mining since it seems most of the high sec belts are completely gone at all times.-congestion and lag are starting to increase in most major/minor trade and mission hubs.-almost all static complexes/cosmos are being cleared out within acouple hours after dt/re-spawn.more to come...empty:-piracy and low-sec pvp is very few and far between.. more to come..kindof drawling a blank here to the differant reasons but you get the idea.acrel
1/10/2009,"i do not think that the galaxy itself is too small. the individual systems might be too small tho. there is a definite inbalance in the game in this aspect: some systems with some professions can house literally hundreds of players, while in other cases a system is too small for even 2 players at the same time. just think about agent running: a good agent running hub can serve literally any number of players, while if it comes to ratting in 0.0, its one player per system. it might make sense to revisit the size of the systems used for competitive moneymaking, however darius's ""incentivizing 0.0"" issue (the one we are going to discuss in iceland) goes beyond this and suggest that it should be left to the players to invest into 0.0 and make systems ""better"", more lucrative, bigger, able to house more players at the same time. this player-controlled solution pleases me the most at the moment."
1/10/2009,"[...] nvm.anyway, i'm all for eliminating learning skills. it's an obvious flaw, and i'm sure ccp recognize that. it's the kind of thing that causes good people to not get through their first month, because it's imperative that you train them, and it's as unrewarding as hell. if there is something that everybody has to do that's boring and pointless, you might as well factor it out and eliminate it."
1/11/2009,"well, the idea of making the cargo containers and station vaults not suck has been proposed in the tasks. here are the problems with them as i see it.1. the items stored within are completely un-viewable and inaccessible from the assets window.2. you have to open them every time you want to peek inside.3. station vaults cannot be moved at all.now i'd like to address these issues in the context of the tab system, but i also would like to see how we can figure out changes to the cans as well.1. adding the item-tabbing functionality would effectively end this. the tabs could be added into the assets window as well. have the tabs along the top and have the assets display only the items in the hangars under that tab. but if you wanted more customizability you could also use cans to sort your junk. this is where i believe that the cans need change also, because then you would still no be able to see what was in the cans from your assets.2. the tabs would simply be quicker. no more right clicking like crazy opening your containers.3. the station vaults are cool, because they were obviously implemented strictly for a sorting sense, but they are not good enough in my opinion. the fact that you cannot break them down and transport them to another location really sucks. the fact that item-tabbing would also solve this issue also is all well and good, but the fact remains that we should also have the ability to move around the vaults.i haven't changed my stance on the item-tabbing idea at all, but i do see the merits of improving the can functionality alongside with it. i see one to be a broken system that needs to be fixed, and the other, a new ""general sorting"" mechanism that would end the massive clutter. if item-tabbing were introduced and the problems with cans were fixed i think my head would explode.i vote for both."
1/11/2009,"one item i'd like to see is a variable-size container, call it a ""partition"" or something. you right click on it, pick its size in m3 from one to a zillion, and it holds stuff without compressing it. assuming the database can handle it, you could also stick partitions inside partitions inside compression containers - they're entirely nestable without issue. you can transport a nearly infinite number of them easily(to save time, might as well make them repackage to 1 m3), and yet they can hold as much stuff as you need cleanly. combine that with a general container fix - make them searchable on assets, remove the utterly boneheaded auto-lock ""feature"" on station containers(or make some non-secure ones, whatever), make it so double-clicking on a container opens it, all that stuff - and you've got a real solution to this problem using existing game mechanics. that's just my pet idea though. i don't care too much about the form of the solution, i just want a better answer to a badly implemented system."

1/11/2009,"wait, this is essentially a way for people to obtain the rare ores without having to set foot in 0.0 or low sec.ummm, i'm gonna have to go with no on this one.we need to add incentives for venturing into 0.0 and low sec instead of making it even easier for the industrialist crowd to turtle up in empire.make all the changes you want to how mining lasers and asteroid scanners work as a game mechanic, but the rare ores need to stay in null sec and they need to stay rare."

1/11/2009,"yes, because getting an arkonor refine every six hours will make empire broken. 0.0 will still be far and away better at producing it than highsec. actually, what this mostly does is incentivize lowsec better, as well as making mining at least 3% less boring."

1/11/2009,"as always i support the dead horse.i think that ccp's way of handling a subject that have a significant support of the paying playerbase is disappointing, at least give us a good reason to your answer.personaly i think that this should have been made reality ages ago."
1/11/2009,"two points here why they're not committed to this idea, and my counter-points:1.) it ""requires a total rewrite of the starbase system""counter: i don't think anyone who plays eve would say they are satisfied with how the starbase system works currently. hell, i don't think even ccp is satisfied with it. a ""complete rewrite"" is not a valid reason to shoot something down.if your code is so rigid and inflexible to add a feature that could significantly improve the game experience, the problem is with the code, not with the feature.2.) it would require a ""complete art asset replacement""couter: and what do you call the trinity graphics? are you seriously telling me ccp will never replace the art assets in this game? that's ridiculous. for other games, that could be acceptable. however, ccp has stated time and time again that they are committed to keeping eve alive and breathing. there will be no ""eve 2,"" and because of that, the game must keep growing and evolving. if that means replacing art assets that have been ""good enough"" for 5 years, then so be it.i am still thoroughly not satisfied with ccp's responses."

1/11/2009,"sorry for bad english - it isn't my native language.before qrbombers were cloaking campers and their targets were:solo: industrials and frigates. even inties only if bomber successfully managed to web frig for two launcher cycles.in a gang without any other support: using some tricks almost any lonely ship was beatable depending on amount of bombers. bombers still couldn't play serious pvp with very few exceptions.after qrsolo: dumb industrials only. every frig easily manages to escape out of the web, even being scrambled, with very predictable result to bomber.in a gang without any other support: almost useless - missiles delivers no damage (ok, 1/5-1/3 of the damage) to small moving targets with very few exclusions.bombs before and after qrhuge fail: bomb just disappear if bomber was destroyed while it flies.reasons for posting thatbefore qr bombers were able to manage killing inties in some (very rare) cases. they were and even did. after qr they definitely lost this ability. because webbed and scrambled intie doesn't die after the first launch and still have speed to escape out of the web of webbed bobmer before the second lauch. so, at the moment, if you have and intie in overview - you'd better don't decloak. this is unfair - frigs shoud be able to fight against frigs.when i was trying to get the gate camp disappear, there was a bomb launched. but bomber was instantly locked and popped. and bomb did nothing - it just disappear. the offer as iswhilst developers keep trying to invent torpedo stealth bombers, two minor changes should take place:change stealth bomber missile explosion radius bonus to 19.95% per level. so, at covert ops level 5 precision cruise missiles could deliver a noticeable damage to interceptors.bombs should be a grenades. means, no matter what happened with bomber after the charge was deployed - it explodes in any case except charge destruction with some other aoe weapon.*upd: added ""[proposal]"""

1/11/2009,i'd say the difference between trade skills and production skills is that trade skills do not create more game items or occupy game spce (slots) they simply fluctuate prices. also i find in most cases that the items take longer to selll than they do to produce.i like that there is so much interest in manufacturing but think about the consequences. you see that you can't build as much as you would like so you want more slots. so every industrialist in eve suddenly gets more slots and the factories remain in the same supply. i do not know what the situation is like in 0.0 but i can't see it working in highsec.every now and then i see items produced far below the level i can produce for. if that door you want opened was opened it would slam in my face as every item began being produced by highly skilled and excellently equiped (bps) industrialists. you never hear people complaining that there is not enough goods to buy. i hate how in real life every thing is nailed down and controlled and i think that it would be a tragedy if that happened in eve too much. i would like to chat to you in game... i hope that you aren't the alt of an alt posting alt.
1/11/2009,facelessness ftw!
1/11/2009,"not supported. just because a player is on the forums often doesn't mean they deserve special treatment above others who were affected by similar bugs and fixed. that's what the ci stuff like this is saying, ""well they were known in the forums so should be given special treatment"". no. never. period. ci's forum portrait lacking a proper face, and them playing off it like others have does not make them a community icon.sorry ci, you're a good poster and all (from what i've seen) but accept you've been fixed like everyone else who had the forum bug, and do the right thing and ask for people to stop making these threads."
1/11/2009,"i would like that, but only if the overview is frozen when you hold ctrl. otherwise there is too much danger to unlock targets you didn't want to unlock.(i'm thinking of shooting lots of frigates in a battleship. losing one target costs a lot of time.)still, signed, the idea is good."
1/11/2009,"as long as you can click on the icon to do it instead of just the overview(which you can at present), that isn't an issue. although i totally agree that the overview needs to freeze when you're hovering over it. it's really disturbing that i prefer to click autopilot on my hauler coming out of jita than to click on the gate and fly out, because it's faster to have my hauler can slowboat it 15 km than to click on the gate. also, another thought - can we cancel a targeting in progress? it's kind of annoying that it clogs our targeting for significant periods of time, especially when damped, and we can't do anything about it."
1/11/2009,"didnt support own topic, but 100% vote rate so far :)"
1/11/2009,its a computerised navigational thing. should be able to align to what ever you want.
1/11/2009,"my god yes. it's probably one of the most annoying things making loads of bms in a system. and having to open the people and podded window. either that, or a seperate ui window for bming and fleet. like squad/wing/fleet warp."

1/11/2009,"you kill any ship that can't reach very high speed or warp under cloak. so essentially you kill any ship under cloak with the exception of cov ops, force recon, blockade runners (as they can warp under cloak) stealth bombers and black ops (as they have a speed bonus under cloak). all the other ships will be still perfectly in range of your hic."
1/11/2009,"and that is a bad thing?the above listed ships are the only ones who should be able to avoid getting killed by a superior force scanning them down in a safe spot.remember, you would still have to get the scan in the first place. not that easy when directional scanners do not work.that means that cloaks become strategic modules and not ""you can't attack me modules"".its a good thing"
1/11/2009,"minmatar have be touted as the most versatile of races. (storywise, this probably stems from the minmatar needing to field a ship with whatever was available to them i am guessing.)this has been implemented in the manner of split weapon systems.however, split weapon systems are just weak, not flexible.sure, in the ""real world"" a ship hitting you with multiple damage types and vectors would be dangerous. however, eve is not the real world. split weapon systems just result in an inability to fit the right damage mods and varying optimum ranges as well as a significant increase in the amount of sp needed to fly a ship effectively.for minmatar ships to be truely versatile, they need to actually have some flexibility - not a split weapon system.i propose the following change - if a minmatar ship is intended to field up to n weapons, instead of having x turret + y launcher hardpoints to give n, instead have n turret *and* n launcher hardpoints. this also ties in with the ""lots of gun's approach of minmatar ship design. this enables a pilot to field missiles or guns as he/she sees fit.(before the complaints about imbalance due to increased dps - i would point out that the missile nerf means this is likely to lead to lots of ac and artillery ships. these both have significantly lower dps than both pulse and blasters. the artillery alpha damage increase is only relevent on a small number of ships, and is unlikely to cause game balance issues.)"
1/11/2009,"i wouldn't go all the way to giving the typhoon 8+8, but 6+6 would be totally reasonable."
1/11/2009,that turns the typhoon into something very similar to a tempest.

1/11/2009,i'd prefer to be able to select bookmarks that could be broadcast to the overview (own or fleet) rather than all of them. in some systems i have tons of bookmarks and for a fleet op being able to show only a subset would be good. a check box next to the ones you'd want to broadcast so you could set targets/align points/rep areas etc.
1/11/2009,hey!you stole my idea! but absolutely signed.
1/11/2009,i like the idea but not for the reasons you suggest. try a range of different pods that have different bunuses... hmmm if i use that pod my weapon interface is superior... if i use that one i get better agility and manaeuverability. or what about the pod that can cloak? hmmm for a while...or even this.... you must have a certain pod for this kind of ship.i can see why you want the kind of pod you suggest and it could be one of the types available for the deep strike behind enemy lines pilots.
1/11/2009,"no to the idea because it's pretty stupid (no offence though).if you keep clicking ""warp to"" (literally, keep clicking it) whilst you enter 5% hull and are about to pop, your pod will fling itself out of the wreck into warp immediately, you will not get scrambled, at all. it's a common tactic used by exploding pilots. lag aside, you'll go straight into warp. if you're bubbled? you're fecked of course."
1/11/2009,"you're supposed to be vulnerable when you're in an escape pod, its not a combat ship, its a last chance lifeboat which - if you're lucky - might get you back home with your clone/implants intact.not to mention that (/puts on robe and wizard's hat) pods are jovian technology and not subject to the same tech level adaptations that the other 4 races use."
1/11/2009,"really simple, easy request. make a queue for onlining/offlining and anchoring pos modules, so that you don't need to waste hours of your life on what would have to be the worst task ccp has ever invented bar none. in no way does it affect balance, as it would be the exact same time amount. anyone who feels otherwise, i encourage you to go set up one or two deathstars."
1/11/2009,"this has been raised several times before, and i'm almost certain one of them has been escalated. good idea, but no need to support it."
1/11/2009,this is an area of the universe where people are deconstructed and shot accors space through massive cannons safely.... what a bad idea. what gets me actually is why the sensors of ships cannot be swapped out... whay are they dictated by the hull?you know i would be more accepting of the idea if you hadn't metioned holographics... because you need something to project it onto and light would not fool a radar. there are so many reasons this is a bad idea. you need to talk to military professionsls to get a clue about high tech e war.

1/12/2009,"everyone needs to read nyphur's original post. incredible idea, especially with the system-wide belts, and the necessity for scanning them down in a very easy way. also, i love the idea of mixing up the minerals. this could actually make mining in 0.0 worth it. please ccp!"
1/12/2009,"the op says absolutely nothing in any part of the post that would lead anyone to believe that null sec would have higher amounts of rare ores. in fact the op specifically says this:he even capitalized it... twice. i'm saying the op is wrong. any balancing changes in mining that are implemented need to add incentives to mining in null sec and low sec. make all the changes you want, but the high end minerals need to stay out of empire."
1/12/2009,"oh, you mean the way they are completely out of empire whenever you get one of the l4 rogue drone missions, and basically drown in zydrine and megacyte from the loot drops ?which part of ""the density of each individual ore [...] would be determined by system security rating mainly"" was hard to understand ? or the example with 1.0 arkonor extracted 100 times slower than deep 0.0 arkonor ?and that, even if you only read the text in the op (which was, as specifically stated the short version), and completely ignore the linked thread. because if you read the linked thread, you would have seen it clarified with actual numbers too.no offense meant, but what you say is simply ignorant.giving people in empire access to some traces of 0.0 ores will do absolutely nothing to lower 0.0's rewards or draw. quite the contrary, if you introduce this system, it means you can buff up the concentration of veldspar in lowsec (but most importantly, in 0.0) significantly above current levels, thus lessening the bottleneck introduced by tritanium, which in turn means more highends can be used locally in 0.0, which leads to less minerals making their way onto the highsec markets, therefore highend mineral prices start to recover, making 0.0 mining much more profitable again, like it should. at the same time, lowsec mining would finally revert to being more profitable than highsec mining too, as it was intended from the start (and the same way it used to be for a long time, before the drone regions appeared).basically, you oppose the system because you do not understand what it means in terms of mineral prices and mining level income across security ratings.what you fear this system might make even worse is exactly what this system will fix.___in case it's not clear yet, let me give you a very clear example of typical asteroids you might encounter...1.0 system : anything from pure 110% veldspar (""pure"", as in ""no other ores"") or pure 100% pyroxeres rocks to composite asteroids made up of strange combinations like (for example) 10% veldspar, 20% pyroxeres, 5% scordite, 5% kernite, 2% crokite, 1% arkonor0.1 system : anything from pure 250% veldspar rocks to hybrids as described above, but with higher densities, so say 30% veldspar, 50% pyroxeres, 10% scordite, 10% kernite, 7% crokite, 5% bistot, 3% arkonor... or at the same time, things like pure 15% arkonor rocks.-1.0 truesec system : anything from pure 110% arkonor rocks or even 900% pure veldspar rocks (yes, that's a rock that yields 9 times more veldspar per cycle than a current veldspar asteroid) to any combination of ores you fancy."
1/12/2009,"what problem are you trying to solve?insurance fraud can be sorted out by basing current insurance prices on current market value of the insured item.the attractiveness of nullsec mining can be sorted out by making the abc ores rarer.the attractiveness of lowsec mining can be achieved by making certain ores only spawn in lowsec.trade between regions can be made more attractive by tweaking the relative abundance of ores, as akita t has stated.adding new features for the sake of it, isn't going to make mining more interesting. if you're trying to make mining more interesting the only features you need to worry about right now are:making all asteroids generic, so thought has to be applied to selection of asteroids to minemaking finding the asteroids in the first place require more work than simply warping to a belt, but let work than spending days probing out systems in the hope of finding an exploration sitethen again, mining could get quite interesting if all belts had to be probed out, with frequency of belt spawns increasing exponentially as security rating goes down. thus 1.0 sec systems would be ""mined out by civilians"" (they don't spawn many belts at all), while 0.0 systems are plentiful (remaining to be mined out by players).you could even make belt pockets with variable levels of visibility, so better trained/equipped miners can get to find richer asteroids. this would make exploration training a requirement for mining fleets."
1/12/2009,"you mean like grind some l4 missions, refine the loot and swim in zyd and mega ? with isk from rewards and bounties on top ? + some lp ?wow so much worse than 0.0 that i absolutely need to go zerosec for those profits ..."
1/12/2009,"this is a good idea in principle. there are small tweaks here and there that i would suggest, but that would be one i would rather take up with you in private.i recommend you read this thread on the same subject, it went over some very similar points, as well as others you may wish to add to the proposal."
1/12/2009,"ummm, start another thread maybe with some solutions instead of sitting here whining?if you want to see examples you can simply check every thread i've created here where i use a very clear ""issue"" ""solution"" format.heck, i'll even do it for you cause this one is really easy:-------------------------------------issueloot drops from npc's refine directly into minerals that are otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain by mining in empire.solutionadd another step to production. the new step would involve using the minerals to make the building blocks for building certain items much the same way that t2 production works now.when loot is refined, it can only be refined down to these building blocks instead of the rare minerals needed to build them.----------------------------------voila! problem solved. you can thank me later."
1/12/2009,"i agree on the mining profession needs a boost!it is way better to do missions, which in my opinion is wrong, mining need to be in balance with mission running and ratting. not better, just as good.if mining could be more fun also, it would be a plus."
1/12/2009,how about you do that ? you dragged mineral availability to a pure mining related thread while ignoring other means of obtaining minerals that are better than mining.
1/12/2009,"hello all,i have recently been the victim of the empire war dec system. i have a corp with just me and my alt in. i moved out to the black rise region and set up a pos in a ""safe"" system (0.6 to be exact).the pos was a basic research/t2 component manufacturing plant and was destroyed 24hrs after war had been declared on my corp (on effect on me!)i can understand why the war dec system is in place - its to give corps the ability to knock 7 shades out of each other with out the dangers that low sec presents, i.e the free for all.in the case of the war dec against me, i didn't even realise that war had been declared! it seems that if you don't log on at least evey 23hrs and 59mins you may warp back to the empty space where your pos used to be.let people have wars but lets those who don't (carebear if you like) get the protection they deserve from concord.remember - safe space is only safe if you stick with an npc corp and it - sadly -looks like thats where i'll have to go to to recover the 3bil+ isk losses i suffered."

1/12/2009,did any bombers used in second world war have any remote detonators?or maybe all of used now do have?
1/12/2009,"well, its a nice idea. but no other t2 ship has 3 bonuses for its primary skill, so methinks our respectable developers will not apply such change.i suppose the better way is to change a bonus with explosion radius -16.66% per frigate skill to -19%. this must decrease explosion radius from 50 meters to 15 meters without gmp skill and will give a good chance to survive against frig-size target.second way is to change profile damage bonus to explosion radius reduction bonus, e.g. -15% per covert ops skill level. but there's another problem - bomb damage bonus will be the third bonus for t2 ship."

1/12/2009,yes and yes. and some bombs were meant not to detonate till later. time delay fuseing was popular tactic on boath sides. current ord in militaries can use a remote detionation. and i support this aswell!

1/12/2009,"atm, i think the need to train bomb deployment past lvl one is non existant. the activation delay should be much much lower than it is. at lv 4 its at 128 seconds, and the bomb launcher itself says its capable of a 2 sec rof. bomb deployment to lvl 5 should get you closer to that 2 sec rof. i dont feel this would overpower them as you wouldnt be able to launch any more at a target than u could now, cause youd destroy any excsess bombs. it would just make highly trained 'bomber' pilot's training worth something and enable smaller gangs to still deal with bs heavy blobs."

1/12/2009,i provided and put on my blog so it would be easy to find everything. kept it private per eula and requirement not to share communication between ccp and myself. offered to go through logs to pull them for the panel. have heard nothing. trying to be patient as there were quite a few holidays in there. holding onto hope since issler asked for the documentation.

1/12/2009,"talk about totally taking what i said too literally.you convoed me. i'm heading out for iceland tomorrow for a whole week. so as i told you, i was rather busy. having to catch up for 7 days worth of everyday doing in just 2 days is hard. having to go to iceland isn't holiday at all, which people seem to think.i did say that if anybody raised this, i would vote no. i argued that the current system is a pay-to-grief system and it should be totally overhauled before any change is made to said limit. i suggested dropping the limit to 1 in order to prove that 3 is a sweet-spot.i can see why one would want to increase the limit. but it's a selfish reason in my eyes. sure, having more targets to shoot at is nice and all. but it doesn't serve any more than that, giving more targets to high-sec griefers."
1/12/2009,i got to say i started a topic and you said you would vote no. your my elected representative. i didn't even get to say one word about my position and you proposed cutting the limit by 1/3. your supposed to listen to us and take our views to ccp. the system is clunky and it really suckz. i'm wondering why i even voted in that election. the negative 10 gank squadz don't even give any warning just bang your in a pod then bang your in a clone. our corp triez to practice privateering going after high value targetz who should defend their assetz.anywaz take some time to see iceland what a wonderful people and country!!! at least go to a spa while ur there.
1/12/2009,can i take ur stuffz while ur gone?
1/12/2009,support: the limit of 3 is overly restrictive - corporations and alliances should be able to declare war as they see fit as long as they can pay the escalating cost. a new limit of 6 would probably be a fair compromise.
1/12/2009,"it should all be risk vs reward i could agree with ccp making a few totally safe systems but you pay a price for that safety. for example, only veldspar rocks the size of pea's spawn there, fly nothing bigger than a cruiser there, and get no better than level 2 missions but, you will be totally safe. then carebears will have a totally safe place if they truly wish that and they can go there if they don't want to participate in a pvp in a pvp based game but the rewards are much smaller. all this crap ""go to low sec"" ""go to 0.0"" been there done that i don't like blob warfare and pos's. and who the heck are you to tell me how to play the game when i use a legal game mechanics to play, quit being lazy and learn game mechanics. quit trying to have reward with no risk. we need to avoid this game becoming another mindless money grind mmorpg like so many others. edit: support btw"
1/12/2009,"alliances can have as many war-decs as they want as far as i'm aware. the point being that there needs to be a certain barrier to entry for grand-scale war-dec. if you are so serious about war-deccing, then you create an alliance. it's 1 billion, that's a small fee to pay for griefing with no limits. sure, it does get slightly more expensive. however i think that's entirely fair.this whole thing only affects small corporations who targets a large amount of other corps. it doesn't affect anybody else. thus, you can deduce that the mechanic is working entirely as intended."
1/12/2009,"i'll never support this for one reason. you're using wardec as a griefing tool rather then what it's function is designed to be.war declaration should be used for when one or two corporations have forced you into a situation where war is the only option.not as a ""yeah, we're a solid pvp corp so we'll war dec weak corporations for the soul perpous of grabbing their stuff and making their game experience miserable.""while i support pirate like activity. low-sec hunting, can flipping, ninja salvage, hell even suicide ganking is ok but i think it's punishment is not as much as it should be. i do not support out right griefing..no one should be able to dictate to anyone else how they should play the game. if a player wants to sit in a belt mining, or run missions, or transport courrier contracts, they can. however, no one else should be able force another game style on to anyone.if war declaration had actual arbitration it would be much better but that will never happen. so the only way to prevent pvp corps from forcing their game style onto others is by limitations."

1/12/2009,"every saw as beautifully ships explodes. but why this explosion does not gives any damage?explosion damage reactor of the ship, will add a little realness in a picture of fight in space and will strongly reconsider tactics. conservative people certainly will write that it is awful, because all will change, but it's much more interesting change rather than stupid nerf of one ship and boost other, nerf of one modules and boost others.damage type depends from reactor type. ach race have different reactor type. (or 2component damage like thermal+em)explosion radius and damage done can depends from: capacitor size, or powergrid output, or some formula thats calculate reactor characteristics (pg ouput, stock recharge time, and capacitor size) i see problem in fighters that attack capitals.. but there are some ways to solve it: 1. fast recharge of fighters shield in a dronbay.2. drone sheld recharge module, use energy from capacitor for fast recharge fighters/drones shield when they orbit own ship.

1/12/2009,"also the tier 1 mining barge is used more or less by no one, why not give that a purpose also?"
1/12/2009,i do not support this idea. i think it's one of the logical limitations.
1/12/2009,they do exist ingame.you can already put rigged ships into your cargo.
1/12/2009,need confirm on this...anyone can?
1/12/2009,"the scarity and limited resources should come from the material side, not by limiting the number of 'licences' that are allowed to build those items with reasonable me level prints. and removing the t2 bpos's or introducing free for all t2 bpo's do nothing for material side of production. materials are fine. if you want dysp source you can always kick someone off from the moon and take it."
1/12/2009,which was exactly what he was saying should be removed:
1/12/2009,insta warp to safe spots.chalk another win up for the carebears when this one passes.

1/12/2009,"inactive accounts should have no impact in-game: remove rp accumulation, market orders, contracts, corp standings, research/manufacturing jobs (both individual and corp) within a reasonable (48-72 hr) grace period."
1/12/2009,"while i whole heartedly support the idea of turning off rp generation and shutting down market orders. this will not actually solve any problems.you'll end up with thousands of corporate orders instead.say for argument sake i have 2 accounts. i use these two accounts to have 1,830 market orders on the market (max market slots).i put all the slow moving orders on the account i'm going to unsubscribe to. place them as ""on behalf of the corporation"" then unsub.i have 915 corporate orders out there in which my active account can modify. i wait 90 days then resub for 1 month just to enter new orders. wait another 90 days etc.the ownership of the orders is the corporation, not the player. so although the logical choice would be ""remove them as well"" you've now found a way to greif a corporation.load up the sell orders, subsub... it keeps that stuff locked away, but not on the market. imagine doing that to come expensive bpos etc."
1/12/2009,"i'm going to copy-paste something i put in a post in ships/modules, where someone was griping about ecm's, because i think it might do the devs some good. i think eve is a great game, and that ccp as a company does an excellent job at many things, including choosing a vision and staying true to it while remaining flexible and paying attention to player feedback and in-game dynamics.(edited for spelling)"
1/12/2009,"problem:destroyers are a limp-wristed and seldom used ship in pvp or pve. they find their biggest role in pve as a salvage vessel, with most pilots moving straight from frigates to cruisers and into t2 ships without ever touching the destroyer. those who do quickly learn to move on and forget they ever suffered the experience of flying one. the situation is not much better with the interdictor, as they are a one trick pony: fit for speed and/or cloak with an interdiction sphere launcher and use it to save ""real"" combat ships when retreating. since the introduction of the heavy interdictor the interdictor sees less frequent use in gangs, being consigned almost exclusively to alt pilots holding cloak on gates to protect the retreat of a fleet and the destroyer is a real novelty when seen in gang warfare.possible solutions are multitudinous:increase the damage output of tech 1 destroyerincrease the effective hitpoints of the tech 1 destroyerreduce the signature radius of the tech 1 destroyerincrease the resistances of the tech 2 interdictorre-role the tech 2 interdictor as a stealth capable (fully or partial) vesselre-role the tech 2 interdictor as a command (gang warfare) vesselre-role the tech 2 interdictor as an assault vesselmothball the entire ship class and give the sphere launching capability to another vesselthere are probably hundreds more possible solutions to the destroyer & interdictor issue that has been exacerbated by the recent speed changes (though the problem existed long before them), but the proposal here is simply that the issue be brought before the council and a direction decided upon. my own personal preference would be to increase the damage output of all destroyers and to retask the interdictor as a stealth capable vessel similar to the stealth bomber (or even the covert ops, which would make for a very interesting pvp dynamic!), though anything to make these ships a more viable option in pvp and pve would be appreciated.thank you for your time."
1/12/2009,adding my own support to the idea.
1/12/2009,"hello!lately, and always, there have been a lot of discussion on removal of learning skills and related grind. now my impression is that this is something ccp would like to do (?), but the ammount of technical surgery would be too great, and the whine too extreme.so what i suggest is not to fix these sorts of issues one at a time, but make a framework that allows for effective restructuring and reimbursement of skillpoints where needed. so that if a feature in the skillsystem regarded as not at all fun, or simply illogical, could easily be sorted out in say an extended downtime with database updates, and a new menu.in example, if a skill is to be removed, simply remove it, run an update, and when people log on they get a message stating n ammounts of skillpoints have been made obsolete and possible for redistribution. i might be wrong, but it might simply boil down to a bit of ui code, a new slot in the database, and a few more queries. as far as i know, no restructuring or removal of skills have been made since the beginning of the game, and i doubt that's simply because everything is perfect.what this could be used to fix right off is of course learning skills (which kills a lot of player interest early on). another thing that i've been discussing with a fellow player is that spaceship command skills would make a lot more sense if they featured frig, cruiser, dessie, bc, bs, etc. as independent skills, and simply ""gallente piloting"", ""minmatar piloting"" etc.i'm not saying the last have to be done, i've never seen anyone else have a problem with spaceship command, but it illustrates the maintainability developing such an in-house system would produce. thus i strongly believe both ccp and the players will benefit greatly from this long term.have a good one,ted"
1/12/2009,"i posted this in ideas forum where it was ignored. i see this as the most pressing problem in eve today. myself and quite a few of the people i know are about to leave the game all toghether because it simply isnt fun anymore. and i know the people i talk to on teamspeak and myself arent alone in this, a huge thread went without dev reply or recognizion a few months ago. so without further ado i repost in this forum in the hope of finding someone in charge who doesent want eve to start haemmoraging players in 2009."
1/12/2009,"on the eve of the record breaking sunday one week ago, 45.000 pilots in space at the same time, myself and a few friends was on a roaming op in the east. lo and behold, in the three regions scalding pass, insmother and cache there was less then 50 pilots online. in the region of cache there was exactly 0 pilots in space according to the in-game map. theese regions are, as we know, owned by either goonswarm or goonswarm pets. we all know what would happen if an alliance would go to any of the station systems and start siegeing towers, the 2000-man blob would move to the system in a matter of minutes and when the agressors where vanquished the blob would move on leaving again the regions completely unused. this has to change, it can't possibly be the intention of ccp that 90% of 0.0 should have 0 pilots in space while thousands of players fight over a single pos. there must be some way to break up the blobbing and the possibility to defend 8+ regions. in 2005/2006 it wasent this way, a coalition consisted of 2-3 alliances (goons/ra, g/iron/rzr, bob/mc/fix) and they controlled 1-2 regions, sometimes 3. following this rant comes a few suggestions to ""fix"" this currently ""broken"" system.1. remove ice from hi-sec altogether. the empires has ignored the warnings from enviromental reserchers for too long, the ice belts of hi-sec has been depleted. this will have two effects. the revitalization of low-sec. the miners will have to move to low-sec where they will be subject to piracy and in responce they will have to form alliances with pvp corps that can protect them. an increase in ""fun"" for everyone involved except the macros, and we dont want them anyway do we? also, the price of ice will increase dramatically making it a lot harder for the superblobs to have hundreds if not thousands of online and active poses at the same time. it will also be alot more expencive to field 150-man capital fleets supported by 15 titans.2. make jump bridges and cyno jammers mutually exlusive items. to make a titan-bridge requires a cyno, it wouldnt be too big of a leap to assume that a jump-bridge contain a machine that constantly cynos. if you want a bridge to your station system or dyspo system you will also have to leave it open for enemy cynos. unanchoring and/or onlining theese modules should of course take about 1 hour, per operation, to ensure that a shuttle alt with the right roles cant just switch back and forth in the span of minutes.3. make titan bridge use fuel in the same manner as a black ops bridge. this will make moving a 1000 man fleet across the expances of space cost potentially billions and people will start regarding this as a last resort, not something you do 4 times a day. right now all you need to move a 1000 man fleet 100 jumps is a titan, a couple of medium towers (dont even need guns) and a few cyno-kestrels.4. make mining, ratting, plexing or mission running count towards sovereinty. only sov 1 should be obtainable with pos. after that the alliance needs to either mine or kill rats to continue increase sov. i am sorry to bob and pl and other alliances that live only to pvp but i think it is silly that an alliance could have sov 3 in every system in a region with 0 pilots in space and no resourses gets used. to offset the fact that some station systems have very few belts i point to an idea that was proposed ages ago by a pilot unkown to me: that alliances should be able to ""invite"" agents to come live in their outpost. one should be able to ""invite"" one agent per level of the local rats or one agent per level of the opposite empire witchever the choice of the alliance.5. make stront timers unchangable if the pos has lost 1 healthpoint. it is common to have an alt in a shuttle logged off at key poses and simply adjust the timers to ones own strong tz. this leads to a cirkle where alliance a reinforce the tower in their tz and alliance b repair it in their tz. leading nowhere."
1/12/2009,"some very good ideas, but you need to think a bit more about the ""worthless"" 0.0 systems."
1/12/2009,i like the plans you have for ice :)
1/12/2009,"this just doesn't belong, sorry. hardly any people think this would be a good idea. it opens up too many exploits.and it would be funny to see chinese farmers owning sov in 0.0"
1/12/2009,"sounds like lots of good ideas to me. the op definitely gets my overall support. i completely support ideas 1, 2 and 3. i have serious concerns about number 4 at this moment and a lot of other problems need to be fixed before it becomes a real option in solving the sov problem. as for idea number 5, i completely oppose that one, posses and sovenerity system need a revamp but the stront timers should remain as they are."
1/12/2009,"supporting another 0.0 fix with the same ideas. not sure how i feel on the stront timer changes. i think i like them. the stront and repping ping pong is pretty lame. i'd rather the towers explode then get boringly repped into a long drawn out stalemate. 1,2,3 are good, 4 isn't very good and undecided on 5."
1/12/2009,"let's not let the fact that there's a conflict involved and most of the people who would inhabit these regions are currently fighting stand in the way of a coherent argument. interesting, but the economic impact would be that it'd tie blobs closer together as northern alliances would need southern ice, while southern alliances would need northern technetium, meaning you'd just create trade relationships. this essentially removes the inherent advantage of defense. most people tend to get peeved with this when it's a titan + cynojammer combo, because it essentially means ""oh, bubbles. oh titan. oh, time to go look into jge."" a better solution would be to neutralize cynojammers with dds, or make dds disrupt the cynojamming field on that grid for a period of time. easy ways to counter this, and seems silly to doubly nerf it. perhaps a rethinking of your tactics may be more useful.upside: more carebears to gank!downside: sovereignty level (3) sovereignty: adlasdadljw no one likes alarm clock, but it's a reality to make eve multi-regional. again, not dropping the tower right off, or taking it down to 35% and waiting might be a good solution, and reinforcing it at an offhour time to prevent them from stront timing may help you here. i think of all the things to complain about 0.0, you've picked and chosen the ones that have only effected you and your alliance while you've ignored plenty of regions/groups that have small gang pvp. cloud ring, fade, syndicate, the dronies even. with darius' proposal on the table to make conquerable 0.0 more lucrative, it'd help free up certain regions. i think a big part of the lack of 'alternative ways' is diplomatic failures. just because a game doesn't necessarily tailor to exactly your need where you want it, doesn't mean you should deprive people."
1/12/2009,i support the ideas.
1/12/2009,"i fail to see how most of eve gathering in a few systems to fight leaving 90% of 0.0 completely unused for months is an atlas diplo problem?as far as #4. i think using the systems should be a preriquisite for owning them. having whole regions empty of people for months at the time is just wrong in my book. when it comes to our friend dlfgsfd he would need to plant a pos to get sov 1 in my idea, then anyone can come along and drive him out. its not like im proposing the removal of sov-on-map."
1/12/2009,"i support 1, 2, 3, 5. 4 needs work, but perhaps something along these lines, but a bit easier for an alliance to do without encouraging the isk farmers.perhaps once you get sov 1, you could maintain pilots in system to get higher sov (not suggesting enemy pilots have a countering effect). even if it's just alts online afk in system to hold it, it will still drastically cut down on the amount of space the huge alliances can hold."
1/12/2009,my vote here.
1/12/2009,"not that i really care, but im not against it."
1/12/2009,"i still think certificates right now are useless and maybe even dangerous, but they're here to stay, so lets improve them in any way possible.signed."
1/12/2009,"i think they could be turned into a great way to guide new players at least to some degree in the right direction without making all the decisions for them. the tutorial should probably mention the ""starter profession"" certificates as they could give newbies some clue about what to fit on the ship and which skills would help them the most.also supporting the ops idea. the cert settings ui appears to have been designed with extensibility in mind, so this might already be on their agenda."
1/12/2009,not unreasonable. my beef with certs is that the cert skills are at times unnecessary to the job title.example - rare ore refining - for a harvester. refining is a separate job.
1/12/2009,yep!
1/12/2009,good idea.
1/12/2009,"at stealthbomber explosion, bomb being charged, blow up and putting full bomb damage.+ for balancing, destructing pod of stealthbombe pilot.like kamikadze ship."
1/12/2009,bombs are weak enough without another nerf....
1/12/2009,it would be a fun game mechanic.but when happens when people suicide outside jita 4-4 ?
1/12/2009,completely agree with op
1/12/2009,"the issue is easy to agree with, but you fail to adress the problems that cause it."
1/12/2009,"as a small scale pvper with years of experience in 0.0, i can say that the biggest influencing factor that works against small scale pvp and roaming is the existence of jump bridges.the great speed nerf ccp made didn't help the matter either.i remember 0.0 before jump bridges. anyone who remembers it should admit there was more pvp back then."
1/12/2009,simple..out of game idea...make e-on (the magazine) payble via etc like sistemwould like to get e-on but be able to pay for each number via ingame isk :p
1/12/2009,eon is outside the reach of the csm. eon is done by mmmpublishing.
1/12/2009,so can't help on that one :(...sure think this would make a lot of people happy(me included)
1/12/2009,too bad. it would be absolutely fabulous.
1/12/2009,"its a pod, if you are spamming the warp button as your ship enters hull you should be impossible to lock by even sensor boosted interceptors as you instawarp.more resists or hp will not help if you are caught in a bubble, hit a smartbombing gate camp, or just simply get caught. it only prolongs the inevitable for a short while.so t2 pods are a moot point and unnecessary."

1/13/2009,"did you read the very next line? the one where he says ""the density of each individual ore (m^3 of individual ore vs total m^3 of ore in the rock) in the asteroid belts would be determined by system security rating mainly (and region secondarily, with some degree of randomness added)""? nobody is talking about a -1.0 belt being exactly as good as a 1.0 belt. 0.0 mining would still be best, likely by a very large margin. as for high-ends staying out of empire, why? it was a sensible method of promoting interregional trade in 2004, but we've made that so flagrantly easy these days(freighters, jump freighters, jump bridges, carrier/rorqual logistics, intentional and massive ore compression, etc.) that promoting it is a bit of a waste of time. nobody wants pure bistot in highsec, but a taste of it every now and then doesn't hurt anything."

1/13/2009,"not if the pos system is completely removed and replaced by something worth our playtime.wrong, the point it the current pos system sucks and we want it out. replaced possibly by this proposed system, variation of it or something else ccp migth deem worth their time to do.wrong again ...the csm will be there with new delegates meeting ccp people. from a software development point of view the pos system is huge and very integrated into the eve economy and game mechanics. modifying the code is a pain, replacing it is easier.so it all boils down to showing ccp that maintaining the current pos system (patching it with new concepts and keeping on top the current bugs) actually costs more than ""simply"" replacing it (or the silly parts of it like all the linking and numpty stuff - seriously, just make it like the rest of the s&i process)"

1/13/2009,"yes, and we're also supposed to be working for peace on earth. how's that working out? design for the game as it is, not the game that can only ever exist in your head."
1/13/2009,"it seems that some ships did not receive an agility boost to go along with qrhowever, if we are increasing the speed(and therefore time) it takes to get into warp, we can easily make these ships more agile to compensate without any negative effects(since their combat maneuverability is more or less inconsequential)"
1/13/2009,surreal but true. supporting a goumindong topic
1/13/2009,"supported, this massive change in combat mechanics has recieved no justification or comment from ccp."
1/13/2009,"yeah, the op makes sense, not sure about the numbers but the concept is fine.but...how about we give each type of gun a 'signature resolution'. and if the target sig radius is smaller than the 'signature resolution' we could reduce accuracy proportionally?"
1/13/2009,"you could use your corp forum for that. i agree with the original poster, however, that in-game would be better.shameless plug: it's still in beta, but bleaklands.com is offering free corp/alliance forums. they're private and secure, of course."
1/13/2009,sound great i hope we get it.
1/13/2009,.
1/13/2009,i agree.

1/13/2009,"also, another thought - can we cancel a targeting in progress? it's kind of annoying that it clogs our targeting for significant periods of time, especially when damped, and we can't do anything about it.^^^ this!!!!"
1/13/2009,canceling would be handy as well.
1/13/2009,"i support this, as well as holding ctrl should freeze your overview,"
1/13/2009,"the problem i have with this is that it would greatly affect the tritanium supply in empire space.the fact is that tritanium prices have been steadily rising ever since shuttles were unseeded on the market, causing the price cap to be effectively removed. this is a more accurate reflection of real-world economics; in order to make this viable, i think a blanket nerf to the refine rates of all ores should be put into effect - perhaps in a range of between 15% to 25%."
1/13/2009,what does this have to do with the topic?seriously.... this is about training times between the covetor and the hulk... the covetor is a waste of time as most would skip over it.we are trying to find a way to make it useful again during the wait time between the 2 ships.this has nothing to do with the bloody market... hell it probially helps by increasing the sales for the covetor.if anything the prices are likely due to macro miners... not the ship.
1/13/2009,sounds good.
1/13/2009,"just to put things into perspective ... i want to train for all the sub capital drone ships ingame ... so that's why the sin is one of my targets ...anyway my take on the sin was as the ""logistic"" multirole bo of the bunch:1. with drone assist/guard it can assign damage/repairs without needing to lock the target. this makes it the fastest bo in this regard.2. not relying on high slots for damage, it can work as the neut/rr boit has the drawback that it needs to wait for drones before it is able to gtfo if needed. i think a larger drone bay (your useless bonus idea) would help here. you'd still be losing assets but you could have many many spare drones in bay.in my view, widow is the most useless bo (ecm on a bs with cloak sig res penalty :-)), the amarr and minmatar are the standard gank type ships (best suited for hit and run type) and the sin is the versatile multirole one (as detailed above). switching the domi to the megathron hull would make the sin a standard gank ship :-) so it's a bit of loss in my view.again i am not able to fly a bo, let alone use it for the intended purpose, so take my view as pure theory."
1/13/2009,"seems so. i stand corrected. even better tho, then we are on the same wavelenght on this issue."
1/13/2009,"uhm i don't get the point.why remove t2 bpo's?with invention you can produce on a couple of bpc's at the same timend by selling more stuff, get more isk/month comparedto a singel t2 bpo.this also counts with alchemy for the high end moon minerals.(ok they don't bring the same output without immense investions,but you can get a couple of high end moon mins)"
1/13/2009,"if a ccp employee cheats to get a t2 bpo, that doesn't mean t2 bpos are bad: it means cheating is bad.if someone exploits pos mechanics and gets free moon minerals, that doesn't mean moon minerals are bad: it means exploiting is bad.learn2logic. t2 bpos for lp is maybe one of the worst ideas ever."

1/13/2009,"thank you for your replies. they are much appreciated and i will consider each of carefully. for now though i would like to say my main goal is the reduction in time spent mining an asteroid which has already ran out of it's ore say 10-20 sec ago, i also would like to see the lasers automatically switch rocks when the button is pressed and the removal of the bug that makes the laser waste power by starting a neww run after the progrram has removed the target and told you the asteroid is depleted.many thanks silverswann."
1/13/2009,"i agree it would be great to have, but may need to be limited to a small number of skills to stop character farming. but as far as encouraging gameplay goes i find it frustrating and worthy as a reason to leave the game should my schedule become more intense, simply put i hate having to log aver 6 hrs to change a skill."
1/13/2009,"i also think that being able to train a skill that allows a second skill to be trained at a severely reduced rate, only improvable by traing it's relevant skill, though still only covering in one day say the equivelent of 30 min to an hour of normal training."

1/13/2009,"i would like to see a check mark or drag-drop (a la grouping) sort of interface for setting a module as ""perma run"". this means that the module would automatically turn itself on after a session change. you would use it for stuff like damage control units and hardeners, maybe even an afterburner, mwd, booster, or repper on some setups.ideally i would like to see the modules activate as soon as you lose your temporary cloak or invulnerable undocking status. if you run out of capacitor and the module forcibly deactivates it should be removed from the ""perma run"" group.edit:after the first few negative replies, maybe what i'm really looking for is for modules to just stay on when you jump through a gate. i.e. if you had your hardeners (or whatever) on when you jumped, they're back on as soon as you lose your temp cloak."
1/13/2009,you've forgot to turn on your reppers again and got blown up in a mission didn't you?
1/13/2009,"it's an annoyance in pvp as well, especially when roaming or travelling to an engagement, i'd like to permanently turn on dcuiis, sensor boosters and hardners."

1/13/2009,"oh, sure it's a convenience. i'm just not convinced it's a convenience we should be adding."
1/13/2009,i would like to see something along the lines of what you get in world of warcraft. in wow you have an alarm feature enabling you to ensure you spend only what time you have to spare in the game. i would like to see this feature come to the game as well as a countdown timer and a calender ( having seen the post made by someone else).
1/13/2009,there's a clock. look at it. out of time? stop playing.
1/13/2009,try buying an actual alarm clock and having it beside your computer. or play around with the scheduled tasks in windows and get that working.
1/13/2009,ideal proposition. i do not know if has been mentioned yet but i also propose a three strikes system for certian offences mild ones allow three occurances bfore serious action is taken. of course after the first offence some action will need to be taken just milder for low end offences.
1/13/2009,"i am not entrirely sure, but i think that is already common with eula violation along gm's.its like you get a warning for bad personal smacktalk in local if reportet, or a small ban like 7-14 days for the second/third issue.however real exploits resulting into an permanent ban. imho,i only know its case based."
1/13/2009,"thing is, they're making a game, and not a game based on either real life or tom clancy. i agree that a comprehensive ewar system would be very interesting in a lot of contexts, but i'm not sure if it really fits eve. for example, given the sizes of these ships and the sizes of grids, just about everything on grid is visible to the naked eye. if you used that parameter with a real-world sensor system, the targeting mechanic would be ""click on it and start shooting"". i'd rather have buffs and debuffs than no ewar at all. the mechanisms eve uses to make its gameplay are intensely unrealistic in all manner of fields - remember, we don't pilot spaceships, we pilot submarines. i don't see any easy way to make an exception for this without ripping out the whole combat system and starting from scratch."

1/13/2009,supporting my own topic
1/13/2009,"agreed. there needs to be another mechanic for target calling as the a,b,c's and z,y,x often get screwed over in the first minute of the fight. what i don't understand is when you scan a ship down or use your onboard scanner no matter what the distance be it 1km or 1au it does not show the pilot name why is that but when they are on your overview at that 1km it shows the character name? i vote to remove the name column from the overview and increase squad size to 15.why remove the name column? as it stands on the eve battlefield orders in combat are absolute which is not the case irl nothing is ever perfect. the only mistakes on the field in eve is that either the character cant read or his overview is setup wrong. people want to avoid the insta-pop this is how. first set overview by type and distance. not everyone will be the same distance from each other hence when the fc primes the scorp there may be 5+ on the field and people based on their range are shooting the wrong one. solution of course being broadcasts but half the time people dont read them any ways. i think with communication being tougher on the battlefield it will make for more interesting combat a need for sharper fc's not pilots who can call names alphabetically.as for changing the squads to 15 with a hockey for broadcast this seems like a good and viable idea. again it adds diversity to the field without the isnta pop and a requirments for more teamwork and tactics."
1/13/2009,"rather than modifying this so you aren't the first to go up blazing, why not come up with an idea that is beneficial for all?for instance how about a tagging system where targets are tagged with a number, by the fc or a designated target caller, and sort by that column? the first dies, the second becomes the first, ect...another option would be changing your character's name. name change proposalcourse then you just get a lot of l.m.n. character names...."
1/13/2009,"this was originally created as a petition, and the gm that replied redirected me to these boards. so here's the original content of my petition:hi,i was just wondering if it could be possible that npc corp channels be available to anyone if they belong to the same faction.at the moment, it is treated like a player corporation, and leaving an npc corp will often mean leaving it forever. several players i know have even left months old characters simply to reexperience the more vibrant chat channels of the default corporations.i had run across the same problem when i joined the minmatar rms and discovered that rms and run are two different channels with absolutely no way of entering the latter from the former and vice versa. i left a lot of friends in run. :(it also means that joining a small corporation will leave you with virtually no one to talk to but the people of your corp, the rookie channel, the local channel, and whatever chat room you decide to set up. it gets a bit... 'old' after a while, you might say.anyway, player to player interaction is a big thing in eve isn't it? i just thought more notice could have been made on the player communities. so as i said, i suggest making npc corporation channels available to everyone of the same faction (i.e. freely joinable).thank you for taking the time to read this, and more power to this awesome game.eric(obsidian soul)the gm's reply:hi, gm disconap here.this sounds like a pretty good idea.i suggest that you post about the new idea for optimizing and improving the game in the features and ideas discussion section of our official forums.the dev team regularly reads it and takes feedback into consideration while working their hardest to improve the game.here is a direct link to the section:"
1/13/2009,"i don't think anyone cares in this case, but you're not supposed to post gm responses on the forums, fyi. as for the actual idea, i like it. let people help new players, join in interesting chat channels, and get spammed by isk sellers if they like. and it doesn't hurt anybody, while giving new players a reason to move to player corps. supported."
1/13/2009,"currently some 0.0 entities are exploiting downtime to garentee thier towers are anchored and onlined safly without fear of being attacked. by anchoring the tower just before downtime hits, there is no chance for reprisal by the defending/attacking force. due to downtime being 1 hour, the tower will be anchored and ready online the moment downtime finishes.by anchoring a pos before downtime, and using the time during downtime to run through the 30 min anchoring (on a large). we may as well either remove anchoring all together, or call this what it is, an exploit.proposal (prefered): pause the countdown on anchoring/onlining pos and modules over downtime.alternative (if above isn't possible. tho i don't see why it wouldn't be): prevent the anchoring/onlining of pos for 1 hour prior to downtime."
1/13/2009,"wtf are you talking about?seriously, your alliance needs to learn to use dictors properly. and destroyers. both of which are fine. (except the gallente versions)wouldn't hurt to have an additional t2 ewar destroyer, or a t2 stealth destroyer mind you."
1/13/2009,"you've got me there; i've not flown in an outpost holding alliance since 2007, and i'm sure that allows you to conveniently pigeonhole my suggestion to the clueless category and move along. i've done my fair share of skirmish warfare since then though, so i've experienced the game through wcs, various speed changes and many major feature additions. i might not be the biggest eve-geek, but i've been around...the bottom line is that destroyers are usually outgunned by assault frigates (a ship they are more or less intended to be a counter for) and easily outsurvived by the same. whilst the coercer and thrasher can deal some serious damage, the other two are next to useless (with the cormorant's sniping ability of little use in most forms of engagement, and again what the cormorant can do the harpy can do just as well with a higher probability of survival), with the same being true of other races. given that assault frigates are of limited use (though much greater use since the changes to missiles, at least for caldari) and an fc would usually rather a cruiser than an af, i think that lets us see where destroyers sit in the grand scheme of things: struggling at the bottom of the pile.interdictors fair a little better, especially if you're minmatar, as they can dish out damage proportionally higher than their t1 cousins and their interdiction spheres make them fearsome when warped into battleship groups, when camped cloaked on gates and in similar situations. however their size means they can be swatted out of the air by heavy drones, rendering them a sacrifice ship rather than a true fleet combat vessel. since the speed changes of course, there's little reason - unless you plan to bubble and run - to take an interdictor over it's heavy cousin in hac/recon gangs, and both of these roles would be better filled if the interdictor became a cloak capable vessel of some sort."
1/13/2009,"i won't say a word about interdictors because i've never flown one, or with one. the current destroyers however need not be touched. they were introduced to counter tier 1 frigates, and for that they do a fine job. they weren't meant to be tanks, they were meant to be gun platforms.a solution to assault ships would be tier 2 destroyers... perhaps with better resistances or slightly better dps. this would keep them more fragile than the heavy assault ships, yet stronger than af's.personally, i like things the way they are. the skills to fly an af are far greater than that of a destroyer. just my two isk."
1/13/2009,"if they ever wanted to remove skills, they could do this then. i don't think they've yet wanted to remove skills though, and i can't think of a reason that they would. programming now for something you may do in future just seems like a waste of time for all involved."
1/13/2009,hahahahahaha no..../thumbs down
1/13/2009,sigh.. no.
1/13/2009,sage sage sage....thumbs down.
1/13/2009,"i don't see why anyone would disapprove of improved maintainability, but ok, nevermind then."
1/13/2009,"because it takes time to implement this sort of stuff, and that time could be better spent elsewhere. this isn't leaving road corridors undeveloped in city planning, this is work that can be done whenever it's needed without need for far-advance planning. also, if they do it now, and then later need to remove a skill, they're locked into one model for doing so by public expectations that they've fostered, whether or not that model proves appropriate at that time. that's also bad. if you were talking about creating a better framework to do something they do routinely, i'd be for it. this isn't that."
1/13/2009,"a sensible answer. thank you, i agree."
1/13/2009,"i dont remember the exact patch when it happened, but recently ccp yet again swapped out the nurf bat for a titanium bat with which to beat something into near uselessness. we all remember the heavy-handed nurfing of the nos, and now it seems as if missiles are on their way of joining nos as a relic.after the nano nurf, missile boats were again able to hit roaming gangs, much to the satisfaction of the statistical 1/2 of eve who is caldari. however after this it became apparent that they were overpowered, cruise missile ravens alpha striking cruisers into oblivion. ccp, the balance seeking people they are, decided it was time to nurf missiles, greatly changing the formula used to calculate damage against x sized ships moving y speed.now, in pvp it was needed, but when im trading in my raven for a maelstrom to mission in, simply because im tired of waiting for my drones to kill the frigs and cruisers of my missions, it's a bit screwy. the selling point in my eyes of missiles has always been their ability to swap damage type done just by changing ammo, all with no drawbacks like you see on other ammo types. this benefit no longer outweighs their different mechanics over other race battleships. using a tech 2 target painter on my raven with average skills, it still required 2, sometimes 3 vollies just to kill a battlecruiser, which is fine in it's self... but using the same tp and same missiles on a cruiser, and i empty 20 missiles into a ship. now to mission run or rat anywhere that requires you to prune belts more then once, my only option would be paying the insanely inflated price for t2 precision missiles. no other race has to use t2 ammo to kill smaller ships, why should i?my suggestion is one of the following thoughts on how to fix said missiles issues.a) missile tracking mods, turret systems get them, even my maelstrom when fit with 1 tracking enhancer can hit a frig at 30km almost every time, why cant missiles have mods to reduce the factor of sig radius and movement speed in the damage formula?b) 35-40% increase to the sig radius of all npc ships, keeping the ""balance"" in pvp of having to use specific missiles or specific sized targets, but ones again returning their usefulness in pve too.c) add a random value to the damage formula on missiles, one that would equate to the ""barely scratches"" and ""wrecking hit"" values of turrets. taking a turret boat and a missile boat of identical dps (theoretical dps as viewed in eft) when comparing actual dps on a target, the turret boat almost always does more real dps due to the random factord) remove missiles from the game as is and make them just like every other weapon, instant hitting tracking dependent damage.another case in point of missiles failing compared to other weapons (based off damage readouts from past pos sieges): the dred. a turret based dred and a missile based dred both shoot at a large tower, both hit for quite a bit of damage while sieged. dreds switch targets and both begin shooting at a webbing battery on the tower. the turret dred hits the battery for near what it does on the tower, as it's still a stationary target... however the missile dred hits somewhere around 1/3 the damage it hit the tower for, because of the sig radius factor of missiles."
1/13/2009,i do not support this topic. you had easymode turned on for so long you forgot what it is like for the rest of us. now you are forced to join the rest of us!
1/13/2009,"easymode? clearly i'm a caldari character who just looks minmatar right? no i trained from the ground up to fly one, i just think it's a bit pathetic that missiles are now more useless then ever... what's the point of having them when they're only useful using the missiles that're 2k per shotnot to mention, you're no doubt a droneboat player... think drones were the only thing better then cruise missiles for missions <.<"
1/13/2009,no. missiles are fine in pve. learn to small drones.
1/13/2009,agreed
1/13/2009,so what you're saying is battleship sized weapons aren't the best choice for shooting cruisers and below? sounds perfectly balanced to me.
1/13/2009,"not only a matter of bs vs cruise, even shooting a bs that is going more than 100 m/s will cause a visible damage reduction"
1/13/2009,confirming the cursed2 is a noob who can't fit a ship.
1/13/2009,"cruises/heavies are ok, it's the unguided missiles that are royally screwed by qr:rockets do so few damage you're better off fitting unbonused guns;javelins no longer reach as far as they used to;explosion radius is huge on unguided missiles and not reducible by any skill or module;"
1/13/2009,no. missiles are more fine now then they've ever been.
1/13/2009,/yawnsno.../goes back to enjoying his minmatar battleship
1/13/2009,"the missile nerf was heavy. the basic idea makes sense, but it was carried too far. why they changed explosion velocity i don't understand. a simple rate of fire increase (and increasing the slope of the sig radius/explosion radius damage reduction calculation) would have sufficed.that said... it is what it is. yes, it was a hard hit. yes, we feel like we were baited n' switched. regardless, i doubt we'll see a revisit of this change, and at the end of the day, minmatar really is a fun race to train (until it gets nerfed too)"
1/13/2009,the only thing thats wrong with missiles atm is that the explosion velocity of class x missiles does not match speed of class x ships. added to that is the fact that there are more skills and mods to increases speed than there are to decrease explosion velocity.class x missiles should do 100% damage to class x ships (t1 vs t1) as a base. this is then modified by skills and fitting.class x+1 missiles should do 50% (or something) damage to class x ships (t1 vs t1) as a base ... again modified by skills and fitting after the base has been applied.
1/13/2009,"there is already a giant missile thread... probably would of been better posting there.missiles do not need to be unnerfd... but their nerf values for explosion radius, and velocity do need to be tweaked, due to over nerfing"
1/13/2009,"i have to agree with the op. most of our ships are great gun boats but still have that ambiguity and weird hardpoint load out. it's not too bad but but the biggest issues are out tier 1 bs and our dread. out of all the tier 1 bs the typhoon is rather useless (especially after the torp nurf). utilizing auto's for most of my career i can not fit a decent combat setup for the typhoon because of my poor missile skills meaning instead of opting for a good cheap tier 1 bs in pvp i have to spend more on either a tempest or maelstrom when i see all the other races tier 1 bs being used in pvp all the time. caldari get teh scorpion great ecm boat, gallente get the domi a very versatile and well rounded ship and amarr get the apoc a great gun boat that can hold its own. the same goes for our dread's after spending all that time to get in one and avoid haveing missiles my whole career it was pretty much a waste to train up for the cit torp. matari hardpoints need a revamp. as it stands each other race only has to use one type of weapon and minmatar in order to be efficient in some of their better ships have to be more skill intensive. not to mention half the ships armor tanking and the other half shield tanking but thats for another thread./support changing minmatar hardpoints."
1/13/2009,ehh i don't think messing with the high slots is the right way to go about this.minmatar ships should have tweaks to other areas.... mid slots/low slots... bonuses....i've always been happy with the high slot layouts on most minmatar ships...but i tend to fall short in other areas...
1/13/2009,personally i love #4. i want asdfasfds and his friends in a place where i can kill them!and as for the ice belts... nevermind low and nullsec... force asdfasfds and his pals into 0.0. i want to kill them... a lot and force the pay to play alliance already harboring these cretins into exposing themselves totally!
1/13/2009,"if i'm reading the proposal correctly, what it's saying is that sov 1 would be under the same rules as at present, but unless you use the system, you can't get any higher than 1. afsgfklerw and his friends would have to be working for an alliance that already has legitimate sovereignty in order to make a difference to sov levels."
1/13/2009,"too much bad ideas mixed with some passable one. in particular i find your ice idea (suggested by other players at nauseam) very self centered:""i want more targets, i want to inconvenient the alliances. it will make high sec pos a thing of the past? not my problem.""there is people that don't play for your 0.0 sovereignty games."
1/13/2009,i'd rather they were gotten rid of.they are useless at best and misleading to new players at worst.
1/13/2009,"yup, if ineve can do it then ccp should be able to."
1/13/2009,"i would like to see more black systems. i'd also like to see more *different* nebulas. i'd like some sections of space to be vast and empty black expanses. i'd some to have unique and beautiful nebulas, nova remnants, etc. we need ""badlands"" in addition to more empty skies."
1/13/2009,yes please ... i have to rotate the camera in some systems to see the green glow of active modules ...
1/13/2009,"+1, but to the align idea: it has somewhat limited use as fleet members would not be able to see their fc's bookmark. now if they removed the regroup and replaced it with a force align command... but that's another discussion."
1/13/2009,i agree this idea sounds great. i would also like to see the ability to have moveable buttons like windows that can be moved around the screen at set for vaious things such as docking in station upon being pressed. also i would like to see a hotkey fuction that does similar.
1/13/2009,"thought i'd chime in cuz this is on my mind all the time.yes, it is too crowded. 35000 generally on most of the time. when it was 15000 it was great. (but 35000 is much better for other reasons and i can't wait when eve hits 100000)i'd like to see 10000 more systems stretching the galaxy out. a separated high sec region might be a good idea. if it takes 200 jumps to get from high sec to your destination would be nice(that's exploration).nothing to explore right now there are people everywhere.glad to see this will be happening in march or at least i hope it will with wormholes.also with more people we need more items to create and trade. t3 is nice but paying 17b for a ship.....well we'll see.as for lag 700 people in jita still plays ok and way way way better than say a year ago."
1/13/2009,"glad to see a follow-up meeting on open issues. and a great wiki to go with it!i'm personally very interested in issues regarding factional warfare. glad to see that those issues are talked about too. however did not find the issue regarding alliances (corporations in alliances) possibility to join fw - is this issue already decided upon?overall great work csm delegates - you are doing a valuable work!best regards,t 2"
1/14/2009,indeed!i have to keep tons of station containers around to organize my stuff :(
1/14/2009,+1although i'd have no problem with staying with containers for sorting stuff is the various improvements people have already mentioned were implemented. you can already turn that off in the container's settings.
1/14/2009,"yes, but it's not stored on the server but on the client.so whenever your settings disappear (be it reformat or new patch), all container are locked again.fun!...almost forgot - signed."
1/14/2009,"ok, that's crap. and odd considering that the setting is ""per container"". you'd have thought it would make more sense for it be server side."
1/14/2009,"against - and strongly so!first of all - if you are allowed to change the characters name, are you also allowed to remove the employment history? because if suddenly joe average is showing as having been in my corp and i am convoed by a ceo for a reference - then i will have to say ""eh, we never had a joe average, we did have a joe dumbass, but i have no way to know if it is the same guy...""your name is your most important asset in eve. have a good name, a name remembered by people as a trustworthy and respectable player - it is worth more than isk."
1/14/2009,"not exactly a compelling argument. you say ""we've never had a joe average. bye"". the person asking the question leaves confused and will remain so until they learn to read. what a pity.this thread has seen the same arguments over and over and every one of them has been thoroughly debunked. so please stop repeating the same old crap and come up with something new./signed"
1/14/2009,i do not support this. i do not want this idea implimented.
1/14/2009,a principled bump for greater glory!/me signs
1/14/2009,can you elaborate on that ? what exactly is so terrible about not having to log in just to change skills then log out immediately after ?or so terrible about not having to worry if your skill finishes during your lunch break or not ?
1/14/2009,strongly in support of this.
1/14/2009,i too walk my car. uncanny... anyhoo. supported. no reason this has not been implemented before.
1/14/2009,i support this 100%. just enabling one other skill for training after the first would be superb.
1/14/2009,"i'm actually going to disagree with this idea... fleets are capped for strategic purposes, and i can't see much reason to need more than 250 people warping in to the exact same spot. large fleet ops generally involve several groups throughout a system (such as support ships securing gates and capitals beating on a pos), and i think a lot of the fleet size issues can be resolved by creating new fleets for groups that will not need to be in the same spot at the same time.alternatively, however, i might be willing to accept a change that would allow one fc to send a warp-in request to another fc, in the rare occasions that you might need the 500-man lagfest for some reason..."
1/14/2009,that's a cool idea.
1/14/2009,"sod, go the whole hog:10 pilots > squadron 5 squadrons > wing5 wings > battlegroup5 battlegroups > fleet5 fleets > armada13000 pilot battles should future proof the game somewhat! :dthe downside would be that armada command would have to be rank 30 and would take about 2 years to train to l5!"
1/14/2009,"""navy admiral"" (rank 16? skill with lvl5 fleet command pre-requisite)allows control of 1 additional fleet per level (and just for fun... 5% bonus to gang warfare modules per level)"
1/14/2009,i like this approach to the fix.. its easy and simple and improves fleet size without laborious skill training..
1/14/2009,"supported. this needs to be addressed, align times are crazy.edit: to tick the support box"
1/14/2009,supported. with the little common background lag and modul lag it is fare to common to only see the other ship warping off before you can applay tackle.
1/14/2009,"i support a change to the cyclone. the main issue being all tier 1 bc's are worse than their tier 2 counterparts when generally the tiers are supposed to be ""different"" not better but i won't go there for this topic. removing a high slot (no change to hard points) in exchange for a mid slot would work well for the design of this ship as it mostly benefits the tank bonus while still limiting the damage potential. extra cpu would be nice but i feel only a small increase as mid slots generally use more cpu than highs on a bc. i also wouldn't complain with a small boost ~200 to base capacitor.most shield tanking ships do function better as a support ship bringing a decent tank/gank ratio while not having as much tackle, at the moment that tank/gank ratio is too low to use it over other ships and that extra mid slot helps bring the tank up to reasonable levels. as a gang ship it falls behind the hurricane substantially for dps and some what for tank.at the moment this ship is really only competitive to standard t2 fit bcs when using faction gear, that extra money is better spent on a tier 2 bc while giving better insurance pay back and not too much good loot to your enemy (i know a lot of people care about this)."
1/14/2009,"all tier one cruisers need looking at.problem 1: bad tank. battlecruisers (and destroyers for that matter) suffer from having near bs size and speed but only have the ability to equip/power cruiser sized tanking modules. this makes it so only the passive tanked bcs (drake) have good tanks. the tanking bonuses need to either be larger or the ships need to be purely offensive.problem 2: tier 2 superiority. for most races, the tier 2 bc is in every way better than the tier 1 bc while being minimally more expensive and skill intensive.what i'd like to see:prophesy and cyclone redesigned from the ground up. possibly a khanid style setup for prophesy and a speed and/or typhoon style cyclone.overall increases to hardpoints/slots/drone bays/capacitor/hit points/pg/cpu on all tier 1 bcs"
1/14/2009,"the cyclon does need to be looked at, currently its only use is as a component to make a claymore and a slipner."
1/14/2009,projectile weapons need a little love.
1/14/2009,good idea. added it as 4th option.
1/14/2009,"post 5, unless you want to change it to a mining, non-storyline mission."
1/14/2009,"typical of the big boyz wanting to have all the funz, alliancez can war dec all they wantz but the little guyz get hamstung. lavista support is growing."
1/14/2009,i disagree
1/14/2009,i give a thumbs down.
1/14/2009,"same, first fix wardecs. no reason to make it easier to wardec more miners at a time.and half of the people supporting it here are your own alts..."
1/14/2009,"no way. fix the fact that a corp can war dec another corp then not even bother to fight first. add an activity timer that forces the deccing corp to engage the decced corp or the war is declared void. i know, ""but all the decced corp has to do is wait out the timer"". duh, it's their prerogetive as they didn't want to get decced, eh? you want better wars, choose better targets. don't increase the numbers of war decs."
1/14/2009,"no. if you operate in the way you say then fine, but the war mechanics do not just apply to you. they also apply to the pvp corps who are too scared to go to 0.0 and like to stay in empire grieving easy targets.i completely agree with lavista in saying that the war system needs a complete overhaul.bear in mind that war is supposed to allow corps to compete over resources, not to act and as way to slap someone from ""dissing"" them, which is often what happens (even if you don't).what i'd like to see is each war needing to have an objection specified. eg:prevent use of asteroid fields in x systemprevent use of lab slots in x stationonce the criteria is fulfulled for y time (say a week) then the war ends on its own. if target corp resumes the activity within z time (say a month) then the deccing corp can re-dec for free.oh, and the cost should be increased since the aim is to allow competition over resources. if the resources aren't worth a higher wardec fee then why bother in the first place.so bottom line, thumbs down (why is there is thumb down icon btw?) for this thread."
1/14/2009,nice twist on the victory conditions... a bit complicated... but it makes sense.war's are supposed to be over resources of sum such or another.... problem is... no one bothers to be that creative anymore.
1/14/2009,"disagree.the wardec system is broken and needs to be redesigned before the number of wardecs should be expanded. as for the limitation, 3, 6, or 9 wardecs per corp/alliance ultimately shouldn't matter if the system is designed well. at the moment though, it would be too easily abused to harass smaller corps in even greater frequency."
1/14/2009,i like it. at the very least pve would become a lot more dangerous.*edited to give support*
1/14/2009,no. i'm just going to reference about 1000 sci-fi shows where the ships blow up but it doesn't hurt anyone else. it isn't needed and ccp doesn't want to design another smartbomb in this game. it would just create more lag and hurt huge fleet battles. no--isaac
1/14/2009,"honestly... if you blow up a battleship at 5000 meters off.... you should get some amount of damage... i mean for crying out loud... its got a large powerplant... a ton of ammo... and so forth.not to mention that i think explosions for larger ships should be....wellin the words of marvin the martian:""wheres my earth shattering kaboom? i want my earth shattering kaboom!""would make for a neat strat... pack as much ammo as you can in your hold and if they blow you up at close range.... hehehe..."
1/14/2009,"heres a problem for you.war target kills your ship outside jita station.your ship blows up damaging nearby neutral ships.concord shows up and kills your pod for acts of aggression, and to cap it off your sec ratting also gets a hit for each ship you agress."
1/14/2009,counter argument:concord isn't responsible if your ships gets blown to hell and some passerby decided to get a little to close.things go wrong.... and if your in the wrong time at the right place... oops...
1/14/2009,this damage would only effect ships that fought at close range unless the radius was very large.i have to agree if the lag of 500+ of ships and the thousands of drones receiving splash damage it would be an insane amount of lag generated. now if in some way only npc delivered splash damage that would be interesting for mission runners.
1/14/2009,"i do like both this and the suggested issue, even if it isn't ctrl+right click, but ctrl+shift+right click or something.either way, i say yes to the initial topic and also, ""ouldn't that be lovely"" to herschel's suggestion."
1/14/2009,"as a logi pilot, i support this request."
1/14/2009,please please pleaseincluding lock cancel and overview freeze
1/14/2009,pretty please? and the overview frieze. that would make life soooo much easier :d
1/14/2009,"i agree with this, the only reason i stuck with the covetor for so long is because at the time, i saw mining as a temporary hobby to pass some time whilst training for other things on my main account."
1/14/2009,"agreed - i currently use a retriever, but have not bothered going higher as i am mainly combat.should the covetor be reduced however, i'd get one of them most likely, and then probably go for a hulk as well.as it is, its too long to train for, and i might as well go the whole hog and get a hulk.none of the people in my corp bother with the covetor, they are all going straight to hulk."
1/14/2009,makes sense to me.
1/14/2009,yup a slight drop in covetor skill requirements should do the trick.
1/14/2009,"astrogeology iv makes the most scene, for both the skill's definition and the train time it takes.astrogeology is a specialty skill that a t2 ship would need.. not necessarily a t1."
1/14/2009,"that is not logic, it's opinion ;)"
1/14/2009,"i like the sound of this, even if it is only alligning to a mission start point."
1/14/2009,great idea!
1/14/2009,"yes yes, please tell us more about how a covops can find a target, then bookmark it, then warp back to a nearby station (which may be several jumps away in 0.0) make a bunch of copies and then come back and pass them out to his friends. in the meantime the target has been sitting there patiently waiting for the covops to make bookmark copies so that the hostiles in system can be aligned to warp directly to him and kill him. we all know how accommodating those silly 0.0 ratters can be, and we love them for it!yes yes, please tell us more about how combat works since i've never shot at anything before in my life. it would be nice receive a few pointers from you, oh wise sage of the autocannons.or maybe, just maybe, the only use this has is for single ratters, miners and assorted other carebears to align to a safespot whereupon they can insta warp to it when neutrals come in system and be cloaked before the neutrals even have time to hit the scan button.i'm just blindly flailing about for explanations here tho, so maybe i'm way off base."
1/14/2009,great idea
1/14/2009,supported
1/14/2009,"thanks for the replies - good and bad. for the people w/ negative comments they all seemed to be along these lines. in defense, i don't see it as supporting laziness as much as i see it as adding back functionality that should really be there in the first place. why do modules deactivate when you jump through a gate? everything else (spooling up modules, cap, shield) stays the same. i'm sure it could also tie into their need for speed initiative. i'm sure the 500+ near-simultaneous module activations can really hurt the server when a 100-man gang jumps through a gate."
1/14/2009,"sorry more playing this game on autopilot is not neededlets look at what problems your supposid fix is addressing:your mods dont worked cloaked so if your active and jump through a gate you should be turning your mod on only, after you break cloakthe only time i see this really making a difference in teh game is afk travel and leaving stations. part of the problem is leaving stations sometimes your at a black screen while undocking and ppl saw it as unfair to be shot at, while you couldnt control your ship.ccp tried to improve on the problem, by giving a 30sec anti-lock timer after undocking, the problem is in some systems or in systems with giant fleet fights, session changes will leave you at a blank screen. this is the real problem ccp needs to address. without this problem, then the only time auto mod turn on would be beneficial is to those autopiloting.already we have ppl whining for autopilot wtz, this is just a lesser version of that garbage imo, but at the same time trying to address a legit problem.not supported, but i understand what i think your trying to get at."
1/14/2009,"thumbs up, makes things a bit more fair for people with laggy/high-latency connections like mine."
1/14/2009,"i don't see the need for this kind of thing. the whole point of you playing the game is the skill level involved and the outcome of that.for people that forget to turn on a module, and suffer the consequences (ie, reppers/hardeners off) then that is your own fault. don't want that to sound mean but it is. playing the game involves you as the player focusing on these things and if you cannot then you should not expect mechanics to be introduced to compensate for this and actually learn from this experience.yes it is annoying, and i know i have done this a few times not even as a rookie, but that is life. eliminating this would take something away from the game and pvp as a whole. because your skill and performance are meant to dictate the direction of your fight, not some automated mechanism."
1/14/2009,"no. this is rewarding laziness and tbh, this game doesn't need it. if you forget to turn on your module(s) then mabye you should focus on the game. not whatever else your looking at. and as for the argue of jump gates, again, laziness. lets not make the game less interactive. --isaac"
1/14/2009,now i understand how players can stand to have their bps tied down for such a long time and clog up the research facilities. this will have serious repercussions that will not all be unhappily received but after the shock waves have finished rolling around new eden players will just get used to the new rules. it just has to be supported...there is no other rational choice. it just isn't fair.and as for ccp getting money well they are kinda running a business they have lives and need to eat. take some time to actually consider their running costs. i for one and happy to pay because i think eve is a project worth supporting and in hind sight eve tv was worth supporting and would go back and chip some cash to help out. i am considering getting a second account but that might diminish my original and best guy.
1/14/2009,"i am undecided about this... sounds fair in general, but how about market orders for a corp or research for a corp? the ceo does not get to know if an account is going idle - and so he/she has the problem of suddenly have bpos not researching because someone did not pay his/her eve account for a week?hmmmi guess that means i am not in support of the proposal."
1/14/2009,"while i can agree with the original idea and many more that ive read in post that mess with markets etc since it does ultimatly mess with it in the long run i cant agree with well pardon me for not been able to afford eve all the time, some of us have other things to worry about other than eve, so what your telling me is im to poor to afford eve and if if i cant play for say 9 months due to money problems that i should lose all my ships my isk my skills becasue i cant afford the subscription?well tbh thats whats happend to me i come back after 9 months inactive i had nothing in the market that would mess with it and give me an unfair returning advantage. what am i rewarded with for re subing?? 15 million isk 6 months of skill training multiple ships gone removed i dont even have the character because that got deleted too, so yeah understandbly im well and truly miffed, ive paid ccp to play thier game which i think is worth the time and effot to play, and i get kicked in the teeth and told that i need to place a pettion to resolve the issuesigning with your orginal idea not with removing characters altogether, my counter argument to that is ive paid ccp for that privledge why should they strip it from us?"
1/14/2009,you sir are a shining gem of intelligence in this otherwise mentally deprived thread.
1/14/2009,depending in the market orders that could be alot of isk loss by having market orders suddenly end they would have to be suspended.
1/14/2009,how in the world will suspending income and rp of accounts that aren't being paid for going to hurt ccp? that one/two month a year that account logs in to harvest rp?
1/14/2009,good idea
1/14/2009,excellent idea!
1/14/2009,there may be a potential problem that would prevent this dependant on how the background code works.this may introduce an exploit where a player can bookmark another ship in space not being his own. ie bookmarking opposition sniper fleet and being able to warp to it.
1/14/2009,"right now, the t2 nosferatu modules offer no benefits over the meta-4 variants. the modules are identical, except the meta-4 variants have lower fitting requirements. there is no reason to choose the t2 nosferatu over the meta-4 nosferatu. i propose that the t2 nosferatu modules be boosted in both transfer amount and range. even a small 10% boost over the meta-4 would make using the t2 worthwhile. this issue affects all sizes of nosferatu."
1/14/2009,posting to support my own topic.
1/14/2009,"thing is they'd need to redo whole lots of items, not just nos t2."
1/14/2009,"the advantage is cost. if you don't care about fitting, use t2 and save a few million. if you do care, pay up. and as the above poster said, this is true of a huge number of modules."
1/14/2009,"as said before. if your willing to pay more, then meta4 is the way to go. if not, go t2. unless ccp wants to change the entire mechanic of all similar modules, this won't happen. --isaac"
1/14/2009,"completely unhelpful comments aside, it seems like a good idea."
1/14/2009,"i do like the concept of an alarm or timer type feature.in my brief stint playing lineage 2, there was an annoying little window that would pop up every couple of hours saying that you should take a break. something like that would be usefull if you could schedule the messages yourself."
1/14/2009,couldn't hurt to have the option. low priority though.
1/14/2009,tbh i tried hard but failed to come up with an issue that has less importance than this.
1/14/2009,"support.and yes we do need ccp's blessing before making a list, eg. the example thread was locked for being a discussion of exploits."
1/14/2009,ccp don't allow discussion about exploits because they can't be assed to fix them. +support
1/14/2009,"not really far because you read the eula so infrequently. and, especially at the start, the mechanic s that the exploits apply to may not be familiar to you if you've not done them in game. hardly far to expect you to remember a list of exploits that are meaningless to you."
1/14/2009,"let's get this straightened out.if i've got +8 to minmatar republic, why then do i get a warning about being a criminal in minmatar space and attacked by minmatar police?yes, i am a -10 pir8, but it should be concord flagging me, warning me, and spawning to plink at my ship (gate 'police', not gank-spawns).the minmatar shold well enough leave me alone. especially if i'm in the militia and at a high positive standing to the entire faction."
1/14/2009,fair point. how far done the security system do concord patrol the gates?
1/14/2009,"i'm not a fiction expert - but isn't concord something like a un security force - a mutually agreed on security force ""employed"" by all of the empires/factions and with jurisdiction in all of the empire/faction spaces?"
1/14/2009,nope... works as intended...concord is global...it's just concord going after you... i doubt its minmatar navy : o /if it was.... i guess concord deputizes them.
1/14/2009,works very well against afk cloakers.. it only simi-works if you bother to take the time with small fleet of recons if the person is active. but then again if you know your being hunted and don't think you can avoid the gang hunting you then you can always either log or leave system.
1/14/2009,i think the only whiners to this idea are those that make living off if ratting in ravens in hostile space or those that grief/market *****/make isk off intel and do so scott free atm. they don't like the idea of cloaking having counters and it scares them.
1/14/2009,wrong. i am opposed to this proposal and i have never flown a raven and never engaged in intel selling.
1/14/2009,left off market whoring
1/14/2009,wrong again. i don't think i've trained beyond trade 3. and i still don't support this proposal.
1/14/2009,support both the above ideas.i did have a nice solution to the bots land in my lap today however. apparently one of the regular ice field bots in my home system is set to loot faction wrecks. my miner killed a couple true sansha frigs and the bot looted one of the wrecks.what a nice feeling it is to have a bot flashing red. grabbed my main and popped a fully t2 fitted mackinaw. and am still watching the pod warp in and out. so at least today i beat the macro miners. sure tomorrow will be back to normal. life can be good...
1/14/2009,by that logic we also need hg edge and harvest sets
1/14/2009,updating post to reflect all the lg implant sets that need hg versions.
1/14/2009,"imho harvest and edge are completly useless implants, those should be changed."
1/14/2009,while i do agree they are useless implants... lol they should still offer a hg version
1/14/2009,"if i recall correctly, a dev said that booster production would be getting some love at some point, so edge would then be good."
1/14/2009,just a simple request that cms ask ccp to include a module timer for interdiction sphere launcher as they already have done with all other modules.to my knowledge this is the only module that doesn't have any indication when its ready for reuse once you've fired off a warp disruption bubble.
1/14/2009,"this is actually a pretty good idea, i like it."
1/14/2009,"i say merge all the newbie corp channels into a single (and optionally join-able) ""faction"" channel.edit: forgot to support this idea."
1/14/2009,"there is empire channel for each empire faction. it theory its function is exactly what you suggest (you can even join a channel not of your race).in reality, at this moment there are: 17 people on the amarr channel, 19 caldari, 28 gallente, 6 jove , 27 minmatar.the only drawback i see in your idea is the spamming of isk sellers, but ccp seem to have resolved most of it. i would prefer a revitalizing of the empire channels, but /supported."
1/14/2009,"problem: i want to talk to my old friends in runsolution: make a new character in run and chat with them.second solution: make a channel and invite your friends. make it open invite and let in everyone from run and rms and everywhere elseno need to change mechanics.i feel that npc corporations should be stepping stones for new players so that they will grow into ""real"" player made corporations. currently we have this anti-social syndrome where solo players stay in npc corporations and stroke their epeen and scream against ""pirates"" and other inane chat. the chat in npc corporations is pretty terrible. a lot of whining and tons of misinformation that comes from long time npc pilots that don't know anything about eve. i log on my noob hauler/scout/cyno alts all the time, the chat is not good.the focus of eve should not be about npc corporations and this puts more focus on what should be a simple corporation for new players to get a handle on the game.this mechanic will hurt new players in that they are having what should be a helpful channel, spammed by old ""vets"" and long term npc players that do not know what they are talking about. having new questions about eve and being too shy to even talk in your new player corp chat because it is being monopolized by people ""visiting"" with ""old friends"" is not helpful to new players. add in the element of isk spammers and people just wanting to rant at others and you have a bad mechanic.not supported. tl;dr = make your own channel or deal with it, you shouldn't stay a noob with no friends forever."
1/14/2009,"againsti don't want to support anything that increases the interest in the npc corps, as i feel they are a way to escape retaliation."
1/14/2009,/suporteddosent hurt anyone having old players join noob channels
1/14/2009,only problem i can see is that the rookie channel might turn into a recruitment spam channel.
1/14/2009,"well in a way that would be easyer for new players to find a ""home"" in a non npc corp...but i higly douth that as there are not that many corps that recrute people whit low sp's and experience"
1/14/2009,not supporting. npc corps are to stay separate. and i do feel for those that war-deck corps and the war-decked corps run like chickens with their heads cut off to npc corps. so a big fat no. --isaac
1/14/2009,bad idea to idle the onlining. it will give the opposing side 1 hour to gather people using out-of-game means.
1/14/2009,and that is better than not being able to do anything about it how?no one is forcing them to anchor them just before dt. if this is implemented you can still anchor them after dt if you are afraid your enemies will use dt to gather people.
1/14/2009,quick frankly this just sounds like an exploit to me.
1/14/2009,supported - using downtime like this is pretty weak.
1/14/2009,"if you do this, then you need to stop all out of game timers continuing... that includes pos's coming out of rf. skill training times continuing, r&d stuff continuing to accumulate.it changes a giant dynamic in the game by pausing everything during the 1hr dt.although it may be annoying to some, the 1hr onlining time is more of a problem than the ppl onlining it during a dt imonot supported"
1/14/2009,coming out of rf i can understand but your argument fails for the rest of the timers. they are not linked and i can see no reason to tie them all together.
1/14/2009,in all honesty a lot of the problem is pos's in general... not whether they anchoring then... or later...
1/14/2009,"perhaps that is where you make a mistake.destroyers are not meant to counter assault frigates. never have been.the af is a tech 2 ship, comparable in firepower and tanking capacity to a light cruiser. one step up, like most tech 2 combat ships. therefor the destroyer deals as well with an af as it deals with a cruiser: miserably.destroyers are the counter to tech 1 frigates. nothing more, nothing less. they also do well as a step between tech 1 frigates and cruisers for pve. they are actually quite useful if you run level 1 missions, too.the reason why they are of little use in pvp now, is that fleets of tech 1 frigates are incredibly rare. the goonswarm birth is past us and something like that is unlikely to happen again.so eventually, destroyers are fine the way they are. they just are not fine for much anymore.the only thing that should probably change is the tech 2 version of the destroyer, which is the interdictor. those could use a buff to perform better against cruisers and assault frigates. only a slight buff, though. after all, their main role is not direct firepower contribution."
1/14/2009,"t1 destroyers are fine.interdictors are good for one bubble, for which you pay with your pod and ship.kill the offensive ability of dictors and buff there speed, while dropping sig radius.they will still be way slower than ceptors, so ceptors stay in there own job, but at least it won' be at the cost of your pod.giving them a bonus to cloaks like stealth bombers isn't a half bad idea."

1/15/2009,"this was a great idea in 2006, and given that so little has changed (except for the targetable modules) since then with the poses, it's still a great idea. ccp's answers are not acceptable - poses need a lot of dev love anyway, whether or not that amounts to a total rewritethey just came up with a whole bunch of new gates in the latest big patch, new models for pretty much everything in trinity, and are about to introduce a whole new chunk of the game that has almost nothing to do with eve currently (walking in stations). to say that it's too hard to take something that's made a lot of people's lives in eve hard for a long time and actually make it work better and look better is a 'c-, must try harder' effort from ccp to be honest.as for the csm, you were elected to represent us. if we want an issue to be raised and discussed, it is your responsibility to do so. if you think you've already discussed it, then we have a problem; either you didn't explain ccp's answer to us satisfactorily, or ccp's answer did not satisfy us. either way, the action's with you still on this one."

1/15/2009,completely unnecessary. if you want to warp and cloak before some big bad pirate gets you make your safe spot near a celestial.
1/15/2009,"this is just a way to ease things when working with bookmarks, and i say only, because right now you can more or less do it all the same, its just a pain in the ass, you have to keep the overview and opened bookmarks folder somewhat sincronized, overview for align, bookmarks for jumpthe result in combat is the same, those ratters with a brain and a cloak are probably aligned and the mouse cursor over their ship's warp button everywhere right now, they will jump the same, hide the same"
1/15/2009,"because they can't already align to a celestial, warp as soon as you enter sys, and cloak on landing, amirite?signed for me."
1/15/2009,"i agree with many of the negative responses. i see what it's trying to address, but i'm not sure there's really any need to introduce any new mechanic. personally, i think i'm rubbish at solo pvp, and mostly it's because i make stupid mistakes, or forget to do stuff like overload my tank until after it's too late to have made a difference. i like this in some ways, it's the factor of skill or training or whatever that seperates a good player from just a player with a bajillion skillpoints and a wallet to match.whilst i'm not advocating people pressing ctrl-f1 >> ctrl-f5 each time they jump to a new system just for the sake of pressing more buttons, i think that taking some of the brain power out of decisions like 'is my ship ready for combat' would be dumbing down the game to a certain extent. the warp engine doesn't run when you're not in warp, so i don't see why tank/sensor/propulsion mods should perma-run when you're not using them.and - for perma cloaking? hell no. people will afk their blockade runner for 35 jumps and then stay cloaked for 4 hours until they get back from the pub or the ball game or whatever. that really would be rewarding laziness.so, sans-wall-of-text: not signed."

(but that's for another day) by far, i feel that the single worst part about eve can be broken down into a single word: time. it takes time to do anything. a lot of it. for example, let's say i'm a regular player. i don't really like to pay 0.0 prices for things, or maybe my market is undeveloped and i'm not able to even get the modules or ships that i want. i decide to buy my ships from the nearest and cheapest market hub - jita. buying a ship and fittings in jita can take 10 to 15 minutes (or longer, depending on lag) even if you already know exactly what you want and are willing to pay the price. then you fly 25-30 jumps to your jumpbridge, which depending on your ship can take half an hour or longer. you get on the jump bridge, which itself took hours to purchase, anchor, fuel, haul, and fit out. the system has multiple other deathstars to prevent sovereignty from being lost - all of which also took many, many hours just to setup and hours more to keep fueled. you load up your liquid ozone, which was tediously mined from ice for hours on end, most likely by isk farming macros. you take 4 to 5 bridges to get your home system, by which time you've probably passed through systems protected by 20 or more deathstars.you get to your home system with a nice little t2-fitted sniping megathron. you go on the op, and after an hour or two of waiting you have a 20 minute battle where your side is victorious. you feel good about it, even though you lost your megathron. you can't wait for the next battle - but first, you need a new ship.see the problem here? every single fun thing in this game is founded on hours upon hours of tedious work. no one enjoys anchoring poses. no one enjoys fueling them. moving 30 jumps in a battleship is not fun. yet, they spend hours doing it as a second job so that others can have fun. you literally might spend 3 to 4 hours of just moving your little ship around so you can have 20 minutes of fun. a good game designer might look at this situation and say, ""hmmm, how can we decrease the amount of time doing tedious things that aren't fun and replace them with more 20 minute battles?""now, i know that ccp might be thinking ""this is intentional."" yes, you intended for some parts to not be fun as a balancing tool. if it takes a really long time to fuel and anchor poses, it will decrease the potential for a small group of players to dominate vast amounts of 0.0 space. but i would argue that this paradigm is fundamentally flawed - surely there must be a way of balancing things that doesn't require certain players to burn themselves out doing logistics work? as a matter of fact, there is. it's called isk - it's already established, limited enough to prevent takeovers, and definitely would not be hurt by making it far more central to the game than it already is. now, given that this game takes place in a highly advanced future where we have rogue ais that control vast amounts of territory, you might think that more of the world might be automated. and that's exactly where i think the game should be going. i therefore propose the following changes to the game, so that every player can spend more time playing games for fun and less time doing it as a job. i'm not committed to every proposal on this list - it's just the direction i'd like to see the game go in."
1/15/2009,"1. replace fuel with ""rent,"" payable from the pos and completely automated on a weekly basis. no phtsical object is required - set and forget. revamp ice mining or remove it entirely. revamp moon mining so that the pos empties itself to the nearest station with automated haulers moving at a schedule determined by the owner.2. revamp the market interface to be more user friendly. implement the interbus. allow players to order with a ""shopping list"" instead of going through each module one by one.3. encourage market hubs in 0.0 by allowing unlimited production slot expansions on outposts at an affordable price. this would also make 0.0 less uniform and more interesting. casual players need no longer worry about having to move six jumps away to get a script.4. automated mining in 0.0 and lowsec by drones. can be scheduled to only mine at certain times and are freely destroyable without penalty. the player does not have to be in system or in space, but if you neglect your drones you will find that they may be destroyed by competitors. this creates new opportunities for conflict between corporations warring for control of resources while preserving the playstyle of pirates and dudes who just like to hang out and mine in highsec. allows players to be more of a ""manager"" and less of an ""isk farmer."" instead of hiding from pirates, players now get to grab their favorite cruiser and defend their belt operations. the player may also purchase ""defender drones"" to destroy npc pirates - although destroying them in such a way does not grant you the bounty, and concord regulations prevent ais from being able to attack pod pilots due to fears of another rogue drone outbreak.5. replace strontium with simply being allowed to set when a pos comes out of reinforced. allow poses configured in a certain way to have its timer set by members of other corporations in the alliance.6. revamp the sov system and move it away from requiring long seiges. this is already on the csm list, but whatever proposal they make to ccp's dev team should be made with the idea that it ought to be less time-intensive.discuss."
1/15/2009,"ack! make the galaxy small, easy, and remove depth... i don't support the concept/motivation behind these suggestions."
1/15/2009,"yes, the universe is smaller and easier. i think that's a good thing.i don't see how it removes depth, unless your idea of depth is ""spend hours upon hours watching modules anchor so you can anchor a new one."" if anything, the new dimensions and game mechanics it adds actually enhances the game's depth."
1/15/2009,sure make eccm also give a limited protection against neut/nos effects or webbing
1/15/2009,i have proposed this several times before.i believe that 25% boost to eccm mods across the board would be a good change. it by no means would make eccm users invulnerable to jammers. and it by no means make dedicated ecm ships useless as people fitting those mods are gimping their setups.
1/15/2009,"originally t2 was intended to be vastly superior to the 'standard' t1 items (meta 1 to 4), with only faction variants providing superior performance for lower fitting requirements.nowadays t2 is par average when compared to meta-4, and on some modules (ex: reinforced armor plates) t2 is just pointless. t2 passive targeters? what a joke. t2 scanners (cargo, fitting, ore) equally pointless.they do need to re-examine meta-4 items against t2 and improve the t2 performance to be in accord with the extra fitting requirements. this goes quadrupally so for faction ammos (little of which has any meta level at all... except missiles)."
1/15/2009,the reason it costs less is because t2 is an inferior product that few people want. i dont see a problem giving the t2 module some sort of benifit over its meta-4 counterpart for its higher cpu/grid requirements. yea its true of a huge number of modules but that doesn't mean it can't be fixed there too and is not a valid excuse to not change this module.
1/15/2009,"ah, this is not the first thread asking for this. so i guess this one will be similarly ignored."
1/15/2009,supported
1/15/2009,currently if you go to low-sec. unless you are at a gate or station. you have no security.i propose a concord faction navy. it is similar in dps as the guns at the gates or stations. however people in the belts or in missions then get additional security. nothing powerful but still it is a little security rather then nothing.@ the same time high sec criminals will be attacked by an appropriate concord faction navy.
1/15/2009,uh... that's the point of low sec.... low to zip security.... if at all.what your proposing changes that dynamic.i suggest you learn to play the game and deal with the hazards of low sec.
1/15/2009,"jump into a system where you have +10 standings, while you have -10 concord standing, and the sentry guns will fire on you if you're too slow to warp. gate security ships (faction police vessels) will engage you (customs will not unless you're carrying contraband).no concord will spawn, and if concord vessels are on the gate they will ignore you (i've warped shuttles into concord blobs left behind after suicide ganks just to see what happens... if i do it away from sentries, such as at a planet, the concord ships blithely ignore me)."
1/15/2009,the op has a point.i think we should:- get rid of concord altogether- use faction standings instead of security status- use faction police for the work concord does nowedited for support.
1/15/2009,/suportedwhit the upcoming local removal(oh yeah it will happen) u have no way to actualy see if a cloker is in sitem or not...that will make clokers way to uber...oh and yeah i do prefer recons over many ships already :)
1/15/2009,"why, exactly?"
1/15/2009,"many proposals have been put forward concerning 'afk cloakers' over the years... and years... and years that they've been in the game.imo:non-cov ops: reduces sig radius of the ship by 80-90%, but it's still 'visible' in space if the pilot pans their camera around. consider that at 50km even a bs is darn, darn difficult to spot by the viewing field alone.cov ops: should be decloakable by a device (sov system anchored structure), but the module does not deactivate. this will require an 'active' pilot at the helm to refresh their cloaking module. other than becoming 'visible' no other change occurs (to limit macros from re-initiating the cloak).while any cloak is active all capacitor and shield regeneration shuts down, and the directional scanner ceases to function."
1/15/2009,"because it increases the costs of all actions via a risk increase. it magnifies the power of cloaking devices as it increases the information difference that is created through their use.the risk increase specifically is bad because it encourages less risky behavior. this manifests in three ways.1. using cloaking alts to monitor in gates2. simply being in space less3. blobbing.neither of these are good for a pvp game since that aspect of the game relies on people being in space and not always being in a super-blob. on the surface it might seem that players will have an easier time finding fights since they are more likely to land next to each other. but that is if you assume that people will not change their behavior when risk is increased. and they will. in reality it means that whenever you're hunting you have to be constantly using the scan button since you have no way of knowing if a superior force is around or if targets are around. as well you have to be entirely wary of cloaked gate camps.(cloaks will turn a single inty on a gate into a possible 100 bs **** with no way of you to know until they decloak and their dictor decloak fry you). and to top it all off, there will be less ratters and producers scattered in the areas where you can hunt.information is a key component of any pvp game. and eve does a pretty decent job of balancing between no information(lots of risk) and perfect information(no risk). no information is bad because the risk stops people from doing things. perfect information is bad because you will always know whether or not they're going to win and how much it will cost them. and as such, no fights happen because no one is willing to fight. eve has neither of these situations, but if you remove local, you're pushing eve towards the first, and it would have disastrous consequences for the gametl;dr : everyone loses."
1/15/2009,in my opinion we have a problem.currently people will fight outside stations such as amarr's main station. neutrals can rush toward the combatants in the hopes of grabing lewt; with little to no risk. while essentially making it so the combatants cant grab the lewt.i propose a change to make it more like the eve online we love.1. make it so the wreck's lewt is owned by both combatants.2. theft makes you blink to everyone in the system; not just the owners.
1/15/2009,"no.... what did you expect to happen if you decide to fight outside of a station with a crowd?same principle applies in real life.oh and there's plenty of risk... the guy who goes blinky blinky to the original owner of the ship.if you wana get picky about zero risk... the guy salvaging the wreck left behind gets literally no risk at all.""works as intended""stop crowding stations and camping them... things are a little different at that point."
1/15/2009,"it won't hamper 10k legitimate pilots one whit. they'll move to their player corp and continue unaffected forever afterward. they might recieve one declaration in a year... if they've got something to bother hunting.macros make themselves painfully obvious, and a war declaration system is the only legitimate way to counter them. unfortunately there is no way to affect them in completely untouchable (except by massive suicide squads) npc corps.and i don't do empire wars. in 0.0 i can pop them as freely as i wish (and do) without ever worrying. why? because they're in player corps, but they're still botting. if they're in npc corps they're meat in 0.0 anyway.you overinflate the importance and risk of wars as a 'wahhhh cry me a river' defense when in fact few empire corps are ever declared against unless they bring it on themselves by irritating someone (theft, smacktalk, obvious macro behavior, market underpricing) ect."
1/15/2009,this
1/15/2009,"fully supported.it would also be nice if ccp would just have a monitor program that keeps track of how long people spend logged on and active. if someone is mining 23 hours a day for several days in a row, they are either macroing or account sharing - either is bannable."

1/16/2009,"i support it.i have bought toons off forums.. and as a result, i am stuck with some ******ed names. hell, i created an alt with a ******ed name, and have actually trained her up to be a decent pilot. for corp security issues, have the former name associated and viewable with the limited api. since any corporation serious about security will ask appliacnts for this anyhow, why the hell not. set a fee to it. same as changing your picture."

1/16/2009,"thank you for your reply.now why won't you support it? i think every argument against has been thoroughly debunked. the exact implementation is up to ccp, character name history or whatever. which, as a csm, you would have a say in."
1/16/2009,[proposal] character name changethanks.
1/16/2009,"if ccp was to implement this. this would cure a lot of pos issues, it would be possible to dock in pos (game loads normal station enviroment). would facilitate easier lab interfacing, i.e. same as station. and your alliance mates could dock and use labs assemblyarrays etc.all using code already in game!!!! and when walking in stations arrives it could load the new station enviroment, just as easy.walking thru pos now thats a plus."

1/16/2009,i think the answer here is in the names and when we look carefully we will see past the desire to make every ship the best...obviously they cant all be the best...not so obvious to some. interceptor: a vessel designed to be fast as possible to intercept and destroy attackers. bomber: a vessel designed to deliver payload to target hopefully without being intercepted.so this is always going to be a game of cat and mouse....not cat and cat or mouse and mouse.i have seen the stealth bomber and the interceptor at work and both are very nasty... i really fail to see any problem here except that you want to dogfight in a bomber.personally i'd want to use it to ambush large slow targets fitted for close range... and make a hell of a mess of them
1/16/2009,stealth bombers are completely gimp. they are seldom fielded.they do very little damage and the alpha isn't substantial enough to have an impact.it would be great to see bombs forcing people to use an ab instead of an mwd. i think some simple number changing would achieve this as well as the grenade like behaviour that should be incorporated.

1/16/2009,"supporting this issue despite the fact that the data i have does not corroborate. examples follow, all unfitted setups.crow vs crowskilled: 2.1s alignment, 2s lock timeunskilled: 3s alignment, 2.5s lock timezealot vs zealotskilled: 5.2s alignment, 4.1s lock timeunskilled: 7.7s alignment, 5.1s lock timeastarte vs astarteskilled: 7.8s alignment, 3.9s lock timeunskilled: 11.6s alignment, 4.9s lock timetyphoon vs typhoonskilled: 10s alignment, 6.7s lock timeunskilled: 14.8s alignment, 8.3s lock timethe main reason i'm supporting this is that the issue of latency means that lock times of under 2 seconds are wasteful, as mod activation won't realistically take place at this level. this means that the fastest unfitted setup should really be aligning at around 3 seconds, and that sensor resolutions should probably be boosted marginally to allow easier locking.it's a very, very fine line though. overdo it and it'll be dreadful.edit: to check the supported box!"
1/16/2009,"indeed, latency is best seen when running two accounts at the same gate. a ship can decloak on one client yet still remain invisible on the other. (yes, i know having two accounts on the same gate would do nothing to improve latency, but it illustrates easily that it is there and to what degree).this inconjuction with the overview polling once a second, the latency involved in activating a module like a warp disruptor after locking (i'm sure most people are familiar with target up on screen, scram flashing waiting for it to hook then the target warps away) means that a typhoon vs typhoon with a 3.3second window of opportunity has a good chance of getting away (unless he's a newer player, in which case improved agility isn't helping him - just making him more likely to lose a ship)i do hope this issue is taken seriously by the csm, especially by those who aren't heavy pvpers themselves but appreciate the necessity for unconsensual pvp in the game.captain thunk"
1/16/2009,"should it be put into another thread? yeah, the ferox got buffed, but it still sucks. the brutix has its uses but is still fairly terrible compared to the tier 2 bcs. the proper fix for the cyclone would be to fix tier 1 bcs rather than just the individual ships one at a time."

1/16/2009,up!
1/16/2009,meh.. not a bad idea. let's send it back to the top with an approval.
1/16/2009,"there is an issue that exists where if a player scans down a mission and steals the item that is required to get to complete the mission, the mission runner can open a petition to have his mission reset because he does not want to 'pay' the other player to get the item back, and does not want to let natural game mechanics to take their course.as per this post:this is an exploit that must be fixed, as it gives mission runners the ability to re-run the mission, and does not give them the 'risk' of failing the mission itself. of course, they always have the ability to check the local market and 'buy' the mission critical item, however, this gm sanctioned exploit should not be permitted.consider it this way: a mission runner doesn't want to engage a player who's stolen their mission item. that's fine, they don't have to. (they aren't being forced to, either.) the mission runner has the ability to 'fail' the mission by closing it, thus, losing standings, or wait until after downtime so that the mission resets itself.a gm should not interfere with the natural gameplay of mission running, even if someone enters a mission for the purpose of stealing the mission item. what would happen if the player stole the mission item a second time? would the gm restart the mission again? would the player get warned for griefing, even though it's been documented that this isn't an offense?the options they have available are simple - shoot the thief, buy the item, fail/close the mission, or wait until after downtime.i would like to see this problem fixed, so that all gm's are aware that they cannot reset the mission if the mission runner has had their item 'stolen' by an opportunistic player."
1/16/2009,i support everything i have to say. (usually.)
1/16/2009,"agreed - this is a game of risk and lessons. the ""natural"" course of game mechanics should be left alone in these cases."
1/16/2009,actually gm's should do what ever ccp wants to allow them to including blowing up players for random laughs if they see fit.rules are so boring.
1/16/2009,"if someone steals a mission item from you, they are flagged and you should have the means to take it back.supporting the idea already."
1/16/2009,"having thought about it, i keep comming back to several things we just do not have the information on and are most likly not going to get.1. was probing ever intended to allow a person to to use it in this way or is it (yet again) another of ccp doing thier britny spears ""oops we did it again"".2. the rules that gms are to follow regarding mission resets are never going to hit this forum, and this topic, to confirm or deny anything. a serious spanking would follow if they did. i did however find several sections of the eula, code of conduct and rules that (and i'll admit it does not say anything exactly about this specific topic) could cover this as an exploit.so, while i do admit there is nothing written in stone tablets passed down from yon high ccp mountain top that covers this specifcly, the wording can, and is, general enough that i believe it does."
1/16/2009,perhaps i should have posted this.care to reconsider?
1/16/2009,more whines incoming
1/16/2009,"as you know i can not post anything from a petition that a gm has talked to me about.that said, i do believe there is some sort of miscomunication going on between gms and whatrules covering this situation are to be followed.if this is something that ccp is going to sanctionand give it's blessings too, then they had betterfollow it to its logical end, newbies being scammed.players ability to advance in the game being held hostage by older players with more skills. you, and your corp, may not consider newbies worth the effort but rest assured, someone is going to do it for kicksand jollies. and isn't that a nice message to sendto prospective new paying customers.cripes, give'm a chance and at least kiss'em and use a little lube, go slow before you ram it home that eve sould be named eve-il."
1/16/2009,this line from ccp/players always makes me smile compared to wow maybe but any game that lets you convert $$ into isk to replace loses isn't harsh at all.
1/16/2009,"""mission runner can open a petition to have his mission reset because he does not want to 'pay' the other player to get the item back""sounds like a valid point to me. ccp could monitor the data base to track downthose lazy and risk free farmers abusing the petition system."
1/16/2009,"you might have also mentioned that the quote was from over a year ago posted - 2008.02.01 21:30:00 - [17] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------it is perfectly within the rules of the game for someone to enter your mission area and steal the loot/salvage from the mission npcs. if they happen to also steal the mission specific loot again this is within the rules of the game, it is a harsh circumstance but it is allowed. eve is a harsh place and there are often things that happen to you that are not perceived as being entirely 'fair'.they may have changed the rules, might have decided to give it a update, heck a lunar eclipse could have caused a change of heart, who knows?"
1/16/2009,"shoot the thief? how about no... most of the mission objective objects do not have a possession. so the moment you take it. if they shoot you. they get concordokken.buy the item??? they can put the price @ 10,000,000,000,000 isk.fail the mission? hardly an option at all.after downtime? also doesnt work. the mission would be marked as objective complete. meaning it doesnt respawn.so basically the options are... fail or pay up; whatever they demand.sorry but this is far from optional. seed all mission objectives on the market.orremove all mission objective items.orkeep it how it is. gm resetting the missions."
1/16/2009,i thought stealing mission critical items are considered an exploit under ccp's current terms.
1/16/2009,actually it was harassment; as you pretty much have to be harassing the person to be taking garbage militants or something. they only serve a value if you get the mission owner to pay up. which rarely if ever happens.ccp decided to reset missions instead of punish those players for harassment.
1/16/2009,"back up your posts with a ccp link, or kindly stop posting. as it is, i've provided the latest information i have, and what you're posting is pure conjecture.(that's the nice way of saying ""proof or you-know-what's-next"".)"
1/16/2009,"dumb exploit, supported."
1/16/2009,lol...at best it's the gm who is committing the exploit. what an absurd concept.

1/16/2009,lol
1/16/2009,"a relatively easy fix would be to make all mission specific items owned by the 'runner. this may not elimiate all mission required item theft, but it does give the thief a flag even for items that drop into its own container and are unowned within the current mechanic, eliminating the potential concord response.now to the meat of the overall argument. is the thief really wanting to grief, or just make a profit off of the 'runner? if the thief is griefing, then there really isn't much recourse for the runner save trying to get the mission specific items off of the market. if the thief is trying to make a bit more isk, then that thief should probably offer a reasonable ransom for the mission items, say approximately what the mission bonus is worth on average. a player may begrudingly be willing to pay up to a mil for those items if the mission is a lvl4, but if you set a ransom price of say 20mil for it, the 'runner will most likely just write it off and take the standings hit.i believe the theft of mission specific items is just plain vile behavior since the items in question truly have very limited value. however, i can see the draw for some to use this tactic for some easy isk."
1/16/2009,"i appreciate the amount of conversation in this post, one way or the other, but i would like to call everybody back to the fact that a gm has provided the ""official ruling"", and other gm's are not managing the responsibility as expected. please make sure you check the 'supported' checkbox, so that the gm's know that we're watching, and keeping them in line.if not, the next gm exploit could be against you!"
1/16/2009,"that exists today, if i'm not mistaken. i believe that when the player takes the mission item, he is immediately flagged. (i don't run missions - never will - so if i'm incorrect, please let me know.)"

1/16/2009,i'm supporting this as it is a good idea. however this type of base/outpost would probably be more suited as a pos module in an overall pos rework that we really need. player owned stations are at this moment rather ugly and lend towards the poor classic graphics from 2003. it really wouldn't be much work for artists to create new modules.

1/16/2009,"have to admit jamming is awsome, as it renders for 20 or more sec a highsp char into a noob for that period of timenothing feels better/worse than that.problem is not every falcon by itself ,but the hordes of chars extra trained, to jam the living **** out of people.nothing against boosting eccm,but make it chance based just like jamming"
1/16/2009,falcons are far too strong. every fight nowadays needs falcon support. i have seen 40 mill skill point players perma jammed by a new falcon pilot despite the fact that their dominix was dedicated to fortifing its own sensor strength. this shouldnt be possible.dont forget that with a falcon its not just that they are certain to jam you its that they can jam you and your entire gang simultaneously too thats the most ridiculous.
1/16/2009,"eccm needs to be stronger on smaller ships. i'd suggest changing it to a flat boost of +30 strength midslot, +15 lowslot. that way interceptors/frigates/ and otherships that are generally fast enough to close the range gap of the falcon can actually have a decent chance of tackling it and killing it without getting jammed easily and falcon warping off."
1/16/2009,"all lvl 5 :pilgrim : 985 shield, 2250 armor, 1090 hull; 6929 effective hprapier : 1653 shield, 1336 armor, 1090 hull; 6381 effective hparazu : 1406 shield, 1618 armor, 1090 hull; 6385 effective hpfalcon : 2004 shield, 1195 armor, 1090 hull, 6637 effective hpyes the falcon has only half the hitpoints.now adding a little buffer to them ( only rapier and falcon used ) :rapier with 2 lse: 8215 shield; 18k effective hpfalcon with 1 1600mm rolled tungsten : 6445 armor; 16k effective hpdps wise most recons outdamage the falcon, by being able to use 4 medium drones or 5 small drones. so falcon range - 50%, drone bay + 50m<U+FFFD>means : remove falcon optimal bonus and replace with heavy missile bonus ( all other recons have a damage bonus ), give third missile hardpoint ( or third turret ), give drone bay."
1/16/2009,"this statement just sums up the amount of n00bs that have infested eve lately.guess what,the falcon pilot has probably used most of his slots to jam your domi leaving the rest of your gang to scare away the falcon or are you saying the domi was on its own and you just want to whine for another 'i win' module."
1/16/2009,"people who defend current state of the falcon refer to its balance from view of big fleet battles - at least anything more than 8 people or so.i would agree that when it comes to big scale fighting, the power of falcon is smaller because it has major weaknesses that other people can exploit.but when it comes to small scale combat, anything with less than 4 people on 1 side. then the falcon becomes extremely powerful. it's strength - makes its own weaknesses immune to attack.anyway, we don't need to argue over theoretical advantages and disadvantages of falcon. all we need to do is pull statistics from eve database - the falcons are everywhere, most people who play multiple accounts have a falcon alt. most people who fight against falcon lose. their dominance on small scale pvp is evident in the numbers you'll find, it would be no longer a question of debate but a statement of fact."
1/16/2009,"oh boy you lot have got my blood boiling now.i find it incredible that people [and by people i mean armour tankers] are crying about having to give up a mid-slot to fit eccm,when their still able to mwd,scramble,cap inject,sensor boost and many other things whilst running a tank but shield user continually get it up the ass.i think ccp should fix that imbalance before they even think about fixing ecm,i mean its only been imbalanced for 5 and half years"
1/16/2009,no this one has.no. the falcon would not need to use most of his mid slots to jam me. typically one will be sufficient. as the rest of my gang would be similarly jammed it would make it difficult to scare anyone away. even if eccm were boosted sufficiently to be effective against a falcon then this certainly wouldnt be an i win button. the only i win button here is the falcons ecm modules.
1/16/2009,im not crying about having to give up a single mid slot for eccm. a pilot needs to fit his ship according to his opponent. what i dont like is the fact that a single falcon can jam 6 gang members who are all fortified with eccm. that is far too strong. all fights these days have falcon pilots on both sides and the winner is either who jams first or who has the most falcons. this is ludicrous
1/16/2009,well tbh jamming needs to be hit hard with the nerf bat i fitted a hype with 3 magnetometric backup array ii and 3 eccm - magnetometric ii and on all counts i was jammed by a falcon with one racial of each type tech ii and a multi spec tech ii i managed to lock the falcon for about 2 seconds which tbh just is not right and on the other hand aruzu's got hit way to hard with the nerf bat if falcons are not hit hard by the nerf bat reboost the sensor dampners and please this is not about chance i was jammed the coding i would say is at fault
1/16/2009,"yes, and the reason why meta 3 is cheaper than meta 4 is because it's an inferior product few people want. you propose a buff to that?"
1/16/2009,i appreciate your comments but would like to add. that some people are required to move around from place to place house to house and may find dragging an extra peice of equipment inconveniant. also it must prove usefull for wow to still have it in the game. for instance you may wish to meet someone in game at a certain time or maybe several people throughout the day. having multiple alarms will save you buying an expensive clock to ensure you leave on tim. it will also be easier than leaving the game to look at the windows calender.
1/16/2009,lately when i have been seeing corp members replys to peitions they have been getting a ton of copy and pastes nothing showing in our logs and getting their tickets closed when an issue is legitimate and if the bother escalating it it gets fixed.why is it that you allow such incompetence to work for you in game petition system?
1/16/2009,wrong place to talk about it....
1/16/2009,1. you just admitted to rule breaking.2. they are cookie cutter out of necessity.if you need to respond to the petitions every 30 seconds... you end up not wanting to be typing like mad. instead you have cookie cutter copy-paste jobs.
1/16/2009,"a gm would have to be insane not to copy-paste solutions to the common problems. the answer is usually the same, so why bother typing it fresh every time?"
1/16/2009,currently if you're in missions. light drones will mwd just to go 5km. ending up in going far to fast and orbitting like mad around rats. essentially doing nothing.in pvp the drones will do the same if the person is stationary or slow moving. if the person is moving fast. they go fast fast fast. maybe getting 1 volley in. then turn off their mwd and then sink back needing to catch up again.they are quite ineffective.
1/16/2009,"a jason edwards thread about a legitimate problem? what's next, chribba proclaiming his love for plagioclase? drone speeds should be designed to match the target, instead of just having ""fast"" and ""slow"" as options."
1/16/2009,ya i know... but i finally have a real issue.
1/16/2009,"yeah honestly, hes improving. the last idea had potential when expounded upon, and this is a legitimate problem.impressive. :o"
1/16/2009,"very.... um.... creative, i agree with the others posts m8, not a good idea as it solve nothing."
1/16/2009,no support... strange and useless idea.
1/16/2009,"bump to this post so it can receive more ""no"" reponses.oh, and no."
1/16/2009,i actually started formulating a response before i realized who you were.you're the worst troll i've ever seen on this forum. 4 topics in 24 hours. all 4 of them are half-baked and borderline insane ideas. please go troll some other board instead of clogging this one with utterly insane suggestions.
1/16/2009,<-------
1/16/2009,"imho with the coming of t3 these ""lets modify this old unused hull for t2"" threads will soon be obsolete.so thumbs down."
1/16/2009,"not a bad idea, although i am opposed to it. by doing so you are taking away the need for jump freighters. not to a very large degree, but still to some degree. carriers are fleet warfare ships, and they need to keep that role. if any boost needs to be made, it should be that they are able to carry combat ships with cargo holds full of whatever since the holds are small compared to a rigged iteron. industrials/haulers should be moderated though."
1/16/2009,"logistics should be made harder, not easier."
1/16/2009,"read the sticky at the top. the cousel brought up carrier's weak logistic abilities to ccp. ccp's response was yep we know we did that on purpose, go get a jump freighter if you want to haul something other than drones."
1/16/2009,"so effectively ccp's attitude to carrier pilots is frack you, go sit and spin, we don't care? how about a separate fuel bay for capitals that has a skill that will let you increase that? and some way to move fighters into the drone bay from the corp hangar? at least a mom has enough space to hold one fighter in its bay to move it over. i'm more looking at space needs for stront and fuel, go into a combat area and hit triage, it wont last that long. especialy for a round trip. and forget it if you need to drop gear off to combatants so they can refit.dl"
1/16/2009,"this game was much more fun before all this capitol ship crap.i'm against this idea. if you want to haul stuff, use transports. it's already all too easy and safe. nobody should be this safe this easy"
1/16/2009,"continuing with the idea for planetary raids: there should be a base chance for a successful raid on a colony with no military installations of 75%. instead of my earlier proposed 10% reduction in raid chance, there should only be a 5% reduction per fully staffed military installation, with a maximum of 5 military installations effective. there should also be a 25% base chance of a tracker being placed on the raiding ship, allowing the raider to be visible to all players in the system, and to make the raider's ship warpable (whether the raid is successful or not). each fully staffed military installation (max 5) would also increase the chance of a tracker being placed by 5% overall, giving the colony a 50% chance of placing a tracker on the raider if there are 5 fully staffed military installations on the colony.so a colony with no military installations would have a 75% chance of being successfully raided, and a 25% chance of placing a tracker on the raider's ship. 3 fully staffed mil installations change the chances to 60% raid, and 40% track. and 5 installations fully staffed would give the colony a 50% chance to raid, and a 50% chance to track. this gives the colony owner some good viability in using the otherwise non-useful unless invaded colonial marines. it also brings some real risk in small-group raiding insofar as there is a chance you are gonna be a big target whether or not the raid is sucessful.this tracking idea can be of great benefit in strategic warfare, however. raiding parties can be used as cat's paws, setting off alarms in more remote systems, causing groups to divert military resources just before the main strike force hits. as with everything in eve, there should always be a potential downside."
1/16/2009,thumbs up!
1/16/2009,supported.
1/16/2009,0.0 is zip security. if you want to live in zip security. go there.low security isn't low security. it is zip security with a pest amount of dps. which often times isn't a consideration. this has led low sec to being the barren wasteland that it is. if ccp wants people to move to low sec. such things need to change.learn to play the game. sigh. i used to live in low sec. all the time. this was back in the day of nanobs-ubernos. beside hictors... i lived in a low sec much more dangerous then low sec now.and i did all this well before you joined eve online.
1/16/2009,"low-sec is low-sec is low-sec. lower sector status. that means, there is no patrol. you want high-sec security? stay in high-sec.--isaac"
1/16/2009,"this could work. currently low security is more like no security at all (everyone knows it entering lowsec system from hisec one where single ganker can do plenty of nice kills). if players get a weaker and smaller version of the concord for example one spawn for all not for every hostile ship (spawn capable to tank by tanked cs or bs not mentioning small rr gangs) then more ppl will go or at least consider going into lowsec, which apparently give more targets to kill by wise groups of pirates (and larger ships wont be useless except fleet ops or npc missions like now). single concord spawn could make a single hostile to retretat, but if he bring two friends then they should be able to kill a concord spawn and the victim (even if he is in a bs too).low sec shouldnt be a good place to hunt only for small or bigger groups, not for single ship like now. its just to easy to kill someone in lowsec, ss drop is meh it takes 4 days with good rats in 0.0 to repair ss from -10.0 to -1.95"
1/16/2009,"if low sec is less dangerous than it was, why are you whining about now?seriously, its not hard to survive in low sec: watch local, don't go afk, and be smart..if you want high sec level safety, stay in high sec..."
1/16/2009,i hate to add support because this guy is border-line troll starting three new threads in the space of ten minutes.but your wording is a lot more attractive. some kind of gradiant would be a welcome change.
1/16/2009,"no no no no no. everyone who supported this thread should be podded repeatedly and perma-banned from the forums. please go delete your accounts, get out of eve and go back to ****ing wow!this is eve, high sec = starter systems where concord kills any offenders. low sec has less security. you can travel through there, but if you want to explore around space then you are at risk. bringing in concord to this system (however light it is) completely ruins the rp aspect of the game as well as combat mechanics. gate guns that can magically appear anywhere will obsolete any cruiser and below sized combat. you will be invincible in low sec belts and deadspace missions because you cannot be tackled as tackle get instapopped by magical appearing gateguns.tell me, come on tell me why the mighty gallente federation should give a flying **** if you are mining or doing a mission in low security space and why they should go constantly patrol the area just so you can bleeping mine or mission like a careless loser.this is eve, it is a mmorpg. we try to focus on human player vs human player interactions. if you want to swing your +3 atk mace at an npc orc, go play such a game. eve is not such a game and never will be. gtfo forever."
1/16/2009,"low security is very low security... don't believe me? go to rancer and get your ass blown to hell.*snip - mitnal*your low sec system called... they wan't there idiot back.*snip - mitnal*what you propose would turn low-sec into a ""ghetto high sec""and while i do not like pirates at all.... i have to side with them in the fact that removing them from the game completely would ruin the game.if your going to post ideas then at least bother to put some thought into it and stop posting like some damned 6 year old who knows nothing of what he speaks of.one of the reasons i don't post ideas is because i take the time to think it out for a few hours and i realize.... its not likely going to work.... you have to take into account factors that effect the game in long term... not short term.and your so short sighted your blind as a damn bat.go live in rancer and come back here and tell me you think low sec is too easy.*snip - mitnal*"
1/16/2009,"i can think of a better way to do this.make penalties, sentries, etc in 0.4 - 0.1 different. stagger how dangerous areas are, with 0.1 rightly being the more dangerous, rather than simply the furthest from empire."
1/16/2009,"then i guess you better make sure you select the correct destination... i would rather be more inclined for an ""abort in mid-warp"" function over changing something that would cause massive changes to the universe of eve."
1/16/2009,"fixing the acceleration gates would be nice. i get stuck in them pretty often if i'm zoomed right out and cant see.the stargates are fine. i have yet to bump one in any of my ships, including thanatos(tried to get thanatos to use stargate), to where i was bumped out of range."
1/16/2009,"crack open eft. open a chimera fit, kestral fit, and rokh fit. fit your medium slots all to cap recharger 2s + 1 stasis web.overload the web. how long does it last?3mins 55 seconds on the kestral4mins 45 seconds on the chimera5mins 10 seconds on the rokh.shouldn't the larger ship become the far more large heatsink who is capable of absorbing a larger amount of heat? thusly allowing you to overload for longer. however... why does it overload shorter then a battleship?"
1/16/2009,"compare the amount of slots. that should probably be the reason. (cba to check the slots now, but if the rokh has more midslots, that's your reason)"
1/16/2009,1 less actually.beside the point. i'm saying that the same module overloaded should be giving x amount of heat; while the larger the ship... the more heat it can absorb.so a stasis web in a chimera can be overloaded for like 10mins.
1/16/2009,"yeah, it could lead to something like the privateers of the old times."
1/16/2009,"booo!!! hisss thats silly. pick tyour fights better m8. then, you won't have to worry about blob carrier attacks!"

1/16/2009,"dual wreck ownership is maaaaaybe a good idea, but global criminal for private theft?"
1/16/2009,"it's similar to the thread started by the pitboss, in which he wanted aggro to be extended to the killer for anyone looting a wreck. his idea was better. i recommend you seek out his thread, throw your support into it, and abandon your idea."
1/16/2009,"oh yes... real life is so comparable to eve online. even then... your posit is wrong. if there is a fight outside grand central station... people get around... but they dont steal anything from the newly dead guy. if they do... the rest of the crowd can attack the thief.oh yes... the guy who just lost his ship, is in his pod trying to warp away in haste... is going to be putting up a fight with such thieves.salvaging the wreck; not lewting. is indeed zero risk. which ought to be. as it is equivalent to basically going through the trash bins around grand central station. nobody is going to have problems with those people.global criminal is moreso a concordokken deal. i simply suggest an appropriate allowance for thieves. anyone who sees theft go on. gets the opportunity to shoot and fire on those thieves.or not... i have something additional to add. too which he doesnt have."
1/16/2009,"yeah, you live in some crazy version of eve in which theft isn't personal, and involves everyone in the system.if you want a place where everyone shoots everyone, go to null-sec, thats what it's for. we don't need to discourage thievery in high sec, it's one of the few things left to make it interesting."
1/16/2009,"ccp already stated it would open up a can of worms that they did not want to deal with. case closed..personally i find it annoying like everyone else, however i find war decing their corp a pretty effective way to get the loot returned or a similar amount of damage inflicted."
1/16/2009,"they may well not be able to do anything about it, but the concepts we're talking about aren't rocket science. in the meantime, they dumbed-down and arbitary model they're using for sensors and e-war leads to all sorts of extreme side effects... just look at all the crying that was done about dampeners, and now falcons. it's always going to be something when your system is that arbitrary."
1/16/2009,"i agree.if your really worried about salavge, then play the game the way it is supposed to be played - multiple players!!get a corp mate, or other mate to salvage whilst you kill things...it is a multiple player online game, so play it that way and you wont have any issues..."
1/16/2009,"i agree with scatim..the system isnt too crowded but the various aspects need to be extended a bit as there is a lot of congestion in various high sec systems (and not just the trade hubs, i'm referring to belts here..)...like introducing mining of the rings of planets, etc. making belts large enough to surround a planet...these ideas would force/allow players to move about more instead of being stuck in the same 200km area of space...it does appear that ccp want a giant universe with lots of very tiny ""dungeon"" areas where everyone congests.... they need to think on reworking the processes"
1/16/2009,"i think 0.0 is too crowded, in a way. its not crowded with people. if you would travel through 0.0 there would be lots of empty systems. but its too crowded with posses and sov-claiming. looking at the sovereignity map now almost every system has sov. this makes it almost impossible for small alliances etc to establish in 0.0. but i think what we need isnt more systems, but changes in the systems of industry and posses to disallow one alliance to take insane ammount of space"
1/16/2009,"good to know that this is a topic at least. i am not so fond of the fact that you are not allowed to discuss the issue tho. i would like to know some specifics about what was being created what reactions, approx how much of the market was being created this way, and if there is a plan to increase legal output to make up the gap. certainly this will effect no one, i can understand not wanting to name players or corps it is not fair to the honest players, in those corps. i may have missed something in the 100 page monstrosity the announcement thread has become,but there have been no real specific's given out. my mains corp has put construction on hold for lack of materials and uncertainty of the future of the materials market. at least tell us what we are not allowed to know"
1/16/2009,"while we can't discuss the specifics at the moment, there is a dev blog on it's way which goes a lot more in-depth into what we discussed in our pos exploit meeting with ccp. and no, no names are named."
1/16/2009,"i disagree...skins for the ui would have no effect for macro'ing...we arent talking about modifiying the game engine or process, just the look of screen colors, transparency colors, etc..."
1/16/2009,"ccp and players would never allow half of the ""improvements"" you've suggested. yes, because they can be used as exploits!!!what we are referring to is screen displays only...like moving the shields/armour/hull/capacity display to the top of the screen, or the bottom right. change it to light blue instead of white with damage as yellow instead of red, allow the slots to be to the left of the shield display instead of the right...all these things would be client specific, based upon xml data (if file doesnt exist then use default settings, etc). we are not talking about any sort of data mining for t he ui, only skins that other programs have the ability to do....<sarcasm mode on>there would be no way to macro this... oh hang on, you could get a macro to auto change colours every two minutes. wow what an exploit!!!!!<sarcasm mode off>"
1/16/2009,"my point is this: developers never intend for their apis or customisation tools to be used for exploits but sometimes they are because someone else finds a security flaw. my examples are deliberately over-exagerated as i stated in the original post. some people beleive that a ""read only"" file like an xml file or an image is completely safe because it's not executable code. the true is that a 'hacker' can sometimes embed certain character sequences or codes or data in the file that can cause the reading program to beheive abnormally or to inject executable code. it is a risk. maybe not a huge risk, but things like this do happen.<sarcasm mode on>you're probably right. there is absolutely no history of software or games containing security holes and bugs.<sarcasm mode off>"
1/16/2009,"sorry if this idea has already been thought of, but i havent seen it so i thought id post it....instead of adding bookmark to the context menu, what about adding the bookmarking option to the shortcut keys list? it doesnt have to have a key assigned by default, but those who want it will use it. my idea is to have the default name auto assigned (with the bookmark autoincrementing if the same name already exists).benefits: very little programming needs to be done.drawbacks: name of bookmark cant be changed by default, but players would have to go to p&p to change the bookmark name. but it allows the saving of ""safe-spots"".ideas?other benefits? drawbacks?"

1/17/2009,"this needs to be a top priority fix.there was no good reason for making it harder to lock someone before they're able to get away. the balance was good as it was, and noone was calling for this change. the new lock time/time to enter warp balance is particularly painful with frig vs. frig situations, where latency now very often is the deciding factor. this was already a problem before the change, but a small enough problem to be acceptable. now, it no longer is.being unable to lock someone in time due to lag - and we're not talking fleet battle lag here, but simply the normal ""background lag"" of any, even almost empty, systems - is incredibly frustrating, and undermines the whole pvp experience.like someone said above, the balance we're talking about is very delicate and a re-balancing measure could easily be overdone. i'm not asking for any drastic changes, or a party favor done to me as a pirate so i can omg kill moar bearz!!1!, but simply, like the op says, that this balance be restored to it's previous values.v"

1/17/2009,"i hate to derail my own thread but to be honest the ferox isn't that bad for a tier 1 battle cruiser. the only reason that people don't like it is because it's a rail boat instead of a missile boat.back on topic: it's not possible for the devs to consider every possible angle in the game that a single nerf might effect and even more impossible for them to forsee how a series of nerfs will cripple a ship until someone raises their hand and points it out.the cyclone is the result of a series of unrelated nerfs that have all culminated in the ship being nearly unfittable, and what is possible to squeeze on it isn't worth taking into combat."

1/17/2009,"i think the second part of that phrase should be kept with the first: that guy has 10 standing with the first agent (the one you get at the end of the training) and no standing with any other agents. sure it is possible to get a mission reset when:1) you are a very young character and you did some error generated by inexperienceor 2) if the mission failed for some bug that the gm can verify.i think that no gm will reset a mission if the target item was stolen by another player unless it was one of the starting missions done in the school system by new players.but then harassing new players in the starting systems can be a bannable offence, while doing the same thing in all the rest of eve is not a problem.edit: spelling"
1/17/2009,"i've heard reports of it from a few of our alliance members, whereby they were not in starter systems, and the missions were immediately respawned, so i do believe that it might happen, if even sporadically. my reason for this vote is to bring to light the possibility that the gm's might not have a 'rulebook' per se, as much as a 'go with your gut on this one' when it comes to resetting missions. (hell - you never know if the mission runner hasn't said, ""i've killed everything, and the mission item didn't drop"" to get the gm to intervene.) in this specific instance, it affects more than the runner, and that's the reason for my request.qft. starter systems have been off limit for a long time now."
1/17/2009,fully supported ! the question is: how common is this situation ? i've been probed out once in my entire career ... failing a mission is no deal to me at all.gosh ... i can't believe i'm in support of griefers
1/17/2009,"first: in your op you state that mission are ""reset"" like gospel truth, without any confirmation from a credible source (again a guy that has never run a mission is not a credible source);second: this is the second time is see this thread, with the same arguments (not sure if done by the same player and not interested enough to research it through the forum), the same flimsy ""evidence"" of some guy saying that some other guye has sad that. it seem more a campaign by some people fearing an instancing of missions or some change in the ""crucial loot"" mechanism that a real complaint of something happening. so someone has ever tried to get a mission reset because someone has stolen the loot? it worked? some reply by people that actually do missions and don't steal loot and salvage for isk and giggles would be much more credible."
1/17/2009,this/thumbs up
1/17/2009,"itt: people missing the point. regardless of your personal view of who's credible (and i'm beyond reproach, tyvm - why do you think i'm not an npc ninja?) or not, don't you think supporting a 'fair and just gm exploit resolution rulebook' is a good idea?if not, feel free to not respond, because i'm leaning towards that chance that you might be trolling my thread."
1/17/2009,"supported - this is a blatant exploit of the petition system by both the players and any gms involved. i have done this in the past as a way to get money from mission runners. unfortunately one of them shot me, losing his ship, and another just refused to pay, but at least their decision resulted in loss of standings so they had some incentive to pay up. i don't appreciate how ccp seem to be constantly making highsec safer."
1/17/2009,"nah, judging by some of his posts he just thinks he knows everything.offical stance: no problem here, move on out people, nothing to see...btw: that gm's don't have a guide of rules for resetting missions and go with their gut... i think that's true of most of the things that happen in this game not just missions."
1/17/2009,"oh and supported. if they aren't resetting missions, then where are the threads of outcry from the mission running community?"
1/17/2009,"i'm sorry, ""gm sanctioned exploit"" sounds very much like the game rules to me and a bad case of sour grapes on your part"
1/17/2009,do you think the rules (if they exist) state:if you find a juicy mission and claim that another player took your mission critical object regardless of whether said item was taken or not - then please feel free to contact a gm to have the mission reset.
1/17/2009,"as jason edwards stated before, your options in this instance are really more limited than may appear. how else to complete the mission if the person who took the loot is ransoming it beyond your ability to pay, and the mission is flagged as completed and thus will not respawn with the next dt?"
1/17/2009,"then tough luck - you had the chance to stop the mission item from being taken because the thief got aggro. if the thief really wants to screw you over, he can do, and that's what is great about eve. you can always screw him over later on in some way if you really want revenge.however, it is very unlikely that any thief would demand an unreasonable ransom for an item that is otherwise worthless. they want to make money just as much as you do, and there's no point demanding an amount that won't be payed. a reasonable amount for the standings for a l4 mission would probably be around 20 mill, which is what, about an hour of grinding?essentially, stop crying, and learn to negotiate."
1/17/2009,"if stealing the mission critical loot is not an exploit, and is harrassment that goes unpunished, what's to stop me stealing that loot from good missions with another account and then getting them reset? or getting a friend to do it on an alt. maybe for your example, the objective should not be flagged as 'complete' until you have taken the item back to claim the reward and the mission itself is completed."
1/17/2009,supported
1/17/2009,and your a hella ******.
1/17/2009,"i am sure to have already seen and voted a similar suggestion, but repetita iuvant."
1/17/2009,ummm i can't really think why i would want to sort by meta level.but i would like an easy way to see from assets:-all of my ships-all of my t2 items-stuff in cargo containersi support making assets screen better but this specific change is meh.
1/17/2009,i support improving inventory management
1/17/2009,easily supported
1/17/2009,"you don't do pve combat, do you?"
1/17/2009,supported. any improvements to inventory management are very welcome and essentially necessary at this point.
1/17/2009,"i have all of the good meta loot from missions memorized. i think most of the mission runners do as well because the missions and loot are exactly the same eg. you get x set of drops from guristas and y set of drops from sanshas. not all meta 4 loot is worth a damn either, take accommodation large reppers for example. however an arby hml or a unstable medium neut is cash money. sort by type works fine on the assets screen. if you are a mission runner, you don't anything via the assets screen, you drag meta loot into a can and haul it to a trade hub to sell it.do you do pve combat?"
1/17/2009,"owned. maybe poor old heschel has been stuck in hakeri working the quiet level four agents there so long that he has forgotten players may have systems other than his own for sorting loot. very good point vaal.and supported, just to make life easier"
1/17/2009,anything to improve asset management...ak
1/17/2009,"in my humble opinion, pvp in this game started down a slippery slope back in early 2006. each successive major expansion has added elements to the game which make it more and more difficult to engage in non-consensual pvp; which i consider to be one of the major foundations that this game is predicated upon.does this mean that i believe that no fights are taking place in eve anymore? no at all, but i do believe that fights are moving more and more towards fleet battles and shoving piracy, faction warfare and skirmish warfare aside.a few of these suggestions probably could warrant their own thread, but i don't want to behave like some people do in this section of the forums and slap every half witted idea i have into a new thread.here we go:1) make local chat delayed mode. at the same time, give the scanner screen a passive ""always on"" mode that is chance based, linked to signature radius, and is system wide. when turned on it will constantly scan the entire system, it has a chance based ability to notice incoming ships based on their signature radius. i.e. a rifter may not ever be detected while on the other hand a thanatos has zero chance of hiding.2) reduce the size of all non 0.0 chokepoint gates to the size of the original amarr gate.3) roll back the agility boost from quantum rise. this is a free pass for anything cruiser sized and lower... and when coupled with the ginormous new warp gates they are simply invincible.4) give haulers and industrials a 99% reduction in cpu cost of warp core stabilizers and make them cost 5000 cpu to fit. haulers and industrials don't have the means to defend themselves, combat ships do. we need more standing and fighting in this game and less running away like sissy girls.5) remove warp to zero and replace it with a skill called warp accuracy. this skill will reduce how close you can warp to a gate by 2 km per level. i.e. lvl 5 warp accuracy allows you to warp to within 5km instead of 15.6) raise insurance payout of t2 ships to within a reasonable cost of the hulls. 75% would be reasonable and would cause people to reconsider standing and fighting instead of running scared.7) remove jump bridges or raise the fuel cost for jump bridges by at least double to discourage using them 100% of the time. jump bridges are a free pass from pvp, and allow alliances to police way more territory than they have any business holding in the first place. i.e. smashkill had no real business holding all of geminate, they simply used jump bridges to police it and when a dedicated alliance came knocking they crumbled in less than a month.8) station hugging. undocking from a station should automatically place the player 5,000m from the station and moving away at full speed. if you undock, then you should be ready to fight, if not, then wow is thatta way.9) cloaking devices. cloaks should all have their cpu raised to 5000 and all ships designed to fit them should have a 99% cpu reduction. recons, bombers, black ops... ect.10) trial accounts should not be allowed to enter low sec or null sec. if you want to scout then pay for your second account, ask a friend to scout you or fly something that you can afford to lose.11) npc corporations should charge taxes based on skillpoints. the more skillpoints you have, the more they tax you. a 30 million sp char in an npc corp would be paying 50% taxes as an example.12) corporations who leave an alliance during a war should still be attackable during the duration of the initial war. after the initial period they will not longer be legal targets."
1/17/2009,wow... quite refreshing to see a pvp'er with enough foresight to actually keep balance in check.some of your ideas however are slightly flawed... but far better than a lot of the stuff i keep seeing... ill wait and watch for comments before i make my own conclusions.
1/17/2009,"some good, some bad, many interesting. i think 2, 6, 7, 8, and 12 are good. 1, 3, and 9 are real problems but i think your solutions need work. 4 was basically solved with the stab nerf a couple years ago, and even more so with the new importance of scrams - if combat ships want to gimp themselves for questionable benefit, let them. 5 is interesting, but ultimately doomed to failure and database-breaking numbers of instas. and 10 and 11 are just dumb. i think you're missing the more fundamental problem, though - people don't have enough reason to go to areas where nonconsensual pvp happens. lowsec sucks, and 0.0 is dominated by gargantuan alliances. fix the risk/reward for small groups in unsecured space, and you'll get a lot more action going on, even if none of these changes are implemented."
1/17/2009,i agree.. the percieved iron grip of the mega-alliances and the inability of most small groups to learn to adapt to the threats/gain the rewards of unsecured space is the key.
1/17/2009,"risk reward for 0.0 is another topic entirely.personally, i find hundreds and hundreds of people in null sec every day. the incentives must already be there at least in some small part. the only problem is that ccp has handed them a smorgasbord of tricks and tactics with which to avoid pvp.should there be methods to avoid combat? yes, there should. however, currently the field is heavily skewed in favor of avoiding combat rather than engaging in it. all anyone has to do is refer to my partial list below for some of the most common methods of avoidance.us pvp'ers on the other hand get this and this. two methods to engage in pvp vs. 12+ to avoid it? yeah, that's a bit skewed."
1/17/2009,"the rewards are there... just they only draw professional 0.0 survivalists. when i think back to a couple years ago, it was actually a lot easier to roam free and avoid combat:everyone had libraries of insta-jump bookmarks. stabs had no penalites. there were no ships that could use warp-bubbles. what has changed is the environment: logistics/hauling almost completely avoids the gate systems. small runners get caught in interdictor bubbles. shopping and travel are just a jump-clone away. cynos pop open left and right like fireworks in some areas. if you're in with the local power-alliance; you basically have a different solar system and different travel network than independent or hostile roamers. why bother with the potentially dangerous main roads when you have private and almost 100% secure back-stage passes?"
1/17/2009,"i was referring as much to lowsec as to 0.0, and it's not another issue at all. more people = more fights, and you get more people when it sucks less. also, a simple enumeration of the modules that let you fight vs modules that let you not fight is entirely useless. it's the equivalent of saying that because there are 24 frigates and only 12 battleships, frigates must be twice as good. besides, you forgot a bunch of them - this, this, and this, off the top of my head."
1/17/2009,"oh - i really like ideas: 1, 7, and 12"
1/17/2009,"great, well thought-out list neesa. i also think you should not be able to jump through a gate if you are warp scrambled. maybe that's taking it a bit too far hehe."
1/17/2009,lets not split hairs. you and i both know full well that those are merely variations on a theme. i merely gave the two most common variations on that theme.
1/17/2009,"to date i've paid for eve either via a monthly credit card subscription,for the first 3 years and arguably the most expensive way to pay here in the uk, or via game time codes.gtc's were, until recently, the most cost effective way for people in the uk to pay, if wanting to pay on a monthly/bi-monthly basis.however, for us uk players, no matter which option we chose, we have to pay the additional cost of currency exchange on top of our subscription costs.given that the uk is is one of the largest national player bases, i think second only to the usa if memory serves, is it not reasonable to expect that we should have the option of being able to pay ccp directly in our local currency?my request is that the csm raise this issue, hopefully with the support of the player base, to ccp in the hope that we can ask them to consider providing us the options of direct debit subscription, credit/debit cards payments, and gtc's in our local currency.thanksyouxd andy"
1/17/2009,not going to get very far with this one chap....
1/17/2009,"there are plenty of fps's out there already,no need to dumb down this game. we don't need to turn eve into world of spacecraft."
1/17/2009,"negative, not supported.your throwing to much into this single topic.you might want to break down everything your saying in its individual issues.in the beginning of your post you seem to be against the way the entire logistics system works. which if your system was implemented pretty much ruins the current market system.however there is a solution to what you want...play on the test server.no having to jump 20+ system to get what u want.fights, equipment, ships, fuel, are all in 1 system fdj- its perfect for what your looking for.however its rare the population there goes beyond 100 people although it does happen."
1/17/2009,"this is probably one of the few things i agree with.to make the market user friendly/eaiser to use.but again i suggest u break up your topic, into its individual parts.as well perhaps start it out in the 'features and ideas discussion' forum."
1/17/2009,"if you want to play a game where there is little to no effort in fitting out and moving space shippies, then go play freelancer.don't deprive us of the depth in this game because you don't appreciate it.you chose this game. not the other way around. adapt to the game or kindly **** off."
1/17/2009,"i'm all for a shopping list / fitting-presets.but as far as market hubs are concerned: this is up to us players. jita as a market hub wasn't created by ccp. people just used the market which was closest to their agent / mining spot / 0.0 system.i'm certain that the largest alliance in the game should be able to set up a new market hub if they set their mind to it. you're totally right with what parts of eve are boring and time consuming, except maybe for mining which does appeal to some players (or their wives). but not all of your proposed solutions would improve the game.what i would love to see:alliances creating safe havens in 0.0. i think the main reason why 70% of eve players are hanging around in high-sec empire is because everything is close-by and pretty much safe. maybe if alliances could erect pos near gates once they have sovereignity 4, pos that would warp-scramble and web you unless you'd have the correct password. or generally having more control over the space you claim, making it secure enough for industrial corporations to operate. this could also help in drawing a clearer frontline ... anyway my 0.0 knowledge is very limited edit: for clarification.i'm in favour of 1) alliances taking matters in their hands and use diplomacy / renting contracts / mercenary services to help markets develop in their systems. (i know that similar efforts have failed in the past)2) giving alliances better means to control traffic through their space. currently there are either nrds or nbsi policies applied in 0.0. both systems can't handle 600+ traders in one 0.0 market hub (think of jita in 0.0). the first system would allow an enemy to gather his troops quickly without you noticing it in time. the second system would require a huge blue list ... and would still open all doors to spies.- being able to transform a sov 4 system from 0.0 to 0.4 or even 0.5 with a limited npc police force could help. - or instead if you could close a stargate in the heart of your space to all ""reds"" provided you control all surrounding systems ..."
1/17/2009,"if your trying to tell that 1 falcon pilot perma jammed 6 of you and you were all carrying eccm,i am going to come out and call you a liar.a dominix carrying 1 eccm has a magnometric sensor strength of 43,im sorry but a falcon is not going to perma jam anybody using 1 jammer.and you say there were 5 others in your gang all carrying eccm.so in closing,gbtwow scrub,learn to counter your enemy before crying nerf."
1/17/2009,fact mate. i am not lying.well they do. sorry mate.i can counter a falcon. i use another falcon. thats why this is so silly. it is obvious to me who is crying here.
1/17/2009,erm no that was fitted to one ship my hype and you can really tell when somone gets very aggresive about a subject and very defensive that deep down in there little soul they them selves know by the god of chance that the falcon is a win mode do all recons give you this advantage no !!!!!they dont. read what ive put and think about dont ramble think before you speak my mum taught me look at the whole picture every battle scence you can think of its not hard to work out what needs to be done
1/17/2009,"lets keep this constructive guys. how can the eccm work, script or skill enhancement or whatever, so you stand a chance without nerfing the falcon to hell and back?"
1/17/2009,"well looking at the counter for damps / tracking disruptors, you actually benefit from just fitting those modules. you gain something from it, even if you are not dampened/tracking disrupted.so while my sensor booster also gives me faster locking or more locking range and my tracking comps / enhancer give me better tracking and range, eccm gives you a few more % of not being jammed with one racial jammer.while this sounds good versus only 1 falcon ( or jamming boat ) it actually becomes worthless, looking at the number of falcons around.eccm gives you moar sensor strength, meaning the falcon doesn't need 1 racial to jam but 2 or a mix of different racials or a racial and a multi or another of them 20 falcons in your gang.in the same time there are no ""signal-distortion-amplifier-like-modules"" for damps, tracking disrupts, whatever ewar, if im not mistaken."
1/17/2009,"several people in this thread have already pointed out that the countermeasures for both dampeners and tracking disruptors are useful all the time while eccm is merely a paperweight until someone jams you.i think that two things need to be done to eccm to make it more useful:1) raise the percentage of sensor strength bonus that one eccm module gives you. the best named and t2 modules should both give somewhere in the neighborhood of 120% boost instead of 96%.2) eccm modules should significantly lower your signature radius. it makes complete sense that a module that is distorting your profile on someones sensors would also lower your signature radius by a percentage... say 10%.with the increased significance of signature radius in modern eve combat, this would be an all around useful module."
1/17/2009,"you do realize you have to put on the right race's eccm, right? and that ""perma"" is short for ""permanent"", not ""once every three cycles"", right?now that is an interesting proposal. makes sense in terms of flavour, and would make the module better for generic combat."
1/17/2009,"i personaly share many peoples fears of 'modular' ship design. while i have, and i must stress this, never, ever been dissapointed with ccp's nerfs, changes, alleged gimping etc, and i regard them, like many of us do, ascompetent, imaginative and visionary geniuses, i do have to express some fears; how, for instance, does ccp propose to explain the tech 3 technology? why, if pilots discover technology such as this, would they not be able to apply it to older ship models? if new technologies discovered would it no completely surpass old technology? how many carriges do you see today? i worry not for the actual gameplay itself, but for the integrity of the story, the continued validity of eve online that makes it so immersive, that seperates it from the mainstay of other games. please, ccp, pay close attention to that aspect of your new expansion pack, make it as completely enthralling as the others, and dont let the spirit of eve be dilluted."
1/17/2009,"that works well when you read the problem and understand the answer that relates to it. i've seen some that are utterly ridiculous, unhelpful and also prove what was sent was not fully read or understood."
1/17/2009,"hey @sshole, the word is spelled 'incompetent'. stop wasting everyone's time."
1/17/2009,well if you girls would stop spamming petitions maybe the gm's would have the time to stop and read them on occasion.
1/17/2009,if the game was more stable and had less bugs they'd get fewer petitions...

1/17/2009,"hi there everyone csm included.i would like to ask all of you to join me in trying to collect some ideas with small ccp demand and huge impact on game features.i am particularly focused on metagame, roleplay options, player created content and events, and market economic issues.the challenge is to word a short and extremely simple idea that has extremely wide consequences and potential for creating content. i would hope we could end up with a top five or ten list of these and have the csm present it to ccp dev crew.kindest regardscaleb."
1/17/2009,"i might as well throw the first one then.i find the issue of static prices of npc facilities and station etc a reducing gamefactor.why not go all out and get eve totally supply and demand player controlled?put up npc stations for rent, thus making all its functions pricewise controlled by players.with a few simple features the exploit griefing of this would be avoidable.all stations leased run for max 6 months. bids on leasing the next period makes it almost impossible to hog a station. bids should be held in escrow so no abuse is possible. this would seriously make things aggresive financially.since pos dont show in ingame info lets not claim that pos have any of the same trafic potential even though i admit it would be even more awesome if pos would take over every aspect of the game in time..as far as i know the management options on npc stations are already in there for gm/ccp to operate, if i am not mistaken that is.."

1/18/2009,"your avatar represents you in eve online. the fact that you will no doubt change while playing eve implicits that you should be able to mirror that change unto your avatar. i see no reason not to let this happen, other than possible technical issues. seeing as scamming and criminal activity is perfectly ""legal"" within the bounds of eve, changing your name to get away could be seen as nothing more than a small addition to the gameplay features."
1/18/2009,"i must've missed the warning message when i started that said ""don't choose a name that starts with an 'a' as fleet overviews are generally sorted by alphabet and you will be targeted first every time."""
1/18/2009,"no, no, no, no, no.not what this does. this is like saying that jaspet is an incentive to go to lowsec so you can mine zydrine. jaspet is worthless so it's no incentive. what you want is a way that provides all ores evey where but provides higher yields in lowsec / 0.0 so that it ensures that lowsec / 0.0 is always more valuable. what you have at the moment, is that veldspar rules all (aside from a/b/c ores) what you want to do is have it so that even in 0.0, mining veldspar will make you more isk, so that the devaluing high-ends don't make it so that one day highsec is more valuable than 0.0 (or at least as-valuable sans risk), which while 'unlikely' is possible with the current mechanics. it already has happened to lowsec, this is unacceptable, in my mind we need lowsec to be twice as good by value to mine in, in order to lure, i mean, encourage, people to go to lowsec.the fact that all ores would be available in highsec means nothing if their yield is pathetic, it would mean that no matter what mineral you wanted, lowsec, and 0.0 would always be better. it is ridiculously broken that there is no more valuable ore in lowsec than highsec at the moment. back when i started playing, lowsec was 2x more valuable, this made it somewhat worth taking a risk. any less than this and i think it won't work as an encouragement. give highsec 10% yield crokite, give 0.0 1000% yield veldspar ;) --- note actual details can be worked out by someone putting real thought into it, i'm just saying what the goals should be, with a move to making everything player run and giving the incentive to move to lowsec / 0.0.if you'll wake up, you'll see that the rare ores are not as rare as they should be, the drone regions have ensured that this isn't going to be the case, and that the mineral basket is not able to be adjusted by miners without changes. stop thinking about 'rare' ores, and start thinking about 'valuable' ores, because this was the original goal of moving the high end ores to 0.0. to make 0.0 valuable. this is what is needed because the current system is broken, where even much of 0.0 is only as valuable as highsec. this is somewhat on the right track with density etc, but i'm not limiting my support to something this specific the base concepts i support are:- lowsec immovably more valuable than highsec, by at least 2x, impossible for players to change this.- 0.0 more valuable again, even the not so good 0.0.- distribution so that mining as an activity causes the stability of mineral prices (not as a whole, but in relation to each other). so that as a particular mineral gets over valued, people have an ore to move to that will help correct that. this will mean that loot / droning will not have the effect it is currently having in terms of mineral values, only in terms of quantity. for low ends this should also solve the transport issue, as such things can be mined locally. for high ends, you could still have some regional variation.i remember zydrine being added to jaspet, and the multiple tweaks to drone loot taking place to try and restore the broken imbalance in mineral prices, this is what happens when the mechanic is not there for players to do it themselves, mining should be this mechanic."
1/18/2009,"hi, please read the two lines following the one you quoted.this means that mining in lower sec would get you more isk, every time, guaranteed. currently the system does not do this, even though you only get zydrine starting at jaspet in lowsec, the ore is worse. this literally makes the ore better.i personally think it should be actually higher density ore, i don't think that mining more m3/minute is a solution, as it would mean more hauling as well. i want the ore in 0.0/lowsec to literally be better. sure, arknor in high sec, but 1/10th yield. on the other hand 10x yield veldspar in 0.0. etc.this means that the system can not be broken by players like it has today, lowsec will always be better than highsec, and 0.0 better than lowsec. i think giving very low yield high-end ores to highsec, in exchange for very high yield low-ends to 0.0 does work."
1/18/2009,"if you guys seriously think that having a higher abundance of veldspar in low sec and null sec will suddenly make all the industrialists think to themselves ""oh wow, now it's totally worth it to risk my hulk, faction mining modules and expensive mining implants to brave the hordes and hordes of pirates and pvp'ers"" then you are simply ignorant.no amount of incentive in the game is worth the loss in productivity of having to warp out of your mining belt dozens of times per day whenever a neutral enters system or losing a few expensive ships.first, something needs to be done to make industrial ships more survivable. they're huge, slow, as agile as a sloth in a jar of syrup and have no means to defend themselves when caught... so why would any sane person leave empire with them when empire is at least profitable without interruption?short of seeding t2 fracking bpo's in the asteroids themselves, there will never be enough incentive to leave empire unless a more creative way is devised to make low and null sec industry less risky."
1/18/2009,"can't you have your corp secure the system? if you're in a corp that uses nothing but mining lasers you stay in highsec(or pay somebody else's corp for security) but if you're in a balanced corp get the pvpers to run some gatecamps while the rock jockeys mine the fancy ores. if there's money to be made, somebody will make it - not everybody is as risk-averse as you are."
1/18/2009,"but it's not purely a case of being ""risk adverse"".in many cases, the corps out there simply have no interest in mining, or in miners. they want combat pilots, who can both rat (to pay the rent to whichever ""feudal overlord"" they owe their corner of 0.0 to in the first place) and fly fleet ops to defend the space they are renting.and, because of those two commitments, they sure as hell do not want to waste their valuable ratting time or pvp time on less productive things like protecting miners. a very big chunk of the ""economic"" model of 0.0 has become so addicted to ratting bounties that, other than pos networks for moon mining/t2 production chains, it's a ""cash economy"".cash economies buy the majority of the manufactured goods they need -- so they are at the mercy of high commodity prices affecting the cost of the manufactured goods they are importing from empire.gee... sounds like the real world, doesn't it? you want to see trit prices go down, then corps and alliances in 0.0 need to spend more of their time developing their own industrial infrastructure instead of b*tching about the high price of trit coming out of empire.sure, that means ""re-thinking"" a huge number of strategies for surviving, fighting and prospering in 0.0 -- but that might actually do some folks some good anyway and, omg, folks might even have fun, too! players need to change their approach to playing eve, instead of trying to change the game mechanics of eve itself.it would sure as hell give the devs alot more time to develop ""cool stuff"" and, ultimately, we can't have it both ways, not even in eve. thanks for reading if you made it this far through my preaching."
1/18/2009,"there's a whole lot of ""out there"" - not everywhere outside highsec is rancer or delve. there's a whole lot of places a 10-man corp could set up in 0.1 and nobody would even notice. and if the ore there was twice as good as in highsec(instead of being actively worse, like it is now), there might actually be a reason to try. even in 0.0, if you can keep a decent level of security - it doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough - miners can go about their business largely unmolested. the attitudes of the existing corporations might not be along those lines, but there's no reason it can't work. and furthermore, you cannot get trit any more easily in 0.0 than you can in 1.0 - veldspar is the trittiest mineral in the game. why would anyone mine it in 0.0 when they can mine it in highsec? make a better trit source - doesn't have to be a new mineral, could just be some kind of improved veld - and 0.0 might actually be able to supply its own minerals sanely. you'd need to rework pos manufacturing for it to make a lot of sense to try, but that can be done with this mineral proposal. and if you think that was bad, go look up my csm page - you'll see a real wall of text"
1/18/2009,this deserves a bump
1/18/2009,"introducing ""ambulation"" is bound to have its' own bugs, no? i think it's just ccp being lazy about it or not caring. this whole dillema tells me that they are more concerned with wowizing eve with useless ""features"" like ambulation. i must say, from the screen shots it looks really good...however i will stick with my roots. blowing the crap out of everyone else in space, where the game originated.as i've done in every thread on this matter.../signed."
1/18/2009,"having now spoken to all kinds of devs the last few days, trust me: if they had the resources, they would love to do it.it's sadly really simple. redoing the whole pos mechanic with this thing is a huge task. right now, we have a system that works, even if ccp does realize it's by no means to the degree of awesomeness as they would like to.tis a shame, but i'm afraid that's how it is."

1/18/2009,supported. horrible change. i love seeing 6 cruise missiles from a raven with bs v do crap all damage to another battleship i really wish i could be in those ccp meetings tbh. lets come up with a way to calculate that cruise missiles can do 10% of the damage they previously did to an npc battleship and lets see the forums erupt!sigh.
1/18/2009,"not so. turrets were calculated against transversal speed. therefore if a ship was speeding towards you, you would hit it for full damage in a turret boat. with missiles that battleship that is 40km from you and mwd'ing straight towards you? you can't hit him for any damage. doesn't that sound stupid?the new missile calculates against only speed (not transversal). why should a battleship be able to speed tank missiles that easily, regardless if hes going straight towards you or not.against a turret boat, you always had to watch your transversal. now against a missle boat, it doesn't matter. close, far, direction. could care less, just go somewhat fast and hes screwed.i don't care that there is a speed penalty, it just seems that it is to much out of line. if there is going to be a ""tracking penalty"" now just as there are with turrets, then make missiles almost instantly hit like turrets.i don't fly missile boats for pvp (only ratting, and i guess that will now change). but honestly. now there are ships that take forever to hit a target and when they finally do, don't hit it for any damage? wow, sounds like a great ship"
1/18/2009,missiles have been ridiculously terrible ever since qr. they retain all their previous disadvantages with travel time and now they perform really badly on battleships that are coasting after deactivating their mwds.

1/18/2009,"supported idea... maybe no need for bigger fleets if we put up some alternative...connect multiple fleets to maybe something called ""platoon"" or ""meta-fleet"" so that people can still warp to members of other fleets but some features just dont work like adding people from different fleets to your watch list and stuff..."
1/18/2009,"the solution is easy. add a new skill called task force management and with every level you get to control an extra wing in fleet. i would then go further by adding advanced leadership. with every level allowing you to add another squad to your wing.this would result in five extra wings and five extra squads per wing. increasing the maximum number to 1011 in a fleet.this may sound like an absurd number but i have been in scenarios where 2 or 3 fleets are not enough. plus after all if you think it's excessive, don't train the skill."

1/18/2009,"no. simply put, the fact is they can demand whatever they goddamn feel like for it, and the fact that there is no upper ceiling to that means that they could very easily demand a ridiculous sum and when you fail to pay up, they just walk away laughing their little heads off.and the bolded part merely amplifies the viewpoint that what they are doing does indeed consitute harrassment."
1/18/2009,"right, i am of course only in favour of this in legitimate cases of harrassment, and not someone using an alt (as you say) in order to capitalise on a particularly lucrative mission).i like the proposal you put forward - that would realistically provide a viable path out of the situation, should the op get their way"
1/18/2009,"i agree that players shouldn't be able to petition it and get off the hook this easy.on the other hand, i actually did have two genuine cases of the mission item not dropping or courier item not appearing in cargo bay, and i think it's hard for ccp to discern in all cases if the item got stolen/destroyed instead of not appearing due to a bug of sorts."

1/18/2009,"the point if so far i have seen no credible proof of missions being reset if not for noob players or bugs.it is always ""some alliance member had said that he can get them reset"". who said that? when it happened?if you have some gm mail or player mail saying that the mission was reset, petition against it and if refused escalate and go to the internal affairs. stealing loot is a valid action, has always been, but i have never heard from a credible source that a mission will be reset if the crucial mission loot is stolen. so for the nth tiem, you have any proof?"
1/18/2009,"in the hypothetical case that such proof could be obtained, would you support tchell's proposal?"
1/18/2009,"yes. i can see people petitioning for a mission reset for noobs errors (and while they are new players) or bugs, not for other player actions. it can be annoying if someone steal your target item, but it is part of the game."
1/18/2009,like it has been said before. if the item didn't appear of a bug it should be reset. but i don't think to the practical side a gm can determine if it was a bug or another player. so it all boils back to the mechanics side.so if it was 'acquired' by some other player it should set off a flag and the mission runner should be able to take it back by force and add a little flair to the mission.

1/18/2009,i don't support this.only really of use to mission/ratt farmers.making it easier to sift through your loot and thus making farming easier is a bad thing.instead of this i'd support a reduction in the ammount of loot given full stop.

1/18/2009,"oh, i'm not fooling myself. i realize that none of these changes are going to be made, even removing local won't actually happen once the carebears start threatening to quit.a couple of points:this game has shifted from being a harsh, gritty game of consequences to one where there is very little risk involved as long as you take a few very easy precautions.carebears are a vast majority of the game currently. therefore, any changes that reduce the safety of carebears will cause them to quit, which will hurt ccp's wallet... which they won't allow to happen.you can expect most changes to pvp from this point on to favor the industrialist / carebear crowd since that's the machine that feeds ccp's bank accounts, and with the economic situation that iceland is in, they simply can't take any chances.this post is basically my last hurrah before i throw my hands up in disgust, and let the carebears have what they've whined so hard to create. if by some incredible miracle they actually implement a couple of these changes (delayed local at least ffs), then eve will be worth sticking around for. currently my play style has been pushed aside in favor of other play styles, so there's really no incentive for me to keep handing ccp my money. *shrug*"

1/18/2009,some excellent ideas i liked the one about the warp skill for making it 5km at lv5 is balanced for both pvp and traveling not like the current system
1/18/2009,changing the warp-to distance won't work. it will result in the recreation of the insta-bookmark market. if you are too young to remember the insta-bookmark market - get off my lawn!
1/18/2009,"number 5, changing the warp to distance to a skill isn't a very good idea imo, because if you're using it to catch people travelling in order to pew pew them, all you're going to end up doing is catching more of the noobs. it will quickly become a must-learn skill for everyone, much like learning or navigation, so the only ones who end up warping in to 10km from the gate are first dayers in their shiny new atrons. pirate broadswords will shudder under the gallant return fire, assuming of course that the poor victim realises what the hell is going on. whilst this is a great way to pad out killboards, killing more noobs in front of the gates to highsec isn't exactly bringing back thrilling pvp combat, and it's far from newbie-friendly.having said all that, most of your other points are well-considered. i'm interested to see which ones travel the furthest :)"
1/18/2009,"i probably made 1-2 billion selling sets of instas, so yes i remember them very well. remember that these aren't fully fleshed out ideas. any rollback of wtz would absolutely have to come with a limitation such as... no bm's can be made within 115km of a gate or something similarly creative."

1/18/2009,"thread gets my vote, but i think some of it is just dreaming. 3, 4, 7 i just don't see happening regardless of any good reasoning.eve is too much in favour of avoiding pvp these days - that is for sure. personally i'm an advocate of solo playing quite often, the buzz of the 1v1 (combat setups on both sides ideally). catching targets which just station or gate hug proves very difficult. they can take a shot and if they don't like how its going, get out. in such cases, which make up majority of fights, the defender dictates if he wants to fight or not.it becomes more efficient to fly around in large groups who can just insta pop targets before they have a chance to react.....but boring as hell with a definite lack of buzz.the lack of choices currently preset in eve is exactly what puts me on a downer. fleet up & instapop stuff or mission & horde isk."

1/18/2009,"calling eve a game is really not that accurate,in games like counterstrike or call of duty you want no barriers to the ""twitch"" eve is more of a simulated world,with a simulated economy, for any economy there has to be a certain amount of unpleasantness so that you are willing to pay others to handle those things, eve would grind to a halt if the unfettered frag fest you want ever came to be, eve is very realistic in at least one respect, in real world combat ops every hour of action usually caps weeks of prep."
1/18/2009,"as for the pos system...most people agree that the sovereignty system is stupid and, iirc, ccp is looking at revamping it.as for the rest...be creative. buy your ships/fittings in bulk and have them shipped to 0.0. or, just buy them in 0.0. just because jita is cheaper does not mean you need to go there"
1/18/2009,"problem:the retribution is the cheapest assault frigate on the market and the least desired pvp assault frigate in the game. it's use is limited almost entirely to npcing against sansha and other em/thermal weak npcs.solutions:drop a high slot and add a mid slotdrop a low slot and add a mid slotadd a mid slot and alter the ship's attributesany or all of the aboveconclusion:an extra mid slot would allow the retribution to be an acceptable ship in both fleet and small gang pvp (in both situations, the ability to fit tackle and move at speed are requirements for small ships) without overly affecting it's ability to shoot rats, it's current primary function. whilst further balancing might be required to stop the retribution from becoming too good, discussion on this issue is surely required.thank you for your time."

1/18/2009,"how about making all ecm function like an ecm burst, ie. just breaking the lock of the target, or alternatively reducing the length of time that you are jammed whilst keeping the current cycle period of ecm. this way ecm can remain at its current strength whilst allowing those who are effected by it, some opportuinty to counter it. being able to somewhat counter ecm, even if your not explicitly prepared (who can possibly fit for every eventuality) is not unreasonable imo. after all, you are affored the oportunity against all other ewar to take some action to mitigate it, ie shooting the bugger."
1/18/2009,"everyone knows that mate. if i say permanently i mean it. or ""perma"" in this case. 1 race jammer is quite capable of keeping a sensor fortified battleship permanently jammed."
1/18/2009,"in most situations i find the need to have 2 eccm modules which severely gimps most ships.please add 100% boost to the module, simple and effective."
1/18/2009,please visit your user settings to re-enable images.
1/18/2009,"a t2 racial jammer on a max-skill falcon with 2 rigs and 2 distortion amps has 13.77 points of jam of its good type. a dominix with one eccm has 43.1 points of sensor strength. thus, a single jammer will succeed 32% of the time. i wasn't kidding when i said ""once every three cycles"". bad luck and targeting time make that more annoying, but if you say a single falcon permajammed six fortified battleships, you're simply a liar. even if it's fitting seven racial jammers, and the races line up, it has a 0.47% chance to jam all six of you per cycle. even if the fight only lasted two cycles, the odds of you all being jammed on both of those cycles are less than one in 44,000."
1/18/2009,"factor in locking time for that battle ship and you have a pretty serious problem, a faclon with racials is likely to jam 3 battleships for 30 out of 90 seconds, adding an extra 10-30 seconds of locking time rarely gets considered.and this is with eccm.either way, people defending falcons are just failing to acknowledge that is poor game design, all binary mechanics which form the back bone of most ewar (including neuts) are.beyond this, having a strong specific counter to something powerfull has the effect of creating an equalibrum in which either can be considered typical in all situations as opposed to this."
1/18/2009,"okay, so in 3 20-second jam cycles, you spend one jammed, and 9.8 seconds relocking the falcon, or 6.1 with a sensor booster. even if you don't use that, though, you have a lock on him about half the time(or a bit more often if it's random when jams are instead of every third). and remember, this falcon has a paper-thin tank - even if you use two lses and a dcu(which is a huge tank for a falcon), it still only has 20k ehp, which means it can go down fairly quickly. thing about that killboard screenshot, everything on it is dead. also, it should be noted that i'm not trying to defend the falcon here. it's a bit op, and there are some solutions i'd like to see implemented(say, swapping jam ranges with damp ranges and making remote eccm better), but the standard onboard eccm modules buff sensor strength enough. a secondary boost to make them better in non-jam fights, like the one proposed above, would be fine, but they're good enough at their primary role. i don't think it's as ludicrous as everyone claims, but a few tweaks would be appropriate. the problem isn't on the eccm side, though."
1/18/2009,"i believe the proof is in the pudding.considering that ecm now appears to scale quite happily in fleet fights, i think it<U+FFFD>s time for a either a boost to there effect counters, or a redesign of the effect of jamming."
1/18/2009,"i support some form of change to the ecm/eccm issue. one logical fix is impliment a skill to increase sensor strength. the abundance of falcons in a small fleet fight is astounding. i leave with a 10 man hac/recon gang that has two falcons and hit a 6-7 man gang with 3-4 falcons and 2 dps ships. we have tried fitting eccm and sacrificing mid slots and still get almost perma jammed every time and our falc's are usually rendered useless after one cycle. i think a skill to increase your ships sensor strength is in order, that or give eccm moduals a secondary boost so they are not usless."
1/18/2009,"there were some questions about some information i was provided that i wanted to repond to. the thread only allows a single response so here is my answer,(from the call for csm transparancy thread)so once i get back from this trip i was going to respond to rata. rata provided me with a lot of detail about an experience he had that seemed unusual. in particular rata had been one of the few players that had pursued the encounters that could be located as result of ship logs. that aspect of eve has been removed. i always wondered if the dropped ship logs meant something but never spent any time researching it. in fact i had never met anyone that had. so before i answered i needed to do some research. in the end there was nothing unusual about what rata encountered but he had found aspects of eve few other people ever experienced (pretty cool rata! good job!) because no one was taking advantage of this ccp eventually decided not to continue the experience and to put the resources that had to be focused on that feature onto other new or more popular features.the summary is rata found a very cool thing that was in eve in the past that no one ever seemed to be interested in and that the experience has been removed to allow the resources that had to go into creating and supporting that feature to be assigned to stuff more people seemed to enjoy. this wasn't some sort of ""back door"" but an encounter not may folks discovered. if i have any reaction to that i learned it was that i'm kicking myself for not putting more time into finding out what rata had. it seemed pretty cool.to rata, sorry i hadn't gotten back to you directly yet. i will definitely still follow up.finally, in terms of march 10th, can't say if that date is exactly the day but from what i've seen, march ??th may be the day a lot of folks say ""it all began!"" and i mean that in a very good way.issler"
1/18/2009,well in case of t2 weapons for example they get a natural boost from the specialisation skill which only applys to the t2 version of the weapon... for nosferatus and similar modules there is none of such bonuses applyed so well... there should be a good reason for the increased fitting requirements... isk in most cases is not a problem for pvp... most people pay a lot of isk just to be superior in pvp also the meta level should indicate how good a module is compared to others of the same type... if they want to keep it that way they could at least fix the meta levels to show up in a correct line!

1/18/2009,"so i wanted to take a minute to share my thoughts on the 2nd csm meeting. i'm still in iceland, still suffering from time zone shock and a result i am not going to say everything i hope to share in this first post.impressions of the second csm. you have elected a very diverse set of players that demonstrated a mature commitment to making eve a better place. everyone in this csm struck me as passionate and reasoned in their views of eve. we all seemed to work effectively together with both other members of the csm as well as ccp. our interactions with ccp were very much as partners instead of adversaries. i believe as a result the meeting was very effective.let me start with the pos exploit. ccp took this very seriously. they will soon share all the details anyone could ever want with the exception of naming, which is against their policy (and that policy was explained and makes very good sense). i was very impressed with the effort they put into this and the new process they intend to add to make sure something like this is going to be less likely in the future. other csm topics. everyone should understand that the realities of software engineering result in feature roadmaps that may not support immediate reactions to opportunities to change features. every issue that we raised was considered and will have positive effects on the eve we all experience at some time in the future. when these effects are enjoyed depends on a lot of factors that aren't always easy to understand. for example a particular idea my be delayed because the pieces of code that need to be added or changed also related to another 5 features. so as a result those features may be delayed to allow the parts of the team best able to create the changes to be able to get all the related changes in together. the summary though is everything we discussed will be part of ccp's planning going forward. if not as a specific ""we did this feature exactly like suggested"" but as a ""your ideas definitely helped us address the specific issue you raised"" fashion.ccp in general (software development and test). my background is software engineering. what i learned was that ccp began as a very ""organic"" development organization. they now see that more ""rigor"" in process is key to future success. i learned that they are making serious commitments to adopt the processes that lead to ""best in class"" software organizations. i saw a commitment to everything i would have considered key to creating a great software development organization.ccp in general (game design). love what i learned! they get it, more often than not they had clearly already been thinking about the issues we raised. in many cases they asked us for reactions to some of their ideas. i also learned that there are a broad range of focus within the groups that influence design. there are folks that love the pvp aspects but there were industrialist and miners as well! all i can say is i met a group of people that i believe will continue to amaze me with the experiences they will create.ccp in general (csm support). ccp has massive commitment to the csm. they believe the csm can be a key part of making eve something very unusual and successful. you definitely should believe the csm is being listened to. on that note please continue to hold us accountable to you as the member base. in a very real way we are your voice!cont."
1/18/2009,"initial comments pt2summary. i wasn't really sure what to expect. looking at the last csm i was worried that the time could have been contentious and unproductive. i was happily surprised. i think the current csm worked very effectively, represented a broad ranges of views in a mature fashion and that we were listened to by ccp. this is a ""learn as you go"" process and will continue to improve. and that finally the ultimate sucess of the csm is not so much the csm or ccp but the pilots of eve becoming supportive and involved in this unique political process.so as i've been known to say ""stuffs getting better, stuffs getting batter every day!""issler"

1/18/2009,"there is nothing wrong with black ops, recons or anything else. its taken me a while to realise this, but its true. the only thing that is wrong is the covert cyno. let the covert cyno be opened in a cyno jammed system, and bingo. all problems solved. all black ops would have a purpose, and alot more people would fly them. means people sat cosy in their supercaps ""safely"" behind their front lines would get a rude awakening as their cyno jammers get popped by a recon gang, and a cap fleet jumps in.would make me restart training for black ops bs instead of just training all racial recons.edit : allow black ops bs to use covert ops cloaks too. whats the point in using a covert ops ship that can't use the cov ops cloak?

1/19/2009,"what would be needed is a way to match the new name against the old name with regards to searches, buddy lists, etc, so that it is still possible to find people using the original name.then you'd need like a new tab, or an addition to employment history, called ""known aliases"" - literally other names the character has gone by.if you have them, i can't see a way for a scammer to hide by changing name, as long as people are smart and check the tab."
1/19/2009,love the idea of an anchor-able structure in belts!
1/19/2009,"i think alliances who manage to establish a number of colonys throughout adjacent systems in 0.0, and manage to protect them from enemy invasion/destruction should be rewarded with gradual increases in security status in that system and the benefits that go with it - sentry guns on gates etc.i think this system could be developed into a system of space management in eve that would recreate a frontier based style of warfare for alliances; where alliances would have to nibble away at each others frontiers to try try and reach the centre.imagine if the number of higher sec systems in an alliances territory kept increasing in number and also sec status. if they reached 0.8 or above how about the reward of a stargate back to ""old empire"" high sec space appearing and cute lil carebears can come and mine for the alliance.or the alliance's colonies and stations might take a percentage of minerals and isk just like the empire stations do. so the carebears feed the alliance without even necessarily being members of it.just a thought."
1/19/2009,"one major issue the devs would have is the introduction of the hundreds of new item types that would be required to implement this idea. if the ore that you mine still takes up the same amount of space in your hold, but you mine three times as much of it per unit time - that makes your operation three times as efficient. if you mine nine times as much of it per unit time... you're still maxed out at three times as efficient because you just filled up your hulk's hold and are now wasting ore.for nine-times-efficient veldspar, you'd have to have a specific ore type that was ""superdense veldspar"" or some such. it has to be an item that can stack in the hold of the ship mining the ore.one simple change to make nullsec mining more attractive would be for mineral compression to be boosted. then again, go check the dev blogs and note by ccp staff, in particular:so let's wait to see if something comes of all that talk about moving asteroid belts out of system space, then we can talk about revamping the mining system."
1/19/2009,"yes it will as it will reduce the price. basic supply and demand, given demand an increase in supply will decrease the price.sure it is traces per individual miner. but then you have 15,000 miners and those traces add up. if you are worried about low prices of zydrine and megacyte and high prices of tritanium this is precisely the wrong way to go.people will start avoiding rocks that have lots of tritanium, but show no traces thus reducing the amount of tritanium. the amount of zydrine and megacyte on the other hand will go up and thus the price down.as for nyphur's insurance problem the solution strikes me as simple. make insurance payouts and insurance contract prices dependent on the price the character actually pays. thus if i get a dominix bb for 10 million insurance will cost me 3 million and if i am foolish enough to undock and self-destruct i get only 10 million leaving me in the hole for 3 million not with a profit of 33.75 million.as for this part:the problem nyphur makes is that these ""limits"" aren't hard limits. it isn't that the price can't go below the bounds he describes, but that due to the way insurance works prices wont stay outside of those bounds for very long.sloppy analysis, imo."
1/19/2009,"oh and a follow up question for the many keynesians here.there seems to be an underlying assumption that people mining say, crokite, should earn more than people mining veldspar. at all times.but if everyone decides to go mine crokite...why should this be so? if bob, -a- and goons all stop shooting each other and everyone hops in a ship and heads out to 0.0 and mines crokite...why should the one lone guy still in emprie mining veldspar make more?granted the above is fantastical, but this whole thread is motivated by nyphur's complaint that mineral prices can't move outside a fixed price range. now it seems people want to have a fixed income range.you've never read finn kydland and edward prescott's paper on the inconsistency of optimal discretionary plans have you? kinda undercuts that whole tweakable thing to discretionary economic stabilization policy."
1/19/2009,"redesigning local is a huge task. right now we have a system that works, even if ccp does realize it's by no means to the degree of awesomeness as they would like it to.that's a cop-out. that can be said for essentially any change to the game. the amount of resources required is irrelevant; ccp put together a massive team for ambulation, which is not necessarily something the community has asked for; certainly not on the scale of the pos issue, which has been around for three years. are you telling me that in three years, ccp still has not been able to find the time or resources to seriously consider this issue?i'm sorry, but the more i hear from devs, the more i realize they refuse to listen to the customers, even considering this whole csm gimmick."
1/19/2009,"copied from ambulation thread quote:other information: those players that do not wish to interact with the full-body avatar aspect of the game will not be forced to do so, a la the now defunct earth & beyond and their station interface. in-station servers will be seperate from the space servers, so there will be little (if any) lag introduced into the other environment. -------------------------------------------------------if they're moving the station enviroment to another server. wouldn't implementing this idea enable them to walk inside player owned stations, moving pos code to the other server. and thus speeding up the game code."

1/19/2009,"every time i have suspended my account i have indicated lack of a skill queue as the reason because it was the reason. i needed a break from the game so why keep my subscription unless i'm gaining something from it?i fully support an extensive skill queue. it is good for me as a player and good for ccp as a company. as it stands i will only subscribe for the 1 or 2 least busy months of the year when i know i have time to play. if there were an unlimited skill queue i could just leave my subscription active without feeling like i'm wasting money and log on whenever i have free time.and as akita t points out: ""the one and only logical reason for not having a skill queue in the first place has vanished.""so please either put ghost training back to the way it was or add an unlimited skill queue to make casual gamers like me happy. or just ignore the problem and save me some money in the process. :p"
1/19/2009,"no, it just means that the equipment interactions are too complex for most players to do in their heads. so my suggestion to fix the problems that eft shows is for ccp to make an official version. though that would be a waste of time as it wouldn't do anything that eft doesn't.but a skill queue would add functionality that evemon can't.there is a difference between something being designed to require third party support (you examples here) and something that had third party support show up afterwards.now could you answer the other point in my post: how do you plan for the unexpected events ?because it is really the more important one as evemon can only deal with the events you know about in advance."

1/19/2009,"okay most of us have done it at some point with a friend or just for the hell of it. we exchange a can with a neutral so that we can shoot at each other in ""high sec"".why don't we just make an option allowing us click on someone you wish to pvp against and propose a duel with that person who then has the option to either (auto decline pvp duels) or he can get a pop-up of the proposed duel and can accept or decline it ""in high sec"". most of the time people who want to duel have agreed to it via chat anyways ""in high sec"".this not only makes pvp a bit easier for those not at war with each other or in the same corp. it increases ship losses, which increases market activity and it also gives players more options for fun consensual pvp which we (almost) all of us enjoy.just an idea."

1/19/2009,"a duel is a contest of honor. if you have lowered yourself to dueling dishonorable opponents, the shame is yours. it is not neccessary to spend time developing game mechanics when combat is already allowable. i do not support."
1/19/2009,"i guess you are just talking about hisec? concord might allow it - for a price. a few million isk, at least?and if you just want a dual without paying, then losec, or even nullsec, is thataway >>>though to be honest i quite like the current can flagging method. more like a throwing down a gauntlet kind of thing."
1/19/2009,"i think the problem is not the ability to ""throw down"" a challenge.its interference...and asking them to go to lowsec/nullsec only compounds the problem."
1/19/2009,"npcs or magic buttons should enforce a ""carebear pvp mode"" in low sec and null sec. players enforce the rules in low sec and null sec. if you don't like it then gtfo of low/null sec.if you want a ""carebear pvp mode"" in high sec then you solved the problem yourself, use can aggro mechanics.an arena setup so that players can create a tournament easily for their corp/alliance for ****s and giggles would be nice, but you are blatantly asking for a carebear world of warcraft mechanic to be added into eve so my standard ""gtfo of eve"" response applies."
1/19/2009,"well gee vaal, you're about as bad at subject comprehension as i am at spelling. all i am proposing is an alternative to can flipping. two people in high sec want to throw down, instead of flipping cans; have a scroll down option where you can request a pvp flag with the other ship, which can then be accepted or denied by that ships player. can flipping works too, i am just throwing out an idea to make the process a bit more streamlined.so vaal ert how am i asking for a carebear world or warcraft mechanic again? lets meet sometime and go flip cans with each other mmk?"
1/19/2009,"i think it should allow pvp between the 2 parties for their current ships only. this way someone doesn't accept and go grab a bigger ship etc. on another note, wtf is wrong with you people? this is a decent and simple little idea to make the game just a bit better."
1/19/2009,"being an occasional mission runner, i beleive the missions should only be reset in the case of a mission bug, item not dropped, key rat doesnt spawn, etc. which should all be in the logs, though it may take time to go through them.i dont think its the standing drop that people worry about as much as the lp loss that they would have gotten for completing the mission, especially in a faction navy mission.with regard to gm's resetting missions, it would be interesting to see the stats on how many missions get completed compared to those reset on a weekly basis and the reasons behind the resets.to mission runners, if you know that a firm like tears operate in an area, find somewhere else to run-missions, or accept that they will bust into the mission and salvage it."
1/19/2009,"also, people can sell modules for stupid prices on the market in remote regions griefing people who want to buy stuff. of course nobody would ever buy those items, but it's still griefing!!! thus, traders are griefers...as for your suggestion that it's harassment, you are stupid. it's worthless to everyone except the mission runner, to which it is worth quite a bit. since they are trying to sell it to the mission runner alone, then it's value it considerable. however, if the mission runner refuses to pay up, then it is worthless. essentially, they griefed you by trying to sell you something for an excessive price!!!just to demonstrate how stupid this is, say i attacked your ship and ransomed you for 100,000,000,000,000 isk, an obviously unreasonable sum. by your logic this is griefing because they are asking too much. however, it is no different to them just blowing you up in the first place, which is perfectly legal. therefore this is not griefing.assuming you're in a t2 rigged t2 bs with t1 fittings, the ship is worth a lot, but it will drop very little of worth if destroyed. now this is no different to the 'griefer' stealing the mission item and charging an excessive amount for it, yet it is obviously within game mechanics. therefore, your arguament fails."
1/19/2009,"/signed.i can't believe that introducing 24h long queue with just one skill can seriously break something down in game balance. even if ccp have some doubts about longer queues or more advanced functionality, this simple change should be more than enough to stop most of complaints.i've cancelled my previous subscription (and stopped paying money to ccp btw) mostly because of this - i had to remember about changing skills when i was not in the game.if ccp respected my personal life by not making me wake up in the middle of the night or install eve on my work computer just to change skills, i would really appreciate this"
1/19/2009,please dont do so -.-i really dont like the idea of a skill queue... its a game mechanics fact that people got to manage their training and considering that you can switch the training without losing skill points on like lets say a half way trained skill gives people the ability to plan their training. if people are too lazy to plan their training the need to lose lets say a hour or 2 hours of skill training. from my point of view and i am playing the game for 5 years now its a part of the game to manage your skills....well if people ask for skill queues because it makes life easier id like to be able to accept multiple missions from a single agent just to not have to dock inbetween the single missions i am running... <-- same argument: it makes my life easier and no i am not aiming towards more profit just less traveling time coz i am lazy just like the people above are too lazy to manage their training...not supported
1/19/2009,i do not support this. there are far more important and fun things ccp could work on. i strongly encourage players to get over it and learn to manage time and logins.
1/19/2009,"how do you plan for the unexpected events ?things like a traffic jam making you get home later than expected, unplanned downtimes, etc.i notice that almost all the people against skill queues keep telling us to plan our skill training. but they never tell us how we can plan for things that we can't predict. they either don't mention it, or tell us to just suck it up and forget about the lost sp."
1/19/2009,supported. and wanna more than 5 clones coz all my five clones are with implants...
1/19/2009,i would like to see jump clones nerfed or (even better) removed.
1/19/2009,this seems to be a good idea... :)
1/19/2009,oh and unless i'm blind and it already can be don an option to look through containers in remote stations would be nice :d
1/19/2009,"just like i think he was being unfair for slamming your suggestions without reasons given, i think you're being unfair for calling him a ""mouthpiece of goonswarm"". yes, he's a goon. no, he's not some sort of mindless propaganda-spewing automaton. if you want him to engage in sensible discourse with you, you ought to start by not issuing groundless insults. also, if your goal is to put ginormous alliances on equal footing, you'd do well to shut this thread down right now and save yourself the trouble. even if it was possible to make a game where 5000 players are on par with 5, i'd want no part of it."
1/19/2009,"1) interesting idea2) yes!3) yep4) to a point5) totally agree6) disagree: i think ships should be more costly, make them stand and fight in other ways, but if they stink/unlucky at pvp, make it costly so they get smarter. keep the market flowing dont give free money away!7) i agree to a point, i think it is getting too easy to move long distances, allowing mega war machines to just pounce at will anyplace in the galaxy. would be interesting to see what eve would be like if movement of war fleets was a lot more limited.8) totally!9) long over due!10) yes!11) mm not sure on that one.12) um, sure"
1/19/2009,make this game more cut-throat
1/19/2009,"its almost impossible to catch someone in empire that you may attack and actually destroy his/her ship.docking games, high agility on the ships, jump portal games etc.please make it more difficult to avoid all fighting once undocked. if you undock during war its a decision you have made and it should mean something."
1/19/2009,"signed, some good ideas here1) interesting - a delay to local would be great indeed2) not bothered either way3) never gonna happen4) good idea5) i like this alot. everytime it is brought up however, people bring up the bookmark argument. here's the answer - put a 5km warp disruption bubble around every gate in empire at least, so it doesn't matter if you have bm's or not, you get stopped right at the edge. i used to love the rush i'd get from the 15km dash to gate/station, i miss it6) i agree7) not bothered (empire hugger lol)8) good idea, i agree9) meh, this isn't something that bothers me, but i know it bothers many 10) awesome idea11) good idea,, ccp would never implement it though 12) great idea. i would actually extend this to individuals aswell, perhaps a 48 hour cool down rather than a week. it is way to easy to corp hop and avoid dec'soverall, some great ideas here, although i doubt ccp will ever implement any. with every patch, it gets harder to engage targets that don't want to be engaged. another year and i wouldn't be surprised to see a pvp ""flag"". that will be a sad day for eve, and the day i cancel my account"
1/19/2009,"back during the first csm, he was probably the most reasonable one amongst the bunch. if he had run this time around, i'd have voted for him without second thoughts.and as said, those suggestions are mostly crap. they do not solve the fundamental problem of pvp today; the lack of reasons to fight in face of bad odds. the suggestions only make the costs higher and/or restrict peoples abilities to do stuff."
1/19/2009,i did run the last time around :(
1/19/2009,"another /facepalm. 'hai ccp, can haz all good missionz befoar i logz for teh nite plix?'you want everyone to just do their worlds collides and blockades and let the others expire while asleep or at work? why? why don't you just propose they remove the allegedly 'crap' missions from the game?"
1/19/2009,even better idea why not have the agent just list all the missions available then you select the one you want every time.unsupportable. imho you're the type of player that gives mission runners a bad name.
1/19/2009,we should stop replying to his topics.... maybe he will go away.
1/19/2009,i fully support this... but only if all lvl 4 agents are moved to low sec and null sec.
1/19/2009,as you've seen from this thread:
1/19/2009,have to post i support my own topic.. silly forums.
1/19/2009,"your link is broken.anyway, i'm just a new player, so i don't know how large fleet battles affect performance on the premium client. however, your specs are a bit better than mine and my computer runs the premium client just fine (have not done large fleet battles yet). caldari and minmatar stations sometimes produce some skipping when being looked at, but if i need to i can turn down the graphics settings (i have shadows and the bloom effect enabled)."
1/19/2009,have you even tried running premium lite?oh wait... you have no blithering idea what it takes to run nor tried it.i'm not going to give support to something that is nothing more than pure ignorant speculation./thumbs downi suggest you wait for it to be released before you pass judgment.
1/19/2009,"if this is your system you should have no problem running premium. i'm running the current premium version on an intel p4 3.2ghz (with ht), 2gb ram, and a ge-force 7600gt with 512mb, vista home premium 32, and it works fine with the processor running at about 70-80%. the only time i have big problems is when the background virus scanner kicks in.i think you'll probably find that the premium lite comes with a set of switches to tune the client for the machine, just like premium, but until further details are released i'm unable to support your suggestion."
1/19/2009,in case you didn't read my first post i played full version of premium and all it did was give me an epic headache and obliterate my os. please do not pass judgement on what i think it takes to run it as the full version of premium doesn't work on my over the top pc for supreme commander forged alliance which requires more than eve.
1/19/2009,then don't bother posting here.... because you obviously didn't read.i said premium litenot premium... again.... stop being ignorant... and start thinking before you post.
1/19/2009,"please stop posting... thank you for thinking half a second. perhaps you need a full caps statement to understand what i did.i used eve online premium graphics and set everything to absoltue minimum settings and it destroyed my operating system.pepsi, caffine free pepsi, pepsi one, it doesn't matter, still is pepsi. i'm against the removal of something that works just fine for me the way i want it to. now if you're only here to flame, congradulations, you're only proving you didn't understand the reason for this post in the first place. i am against the discontinuation of the classic client. i do not want anything to do with premium anything because it does not work for me. i don't care what the premium lite says it is as it is still containing the word premium which in case you didn't hear me the first time doesn't work for me.your arguement is flawed on the basis that you're 100% certian that lite will not work? no, because i'm for the fact that classic works fine for me and i wish to continue to use it. which is the purpose of this thread.your arguement against me is that a shoe to the head is not going to hurt as much as a boot to the head. i don't want to be hit in the head by either, thank you. now until you can argue better than a shoe to the head you may want to think about what you say next unless you really are a forum troll."
1/19/2009,drake is correct in essence on the issue. i suggest you read the dev blog on the issue to get correct information:
1/19/2009,"i'm sure that ccp had some long, involved discussions about this before they decided to drop it. i am involved in software as a developer, and i can assure you that having to maintain two versions of similar software is a pain in the rear. it takes time from the developers, the artists, the qa guys, everyone - and it can be expensive. deprecating the classic client would free up a lot of resources that can be used to fix existing issues and work on improvements.the premium lite client may run very well - we'll have to wait and see. they may have a release cycle where the classic, premium, and premium lite clients are all available while they work out the kinks in the lite version.personally, i'm sad to see it go, but if it means more resources devoted to other issues then i'm all for it. i'm sorry that you are having problems with the premium client, but have you tried filing a bug report? and, what do you mean by ""it obliterated my operating system.""? if you're talking about the old boot.ini thing... that's long gone, and i don't think it affected vista systems anyways."
1/19/2009,my argument against you is your ignorance in assuming that all things are equal... all things are not equal.premium client and premium lite are worlds apart... you think they are identical... they are not... if you bother to read and do your homework before blasting me with your ignorance of the situation... it would be a little different.we don't know the requirements for premium lite..... because it has not been released yet!top that off with the fact that others are running premium on the hardware configuration similar to yours means your obviously making a mistake somewhere along the line.your asking for them to keep classic with absolutely no knowledge of the forthcoming new client.. such things are nothing more than a testimony to your ignorance.if your going to assume the world is going to end.. then you will live a stress filled and very short life.i suggest you take a step back and be patient enough to let the good folks at ccp do there bloody jobs instead of declaring there work to be a total failure.for all we know premium lite is classic 2.0.so instead of jumping to conclusions... i suggest you look before leap... eh?
1/19/2009,"i knew that the first time i posted. it is still going to use the premium graphics though or did i miss that?nope, apparently i got that 100% on the money. even so, a lesser rendered version of a ship of premium will take more resources from my system than a classic version. and i don't see any reason i should be satisfied with being forced to upgrade without a say in the matter. of course if they cut expenses and income by more than expenses what they do is moot in process anyways. so let players speak. let them voice their choice. arguements are irrelevant on for or against really.i see three things possible.with the loss of classic client they loose some playerbase. they guess that 95% of the playerbase can upgrade to what they're calling premium lite without changing any of their system.1: if this is true then they cut out a development process, cut costs, and improve quality. losses remain minimal compared benefits.2: if this is not true then they loose more playerbase, but the development cost cuts keep them in the black.3: if it is way off then they loose more playerbase than cutting of costs, increase the bar for people to start joining, and start running in the red leading to higher subscription rates and less players.is it wrong for me to not want number 3 to happen and people to actually voice they want the classic, or do we want to wait and see which number comes up? then again, there are no hard numbers yet, only a guess. thus the reason for this thread. no need to bicker over it. i prefer classic the way it is, it has my support, and i want to know who else thinks this way. do we or do we not get a say?if you don't like what i'm saying, don't reply, it's like saying you don't support it.if you support this petition, reply, check that ""support this topic"" box while you're at it.i remember there being 45,000 players online at one time. i wonder how many of them prefer the classic over the premium. but if we're going to bicker over it all day then nothing gets done, no data to use, and nothing happens other than a giant fireball where information was supposed to go. so this is my final post in this thread."
1/19/2009,"i believe you are missing the point that drake is making, in that we dont know what the specs will be for the premium lite client until it happens, even then there will be beta testing and a min requirement.the way i read the ccp announcement was that the premium-lite client will make use of the same code base as premium, with down graded graphics and maps, that will allow users to run on boarderline pc's.ultimately this is a commercial decision by ccp to allow them to push eve forward, and maintaining 2 seperate codebases, is holding them back.as far as your system goes, as i said in a previous post, im using a system that is by far inferior to yours (the gpu is an agp8 fit card), and premium works well. as for eve obliterating the os what do you mean? the only major issue with premium that caused an os fail was the boot.ini **** up, and that only affected the xp and prior o/s, as to my knowledge vista doesnt use a boot.ini."
1/19/2009,"are you ******ed? only positive replies?people can support the topic or say they do not like this proposal. i disagree with the op and suggest you look up ""discussion"" in the dictionary as you have zero understanding of this forum and are just a whiny 5 year old that is having a tantrum because god forbid someone disagrees with you. grow up."
1/19/2009,"while i agree with you 100%, it would have been a lot funnier (and probably more demoralizing) for the op had there been no more replies."
1/19/2009,"after reading all the complaints about eccm, it's ineffectiveness on smaller ships and the fact that it doesn't supply a bonus to your own ship when there are no jammers in play, i've thought out and played around with the following suggestion.to solve the first problem, i suggest we change eccm to a flat sensor boost rather than a % boost. part of the reason why people dislike falcons is there large jam range, and the ships that would be capable of crossing this range in a reasonable time and could probably kill the falcon in the same timeframe often have low sensor strength and limited slots. (i.e. taranis, claw, vagabond, crusader)for our second problem, changing eccm to have a signiture radius reduction will help achieve this. there are no modules in game currently which have this effect.proposed modules for low/medium slot.eccm tech i [+10 sensor strength, 2.5% signiture radius reduction]eccm meta 1 [+11 sensor strength, 3.0% signiture radius reduction]eccm meta 2 [+12 sensor strength, 3.5% signiture radius reduction]eccm meta 3 [+13 sensor strength, 4.0% signiture radius reduction]eccm meta 4 [+14 sensor strength, 4.5% signiture radius reduction]eccm tech ii [+15 sensor strength, 5.0% signiture radius reduction]the midslot equilivant will be able to be scripted for either sensor strength or signiture reduction and it can be overheated too. the lowslot one becomes more valuable than it was previously, giving the same stats as a midslot unscripted and less fittings / needing to be activated.example. on a taranis.before: a taranis fit's a tech ii eccm, it also has a microwarpdrive and a warp scrambler. even with the eccm fitted it's chance to be jammed by a gallente racial from a falcon/rook is 80.1%. (assuming 1 racial is used, falcon has 3 sda's and ecm range rigs.)after: a taranis fit's a new tech ii eccm with sensor strength script + mwd/ws (9 base + 30). the chance of the falcon jamming it now with single racial is 36.2%. the taranis now has a much better chance of taking out the falcon or forcing it to warp when it gets into range than previously.vagabond before: 1x old eccm: 51.5% chance of getting jammed by a single racialvagabond after: 1x new eccm: 32% chance of getting jammed by a single racial.dominix before: 1x old eccm: 32.8% chance of getting jammed by a single racial.dominix after: 1x new eccm: 27.2% chance of getting jammed by a single racial.the numbers look alot better for smaller ship classes, and don't change much on battleship numbers."
1/19/2009,"if your goal is to make smaller ships able to withstand ecm better, this is a good way of achieving that. but your numbers are really high for battleships - +30 is a fair bit more than they get now. interesting proposal, but probably too much of a buff. still, that's just number tweaking. if eccm is going to get a change, this isn't a bad way of doing it."
1/19/2009,"most ship modules have a faction variant that is slightly better than t2. some of those have officer variants which are much better. yet other modules don't have any faction variant, mods that are by no means overpowered.in particular:*) active eccm and passive eccm: a bit underpowered, would not break game balance with addition of faction and officer version*) target painters: also rather underpowered, no problem adding faction and version*) shield extenders: large and medium ones are pretty powerful, tho not game breaking with faction variant. officer version may be overpowered, but there's always the pricing issue*) armor plates: only the 1600mm is very powerful now, same idea as shield extender*) tracking disruptors: powerful on curse, but very specialized, no harm in adding faction variant*) sensor damps: same as tracking disruptors. ever since the great script nerf, they became half of what they used to be in game. faction variant would not make them more powerful than they used to be years ago and even back then it wasn't all that bad.there may be other mods that don't have faction version, but these are the main ones, that people would be interested in buying. not asking for officer version for all of those, but just faction version to start with."
1/19/2009,"i don't think i support faction extenders or plates, but the others could probably work."
1/19/2009,"not supported1)essentially you want to set up your death stars, moon mining pos, and research and production pos with no logistical need? to me that breaks the pos mechanics. pos warfare aside you remove the human element of maintaining your 0.0 pos network when the players that set up mining pos/research/production pos for their alliance never have to do any work to make sure a part of their major infrastructure runs smoothly is absurd. you want to set it up do the work to maintain it plain and simple.2) i support this idea to an extent. i believe you should be able to order modual's and have them delivered to any area of high sec for a price. allowing it to be npc delivered to low sec/0.0 is touchy. how would it be defended? what if your npc convoy gets ganked?as for a better market browswer i agree it could better. imo you could take the ten minutes to setup your quickbar by your ship setups that way when in empire you click your sniping mega tab and all the moduals you use are in a nice list you can click on.3)you own the space populate it yourself. hell even capitalize off of a bare market buy bringing down a load of good named and t2 items and selling them for a mark up. there is no need for unlimited production slots just better management. station a is only for market production as worked out by panel of alliance leaders, station b for public use first come first serve.4) last i checked there is a whole skill set for industrialist and mining! using automated drones just takes away from all those miners that mine belts for a living. and if you dont have any miners recruit some.5) why remove stront? what about all those towers you get to take down on the first op because someone forgot to stront/restront them? this pretty much removes human error.6) being adressed.the tediousness is a part of eve. i was in goons for a while and know that it is not hard to have bulk items brought down from emp from the freighter pilots for a small and reasonable price. if you don't allways have time ask a corpie to help you out i've never had a problem."
1/19/2009,"big fat no. your obviously unhappy with working and want everything: ""now now now"". sadly, how our generation is turning out. your suggestions basically boost the crap out of huge alliances and will make more power blocs. your also nerfing miners so are you planning on paying them back for their wasted sp? 3) only going to happen with nrds based alliances. since any nbsi alliance wouldn't allow this to happen. 4) seriously big fat no. there are lots of miners that would demand their sp back for this horrible suggestion if it were implemented. 5) stront is fine. l2p.6) not a good idea for fixing this problem. your obviously tired of your war with bob and just wanted unlimited pew-pew rather than all the work it takes to maintain an alliance. play an fps or something. eve is not how your wanting it to be. --isaac"
1/19/2009,there are some ships that are less than perfect for pvping...so what? i rather like my retribution the way it is. i don't want to lose a high and i don't want to lose a low. amarr is strong on low slots and weak on mid-slots...of course there should be a few ships that aren't good for tackling.keep it the way it is.
1/19/2009,"the retribution is fine as it is.if she lost a high slot, where would i put that nos for pvp or the salvager for pve?she is not perfect for pvp, but she does quite well. someone else just has to do the tackling.when i want a ship that is able to tackle, i just use my vengeance."
1/19/2009,as said above. the retribution is fine. want to tackle? look up interceptors or vengeance. not all ships were created equally. --isaac
1/19/2009,nah... i'm eagerly awaiting the use of this ship the way it is....work's as intended.
1/19/2009,"deffinitely needs a 2nd mid to make it a useful ship, whatever the method it needs that slot."
1/19/2009,"i love the retribution. it is a great ship for what it does. it isn't designed to be a solo pwn boat - it is designed to melt things. if you want an amarr assault frig for solo pvp work, get a vengenace (and fit it with blasters, ha ha). otherwise, friend a friend to tackle.losing a high or low slot would make this ship too much like the other ships in this category.i think the retribution could use a boost of some kind - it is fun to fly, but it just feels lacking. that said, i don't think an extra mid slot is the way to go. i wouldn't mind an extra high slot and a bit more cpu/grid for another gun. if it can only do one thing, it should excel above and beyond other ships of the same class. or, make it more maneuverable.just my humble opinion."
1/19/2009,they use uv in hospitals for a reason.. out them all!oh and i will not vote for any future candidate who does not support naming of the characters and their alliances. naming of characters does open the door for finding the rest of the roaches in this game. obviously ccp can't do this.. so they should let the players themselves find them.
1/19/2009,on related note: we need faction and officer versions of active eccmthere's no reason why that shouldn't be in game right now
1/19/2009,"that's a boost i can support. for that matter, i'm fine with sensor strength skills too."
1/19/2009,"i always wondered about the ship logs myself, but i never thought there was anything about them because nobody ever talked about it. what did rata find?"
1/19/2009,"as someone who runs a small, very industry minded, alliance, and i mean very small. i feel there is not enough resources in high sec any more. there is just too many people out there popping rocks, and the risks of loosing a hulk in low sec > the rewards of mining there, unless my alliance had about 20 more people who were there only for pvp/protection... but that has it's down sides too... who wants to sit there and babysit miners? i can feel the flames coming already, and i don't care. it really is getting to be impossible to live in high sec as a small corp, with trit prices hitting 4+ isk in places, all the standard haunts for my alliance suddenly being mined out, and in place of the belts there are now more can flippers, and more ""merc corps"" more than willing to try to ransom a perceived ""carebear corp"".what is currently happening in the game is good for ccp, more users, more stuff happening, more excitement for people, etc... but it is bad for those of us who think that trying to get buy in null sec, or even low sec, is too risky. so much so that recently i am thinking it may be a good thing to close the mineral portion of my corp, cut all production, and do nothing but research from now on. makes the game less fun for me, and my corp mates... but spending 3 or 4 hours just to try to fine a descent belt to mine is is silly."
1/19/2009,"i can't do anything but completely agree with issler. her words are teh truth. the csm team is great. despite us being from completely different gameplay areas, we managed to agree in almost every single issue and showed a consistent front towards ccp. ccp seemed to be taking us very seriously. they were well prepared for the discussion, they did their best bringing the most related ccp devs to the discussions, so the ccp staff was rotating throughout the meetings. the devs really seemed to have a clue about the problems we were raising and often prepared powerpoint presentations or statistical data regarding the details of the problem or the way they think things should be. they were also very open, answered all our questions, except the few involving character names. as for the issues, my general feeling was that they kind of know what's going on and do have plans to fix them, question is only when they get time to do it. as the issues were clear to them, most of the effects we were having on ccp was getting the problems higher on their priority list. it is interesting to hear their comments on the problems: instead of patching the surface, they usually want to go for the core of the problem to eliminate it properly. they have some really, really good ideas and i can only hope that they implement them asap."
1/19/2009,i am eagerly awaiting the responses about the exploit. ccp has a chance here to gain back some credability. i appreciate csms efforts and representation of the players. i read the initial grilling you guys gave on the exploit. keep it up!
1/19/2009,"so many flaws in your argument that i dont know where to begin.firstly, you missed windows as a bug..... that should have been obvious to anyone...next: so, according to your logic, winamp, by introducing skins for their winamp players, introduced a huge bug that everyone can exploit and lay claim to millions of mp3 files??? (oh, yes, as an example with worst possible result)there are countless programs that have the concept of skins... why would introducing skins to eve be an exploit?all we are really talking about it the ability to mod the graphics files, and locate them in a format that can be easily replaced, like in "".../eve/data/skins/default"" for the default skin and a different directory for others...- change the eula (that you cant modify the program), that you cant modify the default programs or graphics, but using skins in their intended form is ok.. then we can replace base default graphics files with our own...- a little bit of testing with regards to buffer overflows would handle most of any issues that could result... but lets face it: reading the directory, handling output for said read, use list of directies under 'skins' subfolder into a dropdown list, using default skin unless settting has a valid subfolder, checking files of graphics for valid graphic input (otherwise default graphics is used). easy, simple to implement and good for the game as a whole.i'm not saying that a buggy program wont have bugs - duh!the intention is to adequetely test any portion that could have issues.modifying graphics files should be allowed under the eula, as long as you dont modify the default graphics files... so somewhere to put the modified files needs to inserted into the program.so a litle bit of forethought before posting mindless drivel would be appreciated... some people at least want to have an intelligent, thought out conversation.....ps: i'm one of them and your not. i assume bo'tox is one of them too but never met him so don't quote me on that....!)"
1/20/2009,"what is the critical number of supports before a csm will champion the proposal? any other csms willing to comment on this? clearly your character names are important to you now, because you'll always be known as a csm, unless afterwords you want to escape that title..."
1/20/2009,"the number of players in eve makes this a very fast self-balancing system. if the prices drop low enough that it's profitable to build and insurance-fraud some ships, those prices will be countered almost immediately. you're arguing on a technicality that they can go below those prices but won't stay outside of those bounds for very long. but unless your definition of ""very long"" is less than a day, that's not true.this won't work. under this system, i could put a dominix up on sell order for 400m on an alt and then buy it on my main character, that would then insure for 400m (costing me 120m). and if the ship costs about 60m to build, that means i just made 220m out of thin air. and why stop there? why not put it up for 2 billion? then i'd pay 600m to insure it and get a 2b payout. i'd make 1640m out of thin air."
1/20/2009,"the way insurance works in real life (yes, yes, i know) is that the insurance company will insure you for market value. thus you could buy your raven for 80m in caldari space, head over to minmatar space and insure it there for 90m (as an example, assuming ravens are more expensive in minmatar space for whatever reason). then commit insurance fraud, collecting the payout and making a profit. the only cost to you is the time to travel between caldari and minmatar space with your cheaply-bought ravens :)insurance premiums should be linked to market value. i expect the supply of 80m isk ravens will quickly dry up if people keep buying them just to self-destruct the ship once it's been insured for 90m in another empire.then again, you'd make more profit just selling the ships on the market, since you could avoid paying an insurance premium in the first place. this would also make suicide ganking a little more costly, allowing a slight nerf to concord to balance it out!"
1/20/2009,"no. incorrect. it's not about the ore type.the underlying assumption is that people mining in a 0.4 should be able to make more isk-equivalent than any people mining in a 1.0, and that people in 0.0 should be able to make more than any other mining in 0.4.actually, make that ""people mining in lowsec should be able to get at least twice the equivalent isk value of a highsec miner, 0.0 miners should get at least twice of lowsec miners, with deep 0.0 miners getting twice the equivalent of shallow 0.0 miners"".the lower the system security, the higher the potential isk-equivalent reward you should be able to obtain.and that's simple gameplay or game mechanics common sense. which right now is broken. and this system can help fix it."
1/20/2009,"again, that's completely abusable. what if i manipulate the market price of a certain ship in a remote backend region to thousands of times its normal price and then commit insurance fraud? not to mention the fact that if it were implemented prices of ships would likely enter into an ever-increasing spiral."
1/20/2009,"you'd better not be including me in that ""keynesians"" crack seriously though, the reason crokite will be better than veldspar is that it's rarer and harder to get your hands on. none of these proposals will change that, so far as i can tell. if they do, then yes, crokite should be cheaper than veldspar. i'm a fan of as free of a market as we can put into this game, and floating mineral prices seem like a good way of doing that. also, thanks for the link. good stuff, i can definitely see why it won a nobel. amazing how long it took people to clue in that the private sector makes its decisions based on things other than blind parameterization, but at least they've mostly clued in since then. now all we have to do is apply the same analysis to all these infernal ""bailouts"". no, no, no. make it dependent on global average market prices. that's not seriously scammable."
1/20/2009,"well, i haven't wanted to trot out this big gun...but the above example leaves me no choice. get rid of insurance. insurance is for something that is costly and rare. the scenario's nyphur cooks up are ones that suggest blowing up a ship is not rare, but in fact, desirable. so desirable people will do it as soon as they undock.this is why car insurance works in the real world. you don't want to crash your car because,1. you might get injured.2. you might get sued.of course, there is the issue of moral hazard (i.e. with insurance you'll be less careful than without it), but that problem in car insurance is off set by allowing insurance companies to seperate people by risk catagory and charge different deductibles.so long as people could have a reason to go out of their way and blow up their ships you have a problem. the problem isn't mining it is insurance.or a global median so some twit can't build 2 domis put 1 on the market for 900 trillion (or some suitably large amount), sell one to his alt for 1 isk (off market--e.g. contracting) and make a killing. if you really, really want to keep insurance.actually that did seem to be the thrust of nyphur's post, but oh well. again my question: why? if the market evloves in a way that makes this not true...so what? why care? except for the pirates most players don't like low sec. why? the pirates.you have the assumption that mining in 0.4 should be more lucrative than it is, but you have nothing to support this.but 0.0 is less risky than low sec which shoots this viewpoint out of the water. i know guys who can mine all damn day in 0.0 with far, far less risk than in a 0.2 system. why? intel channels, cyno jammers, sovereignty, etc. all make 0.0 safer than low sec.no, it is your belief of how the game should work. the game mechanics as they currently are make low sec less desirable because it can't be secured like 0.0 and the ore in low sec sucks relative to the ore in high sec and 0.0 when you take into consideration the risks involved.you want to make 2x in low sec vs. high sec then put crokite and bistot roids there."
1/20/2009,"details. something that's an average in principle, it doesn't have to be the mathematical mean of markets. and yes, i do want to keep it - it's a mechanism to keep people from getting too badly in the hole if they have a run of bad luck. a game, especially a game like eve, needs that to keep players playing."
1/20/2009,"i suppose we could make it the mean of those ships sold.other things that could be done is give players a finite number of insures a month...say 3 or 5 (maybe make this age dependent). after that you are deemed a bad risk and you are cut off for a month (or two). now losing a ship actually means something besides just as a way to scam the system.i can appreciate that. but the issue strikes me as one of insurance and that ""market"" vs. tweaking and tweaking and tweaking mining for ever and a day so that people's expectations of what mining should be are met.oh and as for all the changes suggested here, here is my prediction. it will change nothing in regards to low sec for the most part.we have joe the miner. he sits in his hulk on average 2 hours a day every day. at the end of a month he makes...mmmm lets say 350 million isk.now he could be making 700 million isk in low sec if he can spend just as much time mining away there as he does in high sec.i'm thinking this isn't going to happen. why? pirates. those loveable a--holes in eve that like to fly in and kill people just because they can. so now, part of that 60 hours is going to be spent not mining. now joe is going to be speding time buying a new ship, gathering up the fittings, and then getting it back to the low sec system he is mining. that is lost time and thus lost isk. and lets not forget the replacement cost of an exhumer. that is going to further reduce the net return for joe. now joe might even been earning the same as high sec or even less.in fact, now joe can even mine some of the high end mins if he works on the right skills. so now his empire income goes up. so does his low sec income potential...but those damn pirates. joe wants to be left alone to mine in peace (or with his corp of like minded players)...low sec....naw.want to get people into low sec? get rid of the pirates. but that is the point of low sec. this is where small pirate/pvp corps can live and do what they do. and to be clear i'm fine with this (even tho' it isn't a style of play that suits me). i've learned how to cope and spend as little time there as possible."
1/20/2009,"won't work. median sale price? sale prices can be manipulated at a cost of only the market fees for the transaction. a few extra hundred fake purchases of a certain ship a day across all major regions for 1b each would cost sales tax of about 1b total per day but would raise the median price several hundred million. a stockpile of those ships would then have increased in value by a few hundred million each since they could now be insured for a few hundred mil and self-destructed.and if you think there aren't people with enough money and vindictiveness to get people to work over the entire eve global market on a ship, pouring billions into transaction fees in the process, think again. if it's possible to do it and possible to make a killing doing it, people will do it. stop fooling around with market-adjusted insurance and start coming up with alternatives. if you want real market tracking insurance, it would have to be paid in minerals and would need to pay out the ship's mineral composition rather than isk."
1/20/2009,"nevermind, wrong thread."
1/20/2009,"but there's a difference. this idea will require a lot of artwork and mechanics. reworking local won't.of course they have considered it. but it's a matter of priority, just like everything else. i think it's a high priority. but we have to realize that ccp has limited resources. they also have shareholders who they have to satisfy. if they stop doing new stuff to attract users, then the shareholders won't be happy. i'm sorry, but you have no idea it seems. i can obviously not convince you that ccp listens. but they do."
1/20/2009,"lavista ... this idea is dragging along for 3 (three) years. if they were interested in it, they would have done at least something.in the meantime, we got:outpostoutpost upgradessov overhauljump bridges and cyno jammerspos modules outside force fieldnow some of these are quite heavy some of these are light changes. however it's still a lot of work to break-fix a badly designed system.pos overhaul is not even a low priority task that devs could work on in ""spare"" time ... it is still a very demanded issue. it is important for lots of current eve playerbase and will be asked for by the future folks that stay in the game past 2 months and make it to 0.0actualy this is a more valuable feature than new eye-candy or ships as it keeps customers satisfied for long time, not only 2 months or so until the new ships or eye-candy get boring ... you can grow your playerbase by either getting new players or also retaining the old ones."

1/20/2009,that's the point. then they wouldn't be playing the same game as us.
1/20/2009,"the success of stackless io has given rise to a new and fairly broken tactic for starbase defense. a defender only needs to gather a relatively small force of battleships or long range cruisers, and position them around the edge to the forcefield. they duck out of the shield, fire a round or two at their primary target, then duck back in before anyone can return fire. this makes it impossible to put dreadnoughts into siege mode without losses, as a decent enough bs fleet will be able to kill them within 10mins.to be this seems to be against eve's risk/reward system. a small force of battleships can kill capitals at very little risk to themselves. the ability to do this should at least allow for the chance for all battleships to be destroyed.as far as countering this tactic goes:capitals cannot lock onto a sub-capital fast enough in the time it spends outside the shield, let alone hit it with any drones. it requires a large number of sub-capitals to lock and kill a ship skirting the shield before it goes back inside, and even then there is nothing to stop a ship using its local reps should it survive. this is assuming that an attacking sub-capital force is not taking substantial more damage from starbase guns + defenders skirting the shield.webs are entirely ineffective. once a battleship has begun moving into a forcefield there will always be enough inertia to carry it inside, especially if it gets to activate an mwd.doomsdays do not counter this. a doomsday animation plays for 15 seconds giving plenty of warning to get back into the shield.-------i can think of three methods to counter this.the first is to alter the range at which targets can be locked around a forcefield. for example: a defending ship can be locked once he is more than 1 metre from the forcefield. however a ship within 5km of a forcefield is still treated as being in one, and cannot lock their own targets, open warp disruption fields, or drop probes.the second is to have ships with the 60-second aggro timer be denied access to any forcefield until that timer expires. this would work in the same way as not allowing docking with recent aggro. it would give time to kill or web a ship before it could be safe.finally - some form of area effect scram/web field that does not require a target lock to reduce max velocity or disable mwd. this could be in the form of an anchorable or heavy interdictor script. however this solution would require the most balancing away from starbase mechanics."
1/20/2009,"a small, active group of defenders behind a fortification should be able to put up a hell of a fight against a larger attacking force. remember the alamo!"
1/20/2009,"erm, what's this got to do with stackless io? that simply remedied a problem that came up as fleet fights got to ridiculous proportions.i can remember doing this in an osprey in 2006 to rep it's shields and **** the attacking dreads off, buying time whilst more defenders come. nothing new here, and nothing that needs changed imo."
1/20/2009,"i remember hearing fc's talking about this tactic on vent back in 2007 when i was a noob in frege, so i doubt its a new feature or tactic of pos warfare.please correct me if im wrong."
1/20/2009,"for those of you who believe players assault a starbase should always take billions in losses per tower reinforced or killed - how do you counter pos spam? an invading force just needs to drop enough towers to take sov then keep them alive at very minimal risk to themselves and huge cost to the 'defenders'. even if they do lose a tower, it's only worth like 4-500m compared to the potential 1-5bn in kills for each tower. that is fairly broken risk/reward to me.if you want to defend something you should be risking something to do so."
1/20/2009,"this feature avaible for a long time, of course stackess io reduced lagg, so this tactic can be used in greater scales as well. i've been doing it on both attacking and defending side as well. it works but you definetly need a lot of piloting skills, to stay alive (u know what i ment if u've ever been primaried by 30 dreds + 50 support when sitting in a bs). so my suggestion leave this feature as it is, don't allow people to win battles just by pure blobbing.for you jitacitizen4756, my friend: learn how to fly a ship properly and don't blame the game mechanics for your lack of piloting skills. eve is not just game about skillpoints and isk, u need to be smarter than your enemy as well."
1/20/2009,"i haven't played against this tactic myself, but the natural response seems to be ""bring support ships"". you don't want your dreads swatting bses, that's what your bses and hacs are for. and furthermore, even if it does cost you more to take down a pos than the enemy loses, so what? you chose to attack, you ought to take higher losses in the default case. the guy with the fort and the fixed defences ought to beat the guy who just has the fleet. you have the initiative, they have the advantage in a fair fight. it's how attack and defence always work."
1/20/2009,as far as i can tell being on a fortified defensive operation is suppose to offer your greater chances of survivabililty while being able to maintain a lesser degree of offensive capabilities. i dont see the issue whenever i was in a pos sieging gang we all had rr and logistics and rarely suffered a loss. if your going to ask this to be an exploit why not station hugging during a station fight? to me the essentials are the same the target gets primed and deagresses gets some reps until he can dock same idea.not supported!
1/20/2009,"the op brings out a fundamental design flaw in pos bubble game mechanic. even if it's not that effective to exploit, it's poor design in terms of game balance.to make comparison with station hugging: you have 1 minute aggro timer that prevents you from docking. this timer was put in game for a reason, precisely same one as op is talking about. now if pos shields didn't allow someone to enter if they still had 1 minute aggro timer, then everything would be fair, and it would be just like station hugging.i want 1 minute aggro timer to effect people wanting to enter pos bubble"
1/20/2009,"ephemeron would u risk your 9 bill isk 3rd nightmare to kill someone 15km away from a deathstar? i don't think this would change anything in small scale pvp, if there would be an agression timer for pos forcefields. if your enemy had the opportunity warp to his pos, then you allready messed up something. the only thing it would achieve is to make pos defence even more imposible for small corps/alliances if they don't have the numbers. so basicly generating even more blobs with more lag."
1/20/2009,"the game has inconsistency that needs to be fixedstation hugging: 1 min aggro timergate hugging: 1 min aggro timerpos hugging: no timersif you argue in favor of having no pos timers, then you are also arguing in favor of removing gate and station timers. because they all represent the same type of game mechanic, on which people base their tactics."
1/20/2009,"to be honest, gate agro time can be annoying when someone deaggress with a bs and gets out of certain death by using it as a feature. for stations i would do exactly the opposite, increasing the aggro timer for 2-3 minutes."
1/20/2009,"i'm not sure the three (gate, station, and pos shield) can be logicaly tied together with the inconsistency described. gate and station both involve a session change (inside/outside station or new system) with all of the loading involved in that change. moving through a pos shield is a matter of moving a few meters. a friendly pos shield should not make a person wait 60 seconds to move back in."
1/20/2009,"there is a ""small"" difference you are missing:station (at least npc station) and gate: equivalent to a neutral port. they will not usually freely accept a warship firing against some other ship.friendly pos: equivalent to a friendly fortress. they usually open the door for friendly units while firing against enemies following and attacking them. that is a big difference to be precise."
1/20/2009,not an exploit jsut a good use of tactcis. just assign fighters to an inty or fast locking frigs so u can lock there ships before they go back into the pos.
1/20/2009,"both stations and gates are not player controlled, so the ruleset is up to the npcs (ccp in this case). a pos is a player owned structure ... thus player controlled and the rules are different ..."
1/20/2009,"ever wondered why local suck so bad?whell here is an old/new idea:local filter!basicly what i am thinking of is in line with the filters used in the overview.you can filter the local channel based on: player who have positive standing to you, players with neutral standing to you, players who have negative (possibly hostile) standing to you, and war targets.pros:this would greatly increase the usability of the local window because right now even at a resolution of 1200 vertical (1920x1200 or 1600x1200) and maxed out local you are only able to see 25-30 players without scrolling you can monitor the local in a glancewill reduce lag, because a new player won't need to d/l the whole local list upon entering a systemwill help find your fleetmate on jita local cons:i can't think of any right nowps: here is a pic, of what i'm thinking of:"

1/20/2009,well i feel that the entire pipeline between oms and tama needs to be given dedicated servers to stop this lag... only other thing to fix this is to fix the way drones work to stop lag.. drones are the main cause of fw lag.. fleet fights are fine untill people pull out the drones and even a few drones start lagging everything.
1/20/2009,"supported.the issue is server side lag, not my pc."
1/20/2009,"ffs any gang bigger than 15 becomes unplayable. we can't get any decently big fleet out any more.it's very frustrating to see your ship still alive, desync and find yourself in clone bay.ccp needs to fix the lag problem or fw will die completely."
1/20/2009,"yes god fix this friggen lag.. cant have any battles over 20 ships.. sometimes even that much screws everything up. everything was fine till the latest ""server rebalance"" a few weeks back.. lately its just horrible!"
1/20/2009,this is surely the only course of action that can save fw from being a complete washout.kane's idea should at least get a trial!
1/20/2009,signed
1/20/2009,you are a heartless monster.
1/20/2009,"i.e. miss a letter when docking, so you are pushed in space to be killed by enemies? great way to make low sec even more interesting."
1/20/2009,underhanded stuff makes eve eve. removing that is bad.
1/20/2009,"relying on game mechanics to set up ""safe"" fights sounds like every mmo i gave up on.. it ain't eve."
1/20/2009,you really need to learn to insult someone better. maybe a your momma joke. wow has 1 million subs it is possible there are game mechanics in wow that are *gasp* good. while i would never want eve to turn into a wow clone. i still would like to have a 1v1 pvp fight or tournament style fight if i wanted to instead of getting jump and poped like a school girl from those meanie pirates.i am no game dev but i am still pretty sure it wouldn't be that hard to make this happen. and for some reason i think it might help eve in some way possibly by accepting change instead of hiding from it like i do sun light.and while i do accept that i will be flamed for this. think about this on the wow forums that's all they ever do is complain and flame each other . but please if u do flame me try to do a good job kthxbye.
1/20/2009,"maybe you should train basic reading to level 1? ""duel pvp flags"" are a very popular world of warcraft and wow clone mechanic. sorry if you are clueless to one of the most popular video games ever, but i like to know what i am talking about. what i am against, is the immunity from interference from other players while ""dueling"" in low/null sec. the whole point of eve, what makes it different from any wow clone is that you are free to do what you want, which most certainly includes disrupting other people's business. what you propose is a *restriction* on this freedom by making it so you cannot interfere with ""duels"" in low/null sec. this is against one of the primary concepts of eve: non-consensual combat.as for your bravado, i have no fear of noob mm drake pilot #146731. i don't even have to look at your killboard. you are mm/ex-bruce + you are whining about non-consensual pvp = you fly a drake. i have heard your whine before and it is pathetic. i do not ""duel"" people in high sec space, i do things like ohhh say help kick your previous worthless alliance out of fountain. ""duels"" in high sec space are completely useless to the game. they do not properly mimic low/null sec combat so they are useless for training. streamlining the process is useless, it is already streamlined. you warp to a planet/safespot and drop a can with 1 ammo; other play picks up 1 piece of ammo and you get to your carebear ranges and carebear each other to half armor and pretend like you are relevant to anything. i have already briefly gone over what i would like a tournament style of combat to be in eve which would include *gasp* 1v1 ""duels"". your idea would bring nothing to the game. if you came up with an idea that would improve the game, i would certainly support it, but stealing a carebear feature from world of warcraft and blindly wanting it thrust into eve is a terrible idea and you should be flamed a lot worse than you actually are."
1/20/2009,vaal he/she has said that it is high sec only there is no way this would ever work in null/low sec. and i know ccp would never do that. this is a high sec only option so we can have some fun duals and lose ships for lol's. and victoria could u edit your first post to show that is high sec only so people do not get confused again. thanks ^_^.
1/20/2009,"hey guys,i<U+FFFD>m still in reykjavik, but i did receive some good news from the developers. it sounds as if you might soon get your wish.since i<U+FFFD>m constrained by the nda, i can<U+FFFD>t go into details about their rough plans, but suffice it to say that your pleas have not fallen on deaf ears."
1/20/2009,oh crap.wow in space anyone? :/
1/20/2009,thanks bunyip i just hope its contained in high sec only and that low/0.0 can still be ganked while in a dual.
1/20/2009,serious pwnage happening here.
1/20/2009,"i've only pvp'd once against someone else, and it was a learning experience for me. we didn't fight to the death for honor or whatever; he was teaching people how to properly fight and how to fit your ship (his shield tank was insane, btw).the only issue with new things: people will try to exploit it. while i'm not exactly sure how pvp flagging would open up exploits, i'm sure some people will figure it out. and when that happens, the devs will have yet more work ...bah...i'll give my support as well, although i don't pvp..."
1/20/2009,"are you ffing serious.... whos pleas, more carebear hellokitty idiots. please find a bridge ingame and jump off it"
1/20/2009,"of interest, to most of us, is the concept of risk versus reward in eve and how that translates into various in-game activities. often, there seems to be much concern expressed by certain elements within the community that a real balance has yet to be achieved.there is also an issue of certain events, in game, that seem out of place and, to me at least, immersion breaking.in addition, a segment of our community is hampered, by current mechanics, with regards to being unable to truly perform, what could otherwise be, a viable profession in new eden. as a service to our greater community and to, in my opinion, help to bring our universe closer to perfection, i propose the following:1. eliminate concord: (reward) concord is immersion breaking, period.2. scrap the current bounty system in favor of the following:(risk) a.) activities that currently generate an aggression flag, will, in addition, also generate a criminal bounty. (no player generated bounties). for example (some hypothetical numbers): flip a can: 1000isk steal from a wreck: 2500isk attack an innocent: 5000isk destroy the ship of an innocent: 100,000isk pod kill: 250,000isk b.) the criminal has the ability to reduce current bounty by ratting or even collecting bounties from other criminals. c.) if a player is podded while that player has a current bounty on his head, the player loses the number of skill points equal the isk value of the current bounty. d.) bounty accrual will not exceed the sp total of the character. as you can see, we now have a viable profession as a bounty hunter, a realistic and rewarding scenario enabling hi-sec piracy and a significant risk factor added to balance it all out.thank you."
1/20/2009,"the thing that stands out the most to me is the bounty system. i don't think i like your other changes, but the bounty being a generated amount for various acts is nicely thought out.don't like the skill point loss, though, that seems a tad unfair. that said, it would stop the friend or alt from podding and collecting the bounty."
1/20/2009,"i stopped reading here. your proposal will never, ever, ever happen."
1/20/2009,hahahahahhahahhaehehehehehehehohohohohoh <coughgaspchokedies>seriously.... where you on drugs when you posted this?there are thousands of flaws with your idea... but to pick out the most blatant one.what happens when you start accruing large amounts of isk and then you get an alt to kill yourself to collect the bounty.ah yes... a new sport..... isk farming by blood.really...really..stupid idea.and that's ignoring the removal of concord.
1/20/2009,"currently, the jump from high-sec to low-sec is a cliff, just like the jump from low-sec (or in some cases high-sec) to 0.0. recent improvements to ship hitpoints and an increased number of t2 ships have meant that these cliffs are exaggerated, and more prevalent than they've been in the past.firstly, i propose that the damage of sentry guns is dependent on the security status of the system. this would be less of a cliff, and more of a slope into 0.0:0.4: 150% of current damage0.3: 100% of current damage0.2: 50% of current damage0.1: 25% of current damagesecondly, i propose that sentry guns' damage increases over time, similar to the increasing concord response. this would be a relatively slow increase, perhaps 5% every 60 seconds.these changes have several effects:it would mean that 0.4 is slightly safer than it currently is. hopefully this will encourage more pilots into low-sec.it would mean that 0.1 is closer to 0.0, although pilots are still at the mercy of sentry guns and security hits. hopefully it would encourage alliance warfare to spill over into empire.a disorganised gang/solo pilot would have to rely on a high initial alpha strike, whilst an organised gang could rely on logistics, spider tanks, or better ships. this becomes easier as the system's sec status decreases.piracy can still exist, and in fact is easier in the lower-sec systems. a gang/pilot cannot simply camp a single gate for hours on end, eventually the guns would overwhelm a pilot and they would be forced to warp out."
1/20/2009,"not radical enough in my opinion, but /signed on the principle. 200% in 0.4 and scaling down as appropriate to 25% in 0.1"
1/20/2009,"you've got it - we're ninja salvagers and looters. that being said, we've seen first hand the damage mission runners do to a system (come to dodixie for the missions, stay for the lag) and we do our best to clean up the clutter.regardless of whether we steal your mission item or not, is it fair for the mission runner to reset their mission? give me a rp reason why this might work? (oh, all of the sudden, we're suddenly rocketed backwards in time? this isn't star trek.)""fairiness"" aside (sorry, couldn't resist) it's an issue that needs fixing. at the very least, devs must be held accountable to a certain level of discretion, and this must be upheld across the board. if it's not fair to reset a mission because someone stole the mission item, then everybody should be held to the same rule.i'm guessing no. somebody seems a bit too biased against us."
1/20/2009,"with all due respect.... valid reasons aside.... all your doing is weakening the barrier that leaves some risk to literally zero risk.you guys have it made in the shade... you have literally no risk at all in what you do.. and yet you ask for ""moar"".if anyone is guilty of bias.. its you tchell... right down to the core.your just too damn proud to admit it.""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"""
1/20/2009,"i'll admit it - there's no risk today! i've figured out that frigates (my frigates, anyhow) can easily tank 3+ mission bs's for the duration of the salvaging expedition, and that there's little a mission runner can do to combat what i do. sure, i'll lose some salvage to fast tractors or blown wrecks, but yeah. there's nothing that can really hurt me in a mission.(...kinda like the mission runners, eh?)i invite you to look up an old post i made in regards to smarter ai, including mission rats that would appear specifically to aggro suddenly appearing ninja salvagers, and smarter ai that could follow you out of a mission if you ran.both of these options were ideas to increase the flexibility and immersion of the mission running system, and not further bork it, as it is today with the ""perpetually resetting mission"" hack.i'm not biased per se, but i'll fight to keep what i have now for as long as i can."
1/20/2009,"the point is that thie ""exploit"" don't happen. the only ""proof"" you put out is the word of your unknown alliance mate that can set them reset. i asked again and again for some prof, at least the name of this guy that say he can get his mission reset regularly. what you do is to cite yourself again like you were a source of divine truth. i have never heard someone i know in game saying that he has got a mission reset after the mission goal item had been stole and i know enough mission runners.so ask this guy to post here, saying what are his magic words to get the mission reset."
1/20/2009,"wow, that's a good argument. ""it doesn't happen, so there's no need to hold ccp accountable to a set of rules.""i'm being rational. you're being foolish. i'm done responding to your foolishness. it's obvious you have no intent on agreeing, so i'll ask you (again) to troll elsewhere."
1/20/2009,"i'm all for this fix as long as everyone in deadspace shares npc aggro. it's way too easy for a loot thief to roam about the mission freely while the mission runner himself is aggroed by 30+ npcs, webbed, scrambled, and/or jammed. if anyone jumps in, friend or foe, aggro needs to be reset and split among all present equally.if you can live with this then i wholeheartedly support your thread."
1/20/2009,"you scream ""it exist, it exist , remove the exploit"" but you don't care to prove it. i can suggest you get a job as witchsmeller pursuivant?your thread speak of a ""mission reset exploit"" not of ""give the gm a comprehensive and fair set of guidelines"". so i reply to your thread and your op."

1/20/2009,did you not even read the minutes from the csm-ccp meeting we had last week?for everybody who still read this topic:
1/20/2009,"at this point i think there are a lot of people who won't be happy till they see a dev blog on it, maybe not until it's implemented.my response to here:training till level 5, training to a module/ship and training to a cert are unacceptable to me because they don't let players chose the skills they want.the con: can easily be answered with a 'no', as most people would have other skill they could plan instead.if the answer is 'yes', we would need the ability to add skill books to our character sheet before we meet the pre-reqs, while blocking us from training until we meet the pre-reqs.for simultaneous training, the con: isn't relevant as if they want a short skill to train fast. simultaneous training will only work if the total speed of all skills being trained is always the same as a single skill being trained (assuming the attributes are the same). if this does not hold, people will still be logging in at odd hours to change skills the instant they end.for allowing a queue of 5 or more skills, i don't see how the con ""too long periods without user interaction?"" holds. on my character, level 1 of a rank 2 skill takes me 13 minutes, meaning 5 of them is still under an hour. but level 5 of the skill takes 7 days, 17 hours, not to mention bs 5 which takes about a month. the length of the longer skills tells me that ccp didn't care about long periods of no user interaction when they coded the skill system, so i don't see why they get to bring it up now.a single skill in the queue would be enough for me, as would simultaneous training of two skills. but a longer queue, or simultaneous training of more skills* would make me happier, until it get to the point where i can't use all of them.*meaning a lot more database calls."

1/20/2009,"i support this only because it helps the ransoms come in. besides eventually we keep deccing the same corp they will eventually stop paying the ransom and then we still get to kill them. still gets the 24hr cool down period. and the ransom goes to the war deccing corp, not to ccp/concordidea supported"
1/20/2009,"genius! granted there's nothing new, but simply having the ability to extort using in game mechanics is rather nice. it's not as if it would take a whole heap of developer time either; it's a fairly simple concept using already existing mechanics.you clearly missed the privateer nerf. doing so now would cost more than you could reasonably recover, and whilst it may be profitable to do this over a long period of time, you wouldn't be able to spam wardecs at everyone you see to make a quick buck."

1/20/2009,:(
1/20/2009,"1) interesting idea, and one i can kind of agree on. the problem is how you would implement this. would there be a second local window to constantly monitor, or would the people show up in general local? in this way, you would also receive some idea of the ship type the opponent is in (those who notice the number rise can count how long it takes to have the avatar show up)2) interesting idea, but how would that benefit either the pvpers or the non-pvpers?3) this was done to account for the removal of mass as a calculation. admittedly, they did go a bit too far for smaller ships, but it also helps the pvper.4) this was dealt with in the nerf of wcs, so there<U+FFFD>s no real need of it. also, if you were to include it, you should also include barges, exhumers, astrometric frigates, etc.5) no. while this idea was posed before, i think the current system works well enough. if you don<U+FFFD>t like it, don<U+FFFD>t camp gates and instead surf the asteroid belts.6) t2 ships have the insurance that they do because people are supposed to use their brain before engaging in combat. i<U+FFFD>d be perfectly content if they just removed insurance all together.7) agreed on this point. alliances can now be everywhere and nowhere at the same time using jump bridges (reference the recent bob stunt for an example). supported.8) while i agree with station hugging being removed, it should be instead handled in a different way. the aggro timer should prevent a ship from docking all together (if it comes from a player - npc aggro timers shouldn<U+FFFD>t affect this).9) agreed 100%. cloaking ships should be limited to the higher-cost t2 ships, to give those who use cloaks for reasons other than surveillance a second thought.10) i agree, generally. it would help the newer players, and those with multiple accounts could simply use a slot from one of their other accounts to accomplish the same thing.11) no. if this gets implemented, you<U+FFFD>ll need to compensate the npc corps in some way (shared aggro/ability to erect poses). npc corps already have enough penalties.12) they might be able to do this, but only if they don<U+FFFD>t leave the alliance in the first 48 hours. this way, they won<U+FFFD>t be a real player in the war.just my .02 isk from a carebear who understands the validity and necessity of pvp from the industrial side."
1/20/2009,i do agree with goums post (for once)...
1/20/2009,"this wont bring any more prey to the belts. i agree that local needs to be changed. actually, it needs to be replaced with an alternative relying more on skill. but not being able to scan rifters at all will just mean the predator has 100% of the advantage over a mining/pve ship.no. let's move away from spawn camping gates.there needs to be a balance. there should be a chance to escape an engagement. an aggressor finding a target should not always equate to a kill for the aggressor. i would need to see numbers from ccp suggesting that not enough ships are being destroyed in order to agree with you on this. if it isn't affecting the overall economic health of eve then it doesn't need changing.hell no. so a player running from a gate camp of 5+ spawn campers is a sissy? . basically you want instant death for anyone not in a blob. just no.this sounds reasonable. but again, i'd need to see how it would affect the overall economy of the game, ships destroyed vs ships created, server-wide. id like to see this happen but you said it yourself. dont fly what you cant afford to lose. so not really a problem. huh. good point. i agree."
1/20/2009,"no. dont like station huggers? then stop station camping! no station campers, no station huggers. simple.unless youre planning to give some kind of survival chance for other ships to survive an aggression, then no. and using a scout alt is bullsh*t. 1- spawn campers usually have eyes monitoring whos jumping in. when a scout jumps in there is no camp to be seen. when a main jumps in surprise! 2- using alts is metagaming. 3- having friends follow you around every time you make a low sec jump is ridiculous, to say the least. i agree to an extent, see above.lol way over the top, although i wouldnt object to some form of taxation by npc corps.the whole point of declaring war is to disband a corp/alliance. if youre accomplishing that, dont see why youd want to prey on ex members. so this ones an iffy for me."
1/20/2009,"i realize that i'm going to have to repeat this about a billion times, but for expediencies sake, i did not fully flesh out any of these ideas. many of them, like this one, still need some more meat on the skeleton.for instance, perhaps a new module that will increase the chance of the scanner finding ships with a smaller signature radius... more meat on the bones.i'm sorry, but this isn't call of duty. you don't spawn at a gate. if you get pod killed, then you go back to a clone from where you can choose to undock or not, you can also choose to jump through a gate or not. gate camps are never going to go away as long as they remain the primary means of entry and egress from a solar system.moving away from gate camping in eve would be like going to a call of duty server and saying ""hey, guys lets not shoot at each other tonight, we'll just sit around singing songs of peace, love and joy"".the overall economic health is now the driving factor of eve? really? ok, lets go have a really long discussion about ferrogate in another thread, cause the economic health of eve is a farce at this point.i'm saying simply this: if you are in a hauler or industrial, then you should have a good chance of being able to get away. wcs are a good means of providing an escape. on the other hand, an armageddon who foolishly jumps into a gate camp of 5 guys shouldn't be able to laugh it off and wave by to the campers in local simply because he has 8 wcs in the lows. wcs need some sort of limiting factor, whether it's limiting the classes of ships they can go on or how many can go on a single ship.the average player base of eve is a t2 ship player base. this was not true when insurance was introduced into the game, but it certainly is now. most players flying around in t2 ships, when given the option of fight or flight, will choose flight simply because of the cost of replacement. make insurance payout at least even half of what the hull is worth would cause more people to stand and fight.this is the best argument you could propose? if you undock from a station, then you should be prepared to fight. the little yellow and black ""warning"" sign in the lower left hand corner of your station screen is a ""consent to pvp"" button.with ambulation just around the corner, there's plenty to keep the sissies occupied inside the station anyhow."
1/20/2009,"a 1.5 million isk module that uses a pathetic 30 cpu to fit, takes only 5-10 days to train for, and eats less capacitor than a civilian shield booster should not equal complete and total immunity from detection. any argument in opposition to this statement is silly and illogical.npc corps shouldn't be tax shelters. plain and simple. if you want a tax shelter, then go form a corporation of mission runners, and make the base tax 0%. what gave you that silly idea? i've never war decced an alliance in my life to make them fall apart. i war dec the alliances that i know will provide targets. i personally couldn't care less about the political landscape of eve, and most of my fellow pvp'ers don't either. what i do care about is war deccing an alliance, immediately 5-6 corporations leave, and then two days after the war dec is over i go back and review those corporations and guess what? they've rejoined! you've used the world bull**** a couple of times, and this definitely fits into the bull**** category."
1/20/2009,since when do wcs modules help with bubbles and hics ?
1/20/2009,"maybe they will consider it when all the uk players start to drop there accounts due to the high, and climbing cost of playing. i know im struggling.."
1/20/2009,"i'd like to see this but i dont think it will happen until the pound gets stronger, but supported as it makes it easier for me to work out my subscription costs. had the suggestion been made 6-12 months ago it may have been more actively supported, however, i suspect the uk will be taken into the euro fold within the next 12-18 months so what does it matter."
1/20/2009,"would be nice ofc if ccp would support all national currencies, but i doubt that it would happen, as in essence what you are asking is ccp to pay the currency excange fee instead of you as customer. plus there is danger that everyone and his dog are running for weakest currency available at that moment to minimize subscription cost thus introducing additional uncertainity to ccp income.the way pound is going at this moment on the other hand i would not be too surpriced if you guys would have also euros in 3 to 5 years. assuming euro will not crash also ofc. crashing currency usually happens with heavy money printing and eurozone is also printing rather hard."
1/20/2009,local for mission runnersnow i havent checked... but i have a feeling... the server is the one sending some sort of code or possibly even the whole text.not to mention these little messages are extremely annoying. removing them completely would be an improvement; not to mention a possible improvement in the node.
1/20/2009,"i see why they have things like that, for immersion and so on, but in practice they don't really work very well. i'd prefer to modify rather than remove, but the current system is kind of lame. that said, bandwidth is not a problem here. most missions don't even generate text, and the few that do aren't going to cause much damage. seriously, it's plain text."
1/20/2009,ehhhh less text yes... none... no....works as intended... even if its a bit annoying at times.bandwidth wouldn't be an issue in this case...text is just bits off of a byte....
1/20/2009,i never even look at local when i'm mission running...so i end up missing most of those messages. maybe another window/tab/whatever that can be turned off if a player doesn't want it?
1/20/2009,cool
1/20/2009,i would have liked this even when i started playing over 2 years ago.i still like to have it now.never understood why we couldn't do it before either.
1/20/2009,"i like the general idea very much. i think what your original concept needs is:1) making it easier to implement into current eve framework2) making it more useful, especially in high sec3) making it more balanced and prevent abusein the following text i try present you with some suggestions. i don't expectto solve everything, but perhaps i come up with some useful improvements:numbers in bracket show which of abovementioned goals it's aiming for.the habitat ship================* i suggest a single ship type (habitat ships market group) to be added. eitherone hull type per race or simply just a single ship (1)* ship would have no high/med/low slots at all, and no rig hardpoints either,like a freighter. instead, a current anchoring system would be utilized as muchas possible, although some tweaks would be necessary (1)* this ship could be deployed anywhere, only limitation would be minimaldistance (0.5 au or so) from 'major' celestial objects like stargates, stations,*moons*, etc. to avoid interference with other eve life. habitat would bedeployable even in 0.8 - 1.0. (2)(3)* deployed, ship would act simply as a slightly different type of control tower.from now on, i'll refer to a deployed habitat ship simply as a 'habitat'. (1)the habitat===========* habitats could be anchored quite close next to each other making thepossibility of building a whole 'space cities'(2)* habitat would, contrary to a pos, generate no shield and its hps would beway lower. (3)* habitat structures (anchorables) would be basically very limited versionsof current pos structures.* certain areas (moon mining, reactions) would not be possible to do in thehabitat at all while other stuff like blueprint research would be available ata cost of severe penalization and disadvantages compared to pos (will bediscussed below) (2)(3)* habitat would have no reinforced mode (3)* habitat would have no intrinsic defenses but there would be special typeof batteries available as anchorables (3)* in high sec, racial starbase charters would be required as an additional fuel.(3)* habitat that is online (i.e. has fuel) would be impossible to detect both byscanner and probes. (2)!!! i think last one needs a thorough explanation: imo it is necessary that thehabitat itself can't be detected, otherwise it is completely useless in low/zerosec. however, while not the habitat itself, the ships operating the habitat(and players will be required to operate their habitats a lot due torestrictions that would apply) will be detectable and even better it wouldn'tbe a deadspace so probing them out wouldnt be hard! once a solitary habitat isdiscovered, it would be basically lost to raiders. as habitat services-providing structures, being it refining arrays, assembly arrays, mini-labs anddefensive batteries would be way too ineffective on their own, it wouldencouraging ppl to build a conglomerates of habitats, mainly to share defensesand partially to increase service capacity. larger the conglomerate, higher thechance of detection it because more ppl would be operating it in detectableships.(to be continued...)"
1/20/2009,"the habitat structures======================habitat would have a powergrid and cpu like pos control tower, of course only afraction of what small pos has. a new set of structures, basically derived frompos ones would be added with various functions.i propose following habitat structures, further tweaking may be necessary forbalance's sake:* defensive batteries - generally way less effective than those of a pos.primary defence of a habitat, as proposed above, would be not to get detectedin the first place. (3)* mini-lab (double/triple research time multiplier, blueprint must be present).this would allow new players research some basic stuff but noone sensible wouldput a t2 bpo into a paper installation like this. due to habitat lowereffectiveness and relatively high running costs, it wouldnt imbalance thecurrent bpo/bpc industry. (2)* assembly mini-array (similar penalties, i see no reason to limit productionto ammo given those penalties are severe enough to make it useless for bigindustrialists). (2)* long range survey scanner. special new piece of equipment that allows a minerto scan a whole solar system and gives him aggregated stats of the belts, like:asteroid belt: total amount of ore: approximate number of rocks: ore/rock:asteroid belt 1 1,234,567 1,234 1000.05asteroid belt 2 6,234,567 123 50,000.15asteroid belt 3 12,234,567 2,345 6000,05(numbers i just made up)this would be useful in those systems where there are 10+ asteroid belts whichare constantly mined out by ... well by those who mine them out :-). thisslightly smells of a fluff but hey if this wouldnt be too hard to implementit would increase the usability of habitat both in low and high sec even more. (2)* tactical news broadcasting relay - a mini-structure giving the owner a mildto mediocre improvement in his combat effectiveness (like 5-10%) provided he isin the same solar system. can be anchored in high security space only (becausethere are no tactical news available in low/0.0 ;). this would be a motivationfor owning habitats for mission runners as well as give a small edge to thedefender of high sec deployed habitat given he fights a comparably skilled foe. (2)(yes this one is a little crazy i know)(...one more part to go...)"
1/20/2009,"raiding habitats================i believe the abovementioned system makes habitats not only a good thing tohave but also makes raiding them a viable business, because:* habitats would be like an 'added value' for successfully scanning a player.sometimes you scan someone down in a safespot and sometimes near his habitat.and sometimes you find out a whole habitat conglomerate and it's time to callfor friends and have some fun.* as habitats themselves are impossible to detect, it can't happen that onefinds a habitat without anyone knowing. so there's no need for any mails like'habitat is under attack' because either you are there, or you build togetherwith someone you trust who is there and should send mail to you.* concord protection in high sec is interesting question. there are twopossiblities:1) make habitat ship and all components very cheap (10m ship, 1-3m structures)but make concord not guarantee safety of these structures. attacking habitat inhigh sec would then act like flipping a can - defender might choose whether hewants to shoot back and allow attacker to hit him too or just to watch but tohave his ship safe.2) make habitat more expensive and cover it by concord protection in highsec.i think the option 1) would add more to the game as high sec is already rigidenough as it is so to be able to legally destroy someone's (cheap) habitat andloot it would be a welcome change. explanation might be like:warning: concord police force does not consider citizens' space habitats apriority as everyone is given the chance to live peacefully in stations. assuch, attacking a habitat, while still considered a crime, will not result in adeadly response but rather only in a security status hit.summary=======many ppl agree that there should be something like 'mini pos' available in gameespecially for newer players. ship-based habitats proposed by bunyip might besuch a solution. what i propose here are adjustmens to his original designrefining usability and desirability of such habitas as well as making themeasier to implement within the current eve framework, as i _assume_ it mightlook like it.habitats would serve as a sort of mini-pos. their appeal in high sec would be:* anchorability in 0.8-1.0* possibility to me research/copy blueprints despite doing it way lesseffectively and in a fairly risky way (blueprint present in the habitat)compared to the pos.* various minor advantages for miners/mission runnersin lowsec/zerosec:* habitats would work as a personal mini- station offering basic stationservices at remote places, always with less effectivity and more risks involved.* for a big corps and alliances, habitats could most certainly act as a greatlogistics support behind enemy lines (always nice to build a little habitat complexto support your fleet ;) further implications in this field need to be thoughtout as i have little experience there.for pirates (aye, i wouldn't forget about you folks)* habitats would add a wholly new profession of habitat raiding* they would add some extra fun into scanning down ships because from time totime, you find yourself warping to someone who is being supported by sentriesof a small space city.* loot: blueprints: manufacturing materials, stuff ppl store there frommissions/plexes temporarily, salvage from t2 built habitation modules.well, that's it. kinda long, sorry ;). i wonder if someone really read through it."

1/20/2009,"yeah i like this a lot - the sig reduction makes sense, and gives eccm modules something else to offer. just need to balance those numbers a bit but i think you're on to something here."
1/20/2009,"i like the proposal to script them, but not give them a 'set' additional sensor str.more like:unscripted eccm ii - +60% sensor str, -12% signaturescripted eccm ii - +120% sensor str, [or] -25% signaturewith faction & meta levels scaling appropriately."

1/20/2009,"i think we all have had the interbus system on our wishlists in some way or form.we all feel its needed for logistical purposes and to increase our game-experience.i think we need to think outside the normal gaming mechanics in order to get something that is actually going to work and get used.so i am suggesting we think about some sort of non griefable system. in order to motivate anyone from using this service, it has to be a no looser situation.that is why i think we need to make the system some kind of contract based. when a player picks up an interbus hauling contract he shouldnt be forced to do risk evaluation. in short the ship should be destroyable but he should be unpoddable. if he isnt risking anything but an ad hoc ship a lot more players would work these contracts. in mechanics interbus could simply give you a clone for the mission, thus you simply return to the original station if you get shot down.if you pod an interbus pilot you get standing penalty, and this in turn should make pirates an incentive to leave them all alone, because they would loose the chance of using the service themselves.packages should be dropped to space and be undamaged, but only accessible using special hacking services in pos. interbus packages should always be contraband in all sec space. if delivered to a 0.0 concord or interbus station it should get a reward, and the package returned to the origin station to enable redoing the mission.price and reward should be based simply on jumps and system aggression situation (number of destroyed ships last 24 hours) and standing.i think this is somewhat simple to create and would really solve a lot of logistics issues.on a side note. some attention should be on balancing this so non interbus hauling would still be worthwile, and preferably even more lucretive.."
1/20/2009,"supporting faction eccm and target painters, but none of the rest. enhanced lses would make passive shield tanking even more terribly overpowered."
1/20/2009,i would support all but faction lse or 1600 plates.... to many hp in the game already
1/20/2009,"the problem is one of scale....cast your minds skywards.. what do you imagine?? me.. i think of huge gas giant planets, asteroid fields with asteroids 100's of miles apart but an almost endless supply of them stretching on forever, flowing twisting nebulas, comets flying through space on orbits a million years long..you think of big things ya?if eve was done to a realistic scale then just one system would happily contain 50k players, 100k players, or even a million players....but eve is not a simulation of life in space 1000's of years from now (just look at the physics.. i mean wtf?!?). so.. how do you bridge the gap between the edges of the imagination and new eden?you have to think big.. one of the best suggestions inho is to look at the asteroid belts.. make them encircle the planets, or at least make them 1k -> 2k rocks big and thin them out. that way you would start to create the feeling of huge scales. a belt stretching off out of sight in both directions.now, lets look at the warp drive. why do you need bookmarks or an object to jump to? this makes no sense and makes any system feel small. surely you should be able to tell your warp drive to take you where ever you ant to go in a system?? feed in the co-ordinates and zooooom your there.even the biggest system feels tiny when there are only 30 or 40 things you can actually warp too, you should be able too warp anywhere.open your mind and expand your horizon"
1/20/2009,"slightly different formulation, since i think we should recognise that overcrowding is or will be an issue. my own personal impression is that new eden now feels too crowded already, though i can appreciate that others might not feel the same way. crucial points to understand about the perception of crowding are that: different pilots seek to do different things in space and thus seek different population densities; and thus the number of solarsystems must scale up faster than a 1:1 ratio with pilot count to achieve the same distribution of population density. i.e., going from 20 k to 40 k pilots online (2<U+FFFD><U+FFFD>) might require going from 5 k to 20 k solar systems (4<U+FFFD>) to maintain the same sense of crowdedness.perhaps a policy of increasing density is intended, though it would be nice to know what is the intended density.given: at some point, new eden became or will become overcrowded.question 1: how is that measured?question 2: what should be done about it at that point?of course, the answers, as alluded to above, start to get complicated pretty quickly. 'overcrowded' for a high-sec mission hub is different from 'overcrowded' for a -1.0 true-sec solar system."
1/20/2009,"dude please don't let them backburner this any longer. ccp needs to come thru on this one, it is long overdue.thanks to the whole csm for raising this issue, keep the fire going guys, don't give up on the skill queue!!!!"
1/20/2009,we aim to please. we are just as eager for this feature as you. so stay tuned
1/20/2009,it sounds really good and i am looking very much forward to see what eve is like 2 years from now. i mean so far eve has changed since it was first released but most of those changes came from ccp. now that the community has a real option to not just suggest but also help prioritize and give feed back on ideas and suggest improvements i think that eve will be a more balanced universe then it already is because in the end a few hundred people cannot ever hope to identify and correctly prioritize the needs of the thousands of people playing eve.

1/21/2009,"/////signed\\\\\creating tabs would be amazing!! not only could you sort your items much more efficiently, but when you are hauling the items that a group of players has acquired, you don't need to log or remember everything you were responsible for carrying. you could easily create a tab, dump the items in there, and split it later without any hassle.brainstormi guess to add to data's idea, it would be nice to have a sorting function, and a tag that could make certain tabs universal, or local to each station.sorting: be able to assign item groups to certain tabs, and those items will automatically be dumped into the proper tab when you click a sort function. after a full cargo load of ratting: the salvage, ammunition, weapon turrets, and misc modules would all be sorted into the proper tab with one drag n drop and a right click option on all or selected items.tags: you can make a tab like ""ammunition"" and set the tag to universal. now you have an ammunition tab in all stations. then you can make a tab ""blueprints"" with the tag set to local, and it will only appear in that station. with this feature you wouldn't have to create all your tabs in every station, and you won't have tabs for specialized sorting clogging up every hangar you have items in."
1/21/2009,"i like the idea, and it would save a fortune in station containers everytime i moved.the next logical step would be to merge the items and ship hanger buttons into single button (my equipment), with the hanger being an additional tab.i would restrict the number of equipment hanger tabs to a max of 7. each tab then can contain freight cans that sub divide that group. thus if i want to move everything is already packed in freight cans and you just load up and move. why 7? its in line with the corp hanger so the mechanics already exist, they just get extended to the player. i also cant see any reason for more, as this is the way i would name the sectionsgeneralhighsmedslowsammomins/ore/salvagerigsthere also needs to be a way to see whats in a can without opening it, almost like an inventry option on the a right click menu, especially for remote viewing.edit : list format"
1/21/2009,"here's another scenario, what if you've been playing awhile say 2 or more years(march will 3 years for me ) and oneday you come up with a name you like better. the option now is to just deal with what you have now or start a new character, i don't know about everyone else but i don't want to start over just to get a different name. not that i don't like the name i got just have one i like more. ""known aliases"" , i like that idea.again i don't see what the big deal is, personally i don't see it effecting the way others play, hell you can even do some roleplaying as to the reason for the name change. though something like this will need a limit."
1/21/2009,"whatever. the important part is that it becomes a system that adjusts to the market as it actually exists, with minimal possibilities for abuse, instead of being the current system that treats base prices six years out of date as holy writ. i don't care about the details, so long as it meets that goal effectively."
1/21/2009,"why ? because good gameplay is more important than realism. that's why we also have submarines in motoroil instead of ships in space.why care ? because the lack of appropriate rewards makes people stay away from lowsec because of the pirates. little over 2 years ago, lowsec was a thriving place to live in, because rewards were decent enough to compensate the increased risks. now, they no longer are.and it's not a random unsupported assumption, it's one of the basic tenents of the game, which has been tortured long enough, sacrificed on the altar of economic realism."
1/21/2009,"i don't want to be mean but there are no magical solutions to any problems. you can't just say ""whatever"" and ""i don't care about the details"". the details are what needs to be worked out before you know if the idea is even feasible. yes, in an ideal magical world the insurance would track the build cost of a ship. in practice, that's almost impossible to implement while keeping it free from manipulation. quite literally the only system that i can see working is switching from isk to minerals and these aren't just fiddly implementation details - these are core mechanics that we need to look at and say yes or no to.let's say insurance was replaced by npc ship salvaging. you'd hire an npc salvaging company for say 10m/month to service you in a region and from then on any time you lose ships in that region they return 70% of the minerals required to build it to their home station. you'd then have insurance that tracks market values. but that decision to switch isk to minerals causes some far-reaching effects on the eve economy. the isk flow into the game from insurance disappears, which must be estimated to see what effect this would have on eve's current rate of deflation and see what problems might arise. furthermore, the insurance system would be reducing demand for all the materials used to build ships by up to 70%, effectively increasing the amount on the market by a huge amount compared to now. what happens then is anyone's guess. these aren't fiddly implementation details, they're actual gameplay concerns that need to be discussed between players and with the ccp economist."
1/21/2009,"you're right of course, the details do matter - there are plenty of ways of doing it that don't meet my goals. thing is, ccp is going to do the detail work either way. we can suggest mechanisms, but they've got to vet it no matter how good or bad the initial idea. i'm not convinced that mineral insurance is the right way to go - as you say, it'd be far-reaching - but even insurance based on actual mineral prices instead of ""base"" prices would go a long way towards fixing this. it still leaves a fairly gaping hole for faction ships, which is unfortunate, but solving the problem for t1 and t2 is still a huge improvement over the status quo. and if you're really worried about faction ships not having a market value, make lp tradeable somehow."
1/21/2009,"you do know what the median is, right? you'd litterally have to sell 50% + 1 of the domis on the market in the entire game. could it be done? yeah, maybe. but it would be f*cking obvious as hell what is going on, much more so than the moon mining exploit. call it an exploit and be done with it.you could also make it the average median value for something like 30 days. now you have to make fake sales orders for 30 days for 50%+1 of domis in game just to try and get that price up to 1,000,000,000. if you fail? you are now out...using the latest data at eve central (1097 dominix bbs for sale) as a guide... 342,576,000,000 isk, lets just say you are out 343 billion if you fail. and that doesn't cover the 40 billion or so you needed to actually make those domis to begin with. and you'll need about 1.53 trillion isk to make the transactions. and you'll have reserve all that isk for 30 days just to try and influence the price.so yeah, theoritically it could be done. i don't think it is anywhere near as easy as you make it out to be.as for basing the isurance payout on the value of the isk embedded in the ship...i'm fine with that too. make it a 30 day moving average of the median price of the ore.at least i got you talking about the real problem and not the symptom."
1/21/2009,"regarding deflation:i think the worries of deflation in the game are overstated. why? here is the problem with deflation:1. you go out and secure resources to make 100 units of x. lets say it costs for discussion purposes 500 isk.2. you make your 100 items.3. due to deflation you can only get back 300 isk.yikes! you'd stop that line of manufacturing post haste, its a total loser.but do we see this? are ships like the megathron not being made? no. so what is going on.here is an idea: deflation is an artifact of the introduction of new ships into the game.at first these ships are of limited value and purchased by peope who want to ""one of the first to own the neat shiny new toy."" real world example: the iphone. people lined up and paid a premium to buy the phone. to them it was worth it to be one of the first with this new technology. of course, like in eve, they whined bitterly when the rest of the market waited till the price came down and then bought...but hey, people whine.so when you have new items introduced into the game, then there is a potential for deflation to show up in various indices simply because the new ship goes from selling for 1 billion to 250 million due to competition."
1/21/2009,"/signeddrones are a secondary offensive system, much like missiles are in comparison to guns. every single thing missiles have should be cross-replicated to drones as well, as there's absolutely no reason for disparity.also in reference to this issue as well, please look at de-nerfing the eos, myrmidon and also providing a buff to the oneiros via a bigger drone bay for more rep drones (perhaps even limiting it to rep drones) as otherwise it's a pants logistics ship.rationale for this is that blasterboats received a big nerf with the speed nerf, and gallente is meant to be an up, close and personal punch you in the gob race plus drones. currently, a myrmidon can't take out an ubertank drake, which is ridiculous, and the eos is severely capped in it's capacity."

1/21/2009,"i, as a member of the csm, had meetings with the devs, gms, pos exploit research team and even the ia department. after having talked to them, i concluded that the measures ccp implemented to prevent their employee's interference with ingame politics and/or the welfare of individual players/corps/alliances were sufficient. they seem to be taking this very seriously since the t20 incident. unofficial chats with individual employees also confirmed that there were strict regulations indeed. what i heard there in reykjavik regarding the followup of the t20 incident convinced me completely: the time of ccp staff interference with ingame politics is over."
1/21/2009,"so devs would have to announce their characters then, right? you don't think *that* will unbalance the game? either they form ccp in-game, which would be even more rife with abuse potential, or they sit in npc corps and wind up looking more like mascots than players. secrecy of dev characters, with internal affairs backstopping to check for abuse, is the best option."
1/21/2009,"they have systems? ok.. what systems? who oversees those systems? would it be ccp? again.. isn't this like a michael jackson day care? i am not paranoid at all. i am in fact being quite logical. i know that if the opportunity exists to get an unfair advantage in a game of anon people. that advantage will be used. i think for the $150+ a year i am dumpin in, i should be able to ask these questions and get a conclusive answer. lets do a short hypothetical... if ccp had its own named corp with its emps as players. what would your thoughts be on the fairness of them crushing your pos and destroying your ships? you would be po'd!now what is the difference between that.. and a major corp with a ccp member in their corp? nadda! zilch!devs need to test game mechanics they can do this without playing the game in a player corp. we are the customers, eve is the product. what is going on here, is like buyin a ipod and having steve jobs show up to break it.. all the while telling you it is fair.honestly..am i that far off base here? please if someone can pose an open minded reason..i am all ears to hear it."

1/21/2009,"pay for an ipod once? much like eve.. you do not own those songs.. i actually do not have an axe to grind. i see this as a way to end all the conspiracy theories. ccp in my opinion is deserving of them as long as they have players in corporations that play against their customers.i understand the need for devs to work with the mechanics of the game. however it is not necessary to play with/for customer corps and alliances. obviously i am not speaking for those in opposition. nor do i care much for the bile being spewed. i have not insulted any of you. i am simply looking for a constructive conversation. i find this type of response more akin to wow if anything.it is pretty funny how people get so po'd over a simple discussion. my postion is not set in stone, only a fool thinks they know 100% that goes for those that believe ccp 100% and for those who follow conspiracy a 100%my pov is not either! but when someone tells me to ""trust"" them and that they are ""monitoring"" it after what are clearly far reaching incidents. i think it is high time someone at least opened the door and asked for more clarity.no matter if you agree with my over all position. i am sure we all would feel better knowing exactly what those ""systems"" were.does anyone have a problem with just knowing?"
1/21/2009,oh so now your talking about the songs on the ipod? yes i actually do own the songs on my ipod.. and iphone....your logic is really screwed up you know that?what... did you download them illegally? pirate them? is this implying your breaking the law?wow... says a lot don't it?just as messed up as your op.

1/21/2009,"if there is nothing to hide.. then why is it hidden?if ccp wishes to end the constant conjecture.. why put your company in a position where the most amount of suspicion could be developed ?again.. i think you are all missing me here. you want this crap to end as much as i do. simply doing nothing has not worked. telling people to leave will not work. none of that solves the problem. .. none of your emotional responses will change the fact that the problem of conspiracy and suspicion will exist for as long as ccp plays within corps that their customers are in.the problem will not go away no matter how much anyone plugs their ears and humms.this problem will only get worse over time unless ccp does something other than just say ""they have systems""if you are truely sick of ""the drama"" we should all care enough to find a solution. i am not saying my solution is the best or only one. more that we simply should find one. to that end, i am certianly open minded."

1/21/2009,"you have no solution to your ""problem"" which consists of paranoid delusion.^^^^^^^^without playing the game, they bloody well can't make it any better, and you haven't offered any alternatives. you either accept what your elected representive from the csm says, or you pretty much should just get the hell off this board.if you don't trust the csm - or ccp, then not only should you probably give up on the board, you should probably leave the game.which leads me to the inevitable. when you leave - can i have your stuffs?"

1/21/2009,"exploit? no.terrible game mechanic? yes.this ""ok i'm going to shoot, oh wait now i'm a coward and i'm going to instantly be safe"" stuff is bogus gameplay. want to engage? fine, then accept the fact that you should put your ship on the line for at least 60 seconds."
1/21/2009,"not trying to poke holes in your ballon. but in 0.0 stations are player controlled. they still have a 1min aggro timer.at first i agreed its a legit tactic, but coming to think of it. it needs the same aggro timer that stations and gates have. this way your logistics for repping the shields can duck in and out w/o the timer. while a ship that commits to combat by leaving the shield and shooting, has to have some risk behind it.supported"
1/21/2009,"if it had to go one way or another, i would absolutely argue that we should remove the timers entirely. however, a more sensible solution along the same lines would be to allow sovereignty holders the ability to set their own aggro timer for gates and/or exempt their own alliance from them."
1/21/2009,"/signedthought the aggro-mechanic stuff would be bad and the other stuff too imho.i'd prefer to give people a sensor recalibration time of 30 sec. (wouldnt help much, except expending their time outside the forcefield till they can shoot at all)or make it take some time to loose lock once your target entered the ff.so once they 'just hover' into the ff they are still lock- and shootable for either 30 sec. or till they made 50% of the way to the tower itself (-> large pos 15 km, med 10 km and small 5 km range to the tower.)something like that."
1/21/2009,this sounds like an nc whine thread tbh 1) stick a bunch of battleships about 150-170km off of the pos in question and a couple of logistics. 2) turn brackets on and watch the pos shields closely3) when a battleship exists the forcefield call him primary and nuke him.difficult i know. feel free to drop a some isk in my wallet for the easy advice. learn to play the game. or complain on the forums enough so the game gets changed for you.
1/21/2009,"the same good advice can apply to station and gate hugging. lets remove those 1 min aggro timers as totally unnecessary, now that we know how to properly handle those situations"
1/21/2009,"failure to read ftl. this is a thread on going in and out of pos shields, no where did i mention gates or stations. but please continue bring irrelevant points regarding stations / gates so as to deflect from the topic of discussion (and the subject line) regarding going in and out of pos shields."
1/21/2009,"what's amusing is your failure to see patterns and similarities in game design.if you fail to see how station and gate hugging is similar to pos hugging, you need to invest some more time into post-secondary education. one can only hope that ccp doesn't listen to people who clearly have no understanding of game design."
1/21/2009,"what is amazing is your inability to understand and comprehend, even at a very elementary level.i guess perhaps if you shoot your guns you should not be able to warp out for 60 seconds as well?either bring a valid argument as to why you cannot park a fleet of battleships outside of a hostile pos and shoot anyone leaving said pos, or just give up, you look silly tbh.or as i said before, whine on the threads loud enough about your failures and perhaps, just perhaps, ccp will change the entire game to meet your needs.theres an easy solution to ships coming outside of the shields. simply because you are to lazy (or perhaps just to stupid) to adapt to the tactic does not imply that the game is broken.feel free to bring a valid point to this argument, instead of ""well perhaps we should just get rid of gate / station timers as well "". i love the tears, please bring more."
1/21/2009,"if you must change the mechanics, how about letting you acquire and maintain locks on targets inside the pos shields. when fired upon, if they are inside the shields when the weapon arrives (to account for missiles) then the shield takes the damage as if the pos itself was targeted. outside the shields, damage to target as intended.dreads (and other supporting ships) target the battleships and open up. if the bs happen to be outside of the shields when the ordnance arrives..."
1/21/2009,"your guess is just further proof of how clueless you are when it comes to game design.and again, you completely miss the point and being facetious (i doubt even you are that stupid). first, nobody here arguing about who or what the battleships outside pos can shoot. nobody is trying to deny your ability to bring a bunch of bs to a pos.what we are talking about is the current ability of defender ships to deaggro without timers and enter safety of their pos bubble.the key game mechanic here is to instantly disengage from battle and become invulnerable by crossing 100-1000 meter distance to pos bubble. and even avoiding session change timers, the ability to instantly re-enter the battle by crossing 100-1000 meters in another direction - away from the pos bubble.this is similar to station and gate hugging in a way that people use those game objects to escape combat. i don't think it's necessary to provide proof that people do indeed use gates and stations to deaggro and get safe. a very long time ago, eve did not have any timer restrictions on this game mechanic and people abused it widely. then it was deemed by ccp that this game mechanic allows for some ugly game play - something that just doesn't seem right, people escape without consequences too easily. so in their wisdom they have added the 1 minute timer.again, the 1 minute deaggro timer was added specially to prevent people from leaving combat area while shooting other people and being immune to warp scramblers, warp bubbles, without any game mechanic forcing them to stay and not jump or dock.with the current pos bubble game mechanic, we have: people leaving combat area while shooting other people and being immune to warp scramblers, warp bubbles, without any game mechanic forcing them to stay and not enter the bubble.the similarity is clear - in all cases people see an opportunity to get safe away from combat, while engaging in battle without real consequences. the game objects involved are different, the fleet compositions may be different, but the purpose of tactics is the same, the result is the same - to get safe out of combat.therefore, it's a no brainer to conclude that the game mechanics of station hugging, gate hugging, and pos hugging, have to share the same rules for deaggressing and getting safe.to that i can say: quantum rise patch.you are right that ccp listens to whiners, in a very big way. if ccp can't be trusted to make the right decisions, we just have to scream louder with the right decisions, so maybe their random idea selection person picks the one he sees most. gotta work with what you got. there's no way i'll allow whiners with bad ideas to outshout me. quantum rise disaster must not be repeated."

1/21/2009,+1 most of the people in fw are in it because they dislike the laggy blobfests in 0.0.. what's the point in fighting in small gangs if they're still laggy as hell?
1/21/2009,quite interesting ...
1/21/2009,"not much to say, other than supported.there's a lot that needs to be done with facwar. having enough server resources to handle the 80-person fights which can occur is a bare minimum to start."
1/21/2009,"we had the most ridiculous lag during one fleet, everyone was desynched, people had ships targetted that were already dead and people's overviews and screens were refreshing and flickering like crazy. after petitioning a loss, a member of my corp was told he was not allowed to petition losses due to lag any more because (get this) he didn't contact gms to request node reinforcement for the event.in case the guys upstairs at ccp are listening, they're completely missing the point. fleets in fw are formed in-promptu, they are usually not planned. in this particular event, the enemy planned their fleet but we formed an ad-hoc fleet in defense. we had no way to know the node needed reinforced. as such, i wholeheartedly support this suggestion to permanantly reinforce old man star and tama."
1/21/2009,"support.hmmm we may be in same fight(s), it was less laggy on kilboards ;)"
1/21/2009,"/signedwe have already performed all the suggested lag reduction steps, there is still a problem."
1/21/2009,"we've had a few really laggy fleets so i wouldn't be surprised. in one in particular, a corpmate lost his zealot in tama and was told he wasn't being reimbursed because he didn't ask for node reinforcement. node reinforcement has to be done at downtime, i don't know how gms expect him to magically know we would form a fleet and hit a caldari fleet a day in advance. since these fleets are a practically daily occurance, it makes sense that the high load fw systems be permanantly reinforced. for ccp it's a matter of efficient allocation of resources but the number of people fighting in fw daily surely makes it high enough priority... i mean we're talking about most of the fw scene being completely unplayable at peak times. this isn't like an alliance lagging while hitting a pos one weekend, this is an entire avenue of gameplay that many hundreds of people are playing at peak."

1/21/2009,lol?
1/21/2009,"you, sir, would be more than welcome to farm as much isk as you like. of course, it does seem to be a rather poor and counterproductive way of making cash, imo.here, i'll help you with some calculations.the criminal isk self-farmer:criminal character, (starting sp = 20 million), goes on a killing spree in jita, while his alt eagerly awaits to pod his main, close by.criminal character shoots and pod-kills 3 unwary pilots, (no one else is around at the time, as our intrepid main/alt combo has done their homework.)criminal now has a bounty of 750k isk on his head. a nice payout, for sure.criminal's alt now trains his guns on the main character, making sure to pod him, so he can collect the desired reward.outcome:alt is 750k isk richer.main has now lost 750k sp's, maybe racial bs5 or something.retraining the 750k sp's will take, perhaps, 2 or 3 weeks.at this point, i don't think i need to do the isk/hour calculation. suffice it to say that it would, most likely, be more profitable to mine veldspar in your newb ship, than to farm bounties on yourself."
1/21/2009,"somewhere far off the way main parks industrial with full hold of small ammor or somesuch and jetissons it. noobalt, also in industrial, takes ammo from main's can by 1 unit at a time(probably macroing), getting 1000 isk bounty on himself each time. when ammo is all taken, alt ejects from the ship and main pods him with the single gun on his industrial, collecting ton of cash. he then boards alt's industrial and alt returns and boards main's industrial(if there is a unreducible sp minimum) and the process repeats if the alt has - billion skillpoints he is biomassed and new alt is bornanyway, if there is no concord there will be no 'safer' grounds to trade, produce, mine and run missions (who wouldn't gank a helpless missionrunner/miner/hauler). that will eventually lead to having markets nearly empty and noone around left to kill. so concord stays, it may be buffed/nerfed, but it's not going away"
1/21/2009,"good point. so maybe we limit bounty accrual to, not exceed, the total number of sp's of the character upon which the bounty is placed.say someone then wants to farm isk off an alt using can flipping.each time the alt physically dragged a unit of anything from your can to his, he would get a, say, 1000 isk bounty.in order to accrue to a 1 million isk bounty, the alt would have to physically perform the illegal dragging action 1000 times. no character can even start with 1 million sp's, so one would have to invest additional time, (a week or more, i suppose), to train this mule. so you could simply get your newb alt an accrue his 800k bounty, can-flip yourself 800 times, ??? and profit.if that's the way you want to make isk, i can live with it. as far as ""safer grounds"" is concerned, employ a merc or a, (newly fashionable), bounty hunter corp to act as your police, or create a police unit yourself, within your own corp.i can envision roaming ""police"" units just looking for the flashy flashies, kinda like ratting, imo...of course, if you happen to be flashy, the only way you could become non-flashy, is to go find some rats, (be they pcs or npcs, hehe), and work of the bounty. station and gate guns would remain as they are. faction navies would remain as they are, perhaps we could even increase their presence in the higher sec systems, but they would still be defeatable and not uber and unkillable, like the current incarnation of concord happens to be.i suppose that, if you are flashy, you would not be able to dock in any station belonging to the faction that placed the bounty.so if you get a criminal flag in jita, for instance, you could not use any stations within the cadari empire, while you're criminally flagged. you would have to make a run for it, either safe spotting, leaving caldari space, or hiding in a corp/alli pos, somewhere, until you could get the bounty removed, using the prescribed method of bounty removal or get podded, whichever comes first."
1/21/2009,"big no to this. new players need a place where they can learn the complicated game mechanics without getting insta-popped constantly and learning nothing.i don't see how a police force is immersion breaking, in fact having no police would be immersion breaking. even in the wild west of the old usa, there was sheriffs and police. a civilized/technologically advanced world without a police force of some kind is pretty non-nonsensical, even to science fiction writers.you idea is near the right track, but still pretty far off. concord still needs to protect aggression from being rampant in high security space. a fun bounty system like this could be implemented against -5.0 and below pirates who want to enter high security space. but just yanking concord from high sec would ruin eve just as fast as adding in concord to low sec."
1/21/2009,"i understand your concerns. where i would differ is due to the fact that it would be counter-productive to insta-pop newbs, if the result of such an action placed one in jeopardy of losing 250k skill points, or so i would think.currently there is no real deterrent to hi-sec aggression, imo. simply get your gang together and go suicide gank some hauler. you get your isk, for your ship, repaid via insurance and, apart from a few minutes downtime, face no real consequences for the action.on the other hand, the concord mechanic, though effective at inta-ganking criminals, seems like a ""hand of god"" type mechanic and, imo, detracts from the ""reality"" of the game. i believe that pirates should be able to actually pirate in hi-sec space for the potential of great rewards, but i also believe that the risk, if the pirate is actually caught, should carry an equally heavy price.let players be the police, with assistance from current faction security systems. industrialists will, eventually, learn to happily employ them."
1/21/2009,1. no2. a) i like this. would fix the current bounty systemb) makes sensec) no. makes utterly no sense and that would actually make eve too hardcore to be enjoyable. d) also no.since i overall like the bounties based on actions i would vote for that. i don't think the victim should receive penalties. rather give the bounty hunter more rewards for number of bounties collected.the alt killing however remains a problem.
1/21/2009,this is completely insane and game breaking. i cannot support this. my head hurts.

1/21/2009,"depend on the mission item. some are ""generic"" trade items and can be purchased on market to substitute for those dropped in the mission some are unique items with a name similar to those that can be purchased on market.if you want to check if the item is in one category or the other the easiest way is to r-click on the item and check ""view market detail"". if it is missing the item is a unique item with an unique id spawned for the mission.eve a similar (same name/same characteristics) item spawned for another mission will not do. there are particular items spawned for some mission that have no market bar but can substitute for the same item in another mission, but those are items spawned in event missions that you can do only once."
1/21/2009,"/not supported, if in fact the petitions are getting granted in the first place. (i think they should.)when my mission running fit has some usefulness in this sort of pvp encounter, then it's not harassment.as it stands now, the item thief has a ship he knows will be at an advantage against 90% of the ships he's likely to face in the mission. if the thief recognizes the mission they might even have time to tailor their damage output to go against a weak spot in the mission runners tank. (hrm, a raven in a guristas mission, i think i will switch to an em damage gank setup...)not to mention how many mission runners carry a point on their ships? that's about the last thing you need in a npc mission. there is no real risk to the thief unless they get alpha strike destroyed, or for some other reason can't warp off fast enough for the incoming dps."

1/21/2009,meant to add the thumb :)
1/21/2009,"supported. i hate that the turnaround is too long to jump down to do something and jump back at the end of the day. at level 5 this skill would reduce the jump time to 14 hours, which i think is good enough to use jump clones to go for ""day trips""."
1/21/2009,"jump clones totally need work.how can characters in stories jump several times a day, and yet we're limited to once?i'd completely vote for the notion of modifying the current skill to allow for an extra clone, and an extra jump per day. lvl v would mean 5 clones, 5 jumps per day. otherwise, the flavor text talking about mental training to prepare for transit between bodies has no relevance when we can be podded 50 times in a single day, and not suffer in the slightest (provided you pay to cover your sp)."

1/21/2009,"i don't care whether you ""debate with me"" or not. i'm not bringing your flaws to light for your benefit, as i know you have a selfish agenda already and nothing will convince you of otherwise. i do it for the readers to realize why most of your points are flawed.you think there's a problem with wcs when in fact there isn't. we suggest the use of infinite point heavy interdictor cruisers and you babble ""apples and oranges!!1!"". i mean, wtf? you babble about people having to use ""alts"" to detect gate camps and i counter your argument with valid points on why scouting is no where near a reliable source of intelligence. i even point where i agree with you. yet you come back and babble that i'm just saying you're wrong.here are my points on why scouting is no longer a viable way of detecting gate camps, and i'm not doing it for you, so no need to respond. i do it for the readers:1) alt scouting is metagaming. metagaming isn't healthy for the game. when the counter to something is a metagaming tactic then something isn't right and needs looking at.2) having a friend or corp member scout for you for every low/0.0 jump you make is unreasonable. i hardly doubt many players log in to serve as a suicide guide for most of their time.3) scouting won't save you in most cases anyway. gatecampers know better than to sit around a gate while there are no targets and aggroed to the gate turrets. they warp away and use an intelligence gathering member on the other side feeding them information on who's jumping in. in other words, scout jumps in... no gate camp in site. as soon as a juicy target jumps in... surprise!also, yes, overall economic health of the game is that important. why do you think ccp hired an economics expert to monitor activity in a game? if the eve economy goes to shambles it is potentially game breaking, whether you care or not. and why are you bringing shooting at pos into the conversation? why are you derailing your own thread? if you didn't know, everything in eve affects the economy. but yes, you've already made it very clear you don't care about any of that. you just care about being able to shoot mindlessly and about eve fitting the game to your needs alone. unfortunately for you, eve is more than just you. and it's the reason it can accommodate thousands of players instead of just you.you didn't counter my arguments and quite frankly don't if you don't want to. it just shows you're not interested in the overall balance of the game. feel free not to respond to my points, as i really don't expect you too anyway. again, my points are for the reader anyway. not you."

1/21/2009,why should someone offer a solution if there is no problem? why should someone compromise when the compromise position would be incorrect.you've come in here essentially demanding changes and are now claiming that someone who doesn't want them should meet you half way? why?
1/21/2009,"i apologize if this issue has already been raised by the csm, i didn't have a chance to go through the wiki.the contract system has some flaws i would really like to see addressed. i believe that a few minor changes would be feasible with minimal effort from ccp if the issue were just brought to there attention. these issues are centered around the contract auction functionality:1. i can appreciate that public contracts can only be claimed in region, but it is unfair to require every bid on an auction to be in region. every time i am outbid i have to fly back to the region the auction is held in to place another bid. if it could be adjusted so that only the first bid you place has to be in region, that would be great2. allow users to specify a maximum amount they are willing to pay for the auction, so that the server can autobid me up to the point of my max bid. i would say this is not critical, i would not want it if it became a server load issue, but it would be nice.3. exact end date & time for auctions are needed. ""less than a day"" simply does not cut it. why should people waste their time bidding on auctions that will end when they are logged off? (see next point)4. i just logged in after getting back from work. the auction ended while i was logged off. i didn't win, but my journal has no 'outbid' notifications since the contract no longer exists. i have no way of seeing what the winning bid was or getting any further information! in fact aside from contract auction bid refund in my wallet, i have absolutely no information or notification. i hope the csm or someone at ccp can take notice of these problems so that in game auctions can be a usable tool."
1/21/2009,"essentially turn the auction bit into more ebay-ish.... course i say that very...very... carefully as ebay is not the greatest example of what we need or want.supported either way.i'd really like to see a ""karma"" tool for contracts so those who frequently issue contracts can be karma slapped for scamming.not saying this will stop scamming necessarily.. but a good way for people to report on there experience... course the system is only good as the feedback."
1/21/2009,"generally agreed, though i'm pretty sure ""less than a day"" is anti-sniper. just allow auction contracts to include sniper provisions in them, though, and that problem goes away. none of them are huge problems, but they're all things that should be fairly quick fixes, especially 1, 3, and 4."

1/22/2009,"i was just wondering... have anyone ever played the game called outpost 1? there you would land on a planet that was enough suitable and establish a colony. why im bringing this up, is because it had a very nifty design, you could build underground facilities in levels. (surface, underground 1, underground 2 etc) it should probably require alot of resources to create and maintain, but should produce something that is unattainable in any other way. something that has nothing to do with income. perhaps an elite standing and/or your own governing rights? establishing your colony will be far from cities, but it has great potential as a stepping stone for ground troops and combat. with the awaited expansion this can be quite fun... but the issue would be on balancing the player owned corps and alliances. with all the rumors and conspiracies going around, id never trust for one group to have any of such power. so it must have very firm balance...hope im not making a fool of my self by speaking out my opinions..."
1/22/2009,"i still don't see the problem. that is the allure of eve to me. that it is largely left alone on a day-to-day basis by the developers, especially in the economy. so the economy has evolved in a way that is different than the past. get used to it, that is the way of an economy. economies are dynamic, not static. if you want static, then eve is not the game for you then. you can't have the same eve economy you had 2 years ago without either a time machine or radically changing the game today.and you haven't explained why your proposal would change anything about the lack of people in low sec. so i can get 2x the income. the pirates are still there. i'd need at least 2x the income after losing my ships, my implants, updating my clone more frequently, as well as the time spent recovering from such incidents. further, the more time one spends in low sec, the more frequent this happens and thus necessitating even more tweaking. and all you have, really, is i think it should be this way."
1/22/2009,"you're missing an important part of the equation. if it's proper deflation, the materials go down in cost too. paying 250 to make 300 is just as good as paying 500 to make 600. the problems are twofold - one, a lot of prices(everything npc, basically) don't change no matter what the inflation level is at, and two inflationary/deflationary expectations tend to warp the market horribly. but a lack of production is not a predicted problem. the only reason it happens in places like zimbabwe is that there's usually some kind of economic madness behind the monetary problems, and that affects the underlying reality. money is neutral - it doesn't matter whether you add a zero or drop one, the real economy is unaffected."
1/22/2009,"who says it has to be dominixes? it would be best done with cheap ships that are very rarely sold. and remember that you only need a handful of actual ships and can resell them over and over again to yourself at the hyperinflated prices. to manipulate the price upward all it costs you is the transaction fees (a few tenths of a percent) for the inflated price sales. and what about people doing it on a smaller scale? they could just buy up all of a particular ship in the game for a few days to drive the median price artificially high and then suicide them all for a profit. all they'd need to do is drive the price up by 30% to break even.i'm telling you, if insurance is made to track the market someone will exploit it. and just saying ""don't do this because it's an exploit now"" is not only ineffective, it's also in direct violation of some of the basic tennets of eve's design philosophy. they are not going to make market manipulation against the rules, nor do they have the resources to investigate and follow up on cases of manipulation.i'm going to repeat this because you skipped the post in which i said it. there are no magical solutions to any of eve's problems. people post them all the time, asking for things like local to be removed or insurance removed or all of eve turned into 0.0. not everything has a simple solution and you can't just ameliorate the problem with a broad hack like tying insurance values into the market. it feels like the right thing to do and trust me i was arguing for it a while ago but it has negative side effects that must be examined in detail and addressed before going forward. and if an alternative system can be made that accomplishes the same goal with fewer problems, that should be considered more highly.well no, this is all a symptom of a much more fundamental problem. the insurance prices are based on the npc base mineral price index which is no longer valid and no longer enforced by npc market orders. tying them into the current prices is a bad idea for the reasons explained before. if you want to make insurance completely self-balancing, you can cut the pricing step out completely by delivering ""salvaged"" minerals instead of ""insurance"" isk to the value of those minerals. this has the benefit of being 100% impossible to corrupt through market manipulation. if you manipulate the mineral market, it's the same as manipulating it for a profit now (which some people do). but even that idea (as i put in a previous post) isn't perfect and the rammifications of it on the mineral market and inflow of isk into eve need to be examined in detail.i had some ideas about trying to make this player-based this but it's late and i have an exam tomorrow. i'll post them tomorrow if they still make sense then. i know a lot of attempts have been made to construct a system of insurance that thrusts it into the player-run domain but i'll give it a shot anyway."
1/22/2009,"this strikes me as a logical contradiction. very rarely sold means it is a ship that is in limited supply. now unless demand is also quite limited the price would already be high.perhaps you can give an example of a cheap ship that is rarely sold.youd still incur the sales tax each time which is where youd run your greatest risk. at best youd reduce your production costs. also youd reduce your payout too, because with so few ships youd limit your return.back pedalling noted.in all seriousness, buying up the cheaper ships would influence the median, but if you didnt succeed youd still be out the the transaction fee as well as the money you spent buying hundreds of ships. have you looked at prices on the market? are they that wildly disparate? i dont think that is the case.i find this amusing in a thread of this nature. oh the irony. a thread where the suggested solution is infinitely tweakable. seriously, half the threads in this forum and the market forum are about forcing the game to met an individual or some sub-groups idea of how the game should be.and why shouldnt insurance fraud on the scale you are talking about not be deemed an exploit? how is it different than the moon-mining exploit? people found a loop-hole in the mechanics and exploited it. same with the insurance fraud you are talking about.you mean like your multi-post opus on revamping mining?considering that you havent shown any reasonable weakness i dont see the problem. and just because many things dont have a simple solution doesnt mean sometimes simple solutions arent the answer. a 30 day moving average of the median price is a much, much harder creature to manipulate than a simple daily average.oh and implementing a 30 day moving average of the median sale price might be a very tricky and complicated change to the game code. i don't know, i don't do that kind of code writing.i read the part about deflation and i think it is over blown. i think it is more the case of being an artifact of patches and new items being introduced."
1/22/2009,"herschel,the point is that with deflation and that it takes time to build stuff that lag results in a loss, not a gain. so deflation can be a problem.oddly, deflation is a problem and hyper-inflation is a problem. a moderate rate of inflation that is well behaved isnt that big a deal.it is with deflation. there was massive deflation during the great depression along with a severe reduction in output.i agree over the long term. short term though i think changes in the money supply can have effect. hence the phillips curve. short term it worked, over a longer period people figured the trick out and it stopped working. also, the neutrality of money arguments hinge on the assumption of flexible prices. add in some price rigidity, you might find money is not so neutral."

1/22/2009,"some of the ships that are more or less fitting the bill : crucifier, inquisitor, maulus, coercer, augoror, sigil, iteron mark ii, procurer, ferox..."
1/22/2009,"in looking at eve-central.com the number of ferox on sale is 608, compared to the dominix 1097 that isn't that bad. and compared to the myrmidon's 659 that isn't half bad. too tired to check the rest."
1/22/2009,"608 * aprox 19 mil = under 12 bil vs 1097 * aprox 47 mil = under 52 bil ... i'd say there's a noticeable difference already.yup, glad you took the most expensive ship you could find on the list, the one that least fits the profile out of all given examples.how about a sigil then ? you will notice that while a reasonable price based on manufacture cost is under 500k, the median price for sales orders on eve-central is roughly 3.6 mil - you didn't even have to bother manipulating the prices, they are already ""pre-manipulated"" for you. and it wouldn't take a huge effort to push them well over 5 mil or so, nearly 10 times the material cost at the moment.so... you were saying ?"
1/22/2009,"only if you have massive and crazy deflation. if it was 10% per day, i'd agree fully. at even 10% per month, it's a fairly minor effect on most things. and since those things(capital ships, basically) are known, and lag equally for everybody, then the price drop on them will lag by production time. there's not generally a huge stock of titans being unloaded, especially into a buyer's market. agreed. as long as the rate's small and predictable, it doesn't much matter which way it goes(in eve at least - irl there's some psychological and seigniorage issues that make inflation preferable). the depression is a terrible case study in a lot of ways, because so much interrelated madness was going on that it's hard to sort it all out. trying to sort out whether those two effects were causally related or merely the result of bank failure, tariff walls, customer confidence issues, or any of a hundred other issues that made the depression as nasty as it was is next to impossible. and unfortunately, we don't have much of a case study other than that for prolonged deflation in a modern economy. frankly, the closest we have to a case study is eve itself in recent years, but there the level is so low(once you account for reduced time horizons) that it's barely noticeable. i agree, my statement was a bit bold, given the lack of good evidence, but most of the theory i've seen suggests that it's a collapse in demand that causes deflation in most cases, not deflation that causes a collapse in demand. i realize i'm getting dangerously close to keynesianism by saying that, but it does make sense. the problem is that initial phillips curve analysis neglected to account for psychological factors - the expectation-augmented phillips curve works just fine. i know it's you who linked that paper earlier, and that you're likely aware of this, but it's an important point - it's as much about managing expectations as it is about long and short runs. it's one of those amusing things about economics, sometimes optimal policy is to lie your face off. getting back to the point at hand, though, you're right about price flexibility being important, which is why i advocated it as an important part of the solution. and yes, there are points at which superneutrality of money(since that's really what we're discussing here) breaks down. if ccp were to make insurance cash in and minerals out, for example, the effects probably would be as nasty as suggested. the deflation would be horrifying. there's reasons that my preferred solution is tweaking the system while leaving it entirely isk-denominated, and fear of macroeconomic shockwaves is right up there on the list. i wouldn't advocate a serious change like mineral insurance to eve's monetary policy without an equal and opposite counter-change - e.g., making pos fuel attainable without cash(for example). but a couple percent one way or another is small potatoes. i trust dr.eyjog and the devs to look over the numbers before they do anything too huge, and make sure it's sensible."
1/22/2009,"what are you talking about? you can't just inferr details like this from economic theory. actually log into the game and check the bloody market, there are plenty of ships that are rarely sold and could be manipulated up without a lot of people noticing. akita posted a few of them.since you're not grasping this, i'll run some vague numbers to show the feasiblity of such a manipulation in a broad sense. let's say someone builds a thousand crucufiers at a cost of around 200m. then they decide to raise that price across all of eve to 1b per unit assuming full transaction fees of 1% (no skills). each sale at 1b would cost them 10mil in broker's fees. and to manipulate the prices for a day, they'd need to do this around 500 times a day across all of eve to be sure they make a new median. so they spend 5b on market fees and once they're done they have 1,000 ships to insure and destroy that will yield 700 billion. if it's a 30 day moving average, it's much more expensive to manipulate.don't be an asshat, that's not even close to backpedalling. backpedalling is where you admit a point was wrong and withdraw, what i did was state two separate valid concerns of market-tracking insurance. if you have any actual objections to arguments i post, make them. otherwise i'd appreciate it if you didn't try to attack the argument by attacking the person behind the argument.in this case, it would be ccp's idea of how the game should be. they've posted many times that eve is meant to be a harsh, hypercapitalistic universe where you can do whatever you want. they've made it explicitly clear that market manipulation is a supported mechanism and if you want proof, go looking for dev posts on market manipulation. what you're asking for is a mechanism that generates isk out of thin air to be partially manipulatable by players on the premise that if anyone actually does manipulate it, they'll just get banned. why would we implement a system that we know is abusable right off the bat?don't be an ass. that was a complete overhaul on mining, not a single simple magic solution like ""remove ecm from the game"" or ""make insurance track the market"". i also delved into the impact of the changes, something you're happy to ignore as manipulation is improbable and difficult on any kind of massive scale. you're even happy to ignore ships where the median sale price tracks above their mineral cost like frigates and haulers.i think i'm done debating with you. at this point it's clear you're not debating, you're just arguing and there's a big difference between the two. if you have any factual holes to poke in my posts, by all means poke away. i don't pretend to be infallable but but you could at least provide factual arguments."

1/22/2009,"i disagree with the ""no brainer"". pos defenders are defending a pos. it shares very little similarity to a fight outside a station or a fight at a gate. to use a familiar movie/combat analogy: it's like archers on a castle wall ducking behind the protective walls in between volleys. there's much bigger stakes involved than a fight at a gate or station (losing the castle). using stations and gates to escape combat is part of a ship to ship fight. defenders using fortifications to thier advantage is part of defense against a seige. not the same. linking pos shields to a gate jump or docking because they allow a de-agress is a huge logical leap, as the de-agression is about the only thing they have in common. if a pilot in combat ejects from thier ship they de-agress too right (at least until someone locks the pod)? by the logic you've used ejecting must therefor equal docking and jumping."
1/22/2009,"even if we take point of view that pos defense is inherently different from other type of pvp, i think that the current game balanced is shifted too much in favor of defenders.with the current sovereignty system, cyno jammers, the defenders have it way too easy. there's no good reason to keep a shady game mechanic like this."
1/22/2009,"why does f&i even exist?from the main page, we're told""features and ideas discussionget feedback on your game-related ideas and suggestions from our developers and the rest of the community.""however... it's really just a place for players to argue.the exact same ideas are raised week after week, month after month. ideas are suggested as though no one has ever thought of them before (either due to the seriously faulty search function, or the lack of participants trying to search beforehand).and when these ideas are discussed (quite often including links to past threads on the same topics), the most common retort is ""ccp knows we feel this way about this topic. if they haven't changed it by now, they want it that way.""but really... i have to believe that f&i is simply where ccp moves suggestions and ideas that they don't want to bother with. whether its someone complaining about macros, or wanting a way to detect cloaks, or simply wondering why the mouse wheel scrolls contrary to common sensibility. it's been seen time and again, a new face and name among the threads. ""ccp xxxxx"" or ""gm xxxxx"". and when readers flock to there in anticipation of actual acknowledgment for their ideas... all they see is ""thread moved to features and ideas"".so... long story short. how about some of these ""devs"" start doing their job? how about they start reading these threads, and providing some input now and then? not only would it do wonders to please the masses. it would quell the ever-spawning threads when someone could simply link ""here's where we talked about that last week, and where the dev came along and said...""perhaps, just perhaps... if some of the ideas were taken into actual consideration, instead of pushed out of the room and told to sit at the kids table because the adults are speaking... maybe these same ideas wouldn't be re-suggested time and again. maybe the players voices should be heard once in a while, since it is our subscription fees that fund those devs paychecks.just a thought..."
1/22/2009,"i see two obvious problems with your proposal. one, dev time is a finite resource, and there's only so much of it that they can spend on the forums. replying to us, nice as it is, really isn't a important as improving the game. second, it's generally considered impolite to tell your customers that they're being idiots and should knock it off, which is the response a good number of the threads deserve. just as discretion is the better part of valour, sometimes rendering yourself incommunicado is the better part of public relations. now, i think that the forum could use a bit more interaction than it has at present, yes. certainly some structural fixes would be nice - make the commonly proposed ideas sticky a list with responses, instead of a list of 90locked threads, for example. but there are real limits on what they can do, especially now that so much of the dev-player interaction has been subsumed into the csm."
1/22/2009,agreed....
1/22/2009,"the devs do read the f&i forum. they did use to post more, but whenever they said something about anything, people would read whatever they wanted and start whining on the forum. hence, they post less now. they still read the forum and take ideas into consideration.for most of the ""common"" ideas, there is allready a dev blog or a dev post to quote."
1/22/2009,"1) why not spend a little time, improving aspects of the game that the players would like improved then? f&i may be a lot of whining and incessant chatter. but it's also a place where a lot of valid ideas are discussed and ironed out to what most feel are acceptable resolutions. only those threads disappear when everyone comes to an agreement, and yet can't do anything about it without ccp taking action.2) if csm are supposed to be the point of contact between players and devs, then maybe they could take more initiative in making the public heard. i know that a lot of csm do frequent f&i, and i greatly appreciate it. but it doesn't mean that ccp has done anything to quell the frequent and repetitive outcries for change.i'm not saying that every idea needs to be implemented. in fact, most ideas that aren't beneficial are usually argued into oblivion by the general populace anyways. but the few that are discussed and worked through, could at least receive official input rather than just dying off and being resumed the following month."
1/22/2009,"trying to argue a topic today, using a dev post from 3 years ago, isn't helpful. times can change, opinions can vary, and certainly mechanics have been altered since it was written. so who's to say that when dev ""x"" didn't approve so long ago, that dev ""x"" even works at ccp anymore.i realize that without the right approach, it would only amount to ideas being retold week after week, and devs repeating their opinions just as we forum writers keep repeating ourselves.point being... why are we paying monthly, without acknowledgment. why does our link to the devs, the csm, have to be monthly subscribers as well. shouldn't someone at ccp, collecting a paycheck for a days work, be addressing some issues too?"
1/22/2009,"most of the time, someone else knows if it has changed and will correct you right away. as you stated, why should devs waste precious time repeating stuff if the players can do it for free.the monthly fee doesn't exactly buy you a dev answering your posts. moreso since, as i said, the answers get ripped apart right away.sure, a kind of f&i wiki could solve such problems. but i really can't see that happen."
1/22/2009,"i think ccp should continue being very careful with what suggestions they impliment. the worst thing they could do is listen to all of the ideas on these forums. eve is good because it's built on a vision and is not designed for ""the masses"" the way some other mmos are. i highly encourage ccp to continue ignoring most of what happens on the forum and continue doing what they do - making a good game."
1/22/2009,"signed, and marcus, it was about time someone did this.nice work."
1/22/2009,"can you prove that devs don't read f&i? because i do see some blue bars in there. not a lot, not all the time and not in every thread. but they are there. that indicates to me that the devs are, in fact, reading our suggestions. a lot of the suggestions in f&i are, for lack of a better word, stupid. some are trolls. neither of these two require dev attention. and the poster a few above me is right, devs used to post a lot on all the forums. but then people started taking every single post they made and making it internet law. then they were all outraged when something did/didn't happen that went against what the dev had initially said, so why would they invite that drama onto themselves?you can also find suggestions in f&i, through the sticky of ideas that were implemented.for example, this one, this one or this one. and before you say it, yes, those are fairly old threads, but all the ideas have been implemented in one form or another. there isn't really a suggestion in your op as to what you want done. or at least nothing with any sort of support or evidence. there's accusations of devs not reading the forum (which, blue bars indicate is not the case and can't be proved either way) and the implication that you want f&i to have more relevance, which, again, can't be quantified or defended since we don't know the level it has now. to be completely honest, this seems to just be a ""i'm tired of seeing the same stupid threads/ideas"" rant and then the classic ""my sub fees pay your salary, do what i say"" thread. while you do have some pull as a customer, and while ccp has made efforts like the csm to listen to player feedback, they don't have to. they own the game, they can change it as they want and if we don't like it we can quit.that's just what i see though. /shrug"
1/22/2009,"how many of those blue bars say something other than ""thread moved to features and ideas"" because someone was trying to raise a topic in a forum that actually receives attention.does this mean that you feel the devs are incapable of posting a reply, without ""painting themselves into a corner""? yes, if a dev says ""that's a good idea""... some may take it to mean ""we'll do that tomorrow!"" but it would be better than everyone admitting it's a good idea, and nothing coming to fruition from it.i appreciate the input, i really do.yes, i agree that i may have failed to properly word my original statement. to form a cohesive argument, free from bias and aggravation. i am only human...i am not trying to say ""i pay your salary, do as i command"". i am only saying that it would seem some folks at ccp aren't earning their paychecks.i'm not saying that every idea on f&i should be heeded. far from it, in fact! we all know that a lot of horrible ideas have sprung to life in there. and they are usually told so, repeatedly, until they die agonizing thread deaths.but a lot of good ideas have sprung up as well. and keep springing up week after week, because nothing is done about them.as i said originally, even if a dev were to show up in one of these threads. to show their pretty little face, with their pretty official avatars, and say ""this is an idea with merit. we will take your comments into consideration."" it would do a great deal to appease the masses. it would show that people are voicing their opinions for a reason. that they are being heard and recognized for their input. that the devs are actually concerned that their game is pleasing to the customers.these statements of ""the devs can do what they want"" and ""if you don't like it, you can quit"" are simply unbelievable. of course it's their game. they operate the servers, they write the code, they make the game. but they didn't make it, just to say they did it. they made it so people would be drawn in and play it. and they made the game the way it is, to turn a profit from people enjoying the game and continuing to play it. so they could stand to at least make an effort to please their customers, if only to keep the subscriptions rolling in.again... i'm sorry if i come across as just another disgruntled player who wants it his way.but you have to admit, there seems to be a lot of disgruntled players."
1/22/2009,"absolutely, and i'd be a liar if i said i was never one of them. the qr speed 'fix?' i was, and remain, utterly opposed to it. doubtful about the arrival of t3? absolutely. a myriad of other changes all throughout the years i've played have, at one time or another, made me ask the quesion, ""are the devs and i even playing the same game?"" i agree that it's in no way difficult for a dev to post a quick, ""interesting idea. we'll look into or,"" or ""we tried that and it didn't work,"" or even ""we'll put it on the drawing board soon"" but i have to disagree that it's in their job description. they are tasked with developing the game. that's it. they can take ideas from anywhere they want and ignore other ones. of course, it's silly to ignore the suggestiongs of your player base and ccp has made a good effort, in my opinion, to keep a good level of game balance v. appeasing whiney emoranting on the forums. compared to a company like blizzard, who seems to make all decision by counting up the number of whine threads and then nerfing whatever it's about, ccp puts some actual thought into things (most of the time--sorry guys, still bitter about my arazu and my nanos )also agreed that saying ""we made the game, we do what we want"" is a bit of line with what could reasonably happen. of course, ccp is a business and their goal is for their product to do well, which means pleasing their customers (which sounds quite cold, as i'm sure there are those at ccp who genuinely want us to like playing eve without too much self-interest) but eve is, and always has been, a very niche game. it does not appeal to a wide audience like wow does and it has a fairly high turnover rate, if the emoragequit posts in general discussion and new player questions is to be believed. as a result, we definetly have to take ""pleasing the customer"" within the context of, ""we didn't design eve to seem like a cold, harsh world. we designed it to be a cold, harsh world"" (something to this effect from wrangler, i believe).i would love to see more dev posts in f&i. in fact, i would love to see more dev posts period. i miss the days when oveur or tomb or wrangler would flame people for saying stupid things or a dev spam thread would appear after a patch day when everyone in the office was **** drunk. it strengthened the sense of community between devs and players and made it feel less like a company/client relationship. i also apologize if my reply seemed a flame or a shot. your initial post made me think you were just ranting, but the follow-up shows you've actually put some thought into the post, which can be a rarity on these forums."
1/22/2009,"from having spoken to a number of devs when i was in iceland last week, a very large number of devs actually do read that very forum.so this is a non-issue."
1/22/2009,"because - much as i'm occasionally one of the ones to make the most noise - there's limits on what they can do. a lot of the best proposals are complex and difficult. they take hundreds of hours to implement and hundreds more to test. there aren't things you bang out over a coffee break. and when you're talking about a proposal that large, at a company as large as ccp has become, that means going through everybody from the dev team schedulers to the marketing department. you can't just read a post, say ""good idea!"" and run with it. that way lies a bug-infested nightmare. i'm sure they take the ideas into consideration, but the dev cycle for anything but simple changes is likely up around a year these days. even if they jumped right on it, you wouldn't know until next fanfest, probably, and even then it'd just be bits of hype and some trailers. i take your point. i have some issues with the way the csm has done business - though most of them are being worked out - and i think there's still improvements to be made. but nothing there requires as drastic a change to forum policies as you seem to be proposing. the solution here seems to be, most likely, that if you see a good f+i thread, cross-post it to assembly hall for csming. it's annoying at times having to fight the same battles twice, but that's the preferred path for player-dev interaction these days, and it seems better for all involved for people to work through it rather than ask for shortcuts that probably won't happen. it's not as cozy as it used to be, but neither is eve."
1/22/2009,"i'm signing this only on the basis that i'd like more dev input in f&i. i do think marcus was ranting a bit, but to be fair, it's getting to a frustrating boiling point. to be specific:1) i see more dev responses (that are actual input) to ideas wrongly posted in general discussion than i do in features & ideas. heck last week someone got torfi to post again after a year or more of silence by posting a rant about graphics updates in gd - over the last year i've seen hundreds of graphics requests along the same lines in f&s without so much as a hint that they were considered.2) there is absolutely nothing wrong with the devs posting questions. if a dev, on reading an idea which they claim they do, immediately thinks 'hmm, what about this aspect, have you considered that?' then i see nothing wrong with them posting that. a simple quick one-liner to provoke thought in the right direction. it helps cull bad ideas that simply don't address the full game; it helps focus ok ideas into good ideas; it helps illustrate ccp's position on a given area and the acceptable impact on it.3) if devs read an idea that they themselves are already considering, it's great to hear about that, and allows more focus on the specifics of the idea, as well as better and more informed discussion about the pros and cons, earlier. if posters in f&i are stupid enough to believe that what is stated is fact rather than an idea to be fleshed out, they are missing the point of the forum.4) occasionally an idea comes up that is essentially a re-hash of the same idea talked about by ccp themselves years ago. to name a few, planetary interaction, player housing, environmental effects etc. - what we're never told is whether ccp just put them on the long-term backburner, or considered them and decided they just didn't fit with the game. we used to have a drawing board sticky that oveur made which died a death some time ago. so much for communication about what ccp is considering.at present, those of us that dare to rebut ideas (and usually get called insults as a result) are usually accused of being subjective or not being prepared to change a given area. i know from watching f&i for some time that there are plenty who are quite objective when discussing ideas; they aren't seeking to promote their niche area of eve above all others, though they may defend it. however ccp can provide as objective an input as can be expected, and any increase in that is good.ccp input is good for the community and helps form closer bonds between ccp and the community.on a closely related topic, i also would like addressed the distinction between assembly hall and f&i, as they seem to be duplicates of each other, but only one is actively promoted.that's an unfair and inaccurate statement. what marcus is asking for (even if it's a bit of a rant) isn't that devs read f&i - it's that an increase in dev inputto the f&i forum would be beneficial. it does state after all: 'suggestions from our developers' - i haven't seen any of those for a long time."
1/22/2009,"welcome to an online forum. been here long? the forums are here to entertain the masses when they get bored of the game. or a place for people to vent when they get ****ed of at the game. it's mostly garbage.the eve search engine sucks goat nutz. ccp needs to post a sticky to www.eve-search.comthe rest of your post pretty much degrades into a general whine for attention. i know where yer coming from, but it's not like then never take any ideas from f&i. i would hope the dev's are busy improving the game rather then surfin the forums that are, for the most part, mindless drivel. anytime there is a ccp responce everyone and thier brother jumps in with thier 2 cents, or tries to draw attention to whatever tangent they feel is game breaking.ccp does have people that read the forums and pass on info. can they read every single post? maybe. should they? no.if you have an idea or suggestion, it's your job to make sure it's posted in well thought out and easy to read format. keep it in the first few pages, and ccp will take a look at it sooner or later. don't expect them to bend over backwards for you though. it's thier game, and thier business. they run it as they see fit."
1/22/2009,"you'd get a thumbs up if you proposed more moderation in f&i.you won't, however, for just asking the devs to post moahr.if i were a dev, i wouldn't post in f&i. i wouldn't bother digging through all that crap of witty one liner ideas and blatant whining. f&i has gone to the ****ter not because of the absence of devs, but because of the absence of reason. the last reasonable posters have long been spammed to death by 4chan memes and don't bother anymore."
1/22/2009,"while i can't make any guarantees...i'd imagine that f&i would find itself more direction and guidance, if the devs were to give input once in a while.for instance, if we were told ""this idea was discussed at the 1492 convention, and it was found to be distasteful"" then players could link that quickly when the same idea is brought up repeatedly. it would also allow us to know when was the last time they considered the idea, in case patches and changes have made it more likely now than it was back then.if players were told ""this idea has merit. however, we don't feel that this is exactly the approach necessary"", then players could continue to discuss the topic and possibly iron out the details. end result, the players do the devs jobs for them, by brainstorming a concept to an acceptable conclusion, and the devs get to take credit for the implementation. we're happy because our ideas are recognized as well as possibly implemented, and the devs are happy because now more people enjoy the game and their subs keep rolling in."
1/22/2009,"as long as the one who made the kill shot is responsible for the damage of the explosion, i have no problems with it."
1/22/2009,it is a start.now it only needs to be implemented.
1/22/2009,"if you're worried about suicide ganking, fit a tank to your exhumer, be aligned with a celestial object.you can reduce ship speed to 1m/s to stay aligned, meaning you only have to worry about getting to warp speed. still a lot faster than having to turn to face the target."
1/22/2009,please add the ability to oppose an idea as well as support it. i feel it would give a better indication to the csm if we could show our disdain for an idea as well as our support. give us the ability to give the thumbs down!
1/22/2009,i am all for the thumbs down choice
1/22/2009,"yes, please."
1/22/2009,this should have been a feature from the start. wtf ccp/csm.
1/22/2009,usefull idea!
1/22/2009,"this has been requested like a billion times, but since it still hasn't happened, i'll support it again."
1/22/2009,"i'm sure they thought of it, but decided it might hurt people's feelingsthis game is getting more carebear with every patch"
1/22/2009,supported.
1/22/2009,"you really think so? adding in a thumbs-down would allow objectors to walk into the thread, post ""**** no"" and tick the unsupported box whereas now we're more likely to see something like this:in many ways, i think being able to give the thumbs down might be a slightly gentler way to let people down than the current method."
1/22/2009,"supported, not sure it should be thumbs down instead of please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
1/22/2009,ccp needs to wake up and do some serious performance analysis on servers of the fw systems.
1/22/2009,yes!!!/signed
1/22/2009,as annoying that could be.... i think that would work out great.make sure its a visual confirmation captcha style type system... so you can't macro that.that would really help out greatly.
1/22/2009,/signednearly no one use corvetors. once you can fly them you are few hours from hulk and rich enough to afford it.
1/22/2009,"bump in high secbegging all of your pardons. since nobody flips cans for pvp in lowsec and nulsec i didn't really think to point out what i meant. but that is my mistake just as much as my spelling errors, k.i am talking about an alternative to ""flipping cans for pvp in high sec"" and allowing for a interface option. thanks to all the thumb uppers!"
1/22/2009,"yes, high security space is completely different. high sec only is fine. as long as ship loss is incurred. in other mmos the losing player does a kneel or bow or whatever and no one ever dies. if this ""duel"" stopped the fight at 1 structure that would be terrible.still, if you are allowing ""duels"" i would rather have an arena setting where you could easily make small tournaments blah blah blah i think i've gone over it already.considering the amount of time spent traveling, fitting and stuff to get to high sec to arrange a ""duel"" is spending 10 seconds to setup can aggro really that difficult? also consider that it will take 10 seconds to right click on your opponent and send a ""duel"" invite and then he has to accept it, you are basically spending the same amount of mouse clicks/time so i don't exactly see the issue that needs ccps attention. also, now everyone is inconvenienced with having to shut off duel invites whenever they make a new character or wipe out their cache. lastly, if two new players want to ""duel"" they ask someone and they quickly learn about stealing and can aggro mechanics which is a good thing. too many negatives for a meaningless mechanic. roll eyes at bunyips comment, god now you have us all scared."
1/22/2009,please - please tell me that you're joking. that would be against one of the core elements of eve.
1/22/2009,"guys, you're judging something you don't know anything about. it's not the end of the world for eve.i can't say anything, but please don't judge it before it occurs. it's not how you would probably envision it. wait until the dev blog, then give feedback.i can say that the csm was almost unanimous in our concern for the effects of this patch, but ccp has their act together. please wait and see."
1/22/2009,"yeah, guess you're right. after all they allways stuck to their vision of a harsh, dark, unforgiving world."
1/22/2009,thumbs down for thumbs up ;-p ttt*still supported
1/22/2009,yup
1/22/2009,"there are way too many pussies in this game, lol..."
1/22/2009,"oh, this is a suicide ganking whine thread. ok. cleverly disguised, this thread is. stop flying afk?having ""pirates"" lose months of skill training for popping random trash ships is not the way to go. there are plenty of deterrents to high sec ganking already. the only ""problem"" is that it is so easy for anyone to get very rich in high sec that they are a valid suicide ganking target. nothing wrong with using teamwork and cheap ships to take down slow, expensive targets that do not defend themselves."
1/22/2009,"quote mining skill: a+determining the intent of the author: faili want to remove concord and have actual players police the game. in order for this to be viable, there needs to be a real deterrent to random crime, so the game doesn't turn into a grief fest.in the spirit of eve, however, there should also be adequate reward potential, for pilots that chose to take such significant risk.get it?"
1/22/2009,"i don't believe that removing learning skills is impossible.there's a difference between impossible and just not wanting to take the time and dot.if it is, the other option is just max them for everyone. 5/5.this (cough, cough) mechanic can really put off new players.a new player doesn't want to spend 3 months training skills to learn other skills.the excitement of a new game will go out the window really fast.there is a reason that 80% of new players quit within a short period after signing up.say what you will, eve needs to make some changes to bring in a broader, newer playing base.just my two cents. (and no i'm not a noob. i've been her almost two years have 4 accounts and all of my players are way past training any learning skills)"
1/22/2009,good idea.
1/22/2009,take interbus for example. they are friends with all the empire factions. they are enemies with all the pirate factions.how about the opposite. new faction... perhaps not necessarily new? eom maybe? who is friends with all the pirate factions and enemies of the empire factions.that way you could recover pirate faction standings that you would have lost doing perhaps ratting or missions.
1/22/2009,"juat out of interest - where is that elusive storyline agent for interbus, since that's what you would need to use them effectively? jove space? for half of the pirate factions there are already workarounds in place. trying to get the problem with the other half fixed is already being discussed, afaik.*edit* you might want to look here, here and here."
1/22/2009,1st quarter of 2009 this is being fixed.
1/22/2009,"this is just a rough idea and i may miss some important angle, exploit that would make this a bad idea but what about the following:one of the problems with lowsec is that there is no good reason to be there isk-wise. you can rat or mine but compared to high-sec missions or secure 0.0 space ratting the isk per hour it is not work the risk of ship loss. i propose a new bubble type that you can be used in low-sec to close off a system or group of systems.this new type of bubble that can be used in low sec would work like this:1. this bubble can only be deployed within 5km from a gate.2. warp drives can be activated withing a 20km sphere around the center of the bubble. so you can warp out after jumping through the gate into the system.3. if you attempt to warp to the bubble you get pulled out of warp at a random location on a 200km sphere around the bubble. you can not warp to the gate in order to jump out.4. someone getting stuck in a bubble does not change aggression/sec status/gate guns etc.with these bubbles you can deny access to traveling through a star gate but you do not get free easy kills from people jumping in unscouted.combine this with improved pve isk in the form of better mining minerals or bounty rats and it should become worth it to have an mixed fleet where the pvp players set up these road blocks on the gates into a system while pve make money ratting/mining in low-sec.you could also set up a roadblock and request toll for passing through."
1/22/2009,"such a thing already exsists... its called gate camps.sorry... but your making it more complicated than it already is.pirates aren't likely to play nice like you imply it.... and there version of a toll is called a ransom.not to be condescending but its the truth.the best way to make low sec more inviting is to have a faction that you can join in which you are the ""local sheriff"".but that's going to take a bit of work.... as there are expploitable problems with that.... bribes.... and such."
1/22/2009,"i don't know about this particular application.. but the idea of a ""bounce"" bubble as an additional option to the ""sticky"" bubble is interesting."
1/22/2009,its only the oposite of a gate camp.gate camps only work on incoming ships... exiting ships you can't stop... unless they don't warp to zero.denying them an exit is only the opposite of denying entrance into a system via the use of a hic or an interdictor.
1/22/2009,"you don't get more people into lowsec by making it even harsher - all you have is more pirates and fewer targets. you get more people into lowsec by making it more profitable. it's an interesting proposal, but i'm not sure it actually would be useful for anything."
1/22/2009,"since probing and hictors lowsec is unsafe enough already, and pretty much same as highsec reward-wise, it doesn't need to get any worse."
1/22/2009,"as a pirate, i guarantee i would use this on outgates way more than any industry corp trying to lock down a system for a minin op or whatever. while it's make my job easier, it makes people less inclined to come to low sec, which makes my job harder. not supported."
1/22/2009,i think this bubble idea should be seen in the context of some other isk giving enhancements. one of the problems with low-sec is that it is hard to close off a system. bubbles in 0.0 allows one to close of a system but it results in you having to scout all your jumps at the cost of near-certain death.maybe something similar to a plex timer but that last 30 minutes and then gives out a very nice isk bounty.in that case if one is close to the 30 minutes on the timer one would have a reason to fight in order to defend ownership of the system.the main thing is that this bubble by itself is not as deadly as the 0.0 bubbles.if you warp to a gate and end up at a random location 200 km off the gate you will just warp off again since there is only a small chance that an tackler will be right on you.you could also make these bubbles expensive and take some time to anchor/unanchor so that when you bust a camp you can take their bubble. (cause pirates not to always scout with alts and run-away at the first sight of a close fight)just thinking out loud.
1/22/2009,"the thing is right now if you jump into a pirate camp during jump into a system you are close to gate and unless mega webbed will more likely start heading to the gate and start fighting. you will get away or die but likely not discuss a ransom/toll fee.if you are in the system with the pirates already you ignore the pirates, warp to 0 and go. with agility or some warp core stabs you really do not need to worry most of the time when in anything smaller than a bc."
1/22/2009,with this you might even be like failed state militias with a reputation of respecting tolls and make isk using reasonable toll fees:1mil for a bs/hac500k for a bc200k for a frig/cruiseri am looking for ways where pvp in low-sec has a reason.
1/22/2009,"your assuming a great deal... most pirates these days shoot first and ask questions later.... no ones going to use a system that isn't as simple as it is right now.and there's an increasing number who do not honor ransoms either... which gives way to the mentaility of everyone saying ""frak you"" and write off there ship then and there."
1/22/2009,"it's not harassment now, or there would be actions taken against the perpetrator, which there are not.welcome to eve. been here long?exactly right, and exactly why it's done. here's a tip - don't engage the thief.i have a question for you - let's say your mission is invaded by someone stealing the mission item, and you petition to have it reset. you get it, and the thief returns to steal the item again. so, you have it reset again. what happens when the thief petitions you for harassment, since he now has had to steal the mission item twice. (you're obviously griefing him, because your exploiting the gm's mission reset and not using ""normal game mechanics"", a term which is quoted - oh so much - in the forums.)what then? why is it fair for you to call foul on harassment and not them?"
1/22/2009,"the answer is obvious... the gm would laugh at the thief because its obvious the thief is harassing the mission running with intent to disrupt.oh... i'm sorry... that's common sense.i guess you where expect us to fall for your trap of ill-fated-greed-infested logic?you really think the gm's are that dense to not check the logs and track history?oh i'm sorry... is the poor little ninja salvager crying for his ransom because the pilot is reporting ""harassment""?no favor will be given to you people because you have zero risk.you reading my lips?zero riskperiod...and until there is risk... you will not be heard. i don't care if your queen of the galaxy.that's the bottom line right there."
1/22/2009,"i think the system in place needs refining alittle as i have no qualms about somebody entering a mission i am doing and cleaning up after me but do have problems about somebody stealing a mission specific item that is not seeded on the market.why not make the system better to keep the salvagers on thier toes, randomize the mission item and make that the only item in the salvage that can not be taken by a ninja salvager without some kind of penalty sort of like a booby trap. maybe this will put some risk into the profession it should be.and a final though i had, were do you draw the line between griefing and normal gameplay ?"
1/22/2009,"thank me (heh - bigger than the queen) that you're not the only voice to be heard. that's a very limited view you have there - ""tchell dahhn is being selfish, so let's not even listen the ideas that make sense.""that's ok - mission runners aren't the only players in the game."
1/22/2009,"sorry to burst your bubble tchell... but your stuffed up pride is making you stupid.the voice i speak is one of rationality and reason.... unbiased with the fact that i'm not really interested in the greed or ego of eve... i seek to play the game to be constructive and to further my corporation.... the games too large for self indulgence.your trying to make the bank robber look like the victim in this sad little tale of your so called ""exploit"" complaint.while you have valid points... the underlining agenda is a little too obvious.. and that is why you will be ignored.as i've said a thousand times... until there is risk... you will not get your wish.all you have to do is scan probe out the mission area... show up... salvage..and leave with a ton of isk.one would call that isk farming...zero effort.... very little time invovled.. and you make out like a bandit.someone war decs you.. you go hide in your little hole and wait it out... or run off.... even if you did fight youd have better finances than anyone else combined.ninja salvaging at the time of its first inception may look like a valid tactic... but any tactic overused/abused would quickly change that opinion...case and point: ghost training.and that's undeniable.whats going to happen if you salvage a wreck and you get aggro? how about taking a security hit for interfering with empire mission's? after all you are interfering in the affairs of the said sovereign empires that hand out these missions.you may think i'm just rattling my gums for the sake of the carebears you oh so hate with a passion.but in reallity its because of those carebears your making millions if not billions.... with very very little effort.even then.... this so called mission reset exploit is actually in your favor... so it gets reset... that means more wrecks to clean up.guess you didn't think of that did you?don't want double the trit bars tchell? lost your way have you?everyone knows that mission payouts are worthless.... salvage is what makes the isk.and your little business of taking advantage of that... daresay ""exploiting"" that fact is going to get a little negative attention... because you are not getting any danger or risk from doing it to begin with... until you decide to get even more greedy and steal the loot and then hold mission items for ransom.this is why this topic falls under a controversial category.... and one that will not be paid attention too until ccp finds the time to bother listening... they have other things to take care of...until there is a defense against invasion of missions... i'm not going to sit here at let people be blinded by your ""holier than thou"" attitude.your excuse of ""shooting back when they take loot"" is completely unreasonable unless the mission runner is smart enough to use tactics to wait out the aggro timer... and even then its destructive to the mission runners environment.which in turn leads to the age old argument of eliminate the mission runners and send them packing to low-sec or endless war-decs.at that rate i might as well go get a copy of warhammer online and say frak it.but we aren't there yet... and i'm hopefull ccp won't fall prey to such things."

1/22/2009,no proof. apart from an alt 'claiming' he got a mission reset. maybe he did it to annoy the ninja guys. it looks like it worked because now tchell is crying. make sure you catch some of your own tears to fuel your ships.zero support for a 'profession' which is below corp theft in my book.

1/22/2009,"who's the one with the stuffed up pride? it is not for you to declare that you speak with the voice of rationality and reason. your abuse of ellipses marks you as an undisciplined thinker.i fully support tchell's proposal - that gm's be given a firm guide on the conditions under which a mission-space reset is considered appropriate. if someone steals your mission loot, just fail the mission. it costs you less than one-third the reputation gain from a successfully completed mission.and drake, please leave the ellipses alone. all those pauses in the sentences might be dramatic when you're coming to the denouement in an epic adventure story, but as part of an argument over rules of a game they're pretentious and make it look like your brain isn't fast enough to keep up with the argument."

1/22/2009,"in an effort to provide a more interactive method to voting on issues/ideas i propose implementing an in-game voting method for ideas/issues.the approach would be for ccp to implement an in-game voting mechanism based around the in-game browser which would be accessible via a link on the browser home-page. the reason for the implementation to be performed by ccp is around trust, to prevent abuse and for a tool to facilitate and promote, by ccp, the csm process.the available list of voting topics would be managed and controlled by the csm. the period for voting should be long enough to gather opinion but short enough to allow it to actually affect the csm meeting cycle. the list of items should be limited to prevent ""burn out"" of voters.the results would be available to the general public & the csm at the end of the voting process. the information could/would be used by the csm to aid their decision making process. additionally extra information would be gathered by using the process, including but possibily not limited to: number of pilots who examined at least 1 item, number of voters on a topic, number of (+) votes, number of (-) votes, number of people who declined to vote. no identifying information would be gathered as part of the voting process for the general eve-population. this information would be used to provide some statistical information on participation of the csm process.the issue summary page would display the links for previous issues and their results, the current voting period expiry, show the current issues (heading) and your vote/voting status on the issue.clicking into the issue would display the issue heading, issue description and provide options to (+1) vote for, (-1) vote against, (0) abstain - optionally there would be a comments field limited to 1000 chars. adding comments would only be possible on voting. once you have voted on an issue you wouldn't be able to change your vote. optionally the system could show the votes of the csms (including their name) alongside the issue before you vote. this would allow pilots to examine the direction of the csm's to votes ""in-progress""."

1/22/2009,"no thanks, i can't support this."
1/22/2009,/supportedninja salvaging is a legitimate profession. if someone left a wreck floating in space it's up for grabs for whoever gets to it 1st.thanx for linking to the guide.

1/22/2009,i would prefer to keep our profession smaller... cant have everyone doing it now : >
1/22/2009,supported ... only for the fact that some douche bag from goons doesn't. which means the post should be beneficial for the real player base and not the minority power brokers.
1/22/2009,"this. the reason why the vast majority of eve players are carebears is i suppose because of the hoarder mentality. give them a reason to fight and they will. most of them see isk as something of real value (and ingame, it really is, or does one get his or her broadsword as a present for venturing into losec?) and are scared of losing it. right or wrong, i don't know, but eve's tough men continually whining about carebears kind of gets old with time, even if they do have a point.you want a fix to this? give the mission npcs much better ai, and change the missions from the mass slugfest they currently are to something that has more quality and more variation. currently, missions are totally predictable the second you find out about eve-survival and the npcs are always totally unlike real players and far more stupid. make the missions chance based on what npcs are there, make the npcs faster, cleverer (you can't tell me a computer based ai is slower to react and doesn't know all the tricks than a real player) and above, much more dangerous.this will make it much harder to run missions, having a side effect of getting those who do run missions less frightened of losec and pvping, and also, it will help make losec and 0.0 npcs more dangerous, thereby adding a bit of a thrill to ratting and chucking a bit of a spanner into fleet ops in 0.0 where npc rats are just a sourse of income.maybe i see all this wrong though. i don't know."

1/22/2009,then post the minutes.and please refrain from putting items on the agenda such as general csm operation. any feelings of impotence you have doesn't warrent a place on the agenda for discussions with ccp and only harms the perception of the csm.the current csm is doing a more effective job at communicating with the eve-population and while some of your discussions may be covered by an nda with ccp - simply reporting that provides a layer of transparency that people will apprechiate.personally i would find it interesting if there was weekly figures available that showed the percentage of the player base that used the forums. this would help show how representative the forums are of those playing.
1/22/2009,"they have, at least the short version. the long version has to go trough ccp to make sure that everything is fine.what are you on about? it was frankly a good discussion we had with xhagen and co. it was very productive and a range of different ideas and solutions were presented. if we don't solve fundamental problems in regards to communication now, which we have, there won't be a csm in the future because nobody will care anymore. i agree. that's why we had the above issue. we want to do even better!hm, that's an interesting idea."

1/23/2009,"my proposal for war declarations are as follows:1) warring should only be allowed in high sec if both parties agree to it. pay-to-grief is not be acceptable. high sec is high sec, and should not be reduced to 0 sec just because some pirate corp pays money to concord so they can kill innocents in peace.2) to compensate for this effect, concord respond times should be heavily increased and also be given a random factor to simulate a more realistic scenario. concord ships should patrol solar systems, so you never know where they are. they should still remain around stations and jumpgates in high sec as well, but maybe not all the time.( also, on a side note, i would be very grateful if concord ships assumed a more static, dignified posture when patrolling jumpgates etc., not spinning around the gates/stations randomly. especially battleships do lose a bit of their dignity behaving in this manner. better if the larger ships could assume a more majestic formation on a static position to the side of the gate or similar. interceptors and frigates may continue to orbit the jumpgate though, that still looks realistic, but they should have a much wider orbiting range, simulating patrol flight paths. )"
1/23/2009,"i know this will sound really weird but tbh i feel that the currant dec mechanics are more in favor of the agressed than the agressor as the defender can just corp hop as many times as they want to get away from war and/or just hop into the nearest npc corp. for example a corp deced a friendly corp of my alliance that was going to be joining us. some guys from another corp we knew had a load of alts they had bought of ebay and illegaly bought isk made an alt corp and made the stupid mistake of putting one of there main chars in it then deced the 3 man corp that we were friends with so the corp that was attacked joined the alliance and as soon as that happend litiraly 3 seconds after they joined the alliance officialy and we coudl shoot the agressors they either logged or jumped form systme. now a few days later they droped the dec and were pretending to be hired by someone else but we knew who they really were, now after we decced there corp they all hopped corp to another corp, then we deced that one and they all hopped to another one then we went after that one and they all either didnt log in or just went streight to npc corps, now before someone says i have just used this thread to whine about corp hopping the point im trying to make is that dec mechanics as a whole is broken pretty much evenly both ways, defenders who **** someone off can just hop to the nearest npc corp for cover till the war blows over and of course there are those who do it to freif others. so in all honesty maybe this should be looked into for both sides"

1/23/2009,"i think this idea is best explained with an example. you are in low-sec happily missioning away, and you are set upon by pirates. you are able to send out a system wide distress signal that people not in your fleet could respond to. (possibly other runners who are not in your fleet, or a corp that has claimed the system and can defend you if you have paid them a fee). it also goes that pirates could ""respond"" to this beacon as well, leading to more fights possibly occurring away from the standard gates/belts :)this could also see use in fw areas, where you may have a target pinned down solo, and you ask for anyone to come help back you up (this may be better implemented by being able to select an option where the beacon is only sent to allies or something of the sort).this simple feature could allow other players to more effectively co-operate, maintain security in a system without needing the overhead to fleet up. as far as i know, the only way to warp to someone is to fleet with them and then warp, be scanned down (far too long for when a quick response is needed), or manually type out the location you are in if you are near a celestial object.system wide distress beacons also have a lot of precendent in sci-fi shows :) this is not meant to replace fleets, but rather to do just what a distress beacon is intended for: broadcast your location when you need assistance and a fast response is required.observing the signals would require another window/overview setting, and there would be the option to block signals coming from certain people (to avoid spam).tl;dr version: at any time you can send out a signal that *anyone else* in the system could warp to. this signal can only emanate from your ships current position.edit: someone mentioned tossing a bookmark into local. that seems like the simplest method of implementation.another edit: if a bookmark can be tossed in local, it would follow that a bookmark could be tossed into any chat. e.g. into militia chat if you are in fw. normally however, tossing a bookmark into local would be the fastest way to hope that there are kind hearted people out there (or at least people who will come in and kill the other people as well as you )"
1/23/2009,"after some consideration, i have decided to support my own topic"
1/23/2009,"another precedent in sci-fi movies is that not only good guys respond to distress beacons. are you prepared for more pirates to arrive when the beacon is sent? or for traps to be set by priates using the beacon mechanism?if both answers are yes - i don't see a problem with this idea. if someone really wants to give everyone in local the ability to warp directly to them, they should be prepared for whatever consequences follow."
1/23/2009,"sorry, i like the idea, but not the exact wording."
1/23/2009,"this would be a good source of the lol, but thats what local is for.not supported."
1/23/2009,"same, if this means anyone - including more pirates could warp to you, i'll sign in support."
1/23/2009,not supported.... local is already there for use of that nature.granted its a perfectly good idea.... and a valid one logistically... balanced in the fact that the risks of calling attention to yourself is not necessarily a good thing as well.but again... it would cause more harm than good on the server as i can see it now...imagine if you will... a 1000 ship vs 1000 ship fleet fight and in the middle of all of that... a couple hundred decide to broadcast a distress signal./me shudders
1/23/2009,"while i admit to being somewhat of a carebear, i am definitely of the opinion that pirates could respond exactly the same as any other player in the system.i had previously stated this with.""it also goes that pirates could ""respond"" to this beacon as well, leading to more fights possibly occurring away from the standard gates/belts :)"""
1/23/2009,"the overhead would be similar to that of sending a message in a channel, and if you recall the live dev blog, hundreds of people were messaging simultaneously without lag."
1/23/2009,"but you can't warp to someone in local, can you?"
1/23/2009,"no, local doesn't work for this purpose.local> help help i'm being shotsomebody> where are youlocal> i'm in belt 3-2somebody warps to 3-2 70km from you.by this time you are already deadeven worse if you have to do the whole fleet invite warp to member thingy."
1/23/2009,this is exactly why i am proposing this feature. i was just checking that something analagous to it didn't already exist.
1/23/2009,you think that people are going to respond to a beacon by a unknown person in an unknown location where unknown activities are taking place? i think not. leave this mechanic in star trek shows where it belongs.
1/23/2009,i lawled at this1 pirates will come and gank u (i wouldnt gank but id come and wait for anti-pirates comin)2nd local is your friend/corp/allaince/wattever elseplus distress calls would be spammed in fleet battles to cause lag and d/c's

1/23/2009,"what do you think about this option?character progress will be faster.it will reduce time of characters standing in ""spot.""one more isk drain.overall faster ability to access and enjoy eve parts which person prefer.to elaborate this idea:your character would be able to finish training of skills instantly.for a cost.one example:engineering (rank 1) have 256000sp so (this is just a proposal) fee will be 10isk per sp. so from engineering 0 to 5 would cost your character 2560000 isk.cruisers (rank5) have 1280000sp because its rank 5 it will cost 5x more per sp so price to train it from 0 to 5 would be 50x 1280000 = 64000000 isk access to this feature could be added via agents. to use this feature will not require any standing. but with perfect standing, fee could be 10% lower.i granted myself freedom to give answers on some questions which i presume would be of interest to you.will this feature be unfair to old characters?not at all. yours old characters would have same advantage as new, and upper hand. you already saved billions, by training them in standard way.how will this affect character market?probably it will make this option redundant.and gtc market?more people would start to sell them, so your isk will start to worth a little more. at the end i do believe that this option, will return to eve those players who just get bored and quit (burned out) before they reach something that they want to do and fly. this will reduce waiting and those boring days and weeks. granting all players faster access to desired gameplay style."

1/23/2009,"not supported, fundamentally opposite to the eve approach to things."
1/23/2009,"firstly, not supported.[troll]secondly, something like this might actually work as long as it's ""balanced"". let's say you put your character into intensive training that reduces the time it takes to train an idea by a certain percentage. this costs isk and begins by talking to an agent in your starting school station. once started, your character cannot leave the station until the skill training is complete or cancelled and if cancelled, the skillpoints you gained will decay at half your normal training speed for that skill meaning it must immediately be started to train normally, which will then train at half speed.great if you plan on training straight into capitals, not so good if you plan to actually play the game.[/troll]"
1/23/2009,"this is so wrong, and the conculsions are so flawed, that its unsupportable.players leave eve for a multitude of reasons, they get bored with the mission grind, 0.0 fleet lag, have r/l issues, buying sp's will not get those back.cruiser 5 is about a 32 day skill (depending on attribs) if you cant wait that maybe you should ask is this game right for you?the basic premis of this proposal appears to be : i want an uber char without working for it. well bo-****ing-ho, if you dont want to put the time into developing your toon cancel your account, and contract your stuff to eve-uni."

1/23/2009,agree with op...30 vs 30 fights should not produce that much lag. this last summer we had 70+ vs 70+ fights and we didn't even receive half the lag we do now in theses small fleets.
1/23/2009,"well ccp would have to give a flying phuk first (apparently they don't). second, it might help if they would perhaps admit there is a problem (their logs never show an issue). after those two steps, maybe they'd get around to fixing it in about 18+ months or so (maybe).sorry, but fleet fights and fw are pretty much massive fail. there's better pewpew to be found elsewhere.ps ccp u suk!"
1/23/2009,"this really has been an issue when having fleet battles. i think that fw areas both caldari / gallente and amarr / minmatar need more power to the server side.yes there are people with bad overview settings. however there is _heavy_ lag on fleet battles.i'm hoping for more focus from ccp to the factional warfare in other aspects as well.best regards,t2"
1/23/2009,why not make the covetor into a drone boat? give it some role bonuses and bigger capacity/bandwidth. then... how about we get some larger mining drones while we're at it?
1/23/2009,/signedthe time difference between retty - coverter & hulk is too similar.the only reason people might fly the coverter instead is if they cant afford the hulk.
1/23/2009,"simple solution, make hulk require exhumers v"
1/23/2009,"um, that's a little extreme.reducing the covetor to astrogeo iv would be a lot more consistent."
1/23/2009,"not really, 95% of hulk pilots have it anyway."
1/23/2009,that's quite reasonable actually... considering what it is.hulks are the top end of exhumers..... if you need mining barge v to fly a covetor... it makes sense that you should have exhumers v to fly a hulk.solves the problem quite effectively.
1/23/2009,lol ... i can quite see the little stone rolling ...
1/23/2009,totally in support of this
1/23/2009,"/signedperhaps the duel arena can have some settings that must be agreed to by both parties before you can fire upon eachother, similar to 2 parties agreeing to a trade in station. for example: arena radius, time limit, propulsion limit*, maybe even a bet. when 2 players agree to a duel, a beacon of some sort is dropped. players must stay within a certain radius or they automatically lose. you could have stats for wins, losses, draws, and cowardly warp-outs. now you have a statistic box that will show up in your character info that can give players bragging rights, and a heads up on duelers that hide their tail between their legs. similar to the duel's setup, a draw can be agreed by both if the duelers are unable to break eachothers tanks, and decide to end it before the time is up. *(my idea for the propulsion limit is intended to prevent one character from orbiting in circles just inside the arena limits with their mwd to exhaust the time limit and gain an automatic draw when they should have lost. this is ofcourse situational, and up to the players to decide if they want to use such a limit before the duel begins) the only setting that would be required is some sort of arena radius, and a time limit. any other settings would be optional. i think that with a system like this, no one can say this is a carebear duel. you decide you wanna battle, here are the rules, you ""shake hands"", and start fighting eachother? no need for wardecs, no need to travel any distance. any time, anywhere, lets fight now!!!! this idea doesn't seem cowardly and cute; rather quite honorable. the only way to get a win is to destroy the other ship, or if the other player dips out. the only problem i see with this type of system is that dueling in low sec may allow players to boost their stats by having their friend's attack the other player and boost their personal statistics. there could be a few solutions to this: restrict duels to empire space, which sadly would exclude some players. or...nullify low sec duels where other players interfere.or...have two stat banks for duels in high and low sec.or!!!!, it could just be the risk you take if you agree to duel in low sec, or if you are at war and dueling in empire. thanks for reading.... if you say ""tldr"" then you should leave this part of the forums"
1/23/2009,this.
1/23/2009,"what is it anyway with older players and the constant sneering at carebears? carebears and losec pirates and everyone else in eve all have one thing in common: they spend huge amounts of time either perfecting skills (actual combat skills) or earning isk or whatever. carebears are afraid, and rightly so, that if they venture down into losec or 0.0, it will be a painful and expensive process. not everyone but many below 0.4 love to kill noobs, because it boosts their egos. but in the main, the fact is that most in losec have been at the game far longer than those in hisec, i.e carebears. all the ""wow is that way, zomg eve is becoming wow"" stuff is really getting old. i think if losec players gave hisec noobs a good reason (and no, camping the first gate they come through amazingly doesn't count as a reason) to go into losec, such as invitations to fly and train with them and learn the ropes, maybe more would go.as every clown here constantly states, eve is a harsh place. it's like the real world in that respect. and just like in the real world, people who, even if is virtual, work hard to earn their isk, and they're scared of losing and their implants bla bla bla. treat thecarebears with more respect and less teenage epeen ****erage and i'm pretty sure you'll get more of them in <0.4."
1/23/2009,"i bet the pleas of those opposed to duelling in eve have...whatever it is, i expect it's another dumbing-down move for the game that looks good on paper and turns out to be terrible. think faction warfare but... no, just think fw."
1/23/2009,"i disagree!! regardless of how serious one of the duelers may be, this is still a game! not a fencing match, nor a martial arts competition, nor a fight to the death. right now its more similar to a thumb war. you shouldn't have shame because the person on the other side was dishonorable and used their index finger to get your thumb down. but maybe the next time that person proposes a thumb war, you may offer to use katanas and have a true duel. if a specific way to duel was implemented, the dishonorable may be discouraged to partake. in other words, players who truly want to duel can do so effectively with a system that promotes honorable gameplay.yes, combat is allowable, but not anywhere, anytime. and sure you could declare war, but then you have the whole corp or alliance on you for a week. we are talking about a one time deal, lets fight now, and its over. i believe the purpose of this idea is to have a function to duel in high sec without having to flip each others cans. i'm not saying it doesn't work, but in order to duel here, players are using game mechanics designed for something else. its great that people have used this method to fulfill their desire to duel, but it still leaves plenty of space for people to cheat and/or waste your time. why not create a mechanic for a purpose people obviously would like to see? and why not have a dueling system where the cowardly and dishonorable opponent can be discouraged to play, or tared and feathered for running away? this is not a nerf of any sort, and doesn't impose on any other form of gameplay already available. this mechanic doesn't affect anyone not dueling, so why are people so against it? i think the majority of people against it just don't care to use it."
1/23/2009,read captainspock's posts he is right on!hey vaal krit lets go play wow now
1/23/2009,"i am against anything which limits the consequences of bad decisions in eve. consequences are what seperates eve from other mmos (where dying simply means respawning somewhere, and perhaps a little embarassment). say a person is in a bar, and some dude starts tryinig to pick a fight with them. the bully has 4 buddies back at his bar table. the person wants to kick the hell out of the bully. a very serious consideration in this situation needs to be ""will his friends stay out of it when i start pounding on him"". even if the bully agrees to ""take it out side"" (agreed to a duel) can we be sure his buddies will not interfere. no, we can't. it's not fair. it's life. i do not want more factors in the game that limit consequences of our decisions. to continue the analogy: find a way to get out of the bar, or deal with the fact you might be fighting five dudes."
1/23/2009,"the beauty of eve is that the only honour in the game is what you bring to it. putting mechanics in place that can be an obstacle to dishonour would be a horrible mistake in my opinion.following the analogy of a thumb war, the index finger example is a dreadful one. what would be more apt would be that you start thumb wrestling, and one of your friends turns up with a sledgehammer, crushing your hand. this to me is the way eve should be, and the ideas in this thread distastefully try to take the game away from this. i would support changing the game to allow combat against anyone, anywhere, anytime as long as it was as unregulated as zerosec combat currently is. anything else would be fluff, and a waste of man hours to develop. one time fight? flip those cans.c&p forum is for your tarring and there's nothing wrong with using the can flip mechanic. if a ""dueling system"" consisted of being able to choose to flag yourself to someone in highsec and nothing more, i could understand that... but it's not. what we'd see is a system of honour points and e-peen waving and there's more than enough of that at present.this mechanic could and would affect people witnessing a duel, as currently if i see people dueling in highsec i may well decide to attack one of them myself and take the concordokken just to **** them off.that, my friend, is the essence of eve-online and all that makes it great"
1/23/2009,"if you want to engage in unregulated pvp action, you have the freedom to fly out to low sec and do whatever you want. that is the beauty of eve. the purpose of this proposed game mechanic would be to strictly have a 1 on 1 duel with someone. flipping cans allow a whole corporation to engage in combat. people who actually want to duel are discouraged to engage in these battles purely because its not worth risking your ship to some dishonorable jack@ss who has his buddies waiting to warp in and gang bang you. after this happens a couple times to someone, one will probably loose interest in engaging in this type of battle. i would have no problem risking a 200mil isk battleship if i was sure that no one else would interfere. if there was a 1 on 1 dueling system we would see alot more pvp, and in turn, stimulate the market. i would be 100% satisfied with a simple flag that allows combat without additional regulation. my only intention for proposing an arena and some sort of regulation would be to support a point system if there was one.no, it wouldn't affect any witnesses... this mechanic won't prevent you from being a moron and loosing your little ship when concord pimp smacks you. the 2 players can flag eachother as ok to fire, while you can throw away as many frigates as you wish in attempt to p!ss people off. you wont be tipping the scales of any good battle when your ship gets popped in 20 seconds. i will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume are smart enough to not waste an expensive ship in such a manner. it seems to me that you are one of those people who will can flip for a duel, and then call in a swarm of corp members to bombard them. this is why you don't want them to create this mechanic, because it would be stealing your fun. go back to a noob system and drop more cans that say ""your cargo container"". and, no, that is not the essence of eve-online. that is the essence of a person who relies on p!ssing people off to enjoy the game because they have become bored with it."
1/23/2009,no it wouldn't.this is a streamlined mechanic that prevents interference... but that doesn't stop some idiot from jumping in and getting concorded because he wanted to do said thing.this just makes sure any interference... including repping.... or corp flagging... would be concorded for interference.not that it would stop you.... you get anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds.: o )
1/23/2009,"that, ladies and gentlemen, is what we call a straw man."
1/23/2009,"so i'm at this bar, and this bully starts picking on me. if i decide to fight him and put my fists up, i run the risk of his brute friends stepping in and sucker punching me. i don't disagree with this statement at all. but the scenario we are asking for is a place to spar with a person in an honorable way. we are playing a game, not dealing with drunken bro-dudes!!!how about this scenario? you are at the gym, and you come across someone you want to spar with. you:""wanna go for a boxing match?""them:""sure."" next thing you know, two people jump in the ring and start beating the living daylights out of each other. one person will win, or both people will become exhausted and call it off. either way, both players get to say, ""good match"" regardless of who won. the difference here is that you have both agreed to a fight for fun, and it is obvious that no one else is gonna jump in to support one of the fighters. this isn't a bully scenario!!! if some idiot brings brings a barbell and wails on one of the contenders, you better believe the gym staff is gonna be calling the police. that is life.the game already allows us to ""walk down the street and start a fight with a stranger."" we are asking for an arena so we can battle for sport. if there was a point system attatched to it like i proposed above, you could keep track of who won, who lost, who had a draw, and who ran out of the ring like a little sissy. sport."
1/23/2009,"yeah, but aren't you the same guy who argued earlier that this wasn't a ""fencing match or martial arts match"".. now you're comparing it to a almost exactly that. my point is that eve is and should remain a lot closer to the bar parking lot than the health club."
1/23/2009,"an arena is a good idea, but that is not what the op wants. any arena would have to incur ship loss, it just has to. otherwise it is a huge immersion breaker. have you ever seen ""duels"" in other mmos? it completely breaks any immersion you may have as it is two people just messing around, instead of dying you kneel down and a healer who watches nearby heals people and they are instantly ready to go again. it is incredibly lame to watch and pointless as no one actually dies. eve is about meaningful losses and combat, ""dueling"" without ship loss is out of place in eve.the whole point of eve is that you are given the choice to be in a bad corp that breaks dueling agreements or be in an honorable corp that honors 1v1s. with the current system you have the choice, with your system, you have no choice. because you cannot dishonor a duel, it makes it have *zero honor* (oh god, e-honor). honor is only accrued if you do something when the temptation to do evil or nothing is there.i don't see why we cannot have a few arenas around the galaxy for duels and tournaments, but a flat out acceptance of the extremely lame wow ""dueling"" mechanic is wholly against what makes eve different from wow and wow-clones."
1/23/2009,no. the camp was actually quite split on this very thing.
1/23/2009,"o rly? let me ask you this, the situation above, you have a billion or so in bounties from a nice life of crime, and suddenly you get caught in a bubblecamp or get podded due to not getting your pod out due to lag or to a discocamp. congrats, you are back to 0 skillpoints. what would you do? quit? i hella would. loosing skillpoints is not the solution. the rest of the idea looks half okay, except for the ""remove concord"" idea. that sucks.reduce the amount of high sec? yes, but not make everything lawless. the nobs would get permaganked and quit within hours."
1/23/2009,"thank you for your time.i would simply ask you to re-read my proposal, as your premise, is, i believe, highly unlikely, based on the proposal i submitted.you could not have a billion isk bounty, on your head, unless you actually had a billion skill points.here is how i see this play out.players would form corps of bounty hunters, security forces or simply bodyguards.larger corps would create their own divisions, probably, but smaller corps would be able to hire such independent corps to protect their industrial assets, miners and even mission runners.pirates would have the opportunity to gank everyone, sure, but they would also be subject to actual consequences for doing so in empire space. a pirate, or group of pirates, for that matter, would have to decide if ganking a newb was actually worth the very real possibility of losing a significant amount of training time. as a matter of fact, smart pirates will probably be very selective about just exactly who and what they will choose to engage, considering the fact that once flagged, the roaming bands of bounty hunters and other players can take a free shot, until such time as the pirate can remove the bounty, by ratting or podding other criminals, themselves.now, if you are a pirate and are both elite enough and, dare i add, stupid enough to accrue a bounty which actually equals your entire pool of skill points, that would simply be your own fault, kinda like flying on ap and afk through lo-sec carrying a bunch of titan bpo's."
1/23/2009,"fair enough, i missed that point. but my point still stands = skill point loss for doing what you want is not beneficial to the game. a pirate that regurlarly pirates would end up with a huge bounty. it's not uncommon today with pirates with billions of a bounty. if you could only get up to your skill point max, not only would it tell people exactly how many skill points you have, but it would also be a ""meh"" reward for the one that manages to pod him.i still do not like it."
1/23/2009,"fair enough, but consider the following points, if you would:1. a ""smart"" pirate would likely not allow their bounty to get too large.2. the system allows for the pirate to have a chance of reducing, or eliminating the current bounty.3. with the elimination of concord, hi-sec pirating would allow for significant profit potential.4. bounty hunting now becomes a valid profession with many potential clients, to boot.5. newb corp hugging becomes significantly less desirable as players, (mission runners, industrialists, traders, etc.), will seek viable corps that can provide actual security.6. mindless ganking and griefing, simply for the lulz, though possible, would actually be punishable, by other players.7. lo-sec benefits from immediate viability, versus hi-sec. in fact, only the real difference would be that in lo-sec there would be no significant faction navy presence.8. macro miners and other non-desirables could now be properly terrorized. ;)the list goes on, but you get the idea.thank you, for your consideration."
1/23/2009,"sorry, i missed the part about the ""meh"" reward.agreed.perhaps we could add a small modifier to the payout, but i would rather that the majority of income for bounty hunters and security type personnel would come from fees payed by the players they are working for."
1/23/2009,"i can agree with the idea behind your suggestion, but the actual game mechanics would be idiotic. skill loss is a bit too harsh for a penalty, so if anyone ever pirates after this change they probably spend most of their time ratting to keep their bounty low."
1/23/2009,"indeed, they probably would.harsh? don't do the crime, if you cant do the time....yea...................don't do it!............................maybe there would be whines about bounty hunters camping hi-sec gates, waiting for the unwary, yet flashy flashy, pirate. be fun to see, i suppose..."
1/23/2009,"no, you don't get it. 100k sp lost for a single shuttle kill is way, way, way too harsh of a penalty. my adequate reward for risking my entire character is you are losing a whole months worth of skill training for one ship? how is that balanced? not even darkfall is having sp loss afaik, and it is because people will just quit the game en mass. players don't want sp loss, and it has nothing to do with them not being hardcore enough, losing 250k sp in eve can mean you cannot compete effectively for 3 months. who wants to play a game that ruins your character for 3 months?god forbid the server or i lag for a few seconds and i get podded, now my character is almost worthless. that is pretty much how podding in high sec works. you lag on ship destruction and an inty grabs you and you die. having your character's life hinge on lag is terrible.you are making it so i have to risk my entire character just to kill one enemy ship. risk vs reward is completely out of whack in your idea. i risk my ship to kill an enemy ship. if i am risking my sp, then how about a way for me to kill your sp? hell if i am risking my sp, how about i gain sp when i make a kill in high sec? that would be better balancing of risk vs reward. if every ship in high sec carried 5b of loot then ok, great rewards for great risk, but less isk than what you'd get while ratting (suicide ganking doesn't make people super rich contrary to popular belief) for risking possibly your entire character's sp? riiiiight.a mechanic like this is fine, but the sp loss is way, way too much. i like how you think this would be hardcore while it really just makes the game more carebearish as it completely favors carebears since they don't have to risk any sp at all and get the insane rewards of high sec.change sp loss part and we have a good idea that i would support."
1/23/2009,"there have been a number of posts on the forum that have crossed my attention and i am sure many many that i have not. which are blatently posted for no other purpose that to bring nationalism or racism into the game.for example: linkimo this is completely unnecesary, in the world of eve everybody is created equal, whatever the race / skin-colour / religion / nationality of the pilot behind the screen is, it is completely irrelevant to the game.i would like to ask the csm to ask ccp to enforce more severe reprocussions on the anyone involved in this. it is not only offensive to those it is aimed at, but also to others reading the forums.and just for the record, i am white, english and aethist, so none of these threads that i have seen have been directed at me."
1/23/2009,"i'm just as offended by overactive censorship as i am by stupidity and bigotry. there's a grey area here. i suppose i support the intent behind the thread, i just urge the person judging the level of offensiveness of a thread to use a lot of good discretion and judgement. for the record i really enjoy the fact that the galaxy we play in is so diverse that the language spoken in local and the times people are awake change by the region (especially in deep 0.0). awesome and realistic."

1/23/2009,fw fights of 30 on 30 are having terrible lag.when we whine about it we get the typical response 'fix you client' settings as if we have not all done so already.i think that the low-sec servers are plain underpowered/overloaded but maybe it is a network issue. (although eve-voice seems fine through all of the lag)please help us understand why we do not get anywhere near this mythical 0.0 fleet fight performance?i can understand that ccp would like to hide this information but scm represent us and demand some openness.
1/23/2009,not supported. ccp is a private company with no obligation to share internal server logs.
1/23/2009,not supported... breech of privacy on all fronts and accounts.deal with it or find something else to resolve it.
1/23/2009,"one instance of the discussion is here, but i couldn't support it in that form. my explanation went on a while so i've started a new thread to explore that.i couldn't support the other option, not because there's no lag, but because having 4 systems wouldn't work for those in the amarr/minmatar fw zones - sure we have hot systems in terms of kills, but fleet fights can happen in any one of 20 systems on any given day. these don't have the blobtastic flavour of the caldari/gallente areas but get more than 30 people fighting each other and lag really starts to show. thankfully the lag bombs have mostly gone our way, but that doesn't change the fact that we're having issues at only 15 vs 15.i suspect that there are 2 issues here - the first is that ccp seem to have woefully underestimated the resources needed for the fw areas. indeed if the rumours i've heard are true then this would be the biggest understatement since mrs chamberlain turned to her husband and said ""you know neville, i think that that mr h-i-t-l-e-r (lol for odd censorship of that word) might not be a very nice man"". certainly this new lag-fest is a recent addition to our days without a commesurate change in how we fly or fight to account for it, and as such should be investigated.the second issue is one of ccp being hoisted by their pr petard. for months now they have been trumpeting about their new stacklessio and suchlike - dazzling those of us without protection from jedi graph mind tricks with visions of a lagless client, and yes the data are very compelling, and we're all suitably impressed by the jaw-dropping performance of jita, but it's made us all much more aware of when lag happens, which is a shame, but there's not a lot to be done about it. until, and maybe even when eve starts running on quantum servers there will be lag. what we as players have to do is recognise which lag is unavoidable and which is not (see point 1 above)the solution? what we need from ccp is really the following:1) a full description of the resources assigned already to the fw war and how things like 0.0 load may affect this so that we have an idea of where we're starting from.2) a description of what realistically can be done to improve resources in all 8 fw regions and an acknowledgement that what works for the caldari / gallente may not work for the amarr / minmatardiscuss awayedit for link fixing"
1/23/2009,"good lord! a sensible post, by jingo!yes this would be rather nice. i also agree that those of us in the amarr/minmatar side of fw don't spend all day fighting in 2-4 systems and thus never need resources anywhere else in the bleaks/devoid regions.edit: by the way your link doesn't appear to work."
1/23/2009,i support this.
1/23/2009,"/signedi like the idea, but i would like to see it also signature based."
1/23/2009,not bad. supported.
1/23/2009,"heh, good idea. but i'd probably make .4 200% instead of 150%. other than that your idea is pretty damn sound. and could even spread gatecamps into more random systems instead of the same 'ol high sec-to-lo sec choke points."
1/23/2009,but that is because with the current mechanics unless you tackle someone at a belt or have lots of webs with you there is no way you have the time to discuss ransom. since there is no way to reliable make money from ransom nobody invests in getting a reputation for respecting ransom. (with some small exceptions)i think it would be nice to take control of a gate in low-sec and make money based on people passing through. right now you only make money when you surprise someone on a jump in from the other side. it would also be cool if you could charge a gate usage fee similar to a station docking fee if you are in control of a gate that way.

1/23/2009,"i will give credit to the orca and weapon grouping...but in reality these werent major game changes, yes they brought cool new things, yes the orca is cool and all but its not a game play change and or huge impact to the game as the indies already had the rorqual which is better btw. weapon grouping is nice and pretty handy and saves alot of keyboards being smashed, now only f1 key is abused but still, in the end no major game changes had been prevented by the csm as of date. ie: nano nerf..(yes i am butt-hurt). had the nano-nerf been prevented, i would have faith in the program. but till then the orca / weapon grouping is just fluff."
1/23/2009,the nano nerf was inevitable. the csm could not change that.
1/24/2009,you sir are probably the only supporter who doesn't want to change his/her name. thank you for your support.
1/24/2009,"havent read it all through..but i would like this option, or at least some cool callsign feature..changing callsign should take maybe 24 hours?just my 2 isk"
1/24/2009,i fully support any proposal that would update the currently awfull looking player owned station graphics and functionality.
1/24/2009,"if you read short version of meeting minutes, you can see this issue was raised. we are all waiting inpatiently full meeting minutes from ccp. anyway this is something i look really forward to discuss and brainstorm."
1/24/2009,"not supported. because of pos discrimination (low/0.0 vs. high sec) when some structures and moon mining become implemented in high sec, i will reconsider this."
1/24/2009,up
1/24/2009,does anyone here actually know anything about explosives? of course you don't! just look at the amount of supports here.explosives produce an amount of explosive force measured in figures like this.. m/s (metres per second) and m3 of total explosive potential. when a bomb explodes in a confined space its effect is amplified by the confined space eg: expanding gasses rushing down hallway. secondarily: explosions in atmosphere have a concussive effect that is totally missing from an explosion in vacuum.stealth bombers essentially perform the role of payload delivery beyond the range of their support fleet.successful deployment of bombers requires the cunning removal of interceptors. such as the sacrifice of a squadron of us torpedo bombers to japanese zeros so that a second bomber force could sink the 4 japanese carriers present at the battle of midway. eve only argument: what other ships can cause damage after they are destroyed?
1/24/2009,"so, why not to give all missile-based weapons (rockets, missiles, torpedoes, bombs) an ability to not disappear after its owner warped out or died or even used cloaking device? it will be a good boost for sbs, maybe the best possible."
1/24/2009,i slowly have the feeling ccp is tolerating them because it brings them money.....
1/24/2009,"i dont support this. mainly because i dont like theese ""how to spot a macro miner"" instructions. if i decide to orbit ice asteroids all day, rejecting convo's and ignoring local, then i should be able to do that and not owe anyone an explanation for it.also i dont get your inital problem. you are angry because you dont get individual personal replys from the gm's you send your petitions to ? do you think it would help the banning of macro miners if a gm had to sit down 5 minutes to create a personal reply to each petition ?wether you got a personal reply or not, ccp will bann the offending party if they have suitable evidence of them using macros. if they cant find suitable evidence, than you shouldn't arrogate that you could. it may not have come to your mind yet, but it is entirely possible, that someone you petitioned was not banned for the reason that they were simple not guilty and that your assumptions on them were wrong."
1/24/2009,"funny, and i do like the idea of being able to throw a bookmark into local, but not worth the effort of implementing."
1/24/2009,"interesting idea, only if pirates could make use of it. either by being able to warp to the beacon, or having the ability to use it setup a trap."
1/24/2009,"i'm completely and totally in agreement with this idea, but only if everyone in system can warp to it."
1/24/2009,supported.
1/24/2009,"not supported. hic are here with reason, learn to use them."
1/24/2009,bringing more people shouldn't be the answer for everything.supporting op.
1/24/2009,"you do know they have to lock their opponent, just like any other ship, outside of 0.0 space?"
1/24/2009,would very much like to be able to lock stuff before it runs away
1/24/2009,/signeda cruiser should be able to catch a cruiser etc.
1/24/2009,i agree with this.
1/24/2009,"i support this topic as one that needs ccp input.there are things that need considering.scout frigates (executioner, atron, etc. ), tech1 fitted to align and accelerate quickly, piloted by someone with moderate navigation skills, need to be able to escape almost all of the time, to fulfil their scouting role. otherwise, it promotes alt accounts rather than co-operation with other players, especially newer players."
1/24/2009,"this has killed off all but remote sensor boosting gate camps for low sec piracy :( gone are the days of roaming hac/recon gangs, now unless you have an rsb hic in gang your not going to catch anything :("
1/24/2009,"yeah, too much reliance on numbers is not really good"
1/24/2009,/signed
1/24/2009,has my full support
1/24/2009,bad idea. even if not your prices are ridiculously cheap.
1/24/2009,"rubbish idea, in fact this one beats out all the other terrible ideas.the above posters sum up why its a terrible idea.'nuff said.no..."
1/24/2009,no.this would destroy eve.
1/24/2009,i wonder what the op was smoking when he came up with this thread...
1/24/2009,"considering that it costs millions for a meager +3 implant to maybe shave off a few hours of training, your math is way off!!seriously, no.......... eve is about patience, frustration, and maybe even a reward at the end for it. if you can't deal with that, find a new game/unsupported"
1/24/2009,"now, now. even in wow you still have to play the game to get your skills up. i'd be hard pressed to think of a game not coded in flash that uses the mechanic he proposes."
1/24/2009,i so dont support this
1/24/2009,not support as gtc buyers that start within a few days can reach high end sp that took most people years to get to
1/24/2009,would you elaborate? oh mighty doomsayer!
1/24/2009,no.
1/24/2009,"because your proposal would let anyone who cared to buy a 60-day gtc card have 65m sp, you maniac."
1/24/2009,not supported. the idea is in fndamental conflict with the eve ethos.
1/24/2009,qfvbt
1/24/2009,lol no.
1/24/2009,rotflmao!!!!herschel i really needed that! your the man of the day!nice one!well said!
1/24/2009,"now that my ego has been sufficiently stroked for today (), can we stop bumping this?"
1/24/2009,no
1/24/2009,"i personally think it is bad game design that mission types are so randomly handed out, in such a way that it frequently happens that people are locked out of the game for hours or even days because they repeatedly get a streak of missions they cannot or do not want to complete.examples of situations:* getting ice/gas cloud missions when not having the required skills/equipment* getting a mining mission in general, or that takes two hours to complete 1.5 hours before downtime* getting combat missions when asking for courier/mining missions* getting vs. faction missionsi just switched agents and got hit by an extremely bad streak of vs.-missions from a l3 ministry of war agent: my sweet privateer, a million little pieces, and another my sweet privateer. i went to a soe agent next door and promptly got portal to war, and intercept the saboteurs (vs amarr), i want to play eve and thus accepted the saboteur thing, and my amarr standing went from 8.03 to 7.60 for destroying an amarr cruiser or two (all kills within a 15 minute window, standing hit -2.4!). anyway after doing a few more missions i'm now stuck on 'missing reporters' (vs caldari). over the past 48 hours i spent over 24 waiting for rejection timers to run out.it is unacceptable and bad game design that people are being locked out of the game waiting for 4-hour timers to expire. with the introduction of the new missions with empyrean age, things have only become worse as 'my sweet privateer' and 'a million little pieces' etc are now being extremely common missions to get.normally i'd say, stick to courier missions, but unfortunately not all corps/factions have courrier agents (soe does not have any l3/l4 that are not in/next to lowsec).it's simply unacceptable that people paying subscription fees are basically being told they can't play now and should come back in 4 hours, repeatedly.possible fixes (feel free to discuss):* less vs. missions if your standing with the opposing faction is higher* charisma-based skills that reduce standing hits from kills* overall reduction in standing hits from kills* charisma-based skills to reduce negative derrived standing hits* reduction of certain mission types if the player has a history of turning them down* reduce 4-hour timer to something more reasonable, like 30 minutes* opt-out of certain mission types, significantly reducing chances to get one (at the cost of also decreasing overall payout for all other missions?)* total overhaul of the way missions are granted (please discuss)"
1/24/2009,"nobody tells you that you can't play. you can just take the penalty of being picky about what you want to do or you can go and do something else. there's plenty of things to do in eve. so i'm not supporting this at all. it's a problem with the player, not the mechanics solely."
1/24/2009,honestly i really don't see a major overhaul on mission running being necessary.a slight adjustment on the percentages of getting various missions would help... but my only major complaint is its prue and total torture to raise up your empire standing as opposed to faction standing.honestly if i kill an amarrian ship... they get mad at me easily enough... but minmatar should be happier just as much.the effect it has on your standings should cancel out each other... much like an accountants ledger... credits and debits.seems to be quite heavily favoring the easily ****ed off type system but very hard to please.not to be confused with concord... that's understandable.... but for cryin out loud... its such a pain.perhaps if your concord sec rating should translate to an easier standings increase as it goes up over time?obviously pirates and those who grief aren't likely to give a damn about mission running so it kinda makes sense.
1/24/2009,"the gas harvesting is the only one where there's an issue, as the skills required are specific.for example, in lvl1 missions, there's the occasional hacking or archaeology mission, and in all of the ones that my friends and i have encountered, the agent gives you a ""civilian codebreaker"" or ""civilian analyser"" which does not require the archaeology or hacking skills, and is sufficient to do the mission.is a ""civilian gas harvester"" that requires no skills too much to ask for the gas missions?same for a ""civilian ice harvester"", which is slower and worse than an ice harvester, but can be fitted to other ships than barges, and requires no skills.the rest of your issues, i do not see as a problem. those are merely missions you do not want to do. gas/ice harvesting missions are ones which you are not able to do."
1/24/2009,like always your posts are filled with complete bs. the game is more than a single agent.
1/24/2009,"this used to be the case (standings going up while others went down), but this was removed because it was exploitable (people failing missions on purpose to boost the opposing faction standing).civ gas cloud harvester is an idea, but even with 3 normal gas cloud harvesters the higher level ones still take 1-2 hours of sitting idle to complete.getting empire standing quicker for higher concord standing makes sense, but is a bit unrelated. the current issue is having to wait so long because there are many missions that have to be turned down, which got a lot worse thanks to the new faction missions from empyrean age.indeed, that's why i now have a mission log full of missions waiting in line to be turned down."
1/24/2009,"you know, you could be out running quests right now if you go back to wow. (heh - who would have thought that it would be ankh that i really got to say that to with such feeling, eh? no really, that was fun. was it good for you?)"
1/24/2009,if your not driving the car then who is? (and why are you in the back seat?)
1/24/2009,"there is a problem in the mechanism too:- a caldari mission runner was (and i think is still) capable of switching between several high quality level 4 agents in the motsu area, so lessening the penalty for his refusals;- a player running for soe don't have that possibility;- a player running for the amarr gallente or minmatar factions generally don't have that possibility as they have less level 4 kill missions agents scattered over a wider area (eve agents say 87 amarr, 61 gallente and 61 minmatar against 118 caldari);- for some weird reason the best area to run for quafe is domain, where you can find 3 high quality non-combat level 4 agents in a area of less than 6 jumps total. the original agents distribution was done randomly, but that created some weird distribution that still affect mission running players today. the high number of caldari kill agents and the fact that they are mostly packed in a relatively small area (together with some ship really well suited for that) had generated the huge number of caldari characters and the ""caldari are only good for pve"" concept. i don't subscribe most of the suggestion done by ankhesentapemkah but some reflecting about the problem should be made. a new player could easily destroy his standing with one of the two empire sides in the first few months of playing before even realizing what he want to do and what he is doing to his staning."
1/24/2009,"the missions with the civilian codebreaker, analyzer and salvager are starting missions done to give new players an idea of what those modules do. each string of missions can be done only once for character, this make them very different from normal missions."
1/24/2009,"personally i would like some free choice of missions also..i think it should be more balanced though..maybe the rewards should reflect the missions picked up in stead.. so those not being worked became more valuable and gave higher rewards and those picked to often lost value when overworked...if atleast the type of mission could be selected somehow..i do see there might be a balance shift issue.. and mission ""mining""...but its better to give a good gaming experience and then find the balance solution afterwards imho.."
1/24/2009,"the 10-part tutorials? yes, i know of those.i'm not referring to those ones though.there are some lvl1 missions that also give out the civilian codebreaker or analyser.""vitoc vector"" is one of them, for minmitar. uses the civilian codebreaker."
1/24/2009,"the standings issue is one that is of interest to me, however i can see the other problems as well.i don't mind working to keep all my empire standings high, but i hate having to just twiddle my thumbs and wait. the whole npc mechanic completely barring you from 50% of high sec is ridiculous, as it can lock you out of a lot of possibilities in the future with player run corps.edit: i don't mind losing access to agents, but i do mind permanently losing access to high sec space."
1/24/2009,"yes please, there are some many times i wished this feature existed every time i misclick and repackage the containers hold my bpcs and bpos."
1/24/2009,"use audit containers as i started to do after the second incident of that kind.""this container has an entry less than a month old so can't be repackaged"" will avoid a lot of misclick incidents.for the op, it has been explained a lot of times why, with the current database, it is not possible. the explanation is even in the sticky in the f&i forum already linked.proposing it again and again will get nothing."
1/24/2009,"i wonder if it would be possible to add a temporary distinguishing mark to just those bps that have been looked at during the current session? wouldn't need to persist even across a docking/undocking, but it would still make it much easier to keep track of which print you want to do something with."
1/24/2009,lies! to change color you need just to change few numbers. in reality it can be done in less then 5 minutes.
1/24/2009,"i can already max out an entire station easily, any increase and i can tie up a whole solar system myself......i support an increase, but you need to find a way to stop people like me from being able to just soak up all the npc slots alone. possibly make it affect only player owned slots, or just increase build speed instead.also, already only a tiny fraction of the player base is needed to build for everyone, increasing what we can do is likely to just drive down prices and actually reduce rather than increase our profit, so the end result is probably that it is counter-productive."
1/24/2009,no because it will nerf newbies.
1/24/2009,make them require advanced manufacture/lab ops level 5... this will make true industrialists >> part timers put-in-oven-and-forget-and-sell-at-lower-than-production-cost-cause-did-not-do-my-work-while-i-was-pvping...anything to crush those wannabe-part-timers is fine by me...becasue t2-fitted bs pilot >>>>> t1-fitted bs pilotbut atm true industrialist =? part-timers (becasue it takes only 1 month to almost max industry out and be as competitive...)so to those who think newbs goign to get overwhelmed by true industrialists... how about when newbs get pawned by t2-fitted pvpers... unfair??? and you think its fair a 1 month old newb can compete with true industrialists???

1/24/2009,i support this one.
1/24/2009,"not supported. i do think that local should be removed, or at least allowed players that can`t be seen in local."
1/24/2009,the lag get rediculously high even with 30 ppl in fw. needs a boost!
1/24/2009,"supported. actually, you could just put the whole of black rise/ the tama-oms pipes on a super-node, there is usually only one big fight going on after all...but yes, the amount of lag we've seen with very modest player amounts is ridiculous. 30v30 is already totally unplayable to all involved, and yes i take off brackets etc."
1/24/2009,"100% supported, please end the lagfest that is fw."
1/24/2009,"/signedmaybe we should all ask for node reinforcement, every day, just to be sure ? like a 'rolling' node reinforcement.hedge our bets in case anything relatively large happens the following day."
1/24/2009,"sat the other day in oms with 60 in local. it was really ok, no stutter, no lag at all. so i could not believe my eyes when the militia-chat suddenly came alive about the ""horrendous"" lag in oms and calls for reinforced nodes. being there for most of the night and not experiencing any lag at all, i recommended to turn som effects off and promtly got told to stfu.now i run premium on an antique rig, so i strongly suspect that reinforcing a node will not help 90% of those who complain about lag. but hey, i know it's easier to ask someone else to fix your problems."
1/24/2009,were you in combat or sat in station ? if you were not even on the combat grid then i wouldn't expect you to notice much of a problem.i don't have an antique rig and have all effects off and i still suffer the occasional de-sync. module lag i can cope with to some degree as you know there is just a delay in activating but full de-syncs make me cry.
1/24/2009,"i was on the different gates most of the time in my example with much skirmishes and two full blown conflicts where the majority of the 60 in local started to shoot each other. it was after that when most of the complaining began in militia-chat. fyi when real lag hits the server, it is not only the grid that is affected, but all systems on the same blade, it becomes even impossible to move between them. i have never seen *that* in fw."
1/24/2009,"way back when the servers where laggy and things were very different, ccp decided to limit market orders.this was in theory a sound idea, to create a specific type of player. it did however end up creating a lot of our sufferings today.i am not trying to troll or turn the world upside down. so bear with me..as a result of many players strategies and short term thinking, the concept passive assets is not very used. this in turn is why establishing a basis for corp and player netvalues isnt at work much..without thinking in passive assets all over the board its hard to work a market with a limit of orders.space is to big for the number of active market trading people.. unless this sees some kind of change we will never get a more flowing and high paced game..what i am basically saying is that economy in eve is pseudo static because market orders limit working hug passive assets. this in case also makes the increments (0.01 bids) an issue.. back when we had unlimited orders this was more rare because you could basically surround such bids with stacks of increasing or decreasing orders.. just like in rl reflecting your supply and demand.. so even though this is a sort of borring topic to most pilots i really think it should be brought up again."
1/24/2009,i'm sorry but i was under the impression the current limit for orders was quite... huge.this your proposal doesn't sit right.can i get a confirmation on the maximum limit of orders please?
1/24/2009,"three hundred and five (305) at maximum skills.and if that's not enough for you, you've got way too much free time on your hands."
1/24/2009,if 305 orders (plus or minus) isn't enough for you.. i'd say your not exactly the honest type.support denied.doors that way
1/24/2009,"if you read the actual post..then you might understand the point and not jump to conclusions about me abusing the system or having to much time..the problem is the gaps between orders need to be removed in order to make prices more dynamic, and in order to make passive assets investing an option...if these parts didnt make sense then you should ask about their meaning before asuming i am manipulating anything..passive assets are the piles you havent been able to work yet. those ordered at long ranges and that need shipping, or parts you havent been able to get buyers for.. it could also simply be tradegoods you get at good prices to long standing orders..these things are using the system, it got nothing to do with abuse. in order to work on that type of economic cycle you really need more orders..notice the many pirates talking about trash loot.. this might not be trash on long investment, but on short there is no market for it..pre nerf i had more than 3000 active orders.."
1/24/2009,its a matter of game mechanics... but you obviously didn't bother to think that far.if you want to play the market then go play the stock market...the market in eve is already out of control pricing wise no thanks to macro miners... and giving anyone that kind of power to buy and sell at the numbers you want is highly suspicious.
1/24/2009,"i can understand why it could seem suspicious...it might sound like wanting to grab market control.. that is actually not the point, its the exact opposite.. i would prefer the market get more liberated and gave more influence to the smaller skilled players..as i have tried to show in other posts the result of this would be orders on more items everywhere, and more requirements in strategy from the traders. the simple micro increments would not be enough anymore because traders would be able to place order stacks on the same item. thus you would need to decide where to place your order pricewise and not just competition shift it by 0.01this would also lead to more smooth price curves on most items becaue competition would be more flowing and less minute to minute trades. in short sellers and buyers would need to consider prices today and on the longer runs when trading. this would not be a bad thing because prices would move towards a more realistic equilibrium.."
1/24/2009,"yes, at the moment the way to duel (in empire) is very much like a childish game where people may ignore the rules and play by their own. i would like to see something more serious that allows two players, and no one else, to freely engage in combat for sport. no one can get support from other ships, no fleet bonuses etc. straight up one on one. i do have to say, i have never played any other mmo's out there, so i am not familiar with the characteristics of existing duel systems. i would just like to see the ability to agree to a duel that doesn't involve me allowing a whole corporation to attack me also.i totally agree with you, but this duel system wouldn't eliminate this metaphorical bar situation. when you go to low sec, you can loose your ship even if you didn't look for a fight. you may have just passed by the wrong people, at the wrong place, at the wrong time. just like choosing to walk into the bar. and it is totally up to you to travel there and take that risk or not. i by no means am asking for that to be taken away from the game. i am asking for a shred of control in one certain situation. low sec allows anyone, or any group to do what they want, and i am all for it. but i want to see some serious contenders go one on one in the boxing ring, not a group of fools with shanks, broken bottles, and brass knuckles."
1/24/2009,"this is not only for 1v1 actually, this works for groups of friends who are not in the same corp and want to do a group pvp in high sec. it is much much easier to just agree to a pvp flag for a period of time via an interface option, rather than all bunching up and dropping cans and stealing from them. especially helps people doing their own pvp tournaments and want to invite friends outside of corp to it.i mean, stealing from cans for 1v1 or group pvp in highsec is fine, this is just trying to offer a more refined method.trading cans for consensual high sec pvp is so 2003. we are improving and advancing eve with every patch, this is no different in its purpose."
1/24/2009,"vaal, you seem opposed to my idea simply because wow also uses an interface option to allow for consensual pvp, where pvp otherwise is not an option. so do you also want to eliminate the option where people agree to steal from each others jetcan in space to then set a 15 min timer for a pvp fight in high sec? how is the jetcan-trading mechanic we currently have any better or mature sounding than the dreaded wow-like interface mechanic that would achieve the same end? seriously, what does wow have to do with this dude?"
1/24/2009,"well, he wrote ""almost"" :d"
1/24/2009,if it was the same as using jetcans why the heck would ccp waste time on such a mechanic when you can use jetcans?a duel option similar to wow would suck in eve.
1/24/2009,"skil point loss idea is terrible...bounty idea while intresting, is too easy to expoit.removing concord is very unlikely...."
1/24/2009,"only makes it more carebearish for those who want no real consequences for their actions.if you are so worried about all those terrible things, simply don't be a criminal in empire. however, for others, this may just add a bit of additional spice to the game."
1/24/2009,no one is forcing you to take any actual risk. that part is completely up to you.
1/24/2009,good luck finding someone that wants to risk 3 months of sp to get loot thats not even worth your time compared to ratting or missioning.
1/24/2009,"warning, followed by temporary ban for a second offensive, followed by a permanent ban for a third.by ban i mean from the game, not just the forums."
1/24/2009,"perhaps the thread i linked is not the worst, i am not normally overly sensitive to such issues. i guess when there is so much of it in rl, it is annoying to see it in game. but most of all, i truely believe it serves absolutely no positive purpose in the game. therefore there can be no harm in ccp doing everything possible to stamp it out. and i am not talking about players who happen to use terms that can be deemed offensive, i am talking about those who specifically target players of other races / nationalities."
1/24/2009,"all,as a merc, one thing that really gets me mad is neut repping alts. engage one target outside a station, and two neutral reppers start helping. this sucks, as you spot a wt, work out how best to engage, but everyone seems to have an endless amount of neutral reppers, ready to start helping when the target is engaged.i have no problem with logistics, as they are very useful, however being able to leave them in a nub corp, waiting to help your war decc'ed main is bs. i propose making remote repping, unless in the same corp/alliance, a concordable offence. i can't engage neutral reppers till they start to help, so why should player be able to use this lame arse tactic.i do my research, engage one on one, and two neuts step in to rep. this is bs, and should be outlawed. i do expect to be flamed, however this is my opinion. ideas/critism/support/expansion of ideas welcome"
1/24/2009,shouldn't be necessary since you can legitimately attack the neutral reppers after they have began aiding your wartarget. unless i am mistaken.
1/24/2009,"oh the irony...you're whining about neutral remote reps when your corp and alliance use them all the time (and let's not forget the 2-3:1 odds, logon traps and ubiquitous falcon alt). perhaps you meant to post on a troll alt?"
1/24/2009,if you can shoot them - and i'm pretty sure you can - i see no problem with the status quo.
1/24/2009,two solutions already exist...shoot them or bring falcon...problem solved..
1/24/2009,"i'd have to agree with the op. firstly you cannot shoot the neutral repn ship in hi sec, if you do ull be concorded. secondly this practice has become rampant with griefer corp/alliances in hi sec. yes im in a carebear alliance but am willing to fight in a war dec but whats the point if youve no chance of winning when this tactic is employed. this seriously needs to be looked at. lastly it was the remote repn a pilot being shot at by the faction navy in faction warfare that was changed."
1/24/2009,i don't understand what the problem is... if you can't shoot them until they help.... then shoot them when they start helping out.is this such a hard thing to figure out? sheesh.
1/24/2009,"nope, as said above ccp has no obligaton to provide internal logs."
1/24/2009,"we knew that. everybody knows that. they're regular, old nodes.because that ""high performance"" only happens on one of the few ""new hardware"" nodes, if you manage to schedule the use of one for those fleet ops.you know, one of those new machines that also runs jita on a permanent basis ?oh, yes, because several devblogs and news items is ""hiding it"", isn't it ?the rest of the hardware will be upgraded when ccp can afford to.in case you don't know, they have a debt about as big as two year's worth of income, and the value of the current hardware is quite impressive too, so you can't exactly blame them for not doing anything.yeah, sure, they could go on a borrowing spree right now and buy better machines all-round just so you would lag less, leaving them with two and a half or even three year's worth of debt... but if you don't realize why that's not a good idea, there's no point talking to you anymore.before you complain next time, at least try to do your homework on what you're complaining about."
1/24/2009,perhaps you could mount a new kind of module that converts the cargo hold for various tasks... i have always thought that the cargo hold should suffer a capacity hit if used for mining except in mining dedicated vessels to represent equipment used inside the cargo hold that organises the carious minerals being harvested.this same idea could be used here. you mount a special module to your freighter (freighter only modules (as i assume there is some reason freighters cannot mount modules)) or huge industrial that allows the transport of assembled ships both rigged and standard at the loss of total capacity. once there are people having private ambulation parties in cargo holds people are going to care what is in them.
1/24/2009,"i have a proposal for a new skill under corp management, that would allow for a reduction in pos fuel requirements per level.the skill would be the same price,level and have the same pre-req's as starbase defense, and its effects would be 2% fuel savings per level, to get to level 5 you would be looking at 30-40 days training depending on attribute levels.this would give fuel savings of approx 14000 isotopes, 2600 heavy water, and 4600 ozone per month. the implementation could be the flaw in this (who gives the bonus), one solution could be to base it on the last person to fuel the pos.its got a few wrinkels that need to be sorted out, please feel free to critise, expand, support, or troll."
1/24/2009,have to support my own topic
1/24/2009,in other words you want ur pos to be cheaper to run? go get sovereingty.also what will happen after this?less demand for ice products; vs same supply.meaning ice products become even moreso cheaper.therefore you want to nerf ice miners.wrong choice
1/24/2009,there's a slight flaw in your logic... i was under the impression the pos doesn't answer to any particular one person.. and if this is a ceo thing... then that's kinda.... uh... unbalanced?although i'm open to further discussion on the matter.
1/24/2009,"one idea i'm kind of fond of is corporate director slots for things like this. have a cfo, whose skills affect corporate market orders, a military director whose skills affect wardecs, and a starbase manager, whose skills affect fuel(that not being an example i'd thought of, but it fits). it'd let you add more corp management skills without making ceo a black hole for six months of training time. i'm not a huge fan of this proposal, but if it's to be implemented, that would seem to be the way."
1/24/2009,agreed.... i always wondered why is it i have to do all this training just to allow ______ to take place in my corp when i can just as easily delegate said tasks/skills to people who are going to do them anyway.
1/24/2009,if you spend your lp. you are always left with a tiny bit of lp all the time. i still have 667 lp with transtellar shipping from like 2 years ago.this has to be somewhere in some database taking up some space.how about an option of simply giving up and dropping lp? or perhaps some minimal way of converting lp to isk for like 100isk/lp ratio or something. just to completely rid yourself of that corp's remaining lp. that way it doesnt take up anymore space needlessly.even if it's 1kb for me. that's 250megs of space for the rest of eve.
1/24/2009,"i'd prefer the option of lp trading, myself. make lp a contractable item, make a market for the stuff. but if there's technical difficulties, yeah, a 100 isk per lp ""offer"" would be good too. it's just an annoyance at present."
1/24/2009,"not a bad idea, if love to get rid of those spare 10-20 lps that i have at some corp ive not used for over 2 years. in the grand scheme of things 250mb is a drop in the ocean compared to other things, market transactions, etc."
1/24/2009,"when i read the topic i reacted with fantastic idea!!! player corporations able to distribute lps to corp members and set up what they are redeemable for in a simply controlled list... omg that is such an awesome idea.. i cant belive you thought of it... oh that's right i thought of it... man i am a genius. really i am.seriously ceo: ""i really need those minerals now!""corp member: ""yes sir! i obey!"" *gets mins.*ceo: ""excellent work here have 2000 lp"""
1/24/2009,taking up space somewhere in a database?do you even know or understand how a database functions?wait... don't answer that... you have no bloody idea half the time with over 90% of your ideas as it is.but as luck would have it.. even if your logic is totaly far out in left field beyond the fence and miles furthermore.. it is still a valid idea.can't believe im saying this<cringes>supportedow... that hurt..... i think i need a medic... medic!
1/24/2009,invention?
1/24/2009,this idea have my full support.
1/24/2009,i guess no one reads the news... particularly about tech 3 coming.no support.op is blind and shortsighted.you can't scrap something without allowing ccp to make changes to come.
1/24/2009,"i came back to eve after a long brake to see what this fw stuff is like. so far its been go out find someone to shoot but also find that lag monster as well. i hear of battles with 10x the numbers we see and they are lag less, but they plan those battles and get a server lined up. ive also have herd of when fw first came out there where fleets of 100+ going out and beating each other senseless with no lag. now why cant we go back to that? (the less lag part, im all for the fighting )"
1/24/2009,"anything that helps reduce the lag that faction war players currently deal with would be a blessing. last night's lag was epic, it was laughable really to me because i just spent last weekend in the south where there was less lag with 1000 people in local than there was in this 60 ship fw fight last night. ugh! help!"
1/24/2009,you can also tie in the ability for 0.0 outposts and conquered stations; whose standing with this new faction can make it possible for those agents to move to your station.right now interbus live in stations that arent their own. no reason why an eom agent or whatever could be moved into your outpost.the level and quality of the agent depends on corp's standings who control the outpost. furthermore i dont see why they couldnt do the same thing for interbus.
1/24/2009,"work arounds already exist.i have 6.46 standings to gallente federation, at the same time i have 6.5 standings to guristas pirates.i have not run missions for guristas for over a year now, but i have run missions for sisters of eve and fed navy for a while.each faction assigns missions to fight certain pirate factions but not others.for instance, caldari assigns missions against predominately guristas, bloods, angels, and sanshas--but almost never serpentis( with the exception of the serpentis side in worlds collide). gallente assigns missions against serpentis, angels, occasionally sanshas, very rarely bloods-- and never guristas (exception is half of worlds collide)done correctly there should be at least one pirate faction that does not have irreversably bad standings against you. that said there probably should be an equivalent of a data center or some mechanic to repair more than -5 standings."
1/24/2009,"low sec concord faction navymy idea above has this is mind.you see if you join fail warfare or are simply highly negative to the faction and you go to their space. 0.5 systems are quite tankable. 0.7 systems become hard to tank.0.4 would spawn a concord spawn different then a 0.1obviously my idea extends all the way to 1.0 systems to replace the faction navies in cases where -10 pirates enter high sec.not to mention. even in 0.4 systems. gatecamps would have the ability to destroy the concord spawns, or lock them up so they dont even spawn on the gate."
1/24/2009,"i generally don't camp gates, rather i like to hunt for my targets. however a fair number of my engagements occur at gates.however i am going to play devils advocate for sec, what you are proposing would actually ecourage bigger and more organized gate camps with more remote repping and sensor boosting.either that or organized gangs would have cloaked alts sitting 1-2 jumps up and down the route watching for traffic, while the gang sits at a safespot withing a few thousand km off the gate.either way you suggesting things that does not do much to change the end result, while hurting small gang and solo pvp on gates."
1/24/2009,what a superb tool to make low sec even more devastating and hostile.lets say i'm a pirate. i know there's some juicy targets in system. i anchor one of those at all gates except 1. gatecamp the one. while watching the others. pwned.mining boost in low sec wont happen. the minerals are quite plentiful now. quite nice. the problem is that the belts have absolutely 0 security. meaning anyone and their grandma can come kill you.want to fix mining in low sec. create actual security. i've proposed a concord faction spawn similiar to the faction navy spawns now.bounty rats wont change. or why goto 0.0? if you boost that... you will deflate the economy epically. my idea for that was low sec officer spawns. 0.1 sec system have a remote of remote chance to get minor officers who drop medium officer modules; and the inbetween officer mods. for example medium nos officer. currently we have some deadspace mods. not much beyond tech 2. officer can be even moreso longer ranged.there's also no officer cap flux coils. we can make those and have those come from low sec. with appropriate balancing there would be quite a good incentive to go out to low sec to rat.those 2 ideas in of themselves would incentivise low sec to great degrees. enough to generate quite a bit of ratting and potential for mining. low sec would be fixed.
1/24/2009,"generally i'm in favor of things that boost piracy and pvp... but this one is a little bit overpowered, not to mention it removes one of the key fundamental difference between low sec and 0.0. no, there are better ways to improve low sec, this is definitely not it."
1/24/2009,"itt: people who know what they're doing, people who don't, and people who like to complain about something that isn't really a problem, anyway."
1/24/2009,"so i can understand a players impression that the csm has no effect. from my personal experience i can tell you that impression would be very wrong. that effect, however canot be seen on a ""features in 15 minutes or the next one's free"" basis. so let's talk about how the csm makes a difference and what the pilots of eve should consider when thinking about the value of the csm.1. oversight. the recent pos exploit is a perfect example of the value of the csm. ccp gave the csm extremely detailed insight into the exploit and their actions after it's discovery. the csm has given large amounts of time with the ccp employees that analyzed and fixed the code as well as those that investigated the effect of the exploit. the csm has not made any further disclosures as the information was given under nda and ccp has promised to release what the csm learned by the end of the month. once that has happened the csm has been told we are free to discuss what we learned.the bottom line is that the players have a huge benefit in having a a player run council that can verify that ccp is acting an appropriate manner when things like exploits occur.2. feature feedback. the recent meeting in iceland convinced me that the csm can have major influences on the things we all get to enjoy in eve. everyone should understand that the csm feedback will take time to see in game. eve is a huge piece of software and introducing changes is a complicated process. so the realities of the software development lifecycle mean that new things will take time to make their way into the 'verse. also remember the changes in code are not the only factors that come into play in determining when something gets out to the game. these include:related developments - features are usually grouped into related chuncks. so for example a change in 0.0 sov mechanics is likely going to be done when all the related changes are ready.game balance - some features have impact on game balance. calculating effects and working on related changes to maintain balance is complicated and time consuming.storyline - eve has a rich storyline and some features are best grouped with important developments in the storyline.laws of physics/system architecture - making eve work well is a huge challenge in terms of network infrastructure and hardware realities. some ideas have impacts on performance and have to wait for fundemental changes in system architecture. as ccp evolves the server architecture and discoveres new ways for optimization certain features become practical.feature ""thunderdome - many ideas enter, only one idea leaves"" - often there are large numbers of competing suggestions to address a single experience. teams have to take time to review the alternatives sufficiently to understand the best choice. that means sometimes the research and planning time can expand dramatically as the best alternatives are researched to determine which one finally makes it into eve.3. real ""politics"" in a mmorpg - the csm is a unique experiement in ""virtual"" politics. at the moment there really isn't much to point at about the csm to demonstrate this but i believe this will become an interesting part of the csm. elections are going to become much more visible in the eve universe and i think we can expect the emergence of real ""political"" parties in eve in the future. i know some folks would find this totally uninteresting but everyone should realize that this adds a game element that the players themselves can affect in a very real way.4. external visibility - because of the csm eve has gained the attention of many outside organizations. this is because the csm is a unique idea. this attention grows the eve universe as more people become aware of eve and give it a try. free advertising!more to follow."
1/24/2009,"the only unique aspect of the csm is that for the first time, a business implemented a player-based consultative commission in a mmorpg with great fanfare, and that some customers are falling for this.virtual democracy has existed since centuries under various shapes according to location, culture and epoch, going as far back as experiments in ancient greece and beyond. every flavor of representative democracy naturally bears the seeds of hidden interests, while the least manipulable form of democracy is based on direct democracy given that voters have the right both to oppose their leadership and to launch their own referendums.why do you think that only a few nations & entities are functioning under direct democracy ? anyone who doesn't understand can go back taking basic political science classes...fact of the matter is that implementing a representative consultative body in a population where all members are de facto wired is the antithesis of democracy, when all you need is an ingame consultative poll at logon on the issues at hand.- no useless discussions- no hidden interests- all numbers immediately at disposal after a poll is closed.but as i said, i suspect that investing one day of a programmer's time to come with a robust and simple poll solution able to hand out the most precise results & statistics isn't the first priority here, because even the best polling system will not achieve 1% of the impact of the csm as it has been designed by ccp.the goal of decent polling systems is to synthesize as accurately as possible the opinions of a set of individuals, and as such, stands at the opposite of marketing-driven operations & pr stunts."
1/24/2009,"you gravely underestimate the uproar when most polls seemingly would be ignored in a system like yours, just because out of 250k subscribers, a tiny minoroty actually can grasp game design and even fewer have facts or a good view of matters at hand.great way to turn eve into an unplayable version of hello kitty."
1/25/2009,"yes please, all of themespecialy a rogue drone dominix (i love the infested dominix model)anyway my dream is a sentry drone bonused ship :-)also the drone bays on drone ships could be enahnced so that each has at least 3xbandwidth capacity ..."

1/25/2009,if we are going to have tracking problems similar to that of guns... i think a bit more of a dmg boost is in order. right now missiles are subpar in almost every way to laser and hybrid weapon systems in each comparitive class shooting at the same size ship.
1/25/2009,"strongly supported.most of the other interfaces in eve, especially those related to fleet/pvp, have significant buffs over the years. s&i should have similar improvements too.maybe on a basic level it should take the form similar to weapon grouping? group a number of max run bpcs together and allow them to be loaded into a mobile lab. after all, bpcs for invention mostly have the same attributes anyway. for all you know, it may reduce server load?"
1/25/2009,"i support batch jobs... with invention making multiple small bpcs, building them out is always a pita.some love to the manufacturing modules on a pos would be good too."
1/25/2009,they are harvesting us for idea on how to improve.they made it a sticky in features and ideas... but it went nowhere it seems. no dev has even went back to the thread in ages; well 4 months more like it... but still.

1/25/2009,save sb!

1/25/2009,there are definite ways to verify 100% ! that people are using macros to mine !sadly ccp doesnt care about that....

1/25/2009,"i'm in favor of such a mechanism.not exactly like this, but similar. only if it can be implemented without too much of a hazzle. it is not worth as much time investment on part of the devs as the more important features. many many many of them. yet, if it should happen to be included as a byproduct, or as something the devs have thought of for some time anyway, i'd be happy about the additional option."
1/25/2009,this is a really good idea.
1/25/2009,something needs to be done
1/25/2009,supported. it's crazy that a ship set up specifically to lock fast and tackle struggles to achieve a lock against a ship of a larger class than itself before the target can get into warp.this isn't the point that a cruiser should be able to lock a cruiser before it can warp off.this is the fact that a properly set up frigate can't lock the same cruiser before it can warp off.

1/25/2009,nej. none. het. no.any rich enough will get a large amount of sps without waiting as we waited.i will not play in eve with la2-style character progress.
1/25/2009,"i see this problem, too. and i even think it extends to a few more things:the range in which missions are given out. its no problem in high sec, as it is just a time sink to do a few jumps for the mission location. but in low sec it is one of he real killers in mission profit. gates are easily campable and such getting a mission 2 jumps away can inevitable lock you out of it, because getting past a gatecamp is too troublesome just for a mission [in most cases]of course it is possible to work with it, its higher risk for higher reward anyway. and of course it is no ""must"" that a gate is camped. but as missioning agents get known the gates around low sec agents woul surey be camped a lot. in my opinion that is one reason that keeps a lot of pve players out of lowsec, but thats a different topic.i like the ""hitory""-solution, an agent is, in an ingame sense, a living person, why would he bother to offer you missions over and over again that you did never or rarely do? and why [if not to annoy you] would he give you a mission where you fight your friends? why would he think you'd ruin your relationships just for a little money?another solution might be, to give a player the possibility to chose a missions. say the agent has 3-5 possible missions he can give you at once. you complete one of them and it gets replaced. [the other 4 remain the same to reduce exploitment]. it is possible that all 5 missions come up bad anyway but the chances are reduced.perhaps the mission choices are replaced every 4 hours. or the agent has a ""global"" set of missions he can give out that replenishes every 4 hours, too. [as he wants to have his missions completed anyway. so not doing faction mission at all will just increase their chance of popping up until the 4 hours are over etc pp]"
1/25/2009,"i am quite split on this issue ...i'd support only the part where an agent should not give you missions which you don't have skills for.the 4 hour timers are a pita, but they simply prevent people from chaining specific missions and are a necessary evil ..."
1/25/2009,"missions in general need an overhaul, but the complaints in the op are just contrivedso? then get them. it's good that one ship/fitting isn't enough for all mining missions. maybe kill missions can be made this way in the future, yes?they don't take 2 hours to complete i don't believe. even if they do, do part of it until dt, then finish it after.i actually partially agree with this, at least with mining missions.those missions are there for a reason. no one else's fault but you're own that you insist on having huge standings with everyone.of your suggestions, the ones to introduce new charisma based skills and the ones to revamp missions overall have merit."
1/25/2009,"not necessarily the option.my standing with gallente is -2 and it wont go any lower; as long as i dont shoot them; but i get ea and such all the time.possibility; but moar skills>????doesnt fit tbh.to which exist.i say that the certain faction missions which get declined constantly would become neutral ones relative to 4hr timer. the problem is... which ones exactly? everyone is different.i say a more dynamic. 10 minutes for level 1, 20minutes for level 2, 30mins for lvl 3, and 1hr for lvl 4s.would be fine in my opinion.this is my main point.currently with the system. you pseduorandomly get missions. the next 10 missions are going to be what they are going to be.there's no harm in giving us the next 10 missions. we still decline 1 per every 4 hours; but you can choose which ones you will do.therefore... there's no downtime... but you dont really get to cherry pick missions. unless you have lots of downtime.sure you can get 5 nice missions in those 10. but you will have 20 hours worth of downtime still to decline those others. nothing changes."
1/25/2009,"except... taking penalty is far worse. anyone who doesn't care about their standings... for example already have gotten 9.9 with 2 factions. will do this... but declining and taking the penalty is just absurd otherwise.this behaviour only reinforces dodixie or motsu where you have multiple agents close together. decline one, get screwed, move to the next agent, do missions, decline, keep going. you cant goto other places or else your next lvl 4 agent is too far off.obviously another fix is to move level 4 agents around. create 100 or more new lvl 4 agents around empire. all high sec obviously.absurd.you have obviously never done a mission before downtime lol. a few experienced players who know the exact average time it takes to do these missions actually get the opportunity to farm missions because of this. the newbs on the otherhand are hurt so badly.absurd. it's basically impossible to have high standings with all. what we are trying to do is make it so we can do other things such as trading... and not get shot at by faction navies."
1/25/2009,"excellent idea. player base going up, we need more capacity to build supported."
1/25/2009,i'd rather have a skill that allows you to optimize slots.so say a new skill that's rank 12 or something. is equivalent of a titan to industrialists. that with it allows you to stack 2 jobs into the same slot to essentially build at the same time.obviously that idea needs to be balanced quite a bit. probably at a cost of materials used. theoretically though it could help free up slots and streamline production a bit.in other words... you get your new slots... but at a cost if you use them.frankly as time goes by... more people are going to be joining eve and those 5 day wait empire lines might become 25 days. being able to get 5 jobs in at a time on a shorter line might be worth it.increasing the # of slots in your method however only pushes the factor of leading to longer lines.
1/25/2009,"haven't really searched around so there is a chance others have already requested this.the map is probably the last part that gets attention when new stuff comes in. we've had the same map layout and options (and sadly issues) since.. well almost since forever. the map should really be improved. its not a topic about ""i want it pink"" but about ""i want stuff that helps"".avoidance listthis is a tricky option and usually people don't use it (at least new people). you (your autopilot) can avoid different system if you already have them on your list. this is bullcrap because if i want to avoid amarr systems (since i have low standings) i : 1 - make the route and waste minutes fine tuning the list2 - fly a noob ship... when possibleits not a whine ""omg i lost me ship wtf haxored"". its a nice way of helping people plan effectively. yes i know i can color the stars by sov but that's just wasting time (since you have to manually edit route/add systems to avoidance list).bottom line : add more avoidance filters. avoid systems with x deaths, x players, etc.multiple filterswhen planing a route or looking for a certain type of system i have the option to view different info (ships in the last day, traffic, kills, etc). this is nice but as with every thing about eve something has to sucks and that is the lack of multiple filters. i can only use one at a time. i cant see the security rating + people podded+sov for example and this really sucks because it forces me to lose time and waste click. region (big) solar mapyes i know i can see the map of the region by pressing f11 but i want to have full screen and be able to use the filters and do other stuff. its not that hard to implement this since its already in the mini-map. dockable/stackable/movable mapdon't like to keep the map open (if i need it). first because i need to see whats going on in the game and second because ccp hasn't fixed the probe bubble/tactical overlay problem yet (although its so old it might even date to prebeta). i want a map i can minimize or dock/stack so i can see it and use it fast (yes i'm crazy about my filters).map route export/save/sharewould be nice to be able to save a route just like you do with places when you bookmark them. it would also be nice to be able to share routes with corp mates just like you do with other stuff (right click linking system, bms). solarsystem mapthere's not much to change here since it doesn't offer that much info but there is one thing that bugs me. its not really a problem but its annoying to have all the icons one on top of another. an option to show only one or more types of bodies would be nice. theres is an option to show/remove info but there's none to remove the icon itself (like removing the icons for planets).my 2 isksedit : grammar/small tweaks"

1/25/2009,i agree entirely. i was wondering what was wrong with the map and you have hit the nail on the head.

1/25/2009,"i suppose what i should of said is that if you weren't in combat then it might of been harder to detect any issues. i have a question though, do the blades have to be organised by locality ?i know it makes sense to have them organised like that but if thats the case then maybe fw is suffering because there are some highly populated neighbouring systems, as oppose to 0.0 where next door may well be empty. if the systems on the blades were balanced out a bit. i.e. by average traffic as opposed to geography, then it might reduce some problems."
1/25/2009,"i really should have said node and not blade. i'm not sure what the common practice is, but i know several examples where surrounding systems got locked down due to a large fleet battle (large in this sense is 300+ pilots, pre stackles i/o and eve64) where lots of reinforcements where held of from the battlefield next door, unable to get within one or two systems. it is quite possible that nodes need to have adjacent systems in them, it seems to have been the way it worked previously afaik.i think i've heard somewhere that they used to keep two nodes per blade in the server, but don't take my word for it.but the fact remains that i have had a lag free experience in fw, while people at the same time and place complain about lag. i'm not saying that there could not or should not be any improvement, but it certainly isn't as bad as many make it sound like. the day i can no longer manually navigate my interceptor in 100+ engagements, is the day i'll give my thumbs up in this thread."

1/25/2009,"i would suspect any lag would be possible to solve, just like they eventually managed to solve lag on combat. i would also say that a delay on entry of a new order would be considered a feature imho.actually it would be extremely nice if the whole thing was simply solved by adding a whole new set of non instant orders to the market. just like when non daytraders in rl order products from their bankers. these then get stacked and an appropriate price is calculated.. the result would be a stacked average price a sort of order package. where the volumes and prices would consist of maybe a mix of orders from the players..just mentioning this because if lag would be a problem a compromising solution, that also could add some new playability feature would not be half bad.."
1/25/2009,"?if i destroyed a ship and killed a pod, based on my numbers, i would have a bounty of 350k isk.that is equal to ratting a couple cruisers. if i did 10x the crimes and got a bounty of 3.5 million isk.one triple bs spawn would,pretty much, wipe it.i would just have to make sure that i didn't get podded, in the meantime.so, despite your concerns, i believe that the rewards do, indeed, make up for any risk. one just has to be careful and have done proper prior planning, i suppose."

1/25/2009,source?
1/25/2009,that is very old and says only that they had 33m liabilities at the end of 2007 while the income in 2007 amounted to 37m.it's not a valid source for your claims therefore.
1/25/2009,"they didn't have a huge influx in income, just a steady growth. the vast majority of income comes from eve subscribers, and while the number has risen, it's not radically increased since 2007.they got new hardware each year, sometimes more than once a year. they spent their fair share there, and still are.they hired more people than they let go. salaries and other development costs could only go up too.they were already on slim margins in 2007 (barely 8% net profit out of all income, compared to over 34% the year before), and those numbers were not likely to get much better in 2008.what other conclusions can you possibly draw than something similar to my previous ones ?"

1/25/2009,this will definitely allow people to freely move to new areas of operations. otherwise you have to manually fly every ship and there is no need for this.also you could purchase a fitted ship from contracts and then set up a courier contract and have your hot out of the oven - fully fitted new ship delivered straight to your door
1/25/2009,"you cannot assign/assist logistic or ecm drones, thus you will need both a lock (sin has atrocious scan res) and pull in your dps drones in order to use repping drones. and heaven help you if you dropped sentries and moved an inch, you would either have to abandon them or fly around manually getting within 1,500 scoop range, which by then your buddy will be dead.the truth is they're all gank ships. the widow is only useless if you make it useless. prior to qr, the widow had the highest gank while simultaneously having the highest tank (1150 dps, 110k ehp), and it was clearly the best blackops followed by the redeemer then sin/panther. the widow lost alot with the missile formula change, it very much relies on multiple target painters (ie gang mates fitting them) to even approach it's eft dps numbers, and the redeemer easily outclasses it. obviously none of those fits include ecm ofc."
1/25/2009,"drake/herschell,thanks for the responses, i like your ideas herschell, especially the use of director slots to save the ceo training all the skills, that fits in with rl corp structures, why have a dog and bark yourself. jason - who wouldnt want to run a pos cheaper?, with sov 1 you get a 20% saving, with sov 4 its 30%. mining ice isnt that profitable in high sec at 3.5-4 mil per man hour, so the saving from my point of view would be minimal, eg 1 hour a month (12 cycles) for a med tower.the savings become exponential as the number of towers increases, im sure some alliance logistics teams would love to have an extra 10% saving. thus making a sov 4 = 40% saving.as it stands you have fuel conservation skills for cap's, so why not have one for the pos."

1/25/2009,"simple solution that can be implemented with any of the future patches:add the following items to each loyalty store:1 lp = 100* isk2 lp = 200* isk3 lp = 300* isk5 lp = 500* isk10 lp = 1000* isk20 lp = 2000* isk50 lp = 5000* isk100 lp = 10.000* isk500 lp = 50.000* isk1000 lp = 100.000* isk5000 lp = 500.000* isk*(100 and multiples of 100 used as an example. could be more, could be less.)done. if you like, cut down some options to make it less. my choice is based on common currency units for the sake of making it easy, so that you don't have to take the 1 lp option n times to get rid of n lp.i think addition of a set of standard items to all loyalty stores is not much work. either it is not, or the database is junk. so any dev with any amount of time around half an hour could probably do it."
1/25/2009,"cant see it being a problem.set in all the lp stores 1lp gives you an item named 1lp. which has a seeded buy order all over for 100isk item. which also gives you the option of selling it yourself for more isk/lptrue that.apparently you aren't a genius because you clearly have significant reading comprehension problems.yes and they do. if you disbelieve my assertion... prove it.1lp to 1lp is enough.what they need to do is implement an easier way to get multiple transactions for lp. so converting 100,000 ammo to navy ammo isnt crazy. then apply the same mechanic to the lp obviously."

1/26/2009,"i really don't understand your argument. did you read it at all? colonies are only for a sov. 4 holding alliance. to do that you have to put a lot of time and effort into the game. it would be dumb if anyone could just establish a colony wherever they wanted, even in high sec in that case. the real world doesn't establish itself on the basis of evenly distributed resources. if every country in the world had the same resources then it would definitely not be the war torn, turmoil rich world in which we live. eve should be the same way. if colonies could be put up by joe blow where ever he wanted, it would leave eve very much stale."

1/26/2009,"you don't have a clue about explosive either. a blast in a confined space is not amplified, it is just directed to a smaller area thus achieveing more pressure per target area. this is the whole magic behind armor piercing explosives, they focus the blast energy into a tiny space which results in a great concentration of pressure and thus a larger effect.anyway all missile type ships should cause damage after they are destroyed as missiles are autonomous devices once launched. this would help to lessen the inherent dps penalty missiles get because they ""always"" hit."

1/26/2009,"i like how jason edwards disagrees with the entire thread but still checks the support box anyways. and then posts with his alt like we wouldn't notice, what a moron.so are you also against gcc? i don't see how you cannot play for four hours yet still able undock and do literally anything in the game still. running missions is the most boring part of eve, if you cannot run missions and you are freaking out, you really should explore some more of what eve has to offer. have you actually rejected a mission? if you run level 4s, you will not notice the standings drop from a rejected mission now and again. i just got -.0112 towards my faction for rejecting pot and kettle part2. oh noes, -.0112!instead of being anal retentive on your standings, just keep standings good enough so you can run missions. going from 8.03 to 7.60? who gives a flying **** if you can still run the missions. a single level 4 will probably get you most of the way back to 8.03.more missions should be versus factions, because good lord, that is what the eve story is all about. don't you think the game should follow the story? pick a side, do missions for your favorite faction and deal with it. like i have said before, most other sided mmorpgs make you pick a side at start and you cannot switch. you are given the freedom to pick a side or switch to keep standings. if you want everything without any penalties or downsides at all, then you should go play hello kitty online."

1/26/2009,"an ongoing source of frustration, for many players within the game, is the current empire war-dec mechanic.without going into all the particular whines, i would like to propose the following:1. the war-dec flags alliance ---> corp -----> individual players, as enemies.2. once decced, each of the preceding elements is flagged both collectively and individually.3. if an alliance has been decced and a corp, within said alliance, leaves said alliance during the period of hostilities, the departing corp remains flagged for the entire duration of hostilities against it's former alliance. 4. if an alliance, or a corp has been decced and an individual, within said alliance, or corp leaves said alliance, or corp during the period of hostilities, the departing individual remains flagged for the entire duration of hostilities against it's former alliance, or corp.5. any group which takes in the retreating corp or individual, then and based on providing aid and comfort, is immediately flagged as a participant in the hostilities. in the case where said players move to an npc corp, they will simply remain individually flagged.6. any neutral individuals that provide aid and comfort are, themselves, immediately flagged as participants in the hostilities. this includes providing logistics, materials, or any service or support that could be considered as assisting in the war effort.for suppliers:1. any trader that sells materials to a member of a warring party has, themself, given aid and comfort and are immediately flagged as a participant in the hostilities.2. in order to make it possible for traders to not become unwillingly involved, ccp should add a selectable option to sell orders, denying a sale to any party currently under a declaration of war. 3. certain traders may wish to supply both sides. in such a case, they will become flagged to both sides, for the remainder of the hostilities.these changes should make the empire based war mechanic much more interesting.let me know of any outright problems, issues or possible improvements."
1/26/2009,you where doing fine until you got to the suppliers bit.not supported.i get war dec'ed.... and then i lose my ship.. i go buy a ship from shipmaker joe... he gets flagged and then loses his freighter of billions of isk.does that make sense to you?stupid idea... really stupid idea.
1/26/2009,"ah, but ship maker joe would have the option to not sell to you.if he did chose to sell to you, he would then, of course, face the consequences of his actions.i suppose that such a system could actually give empire wars some extra strategic possibilities. locking down a corps means of supply and actually strangling them into submission would be a very real scenario."
1/26/2009,this would just create a cycle of war dec'd corps using alts to make purchases.
1/26/2009,"the initial part of your argument i've been pushing for years... persistant war flag per individual to stop the corp-jumping carousel.but flagging a seller as hostile?? uhhhh, no way in hell?look at things as they are now:france sells war supplies to every middle eastern country attacking un/nato forces in the region. is france thus at war with their neighbors by default?joe shmoe goes down to the local hunters' supply store and purchase a shotgun which he then takes and blows hank hunkston's head off. is trader tom now under arrest because joe decided to use a legitmate, legal purchase as a murder weapon?no.let's keep it that way. ccp does not allow us to block individuals, corps, or alliances from seeing or purchasing our orders. i don't suddenly want to find myself at war (at no cost to anyone) because some rube bought a single round of emp s."

1/26/2009,"#1) the inclusion of ""status"" markers in chat would be very helpful, similar to every im system in common use, ie: afk, mining, mission, ratting, fleet ops, etc. within corp chat this would aleviate a lot of redundant inquiries about what everyone's up to. should also be customizable within the corp window, so the ceo/directors can create unique state tags.#2) title fields in corporate chat, at least, if not also in other windows. ""ceo"", ""director"", etc. (including custom and unique titles and tags) should be available to be placed in front of player's names to deliniate more clearly the authority structure within corporate/alliance/fleet chat etc. if the players so choose.thank you,reliq narsdep"

1/26/2009,the interwebs is serious bidness!!!you really need to relax man. last time i check eve is a game and its about having fun. since the council is now part of the game then that makes the assembly hall part of the metagaming content of eve and as a paying subscriber as long as my intent is to have fun and not cause disruptive activity then i am free to do as i please.your view of how eve should be doesn't mesh with mine. i don't want a sweater but fun isn't why your here is it? cuz this is serious bidness!!!no one said you had to support it or even post. you could have just let it fade away into the abyss. sounds like your causing problems more than i am for failing to adhere to the simple rule of stfu!

1/26/2009,exactly. it's bad enough to get bugged by noobs who can barely fend for themselves trying to leach your missions for bounty/salvage/loot but then that noob shows up in a golem and can only fire heavy missiles because his/her skills are so horrible. that same noob gets owned in his/her shiney new golem because supporting skills suck so bad he/couldn't tank 1.0 belt rats and cries about how you should have helped and how you should reimburse him/her....trust me don't fly what you can't afford has sent more than a couple packing in my neighborhood.
1/26/2009,basically they're taking our yobs jobs.
1/26/2009,"the reason people complain about pos wars so much is because things escalate and before you know it both sides are fueling hundreds of towers and are faced with the task of doing a lot of boring pos shooting if they want to keep/take sov. it makes wars slow and indecisive and results in most combat being against inanimate structures.the current system implemented by ccp is to only allow 5 towers to be anchored per alliance per system per day. currently all this does is slow down the process. my idea is that each additional sov claiming tower anchored in a system would lower the shield hp of every sov claiming tower + modules by 8%. spamming 10 towers would result in each tower having a 50% shield hp penalty, 15 towers would be a 69% penalty. the nature of the penalty and the exact percentage don't have to be set in stone. the important part is that there is a reason to stop the spam/counterspam at some point and start shooting each other."
1/26/2009,nope... gonna tell you right now that health penalties are not gonna work.don't know why... but it's lacking.
1/26/2009,this is stupid ... it would put alliances claiming systems with many moons at a disadvantage because their towers have less hp.
1/26/2009,"are you even familiar with how 0.0 works? if you have 60 moons in a given station system you're probably only going to hold sov with 5-10 anyway because of fuel costs. one modification would be that towers that have been anchored for several weeks are exempt from the penalty. so pre-existing towers you use to hold sov act like normal, any spam from the invading force would be penalized as would your counter spam."
1/26/2009,"psst, it's csm not cms"
1/26/2009,"well victoria, i totally agree, a dueling mechanic doesn't need to be designed for 1 on 1 battles only. i got a little wrapped up in the battles that i have witnessed and engaged in. it wouldn't be the same... when you flip cans you are opening the door to an unknown amount of people to fire at you freely. with a dueling mechanic you could select exactly who you are inviting to a duel. we would see people more players willing to engage in consensual combat if there was a system specifically designed for that purpose. using the jetcan back-door commonly ends up in players pulling their pants down, bending over, and inviting others to f them in the a. ouch."
1/26/2009,"no, i have made many posts on why i do not like this mechanic. perhaps you should read them. or have you been too busy scrambling to find new assets after being booted from mm?once again, the can aggro allows for people to dishonor a duel, which makes the game overall better and more free than strict rules that cannot be broken. the fact that you can steal, cheat, lie, and break promises is the core of why eve is different from other mmorpgs. if eve was about 1v1 e-honor battles we would have restrictions on who you could attack based on ship class or sp amount and other lame mechanics found in wow clones.wow isn't all bad, they have some good mechanics. but when you want a pvp restricting mechanic that you are blatantly copying from wow, then i say gtfo. if you want to duel without any risks, play any other mmorpg on the market.i have gone over my arguments again and again. if you refuse to do a simple courtesy as reading my ****ing posts, then gtfo. you are not having a discussion, you are attempting to mock me quite unsuccessfully. go back to the caldari militia and pretend you know anything about anything."
1/26/2009,exactly why a duelling mechanic would suck for eve.
1/26/2009,"with everything else in eve, you want to put this in place....go figure....1v's1 fights priority, massive fleet battles ...priority, normal 10-100 pvp fights...sorry guys lunch time,mission running ...okay its time to make that a priority... seriously who is ccp paying attention to these days"
1/26/2009,"hes not trying to make eve about 1 vs 1, hes simply asking for an invite for sparring/dueling. it wouldn't remove can aggro, it wouldn't change any of the mechanics save to add one extra method of fighting.nowhere in his original post did he mention at all removing any of the current aggro mechanics. so all your anger is kind of mis-directed. aggro between only two players via an invite interface shouldn't be that difficult to add into the game. just give it a fee, since from a role-playing perspective you'd be paying concord to stay out of it. i don't really see any problem with it, and seeing as there is an entire thread to make control+click unselect, i'll support someone who wants a simple way to fight 1 on 1, without breaking, changing, or removing any of the current mechanics.if the op says otherwise, i retract my support."
1/26/2009,its so obvious tat i really dont know why they dont have tat option
1/26/2009,"i think this is a viable idea that could be applied to low sec. as it stands though there is not evough risk v reward in low sec. as such it is too underpopulated to have people actually want to reside there minus the few ""anti""-pie corps that patroll a mission hub.why low sec? well because it just seems like the right thing, concord has no power there and it should belong to the player base willing to put in the time and effort. some idea's that would probably ruin the eve economy doing so but motivates people into low sec:new astroid types that when refined contain high end minerals. they would not be abundant and refining them would not yield the same ammount of said minerals as the 0.0 equivilant but if it yields a decent profit per can, say 20m then mining corps may be motivated to move to low sec and recruit a small gang of pvp'rs to protect them.move all lvl 4 missions to low sec but have them dispursed not all clustered around. doing so would help populate the vastness of low sec. also up the reward since there is now a greater risk. also add in a seperate mission type geared twards fleets (i know lvl 5's but they are fail). i know it's against carebear policiy to put yourself in danger but i don't believe you should be able to acumulate the sort of wealth that months of lvl 4 running empowers people to do with absolute(minus war dec's) safety.i'm sure other players can think of more motivators to go into low sec.some issues:who finances the bounties? will it be some npc mega corp or will the individual player/corp/alliance have to have a slush fund for placing bounties.what about the players corporation? would they have a bounty placed on them also for harboring a criminal? could one bad able reside in a nice fuzzy and warm corporation with a ceo that doesn't care about said actions because it does not affect him and his corp.what if the agressor just flee's across the galaxy? easy make kill rights sellable to dedicated merc/bounty hunters. a whole new job opprotunity arrises in eve.why would i flip a can when i can just gank the miner? easy he is now protected. so a new form of griefing is formed, blowing up cans to be a pain in the ass touching on the selling of kill rights though it really is not worth flying the galaxy to kill a player for a 5m bounty so the bounties would have to be increased say 100%.as for losing sp if you lose your pod thats rediculous plain and simple. i can't think of a viable punishment at the moment but i'm sure someone can get creative.just a barebone idea it would be cool if some of you hard core players could elaborate on."
1/26/2009,"to be quite blunt, i totally agree and it isnt just in the forums it is also in the game, people seem to think that eve is their soap box for social issues outside the game. just because a persons primary launguage isnt english isnt a good reason to get stuck into them, or because they dont fly the red, white and blue, or whatever.. from my point of view it shows them up as being too immature to be actually allowed to play the game with their parents permission, which is probably quite shocking because some of them would be over 18"

1/26/2009,right here is all that needs to be changed. because they are already flaged to you so you can shot at em. the aggression counter is all that needs fixing.

1/26/2009,"eve is a game which is constantly updated with new, shiny features for the playerbase to enjoy; however, inevitably, some of these features come out of the box buggy and often not worth bothering with. on the occasions when ccp promptly looks at the issues and fixes the bugs, that's not a problem.other times, however, the bugs are just left alone. this seems to occur mostly with fixes that are not 'flashy' - that is, they're small little quality of life things that annoy rather than cripple. other times, it is crippling but only hurts a limited segment of the playerbase, such as the fw plex bugs.leaving bugs alone because they're uninteresting is simply frustrating and there's very little excuse for adding a bunch of new stuff every few months when little is done (from a player perspective, at least) to improve the game elements that already exist.ccp should rethink their attitude toward bug fixing. it is just as important as development of new content, and ccp should fix the stuff that's been broken for years before opening new cans of worms."
1/26/2009,"i notice that the assembly hall is heavily congested. also i notice that links to the councilors information pages is located under ""csm - results""this might be not so obvious for people to find.i propose that in order to relieve congestion and rout discussion along organized threads that are in tune discussions between ccp and csm. each councilor begins a thread that is made permanent which includes their core politics and platform agendas along with links to their homepages and other data relevant to their activities.one thread for each councilor, heavily moderated and edited, and recreated when new issues are began and old old issues relegated to the archives. the threads should be posted in order of the votes gained by each councilor. i think that the amount of threads began here that are not relevant to the csm minutes is indicative of the lack of focus present in the assembly hall."
1/26/2009,"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks."
1/26/2009,"yeah right... like these little forums aren't already ignored by the vast majority of players, not even speaking about the backyard csm stuff...fact of the matter is that under the current scheme, ccp & csm have managed to sink from a 11% poll turnout down to 8%, what represents a loss of over 25% voters in a single ""legislature"". if you are unable to draw conclusions, be my guest, you're welcome to continue on that course"
1/26/2009,"exactly, and again, why are they ignored? could it be that a vast majority of all posts are totally clueless and that those few who grasp game design seldom, if ever, have access to the grand picture. this would not suddenly change just because you gave everybody a chance to vote."
1/26/2009,"yeah, you guys need to keep up to date on stuff. next pach black ops can open covert cyno in jammed systems. recon gang can take out cyno jammer (remote rep black ops). one of the best points of covert cyno is the covert transport ship, run through sieged systems to re-stront your towers or even to re-towerspam the system. there are many uses for black-ops now the only problem that i have is their cost. i think that is the biggest hindrance of those ships. people dont want to loose them because they cost so much. if they dropped in price i think we would see them alot more."
1/27/2009,"fix'd. no one cares. fly a faster ship, or use a tractor beam. better yet, maybe you should have your fights somewhere other than right outside a station.when i see people dueling outside a station, i make it my personal mission to salvage and loot their wrecks. just because it seems silly to me to fight in plain view of a lot of people who have no qualms about stealing your ""hard work"""

1/27/2009,"supporti would be fine with the current damage reduction mechanics, if all missiles did 33% more base dps than current, so if you can web down and paint your target up, you can devastate them, but otherwise you will be fairing less than a turret user."

1/27/2009,"in your situation you probably want to run couriers so you can get storylines faster without long kill missions. all you care about is faction standing so running a mission that shoots caldari, who cares if you are planning setup a pos in minmatar space. for your situation, vs faction missions don't matter at all, just keep running missions. we are talking about standings just for mission running while you are talking about standings for a pos. completely different topics."
1/27/2009,"complete overhaul.or at least repair the mechanics, so we don't get the same mission twice in a row.my proposal:once your standing with the corp/agent reaches a limit, you can chose a few options:*) not against faction x*) not of type yetc...but - each option will cost you - the reward will be reduced accordingly.so for example, let's say i have a corp-standing of 5, so i can chose not to run missions against the empires.i no longer get missions against those, but my reward is reduced by 20%.less risk ruining standings -> less reward.simply outwaiting is a stupid mechanic.oh, btw - to the one suggesting one should simply learn/buy gas cloud harvesting: ever looked at the prices? even if mining missions payed five times as much, i doubt it would be worth the effort."
1/27/2009,"i support this. being a game, you shouldn't be forced to do things that simply isn't fun. (ie. learning skills ...). i have no idea why, but it seems a lot of eve players have a history of shunning fixes that will make the game less grindy and boring in a lot of aspects. i like my games to be fun, and don't feel the need to be punished for wanting it to be fun.edit: one suggestion could be a generated list of ""here are the things we've got going on atm."", and you could pick a mission based on difficulty, type and payout. this would both make sense, and we wouldn't have the somewhat awkward ""cancelfest"" simply a removal of the countdown would imply."
1/27/2009,no they are not.... wake up and smell the standings.standings are standings are standings.the pos requires faction standings just like any other particular area.i don't know where you get off thinking they are not identical in any form or fashion....the only way to raise standings is to run missions... which is exactly what this topic is about.
1/27/2009,"forgetting that for ice you need a whole mining barge??? and seen the prices on gas cloud harvesters? and did you know it takes 3 hours to mine a gas cloud with one harvester?seems you've never done them before, as that doesn't work as the roid respawns and the mission won't complete until the roid is empty, even if you have enough ore.there are already mechanics in place that makes it impossible to have huge standings with everyone, due to the fundamental mechanics behind standing changes, that makes you lose more than you gain as you get higher up.yes that's along the lines i envisioned it, basing it on standing is a nice addition. it's like the real world, where people that want to do dirty jobs get paid more than those that are picky."
1/27/2009,i was actually thinking about the same idea. i would fully support an in game calendar.
1/27/2009,"i raised this with zulupark at the last q&a session, but there was no further answer so i'll bring it up here.the current tracking formula does not work.figure 1. represents in the simplest form (using a megathron as the example target), the problem with the current tracking formula, which screws up close-range ships.figure 2. represents how the tracking formula should work, the target at half the range, is twice the effective size, and therefore should be easier to hit.now clearly we can't bin the complete formula and start over, that is not what i'm proposing - i've already gone through three possible changes to the tracking equation that the game uses here, to account for the 'size vs distance' component that is missing, either through modifying the 50% hit chance at very close ranges, or through adding a 'signature radius multiplier' at close ranges.this has been broken since castor, but with 60% webs, this is now causing huge issues for close-range ships ability to hit targets, the proposed modifications would rectify that without scrapping the current tracking formula.regards,gabriel karade"
1/27/2009,the one thing i've never understood.... is the tracking formula in certain conditions dosen't make sense.a 1400mm cannon (8 of them) can hit a target rather hard at 80 clicks....at 50 it starts hitting harder...at 20 it can't hit worth crap....you could be at point blank range and still not hit crap.... and the target could be bigger than you are.a frigate makes sense... maybe a cruiser (maybe)... but if its obivous that you could be off by 5 to 10 degrees... your still going to hit something..... but you don't.any comments?
1/27/2009,i forgot to add my own 'thumbs up'...oops
1/27/2009,anything that adds some realism to the game and fixes some of the issues at the same time is a beautiful thing!

1/27/2009,haha wtf?so suddenly there's a huge number of traders who dont know about this option.. they undock to jita and 100 wartargets lock his freighter.oh good idea... great way to drive people away from the game.or... lets say they switch over all trades and all trades automatically are set this way.the people like privateers who are at war constantly... literally cant buy products.oh good idea... great way to drive people away from the game.not only that... i'm a real pain in the iondrive. i make my alt create a corp for 1.5 mil. then for 100mil per year... i can basically grief 1 corp in making it impossible for them to buy anything on the market?awesome.
1/27/2009,"trade in eve is anonymous. even contracts, while they may have a name on them, are still effectively anonymous, because nobody actually looks at the name or cares if they do. your proposal to criminalize trade would utterly ruin the entire eve market - you'd have traders getting shot for no reason, warriors who can't buy anything, and even if you did want to open yourself up to doing it, you'll probably get hit with wardecs from major alliances even if you're willing to supply a 10-man. this is a horribly stupid idea. the rest of it's decent, although hardly novel, but your supplier rules are crazy."
1/27/2009,"as a privateer i'm obliged to support this idea. however, it's uttely insane and even i'm feeling sorry for all the marketeers who'd fall foul of this.captain thunk"

1/27/2009,"ignorance of the law is no excuse, in such a harsh universe, especially...corps should probably concern themselves with proper infrastructures that can withstand war-decs.i suppose that there needs to be consideration of your alt corp exploit, any ideas?i'll think about it."
1/27/2009,"thank you, for your support."
1/27/2009,"first part is excellent. this. everyone would have to reactivate their old hauler alts from the privateers days. trading with someone at war shouldn't be the same as declaring war on them, which is what you are proposing. punishment does not fit the crime."
1/27/2009,"you know, i have thought about this and do see a substantial upside for traders willing to be ""war-profiteers"". traders that willingly sell to war-decced individuals should be able to get a premium for their products, because many risk averse traders would decline to put themselves in harms way.i could even imagine that some traders will load up a huge supply of commonly needed materials and set-up shop in a convenient system to the party they are supporting.maybe an entirely new, and highly profitable profession, risky as it may, in fact, be."
1/27/2009,"two possibilities:1. those who are wardecced just use an alt to buy stuff2. traders only use accounts which never undock to sell stuff to wardecced people.it doesnt make sense and it doesnt work.about the first part: i am against any changes in wardeccing mechanism which does help the wardeccer, but doesnt solve the other problem, that wardeccing is just pay to grief and getting riskfree pvp. wars should be started for a reason other than getting easy targets."
1/27/2009,"using an alt would make that alt a war target. using a trial account alt would give you the additional issue of not being able to use contracts and therefore not being able to give the goods purchased by the trial account to it's main.i suppose you could blow-up your trial accounts ship and loot the goods that survive. your choice, i suppose.as to the traders, once they were war-decced, anyone that dealt with them would, themselves, become flagged. you can imagine the rest."
1/27/2009,take pity on the fool gentlemen... particularly the ones who don't know how to read.this will never get support.... and your last response is proof of that.
1/27/2009,"question: in-station direct trade, and contracts.what happens?"
1/27/2009,"i really don't have the slightest clue what you are trying to say, or what your post is supposed to mean, considering the fact that i specifically gave the traders an out, in my proposal.did you miss it?"
1/27/2009,"flagged, i would hope."
1/27/2009,oh yeah... clicking a stupid little button that says don't sell to war decced corps.tell me oh holier than thou just how many corps are currently war-decced right now?yes.. lets war-dec everyone to stop traders from selling ships and supplies.real smart... smart like a damn brick.
1/27/2009,get beat up today at school..........again?
1/27/2009,you still havn't answered my question.how many war-dec's are currently active in eve on a weekly basis?start using your head before you start flapping your gums.
1/27/2009,"many, i would imagine.how many of those wars are actually won, in any meaningful way?"
1/27/2009,"0 and 223 so far,this would be a horrible mechanic, it wouldn't help strangle your opponent it would allow them to get a multitude of free allies, get war deced hop in a shuttle and start buying a few pieces of ammo here and there all of a sudden your enemy has a couple of dozen corps gunning for them."
1/27/2009,"way back when, the pirate faction ships (nightmare, bhaalgorn etc..) all had dual sensor strengths for the ship. e.g. nightmare had both gravimetric and radar sensor types. i believe these should be brought back for these ships to increase their viability in the pvp scene.. yes they are grossly expensive and difficult to obtain, however people still use them to fight, and this ""should"" be one of their edges for their specialty."
1/27/2009,supporting my topic.
1/27/2009,"agreed, for there cost they should be harder to jam up than anything else, hell maybe even extend to navy ships, as they are navy ships and the navy would build some extra backups in there 2 :)supported :d"
1/27/2009,"what effect would this have? would you have to jam both of them independently, or would it just use the better of the two against any individual jammer? it changes the effect of this change a lot."
1/27/2009,"it would mean that the best way to jamm faction ship is to use multispec, because racial jammer would always use weakest stat to roll diceconsidering the rarity of faction ships in pvp, i'm all for it."
1/27/2009,"i don't fit jammers myself - do most falcon pilots include a multispec or two? if so, it wouldn't seem to make much difference. if not, maybe it'd be a decent buff."
1/27/2009,"tbh i dont quite recall how they effected the jamming system when they were still on the ships, i would assume you would have to roll against both sensor strengths to actually perform a jam on a the ship."
1/27/2009,"i think, but could be wrong that faction ships had the duel types around the same time that ew was stacking based, ie you needed 12 points of jam to counter the targets 12 strenth.so it prob made no difference at the time"
1/27/2009,"i know this will likely draw a few harsh comments, i will however ask the csm to discuss if nothing else the overall balance of the underlying factors of an mmo game.to get players motivated and have activities in a game you need the 3 base factors covered.sociologyplayers are motivated by doing stuff with other players, this one eve has mostly down and only a few roleplay and player content issues can be added to the issue. there is however a small point when it comes to motivation and goals. these are often linked to an amasing of wealth or power. the two often go hand in hand..economyeve economy is the best in the business no doubt about it. it stems from the mere fact that most of the economy is player controled. back when most of us logged on the financially inclined were quick to notice the potential of a game with standing buy and sell orders. this is basically what drives the whole economic engine in eve, the rest is basically accesibility to the relevant spawning of materials or currency. note currency is actually just another commodity, its just an common universal abstract mediator of goods traded.oh well the main point i want to make is that the reasons things can seem weird in eve economically, is based in the fact that entertainment value has been preset to only entail shooting things. in short since the action is what most crave this is where the motivational pull is placed. this is understandable, but it will become more and more of a problem in regards to eve being a virtual reality. in real life the values might be in inaccessible and remote areas. special plants, oil, relics etc. the problem is out there its actually worth next to nothing, and the end products are extremely expensive if at all obtainable. what i am saying is simply if the big money isnt in high sec empire space, then the mechanics are wrong. example the raw oil get shipped to safer refineries, and from there distributed further and further into the energy demanding and high populated areas. this is how profits are made at each and every leg of the journey.we need some sort of demand on 0,0 goods from empire. one way would be to make high sec pos demand lower standing or be only character standing based. this way much more activities would need the material support from unsecure space.all npc facilities should become dynamically changed by supply and demand. this would either force players to find a lot more income, or move into less populated areas of unsecure space.imho the unsecure space is way to unsecure and trigger happy. this is because the combat profession has it way to easy. they need no more motivation than to grief. this is mainly due to the lack of need for the other professions to stay alive and afloat in unsecure space. they basically have to easy incomes once they know how to shoot stuff.i would suggest totally nerfing pve incomes in unsecure space. this way the needs of activities out there would enforce a change in behaviour. even wars out there would decrease because the resource loss had to be calculated better.ecologythe ecology is a term taken from generic mmo games, mostly based in fantasy settings. the thought is there must be a balance and control on how many dragons are in a world, and how much food can actually be grown on a field. in eve this factor somewhat goes back to economy since resources arent actually scarce, only the work load demanded to get at it.i know this is just a game, and its actually the best one around. i just wish people would try to think about all the stuff we are missing, when the motivational tools are balanced wrong.you dont get rich in unsecure space, you have fun, or build up a powerbase opposed to empire.you dont have fun in empire you work to get status and influence."
1/27/2009,"i am not sure exactly what point you are trying to express. i make good isk and have lots of fun in 0.0 space. i can't support nerfing 0.0 incomes, and i fail to see how this would fix the problem i thnk you're trying to describe."
1/27/2009,"the problem is motivation aside from the fun of risk and destruction..income in 0,0 should only be in assets. the stuff should be demanded in high sec.. the stuff build should actually be build in highsec. there is an inherent lack of logic that expensive ships and gear is build in 0,0 .. i could in part agree that to increase gameplay it should be in lower sec.. because npc rules the higher sec areas..to many things are just a bit scewed.. and without really realizing the consequences.."
1/27/2009,"ok, i understand what you're saying now and i don't agree. you seem to be speaking of a personal lack of motivations and making assumptions that they apply to everyone. i don't share your concerns and i don't find a lack of motivation and i find quite a bit of motivation beyond making things explode."
1/27/2009,i've read your post 5 times now and i still can't figure out what it is your wanting.it's like your saying you don't have any fun in high sec and your not making any money in 0.0.is this one of those you want your cake and eat it to situations?
1/27/2009,"uh, aside from your emo diatribe about what you don't like about 0.0 or high-sec, do you have any actual concrete ideas or suggestions?no? ok i'm going back to assembly hall, where we spend all of our frakking time discussing the overall balance of the game."
1/27/2009,this thread is a bad thread
1/27/2009,"basically i am trying to point out some of the missing focus on features and metagame.we need motivational tools this is not possible with current economic balance. we have no real incentive to have an overall salary system. we have no working stocks and ownership system. we have no price dynamics in npc facilities. we have no motivation to change behaviour for something more immersive..there are to many related issues, but it boils down to the underlying balance and placing of features. adding that to the static prices it makes motivation a *****.corps should get their gross income from work in empires, that is directly related to what people are doing in 0,0. oil makes the world go around basically.. raw materials vs. refined products. a model closer to rl is what i am basically asking for..and please hold the ""its a game"" comments, because then go play something simpler. eve is a virtual world. in order for a virtual world to work it needs to have two main things immersion and incentives. these two are not working optimally in eve as it is.. eve is in the transitional phase between dungeon and dragons and storyteller system. the first is a step up from a boardgame, and the latter is a roleplaying virtual life simulation. you really dont want endless spawns of +4 swords of instant monster slaying, you want a real experience that entails things that is part of real life. you want to use the game to try things that would not be possible in your real life, and thats not just slaying monsters. its taking on charachter traits you dont use yourself everyday, its having a life less ordinary..if this isnt what eve is about its just another grind machine like wow. oh at least wow is massively more populated."
1/27/2009,"do you have any specific suggestions or ideas? the only actionable suggestion i saw in your posts was ""nerf pve incommes in unsecure space"" - can't support that one."
1/27/2009,"i have several things in mind, and i honestly hope and believe most of them will in some way become part of eve.npc corps facilities needs to be supply and demand priced. these has to be updated at least once a week.market orders should be increased skill wise to avoid all the problems stemming from this limitation.0,0 should have an easier time ammasing raw materials but refinement should be extremely limited. i know it is allready to some extend, but the impact of this is not significant due to oppertunity cost blidness.the problem w oppertunity cost blindness is basically that there arent enough traders and their order books are to small. they cant invest long term.when you cant invest long term you cant issue real ipo stocks, because you have to use a lot of time assesing your netvalue and net profit. this has been partially solved by the emms tool now.if you have passive assets to generate your profit, you have steady income and can suport both a salary system and a weekly dividend payment.also npc and player corps should have the tax working as a feature and game mechanic. this income should be put aside in seperate wallet and decided by vote how much to pay out in dividends and how much to reinvest. this data should be available to the public, at least for corps that want to trade on the open scc exchange.stocks should be traded on the scc-exchange. investing and pricing npc corps would be based on activities of these corps and their losses. the easiest way was to use the tax and thus the noobs indirectly decide the best income corps.npc corps should have a gm assigned to allow switching of npc corps, and upon this granting a minor salary according to skills. this in effect would be a weekly expenditure and get calculated from the dividends..all in all we could really use a look at novel and simple features that could increase the game immersion.. the above is just some options, and only the beginning.i havent touched upon fuels, stations held by npcs.npc stations production of tradegoods, and their interdependencies.etc.."
1/27/2009,i see what your saying but i don't think you get that eve isn't intended to be work.it's seriously hard enough to determine the salary of employees in the real world so how do you expect people to do it online? you can't be a lefty and base it on skill points alone because they could be a noob that bought their character or they could be a complete jerkoff who does nothing constructive and hacks everyone off. you can't be a righty and base it on what you know because you could be missing the most valuable members of your corp simply because your a brit and they are aussies.i don't think eve is going to ever be intended to be a virtual world in that sense. second life has virtually no boundries to advancement but eve most certainly does. user created content is virtually non-existant because in eve the restrictions and setting create a committed drive by like minded people to achieve an optimal operating efficiency. that isn't present in the real world and it isn't present in second life.the drive for efficiency is motivated by competition in earnings in both worlds but the limiting factor of only having 8 or so income options in eve doesn't allow much wiggle room compared to a virtual world where users create their own content and income streams.eve can't exist as a virtual world and still maintain any semblance of equality. tribe's was a perfect example of how user content can adversely effect the user base. the renegade servers became virtually closed to outsiders and new player competing on the servers stood no chance of competing or integrating into a clan that could provide them with renegade content.you can't have an eve that makes sense and the aspects you propose. the oversight necessary would make the manhattan project seem small.
1/27/2009,"on salary. it should be based only on skillpoints in relation to npc corps. player corps naturally would assess a lot more and thus you have the competition and the motivation to leave npc corp.eve is to some extend meant to be a virtual life, at least thats what i heard from the ip presentation at the fanfest. sure it will never be like real life, and it should not be, but is should be governed by similar motivational tools. one of these being livelyhood, income and social adaption compatibility.i am sure there are more income options in eve than you think, and this will only increase in player content, player control, and metagame balancing gets an overhaul.almost all your real life skills can somehow be applied in eve eventually. heck even farming once we get some sort of station production on npc corps. build those cows farmboy.if you want equality and fairness games arent the way to go.. there is always someone better and this should be reflected. equality and fairness is something to wish for but not get or force upon people. forced solidarity isnt really solidarity at all.."

1/27/2009,"currently if you goto map-my informationyou have a number of options that are nice. for example ""my available agents""it shows you a nice map of available agents to you.how about an option:""my available jumpclones"" however not existing jumpclones but stations that could have a jumpclone installed to if you go there. calculating even for corp standings and etc."
1/27/2009,"not a bad idea. it'd probably be better through the jump clone menu than as a map layer(especially since that way you can go straight to the station), but yeah, it can work. might be laggy, but worth looking into. also, i'm getting scared. this is like five consecutive jason edwards threads i've supported. i'm hoping it's because you've gotten bored of trolling, not because you've gotten good at it, but still."
1/27/2009,"why not a list of jumpclones you have installed? i could have used that several times now.anyway, more information is good."

1/27/2009,"dear csm.i think we are a few pen and paper players in eve.i would like to point out that there is an inherent flaw in philosophy in the game and development of it..the problem is what is the pride of eve the single shard world.when creating content or events you can not be fair and you can not let things be repeatet.if you created a campaign like scenario and you want it to be remebered and motivate players to be more proactive, you have to be unfair..you have to drop an early t2 print in the hands of someone to give them an advantage. you have to be willing to risk messing up the powerbalance.also there is a solution to making this seem more fair. make all content based on unique and highly complex and connected natures.also be willing to shift things using things like npc corp standings and economy. dont nerf thing but change them deliberatly..a lot of gaming experience can be created using these rather simple content seed methods..just my 2 isk.its just kind of funny that the t2 ""mistake"" is historic, while a lot of aurora work never even gets related inside corps post facto.."
1/27/2009,are you actually proposing something or are you just playing your small fiddle?
1/27/2009,"yes. that ccp should not be to scared of being a bit unfair. i would find it much more immersive with a new t20 incidence, than some grind away solution catering to everyone.funny thing is that stuff has a way of finding its way into the right hands. so be unfair, make the events hard complex big or downright power distrubition meddling..good gms arent sweet.. they are bad ass.oh and it would be cool with wandering jovians. knowing they are wastly superior techwise, it would be fun to see if players would observe or try to engage them.. their could be awesome, but based on biological systems they decay over a few weeks of use. this could make some interesting side effects.."
1/27/2009,"seriously drake, you're the troll here and i would suggest you just stop now. whilst the op is rather ridiculous in my opinion, they do at least have the right to bring up this subject. if it gets no support, then it'll just die away. let that process take place.c&p, as you so eloquently say, is thataway"
1/27/2009,if you can name one valid reason for this thread to exist in this forum ill retract my reason.provided this reason is for the benefit of eve online and how the game mechanics behave.yep... that's what i thought.
1/27/2009,wtf???this post has nothing at all to do with eve online.... why in the world are you defending thislol?
1/27/2009,i rest my case.ps: and if any of you smart asses decide to bring up the fact eve is not mentioned... you seriously need your head examined.
1/27/2009,then why in the world are you supporting the subject? lol
1/27/2009,then why in the world are you supporting the subject? lolhell i didn't even support it and i posted it!
1/27/2009,apparently u didnt read my post very well or u dont know very much about other online games.second life is a hugely succesful game that trades their own virtual currency for real life ones.its so succesful that government agencies actually buy online virtual properties there so ppl visit their online museums and stuff. also banks and other commercial institutions buy property there. one real estate lady managed to make 1 million real life dollars just selling dam virtual properties to pplso if tat game can b so hugely succesful so can evelet ppl buy/sell eve items in real life
1/27/2009,"rmt is already in this game. you can buy ships, characters, implants etc with real money perfectly legally, but ccp only has made it illegal to gain too much rl money with ingame farming."
1/27/2009,did you bother to use spell checking? or are you just a kid banging away at the keyboard.oh and this is eve online... not second life.
1/27/2009,"one of the main reasons for prohibiting rmt - liability.if you assign a given value to in-game currency or, thereby, items, they become a legislation nightmare. in second life, it's alright, as the game isn't really cruel like eve is.if a player lost a titan to pvp, he could sue the people who attacked him for destruction of private property. likewise, you would have to pay taxes on items in the game, and you could list it as employment, ad nauseum.another reason - intellectual property.second life is unique in that it allows people to have possessions of the items they create in game. they do the coding for the items in the game language, then that code becomes their copyright.in eve, there's no coding. if they gave you intellectual property rights on the items available in game, they lose their rights to them. it may seem like a control tactic, but it's well within their rights to do this, and is probably a very wise decision given the type of game eve is.if you have more dollars than sense and want to buy stuff in a game, play second life or one of the other games that allow it. if you want a game that requires some thought to play and master without giving the upper hand to those with more rl money, play eve."

1/27/2009,"i agrea that smartbombs need a little loving. but we must be careful not to kill off all small taclers and all drones while we are at it. i allso think that micro(2km)/small(3km)/med(4km) t2 smartbombs should have +1km extra range just like the large t2 smartbomb and the faction smartbombs should be tweaked accordingly. btw has anyone actually ever used micro/small smartbombs as it is?i have a small suggestion and i hope you guys like it.new shiptype tier2 destroyer.destroyer skill bonus: +10% to smartbomb range, -10% to smartbomb capacitor use.penalty: -25% damage to non-racial smartbombs.bonus: +50% smartbomb range.slots: low/med/high - racial smartbomb.amarr:5/2/6 - empcaldari:2/5/6 - gravitongallente:4/3/6 - plasmaminmatar:3/4/6 - protonmaximum range for the destroyer with small t2(4km) smartbombs would be 9km. allso since the destroyer would never be able to fit a medium smartbomb it would be limited to less damage output than a regular tier1 detroyer but it would be a better tackler. this is a ship that would be good in close combat but would be doomed in med-long range combat. if range on micro/small/medium smartbombs isnt boosted then i think a +100% bonus to range would be needed for the ship.i think this would actually benefit eve in many ways.it would show that smartbombs are getting some loving.it would give the destroyer class a new tech1 ship that is long overdue.it might be a counter to droneswarms.it might be a ship that would be useful to hunt down slow cloakers.the role of the ship would be twofold.#1 to assist in hunting down heavy/slow cloakers.#2 to counter droneswarms.#3 chase off small tacklersdestroyer shiptype has historically been used in asw, now in eve it could be acw (anti-cloacker warfare)this ship would haveto be used carefully, you dont want to kill friendly drones/ships.some additional thoughts:might be cool to add a smartbomb that would maybe give small ammount of damage to all damage types and +50% range that could be useful to hunting down cloakers.make ecm burst modules a part of the smartbomb family (or make the destroyer bonuses apply to them as well) and then we suddenly have a destroyer that can be useful as a ew ship as well."
1/27/2009,"have you tried catching a pod or frigate on a gate in lowsec? it's damn near impossible to catch a cruiser! you have to have a ship small enough to have a high scan res, but big enough to tank the guns.i guess the counter argument is in order, is it right for pods, frigates, and cruisers to get away without any chance of being caught?"
1/27/2009,there's always a chance in catching them.it's called interceptors.
1/27/2009,"i've said for a long while it's time smartbombs had their revision, every other weapon system has. i also like the idea of being able to use them in an ""indiscriminate"" mode, it's highly frustrating fighting in 0.0 and ending up just inside 5km of a gate, thus unable to use the smartbomb..."

1/27/2009,if you look at the stats.it has 1 medium slot.ab vs mwd vs web vs scram. what's the choice? this seems pretty out in left field tbh.should have 2 mid slots; in my opinion.what say you?
1/27/2009,"yes it should.and while we're at it, the omen could use a little bit more powergrid and cpu as well."
1/27/2009,there is already a thread on this from last week.my choice is ab...and also not to change the ship.
1/27/2009,"i've been seeing a fair number of threads recently about ecm, and it's prompted me to do a bit of brainstorming. one of the things i've noticed about ecm is that it leaves the targeted player with no recourse or action. once jammed, that's it. the player can no longer do anything in the fight, period. which quite simply leads to a lot of frustration.the primary goal of any ecm changes should be to allow the targeted player options to deal with being jammed, without making the ecm or targeted player wholly useless.here are my alternative suggestions on ecm mechanics:overview/hud- first and foremost, the player has to know that he is being scrambled in a visual manner. i suggest some kind of distortion effect, as well as the normal jamming bar. nothing too significant though, it needs to be subtle and obvious at the same time.- enemies randomly appear blue, friendlies randomly appear red, and both randomly appear neutral. [or perhaps all ships become neutral.]- speed/distance/angular velocity/ship type/etc. are scrambled and output randomly. so an enemy dominix might, in reality, be 5km's away, but your overview says he's a typhoon, 20km's away, friendly, and traveling away from you at 300m/s with an angular velocity of 0.1211. the ship will still visually appear to be exactly where it is, only the overview readouts are changed.- chat channels are disabled at random intervals.- the damage readout is scrambled, making it impossible to know how much health you actually have left. one minute your readout is saying you're at 70% hull, and the next it says you're at 90% armor.- a small chance [say 1% per level, determined by the skill of the ecm pilot] of a module on the targeted ship being randomly turned on or off/overheated etc.ecm modules- turreted. in order to hit a target with ecm, the turrets need to be able to focus their jammers on it. this form of ecm module is long-range- include alternative ecm modules that have a shorter range than the turreted versions, but utilize an area of effect [say 30km's base] like smartbombs. they don't need to track their targets, but they do need to be within area of effect range. this close-range jamming effects all ships within the area of effect, including neutrals, but not including friendlies. instead of just effecting the locked targets.- allow friendly ecm ships to counter this with their own close-range ecm modules. overall ecm strength is compared, whichever side has the strongest ecm within a given aoe is the side that wins out.eccm modules- targeting bonus against ecm ships that are disabling you.- reduce the effects of ecm. so with an eccm module fitted you may still have problems with your overview, but your damage readout will be fine.fleet- jammed ships randomly show up blue/neutral/red to other players. [might be potentially exploitable for griefing.]- jammed ships lose all fleet bonuses they might otherwise be receiving. [except direct stuff: remote repairs, etc.]"
1/27/2009,i just hope ambulation introduces a use for dancing girls and slaves
1/27/2009,"i half and half support/don't support this.i like the idea that a player should be able to 'visit' a bar from across the eve cluster. i do not agree that they should be a holoprojection that can walk around and interact with people or things as normal. [nevermind the mind-boggling number of physical laws this would violate.]my suggestion:when connecting to a bar you are doing so through a terminal/display only. either you show up on a screen, or as a holoprojection on a table. [cue holo-stripper services] no more, no less. viewpoints for you will be fixed or have a limited field of view, since you're observing from a camera. my biggest concern is that this will result in people aggregating in a handful of major bars, instead of sticking with the bar at whatever station they happen to be in.were it up to me, i would just leave it as ccp's shown so far. you can enter the bars in your station, and that's it. if you want to be in a bar in jita, then you'll have to fly over there to do so."
1/27/2009,"wormholes are well and good, but these could use some loving:gravimetric/ladar - take quite a while and are only worth it in unsafe space, that's fine, but why there is no deadspace probing protection on these? you spend hours to find the belt but after that any noob with a probe launcher can land in 0 on your bigass defenceless mining ship.radar - now the only worthwhile thing in them are decryptors and ship interface bpcs. interface parts drop in abundance, data and tuner blueprints are common -> cheap. encryption skillbooks are one-time purchase.proposed boosts:adjust size of interface pieces to 0.01-0.05 they all go into 1 m3 interface after all.damage interfaces with each invention run, not much, so it could last for thousand(s) jobsdrop other invention science skillbooks besides encryption.magnetometric - in most cases you find a site and get some salvage, whoopee, if you ran a lvl 4 mission you probably got more of it in same time. t2 rig bpc when lucky, but not the parts to build it.proposed boost:drop only t2 salvage in small quantities, no t1 salvage."
1/27/2009,lol thanks.. its not content management.. or wait a minute.. it sort of is..
1/27/2009,ya if you can overload a trader... you have so many alts feeding it... that you might as well train one of those alts to start doing the trading also.i have 29 max trading and i have never hit my limit lol.
1/27/2009,i'm not an economist but if players didn't have a limitto their buy/sell orders couldn't a player/corp/alliance start making single item buy orders at extreme lowball prices to artificially shift regional average calculations to manipulate the market?
1/27/2009,um no? no change because currently you can do that with just 1 order.you want to sell your vexors at 6mil? but that'll look like it's 20% above average?set 1 vexor at 100mil. train your skills to make tax nearly nothing. have an alt buy it @ 100mil. average will then jump up.want to buy vexors at 4mil? but that'll look like it's 20% below average.find a station in ur region that doesnt have any buy orders in range. put up buy orders for 1 isk. have alt sell them in that station. drop goes the average.
1/27/2009,"as jason points out manipulation is not something that is linked to the number of orders available.even most normal daytrading is more than possible with a really low skill level and number of orders.the only advantage really to the big order books is that you can invest long term and on an extreme number of items. gamewise that would mean that everything would be tradable and most likely traded in regions. as it is now even maxed out traders have to limit their traded items, and if you also want to add pseudo automated features like moving prices, then you have no chance of spreading out your business.the advantages of many more orders in scc are many, and not all is easy to predict atm.i do however know that manipulation of averages would be easier to fix.donchian channels would be more usefull, because many orders would mean many unique trades and thus a higher resolution of graph movements.pseudo automation. stacking orders of different volumes and prices would mean you could and would change your bid over time, no matter when the orders filled. in other words less time would be needed changing orders. this would make order book changes less frequent and hopefully mean less updates with servers, and thus less lag issue.the only problem would be to many orders showing at once. there is a rather easy fix for this. let the servers sort and stack these, and maybe let skill level give access to viewing the composition of the stacks. this would also add advantage to high skilled traders without leaving the lower skilled totally out of the loop..the number of stacks sorted into would be based on station quality and trade volume per day. inside the stacks the orders would naturally sort by price and time.it would also be extremely nice if we could somehow have a tool for visualizing order ranges and price in a map. to see the overlaps etc.in my opinion we also should somehow get statistics on the names and corps of the traders post facto. so we can see who has historically traded items. at least the corps should be shown."
1/27/2009,"the average price is the average price of trades, not of orders. go look at the buy-order prices of rare ships in unimportant regions - the top price for marauders is usually about 100 isk, for example, and they're buying a thousand of them. average is still several hundred million."
1/27/2009,"if you are looking for a duel in new eden today, you are pretty much waiving a flag to players that says ""gang-bang me if you so wish."" sorry, i'm not gonna put my pricey powerhouse ships on the line with that possibility. we could duel in small ships and not be too p!ssed off if we get screwed over, but thats not really all that appealing either. if you wanna duel someone, you're not going to bring some half-a<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> ships to the fight. i would have no qualms bringing out these ships to see how they fare against others if there wasn't a risk of r@pe involved. especially if there was a bet involved for the people against this argument, i understand that they want the system to bet left open and have the risk factor involved, but i strongly believe that this is preventing many people from having these battles all together.why interfere with the quest for others to have these battles, when you are free to catch anyone by surprise and take advantage of them in low sec? isn't that part of the reason why we have these two main regions?"

1/27/2009,"+1[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic."
1/27/2009,"my solution to this and other similar problems:if your in an npc corp you can't loot from, salvage from, take from a can/wreck that you didn't create/kill, period. it will pop up a warning that you have to be in a player corp to do those actions. once in a player corp you can do everything you currently do except now the person your ""stealing"" from has the option to war dec your corp.doesn't break ccp's intention that materials that require skill has no ownership. provides some incentive for people to leave the npc corps (although i think after a specified amount of skill they should be forced to leave, but thats another topic.) provides a way for people being victimized by this to exact revenge."
1/27/2009,it feels crowded in places like jita but on the whole the universe is a big place.it would be great to see ccp put more into the game that intices new players (like me) out of empire and into zerozero.
1/27/2009,what use is the csm if it cant discuss specifics? you just become another tool of ccp spouting great pr about how they are 'listening' and being 'proactive' about these kinds of things.
1/27/2009,"if you had bothered to read the minutes, you would note that ccp is going to be releasing a dev-blog by the end of this month/start of february with most of the information we were given.once that dev-blog is out we can discuss it."

1/27/2009,":) please read and think before quoting this. :) note the use of intelligent conversation below:) also note freedom of speech:) re-read the above and then continuethat's your opinion, i guess. and you did begin...fair enough - windows does seem to kop the nastiest bugs, or is in the press for it at least. the point i wanted to make with this example is that it was an exploit that came in though a picture file - something which people do not associate with a security breach normally. the point i was making was that sometimes an innocent or basic graphics object can present a security flaw. hopefully i do not need to further connect this example to the topic in discussion. hint: the use of the word ""example"" above means that it is an example and not a direct comparison. i am totally aware of the differences between this example and a winamp skin.effectively, yes. this could be possible. im not saying it has happened or will happen but simply that it could. people often play down the concept of security and bugs because they beleive that it ""simply couldnt happen to them"" or think ""a winamp skin that hacks your pc, that's sounds so crazy it could never ever happen"". it probably wouldnt but, like i said, it could do. my other point was that it could make the game unfair if certain skins gave an advantage or disadvantage based upon speed of interaction or interface.i am also not saying that ccp shouldnt make an open gui for this reason, merely speculating on why they may have chosen not to.yeah, i agree with this.fair points.im not sure what you're saying here? i think we have both made valid points. i'm also not post"
1/28/2009,"just to clarify, spock is not an alt of mine, he's actually my roommate, and we were having a discussion about this and came across a snag involving implementing the item-tabbing idea in the assets window. we're not really sure how best to do it and were wondering if anyone had any ideas.my idea: have the item-tabs carry over directly onto the assets window, where you will have a series of tabs at the top representing the item-tabs you have in your inventory, and the list of items beneath it will correspond only to those items in those tabs.his idea: change the assets window to look more like the market, where you have the assets all the way on the left of the window (much like the categories of items for sale), and then the main item viewing screen would simply be like the item hangar with the tabs across the top.both of these fit quite nicely with the tabs but what do you guys think would be best? now that this is all typed i actually think i'm leaning towards spock's idea but this would require revamping of the assets window. let me know what you guys think."
1/28/2009,"having an inventory that had sortable options and tabs just like the overview would be very nice.it would be nice to be able to create specific columns showing relevant data like meta level and quick sell/buy price with the color coded good or bad option and the whole nine yards.i realize that its the overview that earned eve the ""excel in space"" moniker but your cargo hold, items, and ships need the ""excel in space"" design."
1/28/2009,heck yeah./signed
1/28/2009,too much hassle especially for new players forgetting what went where. just rent a corp hangar or use a station container; it's not like you will need tabs for every station where you have items.
1/28/2009,i am fresh out of clues buddy sorry.
1/28/2009,this is a change that would only benifit everyone ......... something i am hoping we see in the very near future
1/28/2009,"i'm all for it, but some things come to mind that make it more than ""simple"".what hangar do you look into when using the ""corp hangar -> members hangars""? does someone with the rights get to see all of your personal hangars or just the first one? should that be configurable? should players get a ""delivery"" hangar for this purpose? (i would assume market/contract purchases as well, just like a corp delivery hangar.)while it lasted (damn those db lags!) the filter function on containers was nice.the partition idea is nice, but there has to be some limit to nesting. otherwise some fool is going to take 1000 of them and store everything down at the bottom 1000th level. i've no idea what that would do to the db/lag, but it doesn't sound like a good idea.i wouldn't mind having huge non-audit log containers, i second that suggestion as well. (station <whatevers>). i don't think i've even looked at a personal log for one of them, and would turn that off if i could. i shuffle stuff around all the time, and no password - no log - no locking would be nice for my personal hangars.if we are getting a revamp, why not ask for more than 7 for personal and corp? 16 would be a better start imo, or 32, or better yet a configurable number up to 100 perhaps? (1000-1099 for the api) [side note, any adjustment in quantity also means working on the corp management screen... as well as new ui screens/right click menus for the player tabs.]"

1/28/2009,oops... accidentally posted with my alt ^^
1/28/2009,this is just wrong
1/28/2009,"this was my original post:since you found the blog, you also found the interaction between myself and ccp gms documenting it all. the problem is we played that game for minimum of 5 months. was invited to play by the rats, followed clues provided by them in the ships logs. when we found the wormhole a particular device was required to stabilize(see tab on image of wormhole as i went through). i went away for holiday and when i returned ccp had taken the logs out. the clue to the last thing we needed to claim the prize and wormhole was taken out. i petitioned ccp for a copy of the clue database or an indication of how close we had gotten to obtaining the prize. the rest is self-explanatory.the gm had us continue and report our findings to him as we went as documented. we did everything asked, we even took screenshots of items as we found them, the other end of the wormhole, screenshot of it's destruction to prevent someone else claiming it in our stead while ccp debated how to deal with this. we don't demand anything other than acknowledgment that we played the ""wormhole game"". if it truely was plexes, prove it - let someone else, you for example run these same plexes and let's compare db's and screenshots!my point, why would they take the loot / drops / devices / etc. if that game did not exist? why has no one talked to those involved? all of a sudden that game is coming 03/2009."

1/28/2009,"i'm pretty sure this issue is already closed and forgotten. ccp knows that no matter what bad decisions they make, if they ride out the storm for 2 months - they get away clean. the player base is quick to forget"
1/28/2009,"oops see this was already posted as local cache idea, still seems like a good idea though. <<=== edited to add i wasn't looking at this from the scamming point of view just the convienience when i look at my own hangar(i'm a horrible pack rat). i suppose you could make the boundary only show up when your looking at stuff in your or your corps hangars. seems overly complex though and might require difficult coding. hrmmm, i still want that boundary. well, we already have to set up overviews wherever we play, why not assign color coded boundaries as an option also? that way if you don't want to do it you don't have to, but your stuff could be coded to your liking and only you view it that way. everybody else still has to look at info to see if it's an original or a copy."
1/28/2009,"not sure of the details, but i've never liked the tracking formula. it's always seemed incomplete."
1/28/2009,up!
1/28/2009,"i support this, however i didn't agree with your 'shrinking' hypothesis.i think that the current tracking system relies on you hitting a 'target' point on a ship that is directly proportional to the signature radius. this allows us to imagine all ships as being points. ship velocity causes the points to move, and increased distance translates to less deviation with increased distance. when the ship is up close, the relative movement of the 'target' point is harder to align to as movement translates to larger deviation.i am no expert on programming, but i think we can appreciate that 'upgrading' the tracking formula would require all calculations to take into account a more 'accurate' shape of the ship, and thus calculating hits/misses might become far more demanding. thus my support is for the idea, but i raise questions about the practicality."
1/28/2009,"they key word is 'effectively' - as far as the tracking formula is concerned the angle subtended by a target remains the same at all ranges (signature radius is a fixed number). the only way that can happen if you half the distance, is to half the arc length.*shrug* it's merely a way of illustrating the problem of size vs. distance not being accounted for. in a way, you can think of the 0m 'bug' being as a result of this problem; it occurs because as far as the tracking formula is concerned, at 0m your target is infinitesimally small, you can never hit it."
1/28/2009,indeed - this is how it should work/supported
1/28/2009,"i support this proposal. does this mean when you are at 0m range, you'll always hit?"
1/28/2009,"lets try to keep the key word ""realistic"" first.the objects size should be a factor.. if your flying an interceptor around my malestrom and i lay into you with 8 1400mm cannons at point blank range do you really wana feel the full brunt of that strike?obviously unrealistic... maybe you'll get clipped every so often.. like 1 out of 50 shots : o pbut if your a battelcruiser.... the odds of nailing that ship should be far higher than a frigate.that...is the key. or one of them at least."
1/28/2009,"im all for this fix, but also this would make missiles ""explosion"" tracking even worse than gun tracking.not that guns arent already better for pvp than missiles in most instances"
1/28/2009,"your entire idea is based on the false premise that tracking is supposed to equate to reality.game mechanics are not designed to simulate reality!please try re-drafting your proposal to address a problem with game mechanics, and not try to create a space simulator. eve is so far from a realistic space simulator that we would need to bin the entire game to head in that direction."
1/28/2009,there are portions of the game that relate very much to reality and there are portions that don't.what is wrong with adding bits and pieces of reality of it makes the game better?
1/28/2009,"my idea (as i stated in the op), is based around the problem of close-range gun tracking; specifically, because of the aforementioned flaw, close-range turrets are more heavily penalised at their optimal ranges compared to long range turrets. close-range turret tracking cannot be significantly boosted because it would overpower them with longer range ammo, so instead i'm posting ideas of how to attack the problem at very close ranges only. now, i think the change in webs was a good thing, as it makes combat more fluid, it's actually possible to dive in and out of web range in frigates now. i'm not proposing to go back to how it previously was with 90% webs, but to fix the tracking formula so that close range ships, particularly the bigger ones, can function better at their optimal (for autocannons and blasters we are talking sub-5km here) without removing frigates new found role in being able to close with the big ships..."
1/28/2009,how are they more heavily penalised at their opperational range?having 4x better base tracking isn't enough? 4x tracking is enough to take a 6% chance to hit up to a 84% chance to hit. how much of a tracking advantage do you expect short range turrets to have?how would your proposed changes affect the usage of long range turrets at short range?
1/28/2009,"i totally support this, 11 slots sucks! i want to be able to do more, i don't want more characters to use to do what one should be able to do with invested time."
1/28/2009,"this is a proposal to add some security changes to corporate science and industry jobs in addition to changes to the output and input location for a corporate job.in essence right now it is possible that if given builder rights any one person can cancel any one job. there is no security break down allowing the installation of a job, but requiring intervention for the completion of that job or at a very minimum only allowing the installer, director, or ceo to deliver the item.it is proposed that this be changed to only allow either the installer or a higher security level to deliver or cancel the science or industry job.in addition, it is also requested that the input/output location possibilities for corporate jobs have added to them the personal hangars of corporate members. meaning using say a locked down print in high security, i can select my personal hangar as the source for mats and my personal hangar for the output.this was brought up in the market discussion forum regarding a cooperative business plan between parties wanting to pool assets together, but maintain singularity in actual operation of those assets. you can find the discussion here"

1/28/2009,vigorous thumbs up for restricting cancel & delivery options and addition of personal hangar to both input and output of factory jobs.this is sorely needed.with current mechanics there is absolutely zero reason for industrialists to join player corps vs. flying solo. these mechanics would allow for newer players to provide value to established manufacturing organizations.
1/28/2009,"you've seen concord pop a pod for aggression? no? right.you did give me pause for thought, however, from the fact that now, people would now be able to exploit this (much like the lofty) whereby they could blow up a cheap ship with a lot of ordinance of a 'friendly' war target they're working with, and then work together to loot the other shipwrecks caused in the wake of the explosion.i like it."

1/28/2009,"lolcould be. i actually think that, if this mechanic was imposed, you would be amazed by the vast majority of traders clicking the little check-box, in their wallet settings that says, ""all sales to individuals, currently under a declaration of war are strictly prohibited, by the seller"". especially after a couple, inadvertent lapses... oh and 0 of 223 simply means that there are a lot of pussies playing this game."
1/28/2009,??? not sure i get your meaning.
1/28/2009,lets get goonswarm to wardec everyone.. then sit back and watch what happens to the market.
1/28/2009,"drake, you do realize that you have an option in your auto-pilot settings that enables you to, if at all possible, avoid entering certain systems, right?now and please bear with me on this, what if you had a similar type of mechanism in your wallet that allowed for a seller to avoid selling to certain individuals under certain, specific conditions.what do you say to a player that inadvertently failed to set his auto-pilot settings, subsequently lost his ship to a lo-sec gate camp and then petitioned the loss because he didn't mean to jump into lo-sec?get it?oh and once again, do you think that traders that, in spite of the inherent riskiness of the proposition, actually choose to sell to combatants wouldn't be in a somewhat better position to actually expect and receive a premium for their services?possibly a new career as a war-profiteer?"
1/28/2009,"that would be epic, the stuff of eve legend, imo, but i doubt it would, in reality, actually happen. we can only hope..."
1/28/2009,i give up... this person is offically terminally stupid.
1/28/2009,"so what you actually want is all traders to check the little box thus preventing certain corps and alliances that specialise in war deccing people from ever buying anything at a reasonable price again the irony is, if you'd have just said that, you'd probably get a lot more support lol captain thunk"
1/28/2009,why not?nothing is stopping those corps/alliances from actually developing there own support system.
1/28/2009,"looking at how well received this thread is, there's no need to develop a support system.still, i like you, you're a pretty funny guy.hitme up ingame and we can negotiate your current war dec situation if it's bothering you that much captain thunk"
1/28/2009,there's a big difference from blacklisting corps on the market as opposed to penalizing the whole damn universe.i don't have a problem with a blacklist provided its controlled by the vast population.only draw back is people who are in the business of trading aren't likely to give a damn as they are there to make money... they don't care who blows away what.

1/28/2009,"this is an idea i had that could address a variety of issues and make the game world seem even more dynamic (already one of the most awesome things about eve).the idea is this: that the (true) security status of a system, 0.0 or empire, be made dynamic. but what would affect it?-ratting. when players kill npc pirates in a system, they contribute to that system's security. more ratters, more secure, higher sec status, rats become more scarce. conversely, fewer ratters, npc pirate factions start to gain control, sec status goes down, bigger rats show up.-market activity. when players trade in a system, concord sees that it is important to police said system. if they don't, concord doesn't really care what goes on there.-player activity. similar to market activity, but this could be done for all activities - even docking up could make a (extremely minute) change to the system's sec status.-player piracy (and suicide ganking). if many players kill each other in a system, concord might decide that system is more work to police than it is worth. the sec would go down.this could be implemented just like that, or some more restrictions could be added, such as the following:-0.0/empire boundary. the empires care more about soverign space so they might not change their borders. so while the truesec decreased (maybe even below 0.0, giving new meaning to the boundary of empire space), the sec status hits and other hallmarks of lowsec would not disappear. similarly, 0.0 could not become lowsec. only rats would change once the sec changed past 0.0.-highsec/lowsec. this could also be made static, similar to the above.-asteroids. these might or might not change as truesec changed.the benefits:-game world becomes more dynamic. this is mostly just because dynamic worlds are awesome, but it might also have other benefits.-hurts farmers. farm rats in the same system for too long, those rats won't be quite as juicy. moving around is more beneficial.-0.0. this gives alliances some benefits to ""policing"" their space. not sure exactly what this would entail, as i'm not personally experienced in 0.0.feel free to post comments (constructive criticism is appreciated more than thumbs up or down) and sorry to mapmakers for proposing to mess with the maps.and remember this is just my 0.02 isk - no need to kill me if there's something i didn't think of."
1/28/2009,"supporting... ccp, please at least get rid of the checkbox if you can't support in the op."
1/28/2009,very cool idea you've got going here. it seems like it would be extremely hard to impliment and that there would be a lot more problems with this below the surface but i definatly would think that it would make eve more fun and with plenty of change.
1/28/2009,"i like the principle, and i think it could work well in 0.0, but if you start doing this in empire you'll raise holy hell. there a real meaning to the 0.5/0.4, 0.4/0.3, and 0.1/0.0 boundaries, and it's the sort of thing you can't really mess with too effectively. what happens if you anchor a moon mining station in 0.3 space, and then the sec status raises itself to 0.4? what happens if concord hq goes to 0.4? do empires suddenly uproot their guns and drop sovereignty claims if a 0.1 goes to 0.0? as i say, it's nifty, but it seems a bit too fraught with issues to really be workable."
1/28/2009,"i believe that the sec status he is referring to is the true sec, not the status displayed. it would still be a 0.0 system, but because of all the ratting taking place, the spawns get crappier as the true sec rises. i could really only see this affecting spawns in a given system/region, like exploration sites and rats. i'll support it, even if it will make the things i do to help support our corp/alliance pvp harder!edit: as i reread the op, more ideas. if a high sec system is slow due to low trading, little population, no activity, that would lower the true sec and affect the concord response time to any altercations as well. it is still an 0.5 system, but as nothing goes on there, the true sec gets closer to 0.4 (not ever reaching it though) and if you gank/get ganked, concord responds slower as they don't have the presence nearby to respond quickly. but as i type this i can quickly see probs with this that would require major mechanics changes, so, maybe not....."
1/28/2009,/supported.
1/28/2009,"yeah, i was trying to figure out how to fix it. i think the best way might be to detach a system's shown sec from truesec - make shown sec fixed so concord penalties and pos anchorability don't change, but make rats and roids change. alternately, doing it only in 0.0 would work."
1/28/2009,"i support it. hereon won't code it, so minor issues are of no concern to me. if ccp is fond of the concept of more dynamic space, they will find their own way to do it. this here is more about whether or not they should be poked about it."
1/28/2009,"the choas factor is intriguing but would ruin high sec at best.although the ""status quo"" affect that plagues much of high sec would abruptly make life interesting.i'm torn on the idea. : o /would make the game rather realistic."
1/28/2009,bad idea
1/28/2009,"dynamic standing is an excellent idea.personally i think the standing system needs a bit of tweaking generally. would like to be able to see npc to pc corp standings, maybe just daily updates posted at downtime.a small addition. i think player corps standing towards concord and npc corps towards concord should make up a systems security rating. this would maybe be the simplest way to implement all of the ideas you mention.if a system is populated by a number of npc station head quarters and player headquarters, these should just be added together to give the total security rating of the system.for this to work standing in corps should need to be calculated on a better weighted method. i would think an easy solve would be to take membership time into the calculation. so older corp members weighed higher in calculating corp standing.just my 0,01 isk.."
1/28/2009,"i don't claim to have a final, polished idea. as i said, it could be done while ""locking"" which systems are high/low/null sec. or something in between."
1/28/2009,"i support this idea, it would make more sense that navy ships just have better strength, but a ship that splits bonuses, requirements, and many times fittings should have split sensors also."
1/28/2009,edit to add support that sounds like it would actually make faction ships more useful in pvp. compared to risk of loosing the thing.
1/28/2009,yes.
1/28/2009,"npc corps exist, despite a lot of hatred for them, because people should be free to choose a player corp or not. there are virtually no downsides to being in an npc corporation and ccp has kept it that way. pos ownership is the only one i can think of and since npc corps intent is to serve casual players then owning a pos isn't something a casual player is going to do on his/her own. casual players don't have alts. casual players don't spend 20+ hours a week on the game. outside of that that player should have as much chance of success as i do. it's called a sand box for a reason.player content can't be balanced which is why it will never see the light of day in eve. player control and interaction is the only sandbox part of the game and will remain so. the second someone tells me that i needed to be on at such and such time one some day and i didn't so they are docking my pay they are going to get a face full of antimatter. 99% of eve players will do the same. sorry that kind of stupidity wont work in a game like eve.eve should and most of the time is rock, paper, scissors not where the hell is my tps reports! my salary, vitality, and social acceptance have been earned at the end of my 425's.i have no idea what the hell game you have been playing."
1/28/2009,"well i certainly hope not. not only do i disagree with the few ideas you finally suggested, you took several posts to even bring them up. your initial post was nearly 700 words (672 i think when i ran it through a counter for the lolz) and there wasn't a single coherant idea proposed. i don't just disagree with your economic simulator vision for eve, i disagree with your sloppy, haphazard method of proposing any of the seemingly limitless ideas you seem to have."
1/28/2009,"since you have such eloquent arguments i asume the reason is you prefer the world mechanics turned a bit upside down. that way you can be sure most things in eve dont transport into real life application, and ...i have to point out that if eve keeps growing this will eventually become a bigger issue. also it is rather unique that eve is the only semifunctional game economy due to the fact that players govern it almost 100%. this is why it gets coverage in the financial times. i am rather convinced this is worth building on.speaking from some experience in pen and paper and even in here, it is a fact that good things arent always what the majority would wish for. economy is a borring topic to most and thus have gotten a rather low priority at least feature and balance wise.if the above is so ridiculous it would be nice to have some arguments to shoot down my claim."
1/28/2009,"heres my argument, in my every day life, i don't unhook from my jelly-filled pod, sync up my attribute implants to choose what skill i have passively downloaded into my brain, and then pop over to a corporation agent to pick up a death-defying mission to take on 100 pirates in outerspace. in a frakking space ship.what part of this game has to translate to real life?if i wanted everything to translate, i wouldn't bother with eve. again - my main problem with your post is your lack of organization. post a thread about one thing you'd propose changed, instead of starting one with a vague 600 word diatribe with no discernable suggestions, or issues.i'm all for waxing philisophical about how the game might encounter problems as it expands based on the current economical model, i'm not for vague, bumbling, sloppy crap like this bumping viable, useful idea threads to page 2, and giving them less exposure.so theres my argument again. either you're not reading, not understanding, or you're trolling.*edit*here are a few of those threads i mentioned, whether i support them or not.123*edited again*i don't care if you see this or not, i'm not giving you another free bump. this topic is markec [issue] not discussion. so your defense is null. you're right, you were derailed, by yourself, not me. no one has signed in support, and i doubt that was entirely my fault."
1/28/2009,"i personally find it useless to suggest a specific idea unless its extremely simple.the topic i am touching upon is not even close to simple. that is why i bring it up as a discussion and not as a specific idea.i dont have the inside knowledge about statistics of player behaviour and the economy.i can only see some of the effects of them indirectly. this is the issue i am trying to have a discussion on.i tend to see things a bit different as you might have noticed in one of the threads you linked to. i not only supported the issue i pointed out how much more was in the idea then the short description of the original poster. you might not approve of that style of posting, but i hope that some of the elaborations there just might get some players attention, that might otherwise find the suggestion simple and irrelevant.if your sole reason for changing the tone of this post was to undermine the issue i have to admit you might have been successful."
1/28/2009,k i s sand so far no one knows what the hell your talking about because your issue got buried back there in the last 1000 words.i still don't see your point other than ranting about npc corps... is that it?
1/28/2009,yes please..and with afk timer (not in local naturally)
1/28/2009,"it would be extremely useful if players could apply some custom filters to their view of local chat, at least on the client side.i can understand a standard format originating with the server, but alphabetical is about the least useful of the many ways that the information could be presented.for example: why, in a very busy system, is a wartarget whose name begins with the letter z buried at the bottom of a long scroll list while a 2-day old newbie character that i have absolutely no interest in, but whose name begins with a, sits right there at the top?the ability to sort by threat level/standings/corp/fleet/alliance etc. would allow the individual players to prioritize the information efficiently and logically.thank you,reliq narsdep"
1/28/2009,"sorry for starting a new thread but the primary thread is locked. i was thinking about an alert level bar that is based on the systems security rating and responded to by the navy of the sovereignty and concord in extreme cases. say the system is .4 but is .432 in actuality. well thats .068 from the assumed .5 barrier even though thats not exactly correct lets call it that for simplicity sake. that means there are 68 points in the meter. an aggressive act is going to be almost immediately responded to but that response is scaled by the security rating of the system and the percentage of the meter that is full. the initial response time could be something like 1/5th or 1/10th of the meter time or in this case anywhere from 13.6 to 6.8 seconds. assign a point value to the aggressive act and assign a point value to destroying a players ship by another player that isnt participating in a concord sanctioned war. if the system is very peaceful, low or empty meter, at the time of the act the response will be light. however, the aggressor should keep in mind that he/she could be faced with an unknown foe or foes. this time you might get a battle cruiser but next time you might get webbed and jammed by frigates and set upon by cruisers. this example, not being that bad, is fine unless that pilot you just ganked is looking for revenge. destroying the security force adds to the alert bar which also effects the reaction time of the next wave of security forces. if the act of aggression was 5 points, you killed a cruiser that added another 5 points, and then you killed 3 security frigates and a cruiser worth 2 and 4 points each respectively you have now added 20 points to the bar that only has 68 in it. well you now have 48 seconds to get out of town, try to dock, or brace for another wave. there would need to be a cool down timer before the points start to tick off. that timer could literally the same timer as the response timer or maybe half that. then a system will never stay truly maxed out but the time, unless you fight endlessly, may or may not tick away in seconds but slower to deter prairie dogging behavior. that timer is also not player specific but affects the whole system. so if you, another pirate, and a can flipper all trigger at the same time, you might suddenly be in for a much bigger spawn than you were planning on and it getting there much sooner than you expected. there could be a possibility of the security level reaching a type of critical mass in which youre denied docking rights, gate access, and possibly even concord response for extended periods of maxed out alert bars.these numbers are by no means exact but my concept is to create a middle ground area that effectively blends high sec and no sec while limiting the effectiveness of gate camping as a long term tactic and never providing any true deterrent for casual pirating and pvp. this will stop major alliances from going into low sec from .0 and blasting every pos they come to without war decing those corps because eventually concord will respond to their assault.it doesn't require a change to sec status hits, roid values, agent locations, agent rewards, the bird flu, or any other stuff that is hard as hell to balance. just a new mechanic for a portion of space that under used and doesn't serve its intended purpose.thoughts?"
1/28/2009,not likely to be supported.even if your in a .4999999999999999999999999999999999999 sec system..... concord's not going to show up... or the faction navy.because its a black and white situation.all your trying to do is blur the lines... and while i'm in favor of more security... it would disrupt the balance of the game too much.the new .4 would be .3 and so forth.
1/28/2009,the situation being black and white is the problem. blurring the lines is the point. you are not effecting the security status of the system at all.low sec is so out of balance that few people make it a home so who cares if it disrupts the balance of low sec as it currently exists? the risk/reward of lowsec is the biggest screwup in the game since launch.
1/28/2009,"your only moving them out one system further.lowsec is just that... low security... you go there at your own peril.your not supposed to have the safety net of concord out there... that was clearly established.you need to deal with the pirates in a different way.the idea of doing a concord player law enforcement would be one way.a group of players who enforce the law as deputies.but then how do you deal with bribery.that is far better than rewriteing the rules on security status.don't get me wrong.. i'm all in favor of making low sec more viable... but sorry to say.. i have to side with the ""pirates"" as it would just disrupt the mechanics.if we take an inch from them... they are gonna want there mile. and we don't need that now do we."
1/28/2009,"maybe the explanation of my proposal isn't very clear to you. it would be near impossible to get concord to show up unless your illegally sieging a pos, gate camping a very busy gate, and/or farming the navy security force. again concord intervention in this scenario would be near impossible to achieve in casual combat.even then i said it would have to take a while for them to show up. there is a response timer just like high sec but concord does not show up initially ever. it will always be faction navy or some other security force not concord unless you do one of the things mentioned in the above post. the alert bar effects low sec. thats everything from .1 to .4999 right(in theory at least)? it effects every system not just .4 systems. that was an example.so pirates simply have more leeway with blowing things up the lower the security rating of the system is because there would be a much larger alert bar which would take longer to fill up which creates longer response times for reinforcements.you are still there at your own risk. you will still be engaged by targets and you can still be killed before even the pve help arrives.what did i miss?"
1/28/2009,"illeagally doing something to make concord show up... by whose definition?yours? mine? your talking about a dynamic world here.... one that isn't as cut and dry as it seems.even then... its a below .5... which means there is no law enforcement other than logging actions taken.your bluring of the lines will change that... .3 becomes the new .4....and top that off with your ""it will be a while before they show up"" is a waste of time.most ""incidents"" will take place so damn quickly its a waste of time to even bother...and sieging pos's is not an illegal action unless its in a .5 or higher system and even there are conditions that have to be met in that case.we're talking about lower than .5your solution is vague at best and needs a great deal of refinement.... and even if its a rather interesting idea... not gonna happen.you need to keep it simple.... otherwise you get into the realm of changing a massive game mechanic that has been repeatedly debated. all your going to do in the end is nerf the pirate gangs... and as much as i hate im.... that's not a good idea."
1/28/2009,"you realize those actions are already illegal right? thats why you get a security standing penalty for doing them. the world is that cut and dry. thats why low sec is a no mans land.all i am proposing is that a dynamic security system be used to deter persistent sustained aggressions and provide a security mechanism for low sec space that doesn't stop pirates from being pirates but does increase the population seeding of low sec due to a decrease in the risk vs reward of living there without trying to rebalance every roid, agent, mission, and sentry gun in the entire security region."
1/28/2009,"by your logic then a .501111111 system should allow me to shoot and pod you w/o concord response, i only have to tank gate guns.cant have it one way and not the other ;-p"
1/28/2009,"no it wont. it will still be .3, .2 will still be .2 and .1 will still be .1 because the security status of the system is unaffected. what about that don't you understand?are you reading anything i post? i have already said that. the point is to deter constant aggression there by making systems safer because the more active pirates are the more active security is. it only hurts pirates if they are stupid enough to let the bar fill up and stay filled up till concord arrives. if they do that its their own fault they got blasted. aside from that just like they decide what targets to attack and what targets to ignore they would also decide what systems to operate in based on the target environment and the level of the alert bar.thanks for parsing words. then make it illegal. there is no reason why low sec dwellers should have to compete with .0 dwellers on the same level with much crappier resources and an impossible to police area without using war dec mechanics considering they don't cost enough to really bother most corporations in the slightest much less the .0 corps and alliances.again do you read anything i post?it's vague because you don't understand it. something tells me you never will. i am not going to keep explaining it because your busy trolling my post rather than reading what i said or adding anything constructive whatsoever.it's amazingly simple. other than the alert bar and its derivative system all the mechanics already exist in the game. in fact the derivatives are already triggered in the game by security standing loss. its in fact very very simple.please if you don't comprehend it fine but stop ignoring my posts and stating generalities like philosophy is going to solve the low sec problem."
1/28/2009,where did i ever say this applies to anything other than systems between .499999 and .1?the title is low sec.
1/28/2009,technically...pashanai system for example is true sec 0.45764 but it acts as a 0.5 system.
1/28/2009,"your absolutely right. which is why i said...if my memory serves me correct most systems that are low sec are significantly below the .5 mark and since the alert bar would be based on the differential between .5 and its security standing then no system would have a short bar.pashanai would only have a 54 point bar. which means if the response time was 1/10th of the bar it would be 5.4 seconds for the initial spawn. if you incurred 20pts worth of aggressive actions then the next spawn would not arrive for 34 seconds after you destroyed the first spawn. aside from that nothing changes. those point totals are only examples of how the system would work it would obviously need balancing.it's all mute since pashanai is not low sec but thats how it would work. all it does is deter you from going on a rampage because response times get better, spawns get tougher, and if you really work at it concord will show up. the only reason i say concord will show up is because if a .0 corp decides to gank small low sec corporate pos's for lolz they should be forced to do it quickly. i am not oppose to concord warning timer or anything like that just a system for limiting long lasting sustained aggression without stopping piracy."
1/28/2009,if thats your stance thats acceptable. i fail to see how this stops pirating and turns it into high sec but to each his own.thanks for editing your post before i reported you.
1/28/2009,"you are adding a high sec mechanic (concord) into low sec. you are not adding in the full power of concord, but it is the same mechanic. taking a high sec mechanic and throwing it into low sec is the very definition of turning low sec into high sec. low sec is not black and white. if you want to travel through the system or dock, then you have gate guns to help you. if you want to explore around the system, npcs will not help you. this is a perfect gradual step away from npc protection and towards players policing the space they want to live in. adding in carebear npc police into low sec would make low sec pointless. low sec space is the fringe systems with no police, adding in police would be against the whole point of low sec. get it?"
1/28/2009,"since my other proposals, regarding the bounty and war-dec mechanics have been so well received by this community, i feel compelled to offer yet another solution to an age-old, (at least, as far as recent history is concerned), issue.the blob...i propose a change to gate/portal/bridge mechanics as follows:due to the incredible amounts of energy required to activate a gate, or any other jump mechanism, it seems to me that a realistic scenario could be implemented that better simulates such a colossal feat of energy management.i propose that these gates/portals/bridges have, for lack of a better term, a ""power-up"" timer of perhaps 5 seconds, (any longer may cause an inordinate amount of panty bunching, i fear).what this means is that for each activation of a gate/portal/bridge, another activation is not possible for 5 seconds.for example:multiple ships approach a gate/portal/bridge and activate the jump mechanism, based on when the server receives the actual command, it starts a queue:ship 1 jumps at tship 2 jumps at t + 5ship 3 jumps at t + 10etc, etc, etc... it is inevitable that, at certain gates, long queues may form. these pilots will, patiently of course, wait their turn to jump.i believe that such a mechanic will add a new dynamic to, not only blob warfare, but to other interesting activities, pilots choose to engage in everyday, in new eden.i await your comments and concerns.thank you.edit:oh and btw, you are not to be considered jumping until you are in the 5 second jump window, assigned by the server."
1/28/2009,and what about jita?
1/28/2009,"fun, fun times.... or start other trading hubs, i suppose..."
1/28/2009,that's just messed up beyond reason.a gate tax is far better than that idea.or a maximum limit of concurrent jumps.yours is so far off left field is laughable.

1/28/2009,"this proposal aims to enhance a matter that many would agree is particularly important: ccp-player communicationthe exact target for this proposal: petitionsthe problem as i see it:- the current petitioning system communicates very limited information- there has been significant frustration (and now possibly even learned helplessness) with problems people see in the current petitioning system. this has been much the case when players have interpreted there to be discrepancies in petition response-time and results, particularly where there have been server issues.in a nutshell:- make it possible for players to see a 'petition queue', i.e. an anonymous list of active petitions with their date/time of submission, arranged under each category- at the head of every queue would be an anonymised dev/gm, so players can see what resources are available to deal with the list- petitions can have labels to indicate the number of replies between ccp staff and the players, as well as what stage they are at (i would like to discuss this with others to see what kind of 'levels' could be proposed e.g. succeeded/failed).some of the pros:it is very simple and easy to applyplayers can see a quantitative figure for how busy the relevant petition queue is. they will be aware of how fast the petitions ahead of them are dealt. in the past people have complained that petitions of their foes can 'skip the queue'players may appreciate the petition load that ccp facesplayers will have a neutral resource to refer to if there are rumours of petition bias. players do not feel 'singled out' if what they see as a strong case for ship reimbursement petition fails, seeing that only a fraction do. this is a minor bonus.the only con i could think of:it may open ccp to more criticism if players use these lists to interpret that ccp employees are not distributing their resources efficiently / giving too much or too little time to certain petitions (is this really a con? :p)"
1/28/2009,"no support - bad idea. i've had good responses to the few petitions i have submitted over the years. i think this is probably because i sumbit few petitions and those have been valid issues. look at some of the nonsense on this forum, and try to imagine the amount of nonsense ccp recieves through petitions. the last thing i want is a bunch of customers with to much time on thier hands trying to armchair-quarterback the petition queue. this would not improve service."
1/28/2009,"interesting, good points. i'd be interested to know if there were other pilots who've, unlike yourself, had bad experiences to whom this would be the appropriate nepenthe."
1/28/2009,nope.... won't happen.that's like painting a bullseye on ccp... they get enough flak from us as it is.my only problem with the current system is the fact they tend to close the petitions without feedback... or at least thats the impression i get.seems a bit one sided.the timing of responses is easy to explain... a good enough of them are on the other side of the planet.
1/28/2009,"hello all,i live in east asia and have a real life that usually doesnt allow me to get home until about 7pm at the earliest. sadly, downtime starts at 8pm over here and as i need to go to bed around 11:30, i cant really enjoy the benefits of the game during the weekdays.im not a programmer, so i dont know the details of how it works, but i was thinking that there could be a minor change in the scheduling of downtime. is it possible to have it so that downtime is not always at the same time every day worldwide? perhaps it could shift forward one hour every day or week so that people in one part of the world dont always get hit with downtime during prime playing time on weekday evenings and everyone has to share in the annoyance of the necessary downtime.ccp, if you want to expand your market in east asia, you will be doing us a favor by making some compensation so that we can also sometimes enjoy the benefits of uninterupted play during the weekdays. perhaps some quit/dont join because of this issue.ps: it would also be nice if you guys would finally implement a skill queue (even one would be great!)"

""twich based"" movement and shooting, i should be able to put both engines and turrets in manual mode, it would probably work something like this, arrow keys to move, < > to yaw, - + for spped. the mouse controls gun reticule that can only move at the maximum tracking speed of the slowest online gun. closer you are to the ""sweet spot"" the better your chance of hitting. if i have a computer lock on the target, my skills, bounuses, etc. my chances of hitting are greatly improved, but even without i still have a fighting chance of hitting, especially is i am just damn good. even if i am jammed. in other words, if you want to hit something, and hard, you will have to take personal control of the ship.with just this, a person fighting five accounts that are controlled by just one person has a much better chance, even if one of the accounts is a falcon, which it ussually is. to say nothing as adding a totally cool dimension to the game."

1/29/2009,"this.incidentally, best idea this month.supported."
1/29/2009,"given that ccp already has a bookmark system, and a system for linking to things in chat, i would assume that it would be fairly simple to code. (i say this with a fairly extensive technical background, re: techies elaborating) i envision a button/shortcut that places an active link to your position in the active chat, and the ability to drag a bookmark from your places to a chat sound reasonable as well."

1/29/2009,"if you had done your research properly, you would know that ccp is about to release an extensive dev blog with the conclusion on this whole case.so it's definitely not forgotten."
1/29/2009,"the dev blog is ccp's report to the community. what of the csm's investigative report of it's conclusions? or, are you saying that your body did not conduct it's own investigation but are relying on what ccp decides your investigations reveal before presentation to us?for my education concerning csm role - did the csm investigate or merely wait for notification of what to say to us? if you did not, what was your role - to placate or what, exactly?"
1/29/2009,"it is not the csm's role to investigate the inner-workings of ccp at all. their role is to articulate the voice of the player base.they did this.transparency was asked for in the investigation conducted by ccp (as only ccp has the ability to do so) and we await the forthcoming results in the devblog.there is no need to call out the csm for something that they have no control over, and rightly so. they are the ambassadors of the player base, chosen from the player base. they do not recieve a salary from ccp, or any compensation for that matter (other than a free flight to iceland and what sounded like a night of moderate drinking) and thus they have no grounds for conducting any sort of investigation.if it is not good enough that ccp conduct the investigation and post the result of their finding (which according to the eula, they really don't even have to do) then nothing will be. i really don't see ccp outsourcing an exploit investigation to a small fraction of the player base that were banded together to represent the larger player base.in short, if you've lost your support in ccp, they're pretty much the end of the line in this regard. they have the good grace to release what sounds to be a substantial report on the issue so why don't we just wait for that."
1/29/2009,"this guy is entirely right. if we were to actually get access to the logs in the first place, ccp would have to terminate our accounts and then kill us after we saw them, most likely. it's unreasonable to expect that the csm should make a report. ccp has spend over a month working on this exploit now. do you expect the csm to do that over an extended weekend where we had a busy schedule in the first place?"
1/29/2009,"i was not attempting to be snide but to ascertain what your roles were. thank you for making it clear. my expectation did not equal the reality. my apologies to the panel - when the candidate explained what csm was it wasn't what you just said. i was lead to believe you were there to assist the player base resolve our concerns, an avenue to facilitate communication to achieve resolution that is mutually respectful. my mistake."
1/29/2009,thank you for the clarification. my mistaken understanding of their function in eve. i was led to understand they were more.
1/29/2009,"no problem. there has been some confusion about our role due to an interview hellmar did with nyt, where he suggested that the csm will be an oversight committee. but that's not the case."
1/29/2009,"read the article. if not oversight, what is the function of the csm? since you do this, can you tell me what csm really does."
1/29/2009,"ideas change and morph to new things as they are put to the test. the original idea was heavily influenced by the t20 incident, etc. however, when they started working on the csm concept they seemed to have realized what they needed was to communicate with a group of people whom represent the player-base."
1/29/2009,"to be fair, that's not the complete truth.ccp xhagen has been pushing for this idea for quite a while. the current implementation is what he wanted it to be. i assume the nyt article after the t20 incident was hellmar pushing forward the idea as well, but with too much focus on csm as an oversight.ccp has been very open to our questions about the exploit. so in a sense we are overseeing what they are doing. but we have no direct oversight as such. we are just representing the players."
1/29/2009,"i still can't quite work out why a news update about the upcoming release of information was not published, only a entry by the csm in the thread that only a portion of eve players read. maybe that's just it though, since it's bad press if it makes the news pages right? of course it will when they make the final statement, but why stoke the fires with a few updates that leave the issue longer in players memories? for all the good work that the csm may do, i don't want to hear it from them - i want updates and assurance from ccp themselves in an official capacity. this was a serious issue, not just another ""we want our missile range back!"" matter. an update or two since the 19th dec, even if it contained nothing more than ""we are still investigating this"" would have be welcome and taken only a minute or two to type up publish."
1/29/2009,"the effort to write a new database for a game like this is not trivial. do you want tech 3 ships, or coloured borders on bpcs? yes, it's a feature that's obviously lacking, and yet it's a huge headache to a lot of people. but the amount of work involved far, far exceeds the rewards of doing that work. in a perfect world, it'd be done and we'd be okay. in this world...not so much."
1/29/2009,"i never doubted that.me, personally?colored bpcs.i'm dead serious. i don't need new features i don't even know anything about, if i can instead get a functioning system i am currently working with.i suppose the same can be said about pos, and the entire interface of eve and about a hundred other things as well.you just have to define ""reward"" in the right way and anything won't be important enough.the blueprint issue isn't going to solve itself, if tech 3 adds another layer of blueprints, it's only going to be worse.[ edit ]yes, i'm somewhat bitter and angry about that. every time i have to deal with blueprints i'm annoyed, and seeing that, like the entire pos system, it's not worth reworking it doesn't make me happy at all."
1/29/2009,yes please. it is quite a pain to have to click on the info page for all the bpos and bpcs that i have so that i can separate them.
1/29/2009,"i'm sympathetic to that, but surely you're aware that you're in the minority on this. the difference is, pos changes affect gameplay directly, bpc changes only affect the interface. i'm a big believer in a solid interface, and i'm willing to suggest putting more work into fixing it than most, but even for me there are limits. bpc changes are on the priority list somewhere, but they're below a lot of other things. i'd be all for them taking the place of ambulation, but that's not going to happen, and most of the other announced features are probably ahead of the one you propose, and rightfully so. i get ui frustration, but there's limits on what they can reasonably fix."
1/29/2009,"i think i rarely agree with the majority. still, being the minority doesn't mean being always wrong. otherwise i'd like to know when the earth got folded into a sphere.i somewhat resent the ""only"" but i get your point.as long as it is on a list, that is good. hopefully it doesn't get bumped down with every new shiny."
1/29/2009,"i got better idea. why do all items have to be in the shape of a square?? picture wise.bpo = square picture, like they are right now.bpc = circle picturewhy stop there? ammo (not blueprints but the actual charge) could be triangles.i'm not a programmer or whatever but would it be really hard to introduce something like that?"
1/29/2009,"taking a neutron blaster vs. a 425mm railgun for example, the latter has 8x the base range for 22% of the tracking. it gets worse when you consider real setups, where for example a tracking computer pushes the long range weapon out to ranges (still talking short range ammo here), where you simply cannot miss another battleship. plug in the base numbers into the tracking guide and you can see that even with a small (50 m/sec) transversal, hit chance drops to 80% at 2km, and 40% at 1 km. note; this is for a weapon system with a base optimal range (short range ammo) of 3.6km shooting at a km-sized target... you simply cannot miss another km-sized target at 1km!again, taking the base numbers for a 415mm railgun, my proposed changes would boost it's hit chance, vs. another battleship to 100% at 13 m/sec transversal at 1.4km, 72% hit chance at 29 m/sec transversal at 3km, and 51% hit chance at 48 m/sec transversal at 5km (c.f. the current is 50% at those ranges at those transversals). in short, you are still stuffed if you fight a close-range battleship up close when you are fitted for long range."
1/29/2009,"ah you are trying logic and maths, don't expect much support :-)anyway a quick fix would be to multiply the gun tracking speed by the effective/true signature ratio if effective > gun sig res.now a simple and fast way to determine the effective sig ...supported"

1/29/2009,your doing it wrong!opperational range is optimal + 1/2 falloff.neutron blasters have 4.5x the tracking while 425mm railgun has 5.7x range.add antimatter ammo into the mix and the range advantage drops to 4.7x.try using your falloff range as intended.

1/29/2009,"technically ecm is overpower in comparison.solution? maybe each race should have an ecm dedicated ship? as it is the most useful of the electronic warfare variety, as you'd think by now the other races would have adapted to something that is far superior.modify the blakbird/falcon hull for each race. it still looks blackbirdy but, give it the bits that makes each race unique (except for the fact they are all using the same ecm in this case)."

1/29/2009,"reading between the lines, this is basically a call for a stealth boost to ganking industrials in highsec.assuming you use this little checkbox as a seller, if you choose to click it, who exactly do you think will buy your ships and shiny modules, if it's not for the people who are involved in wars and conflicts and thus using and losing their equipment? the people who check the box are basically going to be selling to the collectors, the mission market (i don't lose many ships at all in missions even though i'm stupid), and lowsec and nullsec people (who arguably are in the best position to look after themselves anyway). the checkbox is therefore pretty much redundant, it's like selecting ""doom yourself to market failure"" from the picklist on placing your market orders. you're forced to sell to people at war if you want to actually make a living, it's not going to be a 'new career path' of selling to warmongers.plus. say i'm in a corp in an alliance, and the alliance leader turns out to be a re-tard, and we get war-dec'd by ooh, i don't know, repo or some other mercs. currently, my ceo can realise that the guy's an idiot and going to brign nothing but trouble, and pull the corp out of the alliance, thus removing us from the hostilities after 24 hours. if the beef was with us, we can of course be re-dec'd. but in your proposal, people who have nothing to do with the original beef, didn't cause it, didn't agree with it and wish it had never happened, can continue to be dec'd for just the single price of the initial war. i don't think i like that possibility.however, if there is a requirement to provide formal surrender mechanism which went through concord, whereby such corps could always formally surrender for a contract settlement (isk, items, tasks performed, whatever), then i would give the first part of your idea more consideration, as there's certainly room for improvement in the war mechanic.tl,dr: * warring parties make up a huge chunk of the market, choosing not to sell to them dooms you to market failure.* perpetual flagging of corps who leave alliance allows for griefing of uninvolved people who could be on your side in the argument* if there's always a formal surrender option, then this isn't so bad. tl,dr the tl,dr: meow."
1/29/2009,"first, very perceptive. gratz!i think your idea for surrender conditions definitely has merit, but i disagree with letting traders of the hook, especially considering their immoral support of such vicious crimes against humanity.if a trader wished to be successful, he could always be a war-profiteer, though he should be prepared to accept the consequences of such an action.the best part, honestly, is that hiding in a dec-proof npc corp would now be just, a fading memory."

1/29/2009,"so in your opinion the risk vs reward value of low sec is acceptable? despite .0 being more profitable and safer and high sec being more profitable and safer.so low sec consists of stations and stargates? everything else is .0? what your saying is the only way to be profitable in low sec is to be a pirate, take overwhelming force with you in all your ventures and end up making less than you would in the perfect safety of high sec or less than you would by going to .0, cloak/log every time a pirate comes in the area, play the station hugging/pos shield hugging game, or any other number of ridiculous things that already go on because those mechanics are broken and/or necessary to maintain some semblance of safety in low sec. my idea places people in low sec which places targets in low sec and doesn't stop piracy. your just parsing words again as i have clearly stated the intent and purpose of my proposal. the gate guns in low sec are the only ones that are half a deterrent and just like anything else all people do is tank them and keep gate camping. at least my solution provides random spawns and that ever elusive dynamic content that games and gamers always look for. if the gate gun solution was working it would have done so sometime in the last 4 years of jacking with them to deter the behavior.the players can't police that space though. if i go to low sec and kill every known pirate i come across i will be a pirate in a couple of days. there is no policing of anything just reacting to constant jabbing or taking a security penalty. pirates are free to traverse the area and pick and choose and the consequences of their actions are perfectly fine because that's part of being a pirate while being pro-active and going after pirates is still something you get punished for just like pirates get punished. that's real balanced. play defense or else.that's your opinion and i respect that. the fact that you could still run around and blow ships up without losing yours makes it vastly different then high sec but hey if what you want is a free for all zone then isn't that what .0 is supposed to be? right now low sec is just as free for all as .0 its just got a crappier risk/reward. if you don't want to fix that then fine. point taken get off my thread."

1/29/2009,"i love the people who say you're stupid for voicing an idea. iq's must have dropped sharply while i wasn't paying attention.back to the op of this topic:i think it's a bad idea. let me try and explain why. you are, in essence, expanding the sphere of control of both the faction navies and concord into areas of the galaxy where they do not currently have a presence. it would be one thing if, for example, the minmatar government laid claim to a system, built some stations, and their navy started kicking the thrusters off any pirate ship in the vicinity. it's logical, they're protecting their interests, and it's very similar to the way actual governments protect their interests in the real world.but just like you won't see the eu devoting martial resources to hunting down pirates off the coast of antartica, why should the minmatar (or anyone else) care what happens in an area they have no influence (read economic interests) in?the question just gets stickier if it's a system lodged between two empires - what if the system is right next to both a gallente system and a minmatar system? who responds in that case? or worse, minmatar and amarrian space. do you really want to get caught in the middle of two skirmish groups that are supposedly there to ""protect"" you?in short, the reason it's a bad idea, isn't because you're a moron, or daft as some of the other people pointed out - thereby proving that if you don't have an argument, an insult is the next best thing.rather, the reason it's a bd idea is because 1) it unrealistically extends the control of factional security forces beyond their spheres of influence and 2) it would open a huge can of political worms in game.when you get right down to it, lowsec isn't meant to be safe. it's meant to be a stepping stone from highsec to nullsec in the development path of a character. it's the place that teaches you how to go from working alone to working as part of an effective team. it can be profitable - i woulad argue just as profitable as high sec, if you learn the lessons it has to teach."

1/30/2009,"truth is independent of opinion in science, correct. in marketing(which, don't kid yourself, is as big a part of the priority scheme as anything), the line is a lot fuzzier. ui is important, but less important than gameplay. i don't think either half of that statement is controversial. i don't know for sure, but it's been requested often enough, and has enough obvious utility, that i can't imagine it not being on the list. just as hard as it would be to introduce any of the other changes mentioned thus far. in order to have different icons, you need to have a way to distinguish them in the items database. since no such way exists at present, there is no way to make them distinguishable without running a blueprint-specific search like the blueprints tab in s+i does at present. doing that every time you look at a hangar or a cargo hold would be laggy, to say the least. shape, colour, border, whatever - it can't be done without either major lag or major work."
1/30/2009,"at least to me, gameplay is directly affected by the ui. a good game can be ruined by a bad ui, and a mediocre game can be more fun if the ui is good."
1/30/2009,"i'd love to see this, however i understand that there are some technical database issues that mean that the solution isn't as clear cut as we'd like it to be.as a suggestion though, the primary difference between a bpo and a bpc is the number of runs with all bpo's having infinate runs. i'm not a database programmer so i have no idea if this would work, but would it be possible for the icon for the blueprint to be called by comparing the values for both the item id and the number of runsie if itemid=blueprint and runs=infinate then icon=itemidbpo if itemid=blueprint and runs<>infinate then icon=itemidbpc"

1/30/2009,"blasters need a serious boost, and this would be it."
1/30/2009,"if you want to get nit-picky then yes, but this is before taking into account any realistic setup, as i said in my previous reply, it does not make any sense missing another battleship (1km length) from 1km away, particularly when using a dedicated close range weapon, that is the crux of my argument.i gave some examples from the basic tracking guide, please feel free to have a play around, and you'll see that compared to the hit chance for long range weapons at their optimal, short range weapons, i.e. blasters and autocannons, are hit by the lack of effective target size in the tracking formula. now this wasn't a problem with 90% webs as everyone was stationary, i repeat; the web change was in my opinion a good one, but close-range ships need some help that a simple tracking boost alone will not provide (recall, ship velocities in 'operational range' went up by a factor 400%) now that combat is more fluid at short ranges. correcting for size vs. distance is not intended to make eve 'more realistic', if you follow through the technical thread i linked, you would see that for 'realism' you would go down a somewhat different route, this is simply aimed at boosting close-range weapons, without going back to 'anything within web range dies' - with regards to large close-range guns, frigates for example, would still be completely untouched, cruisers would still be able to mitigate some damage (but you wouldn't want to go in solo vs. a close range-battleship for example), battlecruisers and above would be taking nearly full damage except for large transversal velocities inside of 2km."
1/30/2009,"he is using math, but no logic as to why it should be. tracking does not need changed to reduce the advantages that low tracking weapons have in the close range. in short, there is no reason to buff pulse lasers."

1/31/2009,"i am glad people do not let this up. it has been years, and ccp pretty much ignored, and swept it under the rug. the pos as it is now needs to be re-examined and revamped. honestly, they cant screw it up, the ccp that is, they can no, simply because it is so screwed up already that making it worse would be like going back to 2004. anyway, all people who need this, whatever their affiliation might be, should contact the csm they have voted for, and support the pos overhaul, point them to these boards, you know, just in case they are ""too busy"" and forgot about the ""funny pos thing"" as ccp has called."
1/31/2009,i support this issue mainly because it should have been done like 1 year ago and ccp dropped the ball on this issue and sov in general.
1/31/2009,what about drone mods? any news on this yet?
1/31/2009,"the underlined bits are priceless, so basically what you are telling us, the players of eve, many of whom voted for you, is this: ""don't rock the boat."" truly priceless, you do not want to risk a relationship with ccp? just listen to yourself for a second, whom do you represent? ccp? or the players of eve? this is truly an example of being too comfortable, and now that you know you will not be going to the next csm you tell us the truth, your relationship with ccp is more important to you than what your duties as the csm! why would you even say such a thing? why would you even come out and admit that csm has no ability whatsoever to represent the players, because, if we go by your statements, csm does not want to risk it! furthermore, you are comparing a polite and pointed demands that people have been aiming at ccp regarding this issue to a behavior of a spoiled child? you joking right? this has been going on for years now, over two years has passed, and i have not seen one flame, one troll from the community - the only reason you would say something like this is to reduce the validity of the need for the pos rewamp. spoiled children? really? the developers did not even give csm a time of day on this issue, they chose to call it a ""funny pos thing"" and all you are doing is reiterating the point that reduces a significant issue by renaming it; thus proving all those people on forums who say that csm has no ability to do anything whatsoever. they can't even garner respect from ccp to call an issue what it is, a pos problem, and resort to the diminutive and reductive lexical semantics of the ""funny pos thing"". lv i know you are not running for the next csm, and you had my support for the two terms that you have served, and i know ccp refusing you entry due to your age, but, i am afraid from the above statements your age does show. you did not think things through before you posted, and painted yourself into a corner, i am afraid. i do not know what you meant to say, but what you did say was pretty much this: ""ccp is a big daddy, i want big daddy to love me, and i want him to love me better, so i will take the big daddy's side, even if it means going against other kids. and, it does not matter that the other kids are the ones who asked me to help them with the big daddy, because he was not so nice to them.""the pos has to become a priority to ccp, it has been a huge drain on resources, and just patching the code does not work. if it is impossible to patch the code, then ccp should start working on the new code! what a concept, i know! and, when the new code for pos is ready, implement it. csm should keep this alive for a simple fact that pos - as it is - affects pretty much everyone in the game, and making it better, more streamlined, more user friendly, more believable, will only improve the game in the long run. ccp is happy to spend their time on all sorts of things, why not dedicate a small team to slowly trudge and make a pos better? because, i guess, they do not have to deal with the pos garbage every day, and it is easier to have a defective, if working pos, than to actually have a fully functional structure in place. well, i really hope csm would stop being ccp's lap dog and show some backbone. otherwise, i would say, the whole thing was an exercise in futility. so far, the important stuff, csm has failed at it. oh, and it is nice to be back after a month away from eve....."
1/31/2009,so what is it going to take to get some csm support on this issue???
1/31/2009,"importable/exportable block listit's harrassing to block the same people 2 or 3 times( or more ) ( and theres just too many scammers so its harrassing to block them on every char ) , so it would be nice to be able to export/import the block list from/to other charactersopinions ?"
1/31/2009,"as long as it's easy to implement, sure."
1/31/2009,"first off, an interesting article. i am one of the people that see macro mining as a problem. why? well, i see a big feature of eve is it's player based economy. when people are able to mine vast amounts with no limits they can create a monopoly over ore prices, minerals, etc. monopolies are not allowed in most real life countries, so i think in a game with a market based aspect their should be at least some measures to at least make them harder to pull off. monopolies shaft people, and most players get shafted by macro mining. regardless of whether or not people have access to macro mining programs, not all people will have the best resources to run a pc 23 hours a day with the client open. (playing on a family computer for example.) so what do they say? i happen to be in group of people that use macro miners. they usually pull up this comment from the link at the beginning of my reply.so this is what i think would be a good first step: see if we can get ccp to revise the eula,that way there will be at least some clarity of it being ""not okay"". if newer players are told that macro mining is okay by their friend and shown the current section 7 of the eula, it probably won't help the problem. sure, it's not going to get all macro miners banned,etc...however this might be a helpful first step in the right direction. just for ideas sake, here's the similar statement from the wow eula:eve online eula"
1/31/2009,"so if you are truly macro-hunting and someone reacts as you stated above, calling you names, etc. would you apologize for the gank and reimburse him for his lost equipment? (insert laughter here) you may apologize, but the reimbursement would most likely be out of the question."

1/31/2009,"well gee whiz, i had no idea that all you had to do in the csm was make ginormous posts about such important topics! i have experience doing things like that too, don'cha know. maybe i should use my abilities as a maverick to bring some fresh blood into the csm next time the election rolls around. i've got some great ideas that can really change new eden around, like banning that nasty pax amarria book and making podding illegal (it's too much like abortion!). don't forget to vote for me next time the election is here!oh, and ankhewhateveryournameis, you don't seem too popular. i'd stop sounding so carebearish. go and take a lesson from ronald reagan and maybe you can be a maverick like me!"
1/31/2009,"i'm encountering the same issues - ccp seem to want everyone to take sides, so the prevalence of faction missions is much higher than it used to be. but it's not just the standing loss, it's the lack of bounties that i don't like. plus many of the faction missions i've tried are insane: ""smash the suppliers"" (level 4) is the most difficult mission i've come across and even with a couple of buddies to help out we couldn't do it.i'd like to see faction missions to only become available from certain agents, say, intelligence. if someone chooses to do them, that's fine. i personally prefer missions with bounties, as i don't usually bother to salvage. some added flexibility in choosing missions would be welcome - wanting to do combat and getting courier or mining missions is very frustrating. ccp should check their stats on which missions are being turned down the most oh, and i hope that these new 'epic mission arcs' aren't all faction missions..."
1/31/2009,"i reject!no seriously missioning mechanics are generally fine, except standing mechanics for 0.0 factions, say you have been living in low sec/hi sec and you want to make a natural move on your career and go to 0.0 but you notice you have -10 standings for every pirate faction, except mordu's maybe, who have like 1 level 4 agent. which means missioning in 0.0 is pretty closed for you, forever. i think this is a bit of a real problem there, if any."
1/31/2009,"gas missionsyou show you know nothing about gas missions. you are not allowed to use more than 1 harvester. 425 bits of gas, 1 bit every 30 seconds, thats 212.5 minutes or 3.541666666 hours for a single mission that pays no better than a 90 minute mining mission. if you use an industrial ship you can go non stop, if you use a smaller ship you must add in drop offs at the local station and dont forget if you jet can it, you can loose your can in 2 hours <lots of fun!>starting any mission before down timemining missions being done partially before down time are a bad thing because at dt the mission resets and you have to start alllllllllllllllllllll overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrragents giving wrong mission typesthis is a personal pet peeve of mine. i'm the corp industrialist, i can l3 kill mission but i'd rather l4 mining missions. why would an industrial agent (mining or manufacturing) need a kill mission done?undesired faction missionseve is a sand box, why are you being so negative on someone elses sand box? everyone has the right to play any way they choose within the rules and if having good faction with all factions is someones goal that is their choice. i support the portion where an agent should give the missions that they are set to give and not other genre ie security agents should not give mining missions and mining agents should not give security missions. ideamy suggestion on this would be to have (perhaps scaling with your faction to the npc agents corp) a list of missions the agent needs to get done. example:rating - missions offered4..........26..........38..........4maybe even a ticker where you can accept all 4 missions or 1 or 2. i understand this is nothing easily implemented but it is something that would be beneficial in the future."

1/31/2009,"no instead you are moving it to an anything within 1km dies.it is supposed be nothing moving within 1km dies. so as they say: ""working as inteneded"""

1/31/2009,"negative, frigates class hulls will not be touched by this, cruisers will still have a damage reduction particularly if using, for example, tracking disrupters. battlecruisers and battleships however, are far too large to miss at 1km range.does the '0m' effect count as ""working as intended""? - probably not."
1/31/2009,fool the effects of tracking will still work as intended and making it difficult to hit targets that are moving fast and near(transversal velocity) however the target should not effectively shrink because of the games in inability to understand how a firing arc actually needs to increase when the distance reduces.in other words objects in the eve do not apaear to be bigger when you get closer to them. instead thay effectively shrinking in size. a typical school maths revision guide on our the behaviour of angles and perspective view will end the matter.
1/31/2009,tl;dr : how does i not hit ?

1/31/2009,what imbalance ???
1/31/2009,he will eliminate the weakness of low tracking weapons at close range.
1/31/2009,"original threadbackgroundnbsi and nrds are the two most common roe employed by sovholder alliances in eve.not blue shoot it is often used because marshalling standings to badguys and protecting your assets and locals is hard with unidentified ships running around.not red dont shoot the another option available but it's very difficult to punish the right ""bad apples"" and not shoot innocents. it's also a constant ""pain"" to adjust standings to small corps (and even individual pilots) who are abusing the sovholders nrds policy.nrds promotes alot of good things. like trade, freedom of movement and generally makes 0.0 more accessible to the broad public (combined with ratting/farming contracts/deals and dockingrights it also generates income for the sovholders). so why isn't it used more?two major factors encourage nbsi over nrds as the ""easy way out"". 1) standings are hard to keep updated properly. especially in large areas with alot of different neutral corps operating on a daily basis. pirates and other ""unknown"" entities needs to be detected visually and hunted down manually, and they can easily hide among ""true"" neutrals in a system. 2) nrds means less targets to shoot at and increases the chance of hostile spies running around uncontested. the goalto make the game more dynamic and increasing the level of interaction between players.by:populating 0.0 by making it more accessible.giving industrialists (even very small corps) a better chance to experience 0.0.giving pirates and pvpers new fun challanges.making sovholding alliances appear more like true powerful factions rather than greedy backscratcher corps.ambitious? maybe... but keep reading."
1/31/2009,"my suggestionintroduce new tools to encourage alliances and corps to choose a nrds like stance and open up their space for more players.the toolsautomatic standings: an alliance style sec-status with parameters set by the sovholders. pilots and gangs who do bad stuff in the sov areas are flagged as ""red"" to the sovholders (like in empire). the thresholds are determined by the sovholders. it could be anything from agressing neutrals or entering forbidden/off limit systems, stealing cargo or putting up too large market orders on specific items, opening cynofields, or being reported by sovholding personel, with sufficient roles (like security officers). depending on the transgression it would result in different kinds of flags, like temporary or permanent ""sec-status/standings"" loss (in the end resulting in different responses from the pilots in the sovholding alliance). fees and taxes: different kinds of fees and taxes. like gatefees, jumpbridge fees and dockingfees. ignoring a fee at a gate and jumping in anyway would result in a ""criminal flagging"" towards the sovholding corp. tax on station-trading depandant on the standing of the pilot/corp/alliance. markets: market access controlled by the sovholders, by dynamic taxes in relation to standings (to prevent unrealistic hostile market action, since the sovholders should be able to govern the market as they do their space). licenses: sellable licenses that are bound to the pilot/corp/alliance receiving them. a license could allow access to a certain system or systems, dockingrights at certain stations, rights to trade certain goods or items. permission to shoot neuts (or reds, or blues, whatever the sovholders allow) within the sovholding alliance territory. pos setup, you name it. licenses would be time-limited and/or revokable at any time by the issuing alliance. billboards and information: anchorable billboards and/or automatic messages transmitted to pilots in or entering sovheld systems (for example explaining the rules and directing visitors). different tools would be available at different sov levels.my thoughtstools like the ones above would allow sovholding alliances to have both neutrals and pirates roaming around in their systems. industrial players would have the chance to enjoy 0.0 while being protected by a sovholding alliance (without the regular hassle of rent and obligations to pewpew for their ""masters""). pirates and evildoers would be rewarded with target rich environments and instead of being hunted by concord or lose empire sec-status they could get fun fights by real breathing players.sovholding alliances would be competing against eachother to provide the best service and securest space for the ""neuts"" and war between alliances would get alot more interesting (since it encourages smaller fleets on disruption missions) and the stakes are even higher than before.this of course is all optional. these are only tools to encourage a more breathing living 0.0. the regular nbsi stance would still be available. even a mixed nbsi, nrds stance could be chosen for different systems and areas.this could also integrated in whatever new sovsystem ccp has on the drawingboard.it would not affect sec-status or dealings in empire or other areas of 0.0 and alliance and corp standings would overrule the parameters set by the sovholders (-10 would always be -10).edit: oh.... the end"
1/31/2009,"i think i see what your asking for..it sounds like an overhaul to the standing system in general..would a lot of what you ask for game mechanics wise not be solved if standing had some visibility improvements? so you could change standings with corps, players, alliances and the options would be; private, personal, public. the private would be invisible to the receiver and no collateral impact, the personal would only have impact on the receiver and not further up, the public would have derivative impact all the way through the standing system.the back and fourth of such a dynamic system would also make it possible to datamine and use infiltration as a method to enter player sov regions. flying false flags.with something like this setup from players would have more meaning, and would create more game, while making things easier to govern out in sov space.i would expect something like that to ease the workload on a combat perspective, but increase the interaction needs, and trust relations governings more..this would also kick at player behaviour in an interesting way../signed because it kicks the beehive figuratively speaking.."
1/31/2009,"i see what you're going for. as a member of an independent corp in 0.0 that is normally the ""neutral"" in the nbsi equation is a very enticing. however.... i don't know. despite the difficulties of being constantly hunted and shot at, i truely enjoy 0.0 as the honest, simple, free alternative to the mess of standings and rules that exist in high and low sec. it's hard for me to endorse any idea that clouds the clarity of 0.0; even one that seems to benefit me."
1/31/2009,"no need to worry, most will still shoot you. but it would be nice for the nrds people to have some more options."
1/31/2009,"good read, my friend."
1/31/2009,"as i started reading this i had thoughts of ""oh great... here it comes... another stupid idea""but honestly i'm stunned... this is a well thought out and very ambitous idea.the only draw back is.... takes a lot of effort to implement this system.you have my thumb sir...and best of luck getting support./signed"
1/31/2009,"this, basically. i'd imagine that most alliances won't use this, but for the ones who do it'd be seriously useful. a surprisingly good and interesting idea."
1/31/2009,"with the upcoming release of t3 and the previous patches i fear faction ships are becoming more and more irrelevant. i would love to see a boost to their abilities as it would be a great shame to see these ships fade into obscurity.i would like to propose changes to these ships so they remain viable in pvp. one of these changes would be to the vindicator and its mwd bonus, which is more than pointless. i think it would be nice to see a boost to resistance, dps and other area's to ensure people keep making video's with them for years to come."
1/31/2009,"would it not be wiser to wait and see how t3 will be like and to observe which influence it will have, before making wild assumptions?with the upcoming release of x (insert anything vague and mostly unknown) i fear that y (insert anything unforeseeable) will happen. let's change y, so that my fear will turn into someone else's nightmare. ;)"
1/31/2009,"yes... i love it when people say ""kill tech 2!"" ""omg hax!~ pos exploit tech 2 ftl!""tech 3 is coming.... read the bloody news posts.... do the research... good things coming this way.... don't put the cart before the horse.you just might be surprised.complain after you have something tangible to complain about.don't always assume ccp is going to screw up.... they do a rather good job imho.... let im do it.^_^(ps: not tying to come off as a hairy troll... just a bit snippy this morning hehe... need my quafe or something)"
1/31/2009,"t3 has nothing to do with it. sub-bs faction ships need an overhaul.pirate ships need more pg/cpu.price needs to be substantial reduced. especially on frigates. t2 ships are cheaper and more effective.dramiel needs another turret.guardian angel ships may need their bonuses changes.frigates need to not all be split weapon systems. (hookbill, worm, comet, dramiel all suffer from this)also, it would be nice if non-faction versions of the frigates were introduced (and possibly pirate cruisers/bss) as they are some of the best models in the game. say you buy the bpo through the lp store to make a tier 5 frigate (racial frigate 5 but no supporting skills to bridge the t1-t2 gap) for the standard faction ships and tier 4 for the pirate. (racial frigate 4 for both races) i think this would be the only way to ever make the cruor viable."
1/31/2009,"problem is that ecm is all those ships have. if you nerf ecm even a little bit they become like one volley bunching bags. ecm ships have no mentionable ability to tank anything, they're slow and possess no real mentionable offensive capabilities.when you talk about nerfing ecm you could as well speak about nerfing i.e webs or neuts also. at least curse and rapier are wtfpwnage in very similar amount than falcon is. and they can actually hurt people."
1/31/2009,well looking at contracting i thought about why logistics might be an issue..why not try and increase the number of outstanding couriers allowed.so in effect couriers cost say 1/10th of other contracts.i think more courier missions would be made this way and more would go into hauling because filling the trucks would be more likely..
1/31/2009,"*edit*didn't notice you where talking about missions.they should pay much more... and should be categorized in there own department.not forced upon someone doing a ton of combat.nothing says ""haha"" when you get a shipping mission flying a battleship."
1/31/2009,are you talking about courier contracts or courier missions? you seem to be discussing both. please clarify.
1/31/2009,yes i was talking about contracts. not missions.more possible outstanding contracts could increase its usage..
1/31/2009,"penalize overkill & reward fair play.the lack, or decreasing frequency of small gang and small ship pvp is something bemoaned by many players and since there is a symptomatic relation between the reasons for the decline and the natural reaction to the very concept itself, it can only be revitalized if there is an actual reason to do it.i have thought about that for a while without any conclusions, but then i had an idea, which i want to share.one thing that motivates players, apart from doing it just for the sake of doing it, is profit.profit can be made in many ways of course and some ways are salvage and loot from your enemy.my concept is to introduce the concept of dynamic circumstantial calculation into the makeup of both loot and salvage through the concept of overkill.when a large ship blazes away, it's cannon are supposed to shred huge holes into the enemy, smashing anything they hit apart and eventually blowing the enemy ship to pieces. a battleship that destroys a frigate will likely not leave much of anything behind. imagine what happens when you shoot a commuter car with a howitzer. there will be little to nothing left to loot or salvage. just an area littered with smoking pieces.however, if the same commuter car is effectively destroyed by small arms fire like a goon with machinegun, there will be a lot left to be salvaged and looted.the inclusion of such a mechanism might be a small part of the bigger picture of reducing overkill. at least when the involved parties act with a sense of magnitude.destroying something using a smaller ship and smaller weapons should leave more behind to loot and salvage.and i don't mean that the final blow should count. ccp could probably add a max salvage value to all ships and have that value decrease in proportion to each hit. like a hidden hp stat that is affected by the sheer magnitude of damage, not by the added total.even if it should fail to provide the necessary incentive for increased small ship use all by itself, it may easily be a factor eventually and it will provide added reward for sportsmanship.the same could and should be true for missions. blasting enemies that are hopelessly outgunned and outclassed would result in less loot and salvage reward than doing missions in smaller ships, where the mission provides an actual challenge and risk.now you can rip it apart."
1/31/2009,i don't really see how this should help smaller gangs and maybe it's just my impression but the most pvpers out there are doing it for the fun of it rather than for the loot or salvage.
1/31/2009,"i like the motivational aspect of this post.it goes to the core of what i believe is a balance flaw in eve.you point at salvage and loot tables, and how they could be integrated better into the players activities. i could not agree more..the most refined way to implement this would be to let the destruction of ships npc and player be the balncer of access to items and everything else.i am unsure if this to some extend is attempted to hardcode.my take would be that when a ship of any type is destroyed each item should be rolled for and its chance to survive be based on how many of that item is active in the entire universe. its chance should also be compared to that items donchian avg, and thus the combat of smaller ships would potentially be a price balancing activity.salvaging would be the same thing, the different type of salvaged goods would be based on availability of the item and that items trading value. so smaller ships spawned lower end salvaged goods and bigger ships the higher priced salvage.from ccp side they should have a general idea of how much of the different items they prefer are in the world, but the above type of system would end up rather self governing, if the price and trade volumes was a factor.the precise mechanics would most likely need some tweaking, but in the end it should become a powerfull and effective solution to the whole loot table problem./supported by principle"
1/31/2009,"to me, the most important thing about this is to both punish excessive use of force and to reward those who restrict their use of such force.if you want to capture something for it's value, you don't blow it to smithereens. ccp themselves said, that they consider elements of surgical warfare for future expansions and this could be part of that.in a certain way, this would also address the issue some players have with empire afk mission runners. it would be a lot less profitable to afk run missions in a passive tanked ship that fires away with brutally oversized warheads at small and medium targets. on the other hand, using drones would gain advantage as a tradeoff for the immensely increased risk of salvage ninjas, through the fact that drones do their damage in small portions, instead of huge strikes.maybe some day in the distant future, we might even get different wreck models, where a dominix destroyed by small guns looks like the original ship cross-bred with a swiss cheese and the same ship destroyed by cruise missiles, stealth bombs and extra large artillery looks more like the cloud of debris.supporting my own concept, of course."
1/31/2009,i dig it.
1/31/2009,yes!
1/31/2009,"i would love thisbut some issues would come: i.e. you want to dock quickly cause a dude is pursuing you and the security code ruins your docking speed loland the annoying factor... maybe asking for a code each 30 minutes... and you can ""update"" it whenever you want (so it doesnt come just when you are in a pvp fight for example). it also needs to be placed on a not annoying part of screen and must be small."
1/31/2009,"they have to change the sovereignty system first before they can go after macro ice miners. 0.0 would collapse without them.as for regular macro miners, so much of the economy is based off of them that they might have to increase mining/refining yields to consider banning them."
1/31/2009,"exactly, make all the yields 2x and ban the macroers. solved."
1/31/2009,where do you want these added?
1/31/2009,"wrong!the prefix ""meta"" (except when used by ccp, <U+FFFD> la ""metalevel"") refers to one level of description ""up"". thus, meta-knowledge is knowledge about knowledge, meta-conversation is a conversation about conversation, and so on. it derives from the greek prefix meaning after. (fun fact: metaphysics is so called because aristotle wrote about it before writing after writing about physics.)you seem to be under the impression that ""meta"" refers to something simply outside the game. in reality, the metagame is the game that occurs about the game - alts, spying, balance issues, etc, no stocks and ipo's.also, you suck at concise explanations of what you are trying to say.edit: dammit, goumindong beat me to it. reading the whole thread before posting an exasperated and intentionally condescending reply ftw."
1/31/2009,"he is more right than you are icarus. much more right. the prefix ""meta"" means ""beyond"". the metagame is the ""game within the game"""
1/31/2009,"let see if i can clear this up in a short and concise fashion....my use of the term metagame is on point, this also in regards to ipo and stocks, because as a feature ccp has added only a skeleton and the players have had to govern everything else. (somehow i am beginning to see a few advantages in this..)when i am talking about balance issues, and go in every direction its because the missing features are of an emergent nature. it will shift things maybe a bit to fast, and not in the intended direction. what will happen if we get a working npc interbus hauling system?we might all agree that the logistics are a bit of a pain, but to easy solutions might nerf the game beyond repair. that is why i want to ask for a debate on these issues. my personal take is that the motivational tools are shifted poorly. i find it strange that pointing this out brings such an opposition.what about the oil and refinery, and energy consumption parallel is hard to understand?if 0,0 is not operating in fashions akin to real life our intuitive behaviour will be wrong.if bureaucracy and capitalism isnt mainly in secure high populated areas things are a bit askewed. i know its just a game, and entertainment should be king, but bending this to be just a scifi space shooter is not the intention of the ccp as far as i am informed. after watching the fanfest videos i am quite sure about this. so i was posting to open discussion.who knows someone might have some extremely simple and great solutions to these thins.eve is the best virtual world simualtor around these days, because in here stuff actually matter and its not a casual game experience, but a lasting and life demanding one.this simulation will improve if the mechanics of ressources are tweaked. no matter if that is stuff, manpower or currency.fix corp standing mechanismlet stocks be traded on scc market.make more access levels to the api, to customize allowed outside access. (audit of corps)let players rent npc stations.fix all npc facilities prices to react by supply and demand.make system standing dynamic, and even to the point where players can have 0,0 made secure by pulling in concord. push pull of security..have maps updated about changes in sec rating nice colored ones to in effect show where the pvp swarms move about..things of high tech should be build in empire space, to remove risks. no shipyards in real life could survive placement in a warzone. exception might exist in regards to warships considered secret projects.i hope these examples give an idea to what i am thinking.nb: i am all for 0,0 space.. i just seriously think it should be for the excitement and not the long lasting economic powerplay. because then eve will never get a good wealth distribution in its simulation."
1/31/2009,are you sure it isnt because you have no clue what you're trying to say?this is irrelevant to whether or not its game or metagame. my point about your use of metagame was irrelevant to whether or not you're using it wrong.
1/31/2009,"*edit*screw it, i give up."
1/31/2009,"there are a few threads about suggestions to some changes to missioning.i would just ask if the following idea would not solve a few of these issues.reducing expiration penalty on standing to a rather low value.letting the cancellation of missions not yet accepted be governed by a skill.so unskilled once every 4 hours, level 1 1 every 3 hours, lvl 2 1 / 2h etc and level 5 once every 30 minutes.also in addition to this letting mission runners be able to contact about mission offers remotely also based on a skill, one similar to market range.a feature needed would be rightclicking the agent in people and places and set course the same way you can with an active agent when you dock at station and have an active mission.some balance tweaks might be needed afterward to clean up the increased work on missioning..but basically this would be offering options much along the lines of ""selecting"" missions.."
1/31/2009,"i think it is rather moot to discuss details of mission running at this time, because as far as i have read ccp is doing a massive expansion of mission running. we will have to see how that works out to see how changes would fit in.the ability do deny a mission remotely would be of help in any case, though.few days ago i flew a mission in khanid. then i headed back home to gallente space, 24 jumps. the very moment i arrived in my home station, that cramp-arsed storyline agent in khanid decided that he wanted to offer me a storyline mission. i had to make 24 jumps back and forth just to tell him to hide in a bush and frell himself.when agents can contact you via mail to make an offer, it should be a polite option to deny them the same way.when it comes to skills that decrease the time for turning down a mission, i am completely against it. it would be an economic desaster. using 1-2 characters in a hub area that has multiple high level agents, it would become far too easy to farm for the best missions. farming missions is a serious issue, because empire already makes it very easy to make loads of money. if i could run twice as many angel extras and assaults, it would roughly increase my net yield by 30% minimum. a lot of impact for the kind of skill you are suggesting.if you are picky about your missions, be picky about it. being picky is a personal disadvantage that has consequences. when i say i do not eat chicken, pork, shrimp or veggies, i lose a lot of options when faced with a preset buffet. it is my decision, though. i should not complain when all i am left with is rice and potatoes, or the time it takes to wait for the pizza delivery service."

1/31/2009,"problem with blackops is that they're way too overpriced to be used in pvp. they lack scan resolution to tackle anything, they're bs size and now even more slower than they were. if they were to be used in pvp they should be made useful for that instead of being funny big alliance boy toys. being able to jump into cynojammed system is only useful for very limited number of blackops pilots, mostly for funny nc/goon/gbc etc. lolguys. say hi for blobs. whole jump drive in blackops is only needed for going around megacamps, blackops is still a cloaking bs able to go through gates. the problem is that fuel takes whole cargo space, making it so that you can't really fit any fuel on board, tbh. oh, and jump portal.... if you get someone to make a covert cyno for you it means the path is totally possible to make through with covops/recon so why any need for cynoing in more if they just can fly?i cry when i see threads like this."
