7/1/2010,there's just so much wrong with that statement i don't even know where to start.
7/1/2010,"first off, apparantly alot of people have very poor hearing comprehension. sicne when does ""we think introducing them was a mistake, but we don't want to simply remove them because that'll make alot of people angry"" translate to this ridiculous claim of ""ccp has already said tehy are definitely removing them"" ? seriously, those two statements are nothing alike.secondly, since the learning skills supposedly add nothing to the game, than if ccp does remove them, it should simply be removal. no sp reallocation for those of us that have them, no +10 and +10%... just a flat out removed.thirdly, the proposed plan isn't a cover all for everyone's pain from this. only the vets with 3 or more years of having the learnign skills have gotten the payout from learnign them. those who haven't been playing that time with them will get royally screwed by everyone startign with them now. afterall, they had to spend the unaccelerated time to train them up to that level.personally, i don't care if they stay or not... but if they go it shouldn't be a free for all +attributes because people are lazy. it should be simply ""you don't like them? fine, they're goen along with the do nothing for the game trainign bonus they provided.""-cash"
7/1/2010,"what does laziness have to do with training skills in eve? you think you're making a big effort by clicking and dragging those boxes into the training queue? there's no work, there's no effort. in the case of learning skills there isn't even any interesting decisions apart from when would be the least annoying time to train them. there is only time. you are not a special snowflake because you paused your character's ability progression at one point in time to gradually increase it later. *everyone* has to do this. the only variant is how far they go between 4/3 and 5/5."
7/1/2010,whatever removes those stupids skills is fine with me.
7/1/2010,"you wouldn't know sarcasm when you saw it, right?anyway, i profit from the impatient crowd, so fine by me ;)still not supported tho, previous arguments still stand."
7/1/2010,the only people who would cry are the ones who will cry no matter what ccp does or does not do. if you only make decisions based on what everyone will like you would never make decisions.
7/1/2010,"to start with, you're considering that laziness can only take a form of physical action, which is incorrect. the fact that you want a bonus because that's what you have defined in your head as the ""standard"" for absolutely nothing is sheer laziness. the fact is, the standard is the baseline stats you start with, hence why learning skills provide a bonus (do i need to link the definition of bonus to help you understand that point?).secondly, i have a mining alt that only has 2 learning skills at 4/3 and the rest at like basic 2 or 3. and he's in a hulk. so i'm sorry, but your point is defeated right there. so guess what, they are optional as proven by such case. any more attempts at such a paultry arguement to getting a bonus because these skills are supposedly mandatory?edit: correcting abyssmal spelling and incorrect sue of you're."
7/1/2010,"this is my main issue with people wanting the training skills removed.it's""i want the training skills removed and everyone given +10 to each attribute""which to me reads""i cba to train the skills so gimme free stuff""if you cba to learn them then don't, if you think they're worth the time then learn them.if ccp do remove them i think the best way would be to remove them, drop everyone back to basic attributes and release a load more implants with the best being a +15.that way we're back on track with the ""i think it's worth my time to spend xbillion on implants so i have 25 in what ever attraibute"""
7/1/2010,"yes because alts are oh so relevant to this discussion here. getting a new char in a hulk is 50 days training, of course you're not going to put more learning skills into it if that's as far as you plan to go. guess what? most new players a) don't know exactly what they're going to do b) don't plan to stop training skills after 50 days. incidentally, you'd have been better off going 4/3 in everything except charisma even if you wanted hulk i and nothing else.again, training of skills requires minimal physical or mental effort. they just require time."
7/1/2010,"that's funny, because the next thign on his list of things to get is to pilot a jump freighter... yet i'm not wasting time with the learnign skills i should have to be ""effecient"". and considering tiem is the most precious commodity of all, i'd say that's quiet a valuable thing to spend."
7/1/2010,"but you do realize that the whole skill-system is about time, right? it takes time to get skills in eve. how the skill system were implemented wasn't given by some divine intervention. i could have been set up in many different ways. for example you could buy the skill and plug it in and immediately have the skill (matrix style, no training time). or you could have the double training rate compared to now, or just half of it.as a new player, what i did and many with me, was that we acknowledged the system for what it was and accepted it as a fundamental premise for the game. not necessarily because we thought it was the best conceivable system one could come up with. but it was the same for everyone and that means parity which imo is important in any competitive game.it takes time to get skills in eve and learning skills are an integral part of this system. asking for them to be removed is to be asking for a shortcut. it is to say that you should not have to play the game at the same premise as players who came before you. it should not take you three years to get to the point, skill wise, as those before you had to wait three years to achieve.ccp could take away learning skills and then add the time they take to train to the the rest of the skills by adjusting individual training rate. then people could train fun skills all the time and did not have to deal with the boring learning skills. wouldn't that be the most fair system? why are you guys not suggesting that?"
7/1/2010,"but that's just it. learning skills *aren't* an integral part of the game. you could strip them out and the rest of the game would chug along merrily without even noticing. though of course everyone would be training more slowly if you didn't increase the base attributes to balance it out. its an unnecessary addon to a very intricate well designed skill system.would new players have it easier then veterans with learning skills gone. not really, since the vets are already ahead in every measurable way. more knowledge, more connections, more skillpoints, more isk, so there's no reason they should feel threatened or aggrieved by a chance there. new players just get to feel more useful a bit earlier, no big deal. the rest of the skill system still provides a good pacing mechanism to stop them hopping into battleships in week 2.as to your final paragraph and suggestion for increasing skills to balance the time saved by getting instant +10s. sure, i'd go along with that. i don't especially need or want faster training times, i'm over the hump so to speak already. and whenever i do hit a rut and need to wait for a skill to finish training, i just go play another game in the meantime.edit : or i spam the eve forums, as the case may be."
7/1/2010,"it is annoying to train up learnings. so please remove them. waht comes as next?it is annoying to train bs from iv to v, make it go much quicker.newbies want to fly capitals a week after they have started, make the training go quicker and give them 10 bil isk. introduce joystick-control to eve.make eve x-box compatible.no! no! no! it is just the wrong way to go! much better would it be to give the newbies 1,5m sp for their disposal. so the still would need to decide whether they invest them in learnings or in spaceship command to fly big shiny ships right now."
7/1/2010,"i could agree to that idea, you'd have to give out the skillbooks for free too though i guess.people will still cry as it's still ""not fair"" though.truth be told, all the training skills do is divide the ""want nows"" and the ""want long terms"" squarely down the middle.i can see it being a thin end of a wedge if learning skills are removed.give people +10'stoo many support skills so everyone starts with lvl 3 in them, etc etc etc"
7/1/2010,"not supporting this idea.this proposal is a whole lot of ""something for nothing"". if you want the learning skills removed, then remove them. no free bonuses for anyone. if this proposal passes, what's next then? i think the same people who support this proposal will be begin screaming that cyber implants are not fair either. i mean...a new player can't use +5's right? he or she would have to train a skill. that skill would take a while. the implants are expensive. new players can't have that right away and that's not fair to them! right? let's do away with implants too or give all new players cybernetics 5 and full sets of +5 implants! it's fair because older players are already ahead of them and so they shouldn't have to work through the rules of the game to achieve any of that. it should all just be given free right up front! right?*edit*i thought i was being cute about that, but...i just read in another thread a player proposing to remove the attribute implants and just give +5 to everyone! there is no end to this. giving in to this proposal is a slippery slope and the whiners will only ever want more and more and more for less and less and less."
7/1/2010,"there is no time to waste, remove the learning skills :d"
7/1/2010,"ccp have constructed their game so that new players are at a disadvantage compared to veterans. it is a game-design. the whole skill-system puts new players at a disadvantage, not just learning skills. as i said, it did not have to be this way. you could get the skills by plugging them in and they could be cheap as dirt. or you could have all skills to begin with. those that now are veterans have also been new players, that is important to remember."
7/1/2010,so you agree that removing learning skills would not remove the advantage veterans have rightfully earned for having subscribed and played for longer?
7/1/2010,"i can't be sure but i don't think that's the point they were making. having read a variety of your posts now, though, i can say you are quite adept at putting words in people's mouths. i'll wager that you are a salesperson in rl. i can see the assumptive sales technique in a great many of your posts. once i look past your nearly religious hatred of learning skills, your obvious bias, and your nauseating sense of entitlement, your salesmanship skills can be seen.to further address your last statement, of course removing the learning skills removes ( as you yourself called it ) an ""advantage veterans have rightfully earned for having subscribed and played for longer"". you want to give that rightfully earned ability for training speed to the newest of the new and the most worthless of the unwilling. you are contradicting yourself."
7/1/2010,"i think you are trying to deflect the point i'm trying to make here, or you just don't grasp it. to me this is not a matter of safeguarding advantages for veterans as you are insinuating with your question. the skill-system is designed in a way that puts new players at a disadvantage compared to veterans. therefore, saying that learning skills should be removed because they put new players at a disadvantage is not really a valid argument. obviously, if the goal was to design a skill-system that did not put new players at a disadvantage, then training time should be removed completely.removing learning skills would of course remove one of the disadvantages that new players have to face. so, yes, new players today would have a faster and easier rout to skills compared to those that had very little starting sp, no accelerated training time and had to train learning skills to get up to speed. the question will then be: why stop there? why not keep spoon-feeding new players all kinds of stuff to make it easier on them? because if learning skills are such a turn off for new players, most likely they will find another obstacle they will not like, that will put them off."
7/1/2010,"i in no way mean to show a lack of respect for opposing opinions. however...""in debate or rhetoric, a slippery slope is a classical informal fallacy. a slippery slope argument states that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact, much like an object given a small push over the edge of a slope sliding all the way to the bottom.""while i can understand your concern, you should consider the fact that just this one debate is a very heated and passionate one. both sides bring valid points to the argument. ""if"" learning skills were removed, should any new arguments calling for similar changes appear, i'd be confident that such passions would prevent the ""slippery slope collaspe"" of eve.that said, in my opinion, the cons of learning skills outweigh the pros. whether that holds true to the majority of the playerbase remains to be seen however, and i fully understand the opposition's concerns. i simply mean to show that such an argument isn't really valid."
7/1/2010,"i'm not making that argument though. i don't give a toss if veterans have 50 or 500 million more skill points than me since i'm not in direct competition with them. its those who don't want learning skills removed that say its unfair to vets and will close the gap. i don't care, i just want the extremely strong incentive for new players to not train useful skills for their first days/weeks/months to be removed. if they rolled that time into slightly longer training time needed for other skills, it'd be a decent compromise.edit : and yeah, the slippery slope argument is weak.edit2 : and i think learning skills are sufficiently different to other skills that to justify removing them. note the absence of any other complaints about other skill training times."
7/1/2010,"yes, but trying to misconstrue someones argument is also common in rhetoric. the point im trying to make here is that the same logic that is being used to argue that training skills should be removed, can be used to argue that training time for skills should be shortened or even removed. learning skills are not fundamentally different from the skill system as a whole. acquiring skill takes time. that is the fundamental trait of the system.this is not a slippery slope argument. for example, saying that you should not yield to terrorist demands because that will lead to more terrorism, is not a slippery slope argument even if it could be construed to be such an argument.a slippery slope argument is more like if you try weed you are bound to end up as heavy drug addict"
7/1/2010,"it's definitely a slippery slope. the fallacy is avoided because the middle ground is acknowledged. you guys do know that there are other possible compromises on the learning skill situation besides the way this is currently drafted, right? this current proposal is simply a welfare bill. free stuff for the needy."
7/1/2010,"ok, well then i think we agree. i was mostly arguing against the essence in many of the arguments and requests raised in these learning skill threads. you mentioned the time aspect though."
7/1/2010,"what!! i have to train advanced spaceship command to level 5 just so i can get into a carrier!? so i train a full month just so that my carrier will align to warp 0.4 seconds faster? ccp are you kidding me? gee, that is a really fun game you have here - not! if advanced spaceship command lvl 5 is a prerequisite it does not add anything to the game. everyone who want to fly a carrier must train it. remove that skill and just bump up the agility stat for capital ships. this is a major turn off for new players who want to get into capital ships. this need to change ccp.and learning skills also of course. learning skills should also be removed./parodyedit: ok, this was semi-trolling but i think the point being made is valid. anyway, this will be my last input on this matter."
7/1/2010,"everyone's thinking it...you build a colony, position who knows how many extractors, link them all here and there. and then what?every day, you log in, and aggravate your carpel tunnel by having to resurvey and reset every single one.so how's about we get a quick option through the command center (which is otherwise a completely useless object).[reset extractors]- [5 minute cycle - 30 minutes to depletion]- [15 minute cycle - 5 hours to depletion]- [30 minute cycle - 23 hours to depletion]- [1 hour cycle - 96 hours to depletion][submit]"

7/1/2010,i can't sleep every night because i've lost so much sp.
7/1/2010,"the way ccp could do it :total of sps of the character / number of total months subscribed = average sps per monthafter you look at the number of month the character wasnt active and voila !ex : a character has 30000000 sps and played a total of 25 months = an average of 1200000 per month.that character stoped on and off for a total of 5 months, so :5 x 1200000 = 6000000 of sps he can buy.5 x 14.95$ = 74.75$ for the total.a character could never exeed the maximum possible of sp he could have, related to the number of years/months he/she exist.and even with a new influx of sp, the character will need isk to buy skills and stuff, so that will still be advantagous to players who are active."

7/1/2010,"if poeple stopped playing then no, this idea is not supported. they quit the game, they know whats happening to their skill points.i will only support this option if one person payed for an account and in that time, if he lost sp because of x reason like a patch, bad schedule or so then yes.for the new guys: we didnt have any skill queue so we had to fix our work (or school) schedule for eve's skill system."
7/1/2010,"absolutely not.if you quit playing, that is your perogative, but don't expect to jump back in and buy your way back to an even footing with those who stay. if you plan on playing again in the future, keep your skills training - that doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out. i took a break for about three months but i set up my queue to train as long as possible (mostly learning skills) and logged-in periodically to keep it full. when i came back, i lost nothing except the isk earnings (which you can buy back by selling gtcs in the forum, which i did ) and i actually got a jump on the game by having my learning skills all but maxxed-out.an unequivical not supported."
7/1/2010,"i totaly agree with you, this is the way to go about it normaly, you just train your skills and dont realy play.but sometimes, players simply dont have the choice of continuing to pay per month and need to stop.

7/1/2010,"missions=> after you clear a room of all enemies, you become able to bookmark that space, to come back later without passing all gates again. scanning and gating mechanics remain otherwise unchanged.mission bookmarks- pros (require you to -actively- bookmark space):<U+FFFD> great increase in mission space gameplay value thanks to the reduction of travel times. you can only bookmark and warp back to a gate that's clear of enemies.<U+FFFD> eliminates the unnecessary grief and annoyment of returning to a mission after a few hours, for whatever reason(particularly important for casual players, or for long missions).<U+FFFD> allows pve configured ships to quickly:- warp-out- refit- warp-inwhen pvp threatened in pve space, opening a pvp scenario currently unavailable, and very interesting. at the moment a carebear can be tracked and jumped to into pve space, but he can't do the same with his mission!!! ridiculous.<U+FFFD> streamlines salvaging/ looting in active missions. makes it actually less boring.- cons<U+FFFD> none. you have to bookmark to benefit from anything."
7/1/2010,"uhm ... if someone probes you out in a mission, they have to jump through all the gates aswell. they cant warp directly into your current pocket."
7/1/2010,"none of those pros are really good in my opinion.pve players should be penalised from fitting their ship badly for a mission, or if they need to constantly warp out to repair. personally i think they're far too generous in letting you warp out at all. in most mmos if you get in over your head in a dungeon, you die with little or no possibility of fleeing.and it would make plexing/missioning in lowsec less safe, since you can often spot an incoming gankfleet on your d scanner as they go through the gates. with your suggestion they could scan and warp to you directly with much less warning time."
7/1/2010,"in most mmo's you do not loose all your gear instantly upon death, which may be months of work. regardles, i don't care what most csm's have/ that's why i play eve, and not soemthing else. most mmo's don't have csm, should we go down to their level?"
7/1/2010,"so ""don't fly what you can't afford to lose"" shouldn't apply to pve in eve?"
7/1/2010,"sorry but i don't think you get it.gating/ scanning/ everything is unchanged.the only variation is that you can bookmark gates you cleared from enemies.i'm sure you understand that this does not affect your actual ability to warp from an enemy populated gate (which you can't bookmark and warp in to, exactly as of now).i'm sure you understand that this does not affect your ability to track gankfleets in d scanner.if anything, it lets you warp out fast, re-fit, warp in to a pocket where ai is not pounding you, and be ready for some pvp.oh and furthermore:it sure does apply, but this is a case of""don't travel for 5 boring minutes from pockets you cleared hours ago, to reach an enemy populated pocket."",rather."
7/1/2010,obvious stealth ninja salvager buff proposal is obvious.epic fail.not supported.psst: pro noob tip - there's these neat little mods called afterburners? duh?
7/1/2010,"so ninja salvagers are going to have bookmarks two rooms deep inside a mission? ninja salvagers are going to want bookmarks two rooms deep inside a mission? i'm not a fan of the idea, but your argument sucks."
7/1/2010,this please
7/1/2010,its the sheer number of clicks that i cant hack.
7/1/2010,yes - reduction in clicks once set up would make a big difference to my rsi
7/1/2010,"i concur, please seed the bpo"
7/1/2010,"i fully support this! since eve is a sandbox game attempting to mimic real life principals, it seems to me that someone should be able to reverse-engineer this ship, to create more, and even to improve on its design, creating t2 and even t3 versions.the unique nature of the free ship can still remain intact, as the bpo won't be of the free ship, but rather an alternate iteration, either with a different paintjob, or different or expanded cargo, specs, etc."
7/1/2010,"there should be a production bpc/bpo version of this hull. it does not need to be the same ship stat wise with the primea, but this ship mesh should not be wasted on a one-off ship that will never see space."
7/1/2010,i love this idea. eve gate really needs more features such as this too. being able to communicate in alliance chat while on the web page would be even better but something similar to google chat and how it seamlessly integrates with checking your email would be great.
7/1/2010,towels are the answer to fix lag.100% supported
7/1/2010,"i'd support this 42 times if i could be bothered to make that many new accounts.i know where my towel is, and it's not in eve. this is wrong."
7/1/2010,not to mention using your towel to fan out fires on your ship when you hit structure damage! this is a safety hazard! lives are at stake!
7/1/2010,"now looking at my trusted capsuleer alter ego's name, there's really no way for me not to support this ;)bring me a towel! minmatar colours if possible! ... and a shrubbery!"
7/1/2010,"tunnel vision much? a lot of dual screen people would be negatively affected by this brainfart of yours. i run my client on one screen, and my browser / comms on the other. windowed mode allows me to easily switch between my client and the peripheral programs i run, without the bulky minimization / maximization."
7/1/2010,"when i first saw this thread i thought ""**** off!""but then i thought to myself that might be a bit harsh and decided to actually read your thread.my response now after considering your argument is....**** off! you moronic idiot!i hope this criticism will assist you in your future forum endeavorers in the hope that next time you decide to share with us another of your brilliant ideas.....you don't."
7/1/2010,i guess i'm a bot. i will now go report myself :(.
7/1/2010,here we go again... a guy that thinks that he's the center of this game and wants to eliminate all options that he isn't using.there are computer configurations where you must use windowed mode or your client will crash very frequently. now back to your troll cave... go on... shoo...
7/1/2010,**** off! you moronic idiot!
7/1/2010,so if you alt+tab to open your second client the first will close;if you alt tab to open vent the client will close;and so on.please next time read what i am commenting.
7/1/2010,"no way! some people actually have 2 screens. its ineffective as hell to scout in full screen mode, when you can just throw it in windowed mode and have both ships up and ready to move. before you tell me to have a friend scout for me: who would do something as boring as that while the rest gets the fun fight you worked for and only get to see?"
7/1/2010,"the most obvious group this would hurt is the roaming gang, who almost always tends to use ventrilo or teamspeak due to eve voice's general insufficiency for fleet ops (inability to adjust volumes easily, user limit in large fleets, inability to have multiple groups easily). another group this would hurt is the legitimate miner. mining, especially ice mining, is tedious and boring, and most miners i know will either be running vent to talk to each other while mining or will be running firefox to browse forums and websites while waiting for the cycle to finish. the orca pilot, who isn't doing anything at all, is especially likely to do this assuming he's not an alt.what group doesn't this hurt? macroers. why? they would invent ways around it very quickly, since they don't care too much about following the rules of the game as it is.tl;dr - bad idea is bad."
7/1/2010,op: you stole valuable time from my life with that ******ed idea. go away!
7/1/2010,"not supported. nice to see clever people laughing at the fool op.5 year player, only ever used windowed mode here."
7/1/2010,can you just die?
7/1/2010,if window-mode get's removed eve will lose more than half it's subscribers. have fun running your alts without window-mode
7/1/2010,"i will support this if at the same time, they remove the ability to remote anything to someone outside your alliance/corp. npc corps do not count.then, and only then would war decs in high sec be better."
7/1/2010,"hello csm,my thoughts on domination and the general moves to make lowsec / 0.0 more accessible and attractive to highsec dwellers. id like to know if ccp has considered reshaping the security status of some of the quieter parts of eve? a quick check of dotlan maps shows dozens and dozens of systems which are off the main traffic routes and are away from mission hubs which receive little or no traffic. this is most evident in highsec, where there is little incentive for pilots to inhabit those areas of space.my proposal would be to identify a number of quiet and empty systems and lower their security status to lowsec. these small pockets or islands of lowsec in would give focus to those areas and will encourage pilots to dip their toes into the more dangerous parts of eve in search of better roids, rats and exploration. isk. id go further also. dominion brought about a shift from large alliances holding vast areas of space to one where large alliances dominate but dont hold vast areas of space. if we want to see more smaller alliances holding space we need to free up some space. i would not touch the politics of the larger alliances so my proposal is simple. npcs should vacate some of their nullsec systems. why should they get to hang onto vast areas of space when domination was intended to counter that very problem? lets free up some npc space so that there are more systems which we can fight over. again i would focus these efforts on some of the quieter systems. in summaryconvert dead highsec systems to lowsecconvert some 0.0 npc space to sovereign 0.0 spacekeep up the good work"
7/1/2010,"1) by converting npc 0.0 to sov 0.0 the smaller entities living there will just be pushed out by the larger alliances. not sure if you considered that. however, i agree that with the changes brought with dominion, npc 0.0 could use some looking at.2) empire is small enough as it isso i can't support the proposal in this form."
7/1/2010,1. npc 0.0 is way more fun to roam through than sov space.and it gives everyone the options to dock up when something comes up irl or you run into a blob and need a break. so no to that part.2. what is really wrong with quiet highsec? i mean lots of lowsec around those quiet highsec areas is just as dead. i know lowsec areas where you can do 10-15jumps and you might see 2-3 people in local over the whole trip.so i highly doubt your proposal would bring more live to lowsec. there is enough quiet lowsec out there for grabs.that said ... not supported.
7/1/2010,"quiet parts of highsec are nice for some sem-lucrative exploring in a safer environment then lowsec, or if you don't yet have a combat ship to handle the higher level plexes. fine as they are in my opinion.also, how would converting a ""dead"" highsec area to lowsec make it any less dead?"
7/1/2010,"lowsec is useless, npc 0.0 is awesome, why would anyone want more of lowsec and less npc 0.0?and making it into claimable 0.0 won't open any opportunities to claim them for new alliances. there is plenty of unclaimed 0.0 space even now, try claiming that and see what happens.if it's more fighting then this is the way - 1) npc space should be connected to lowsec(like curse/syndicate), not surrounded by claimable space1a) more npc territory in delve and fountain(12 and 7 systems for major pirate factions, really?)2) more stations - great wildlands/outer ring are pathetic, venal is only slightly better3) add lvl 5 pirate agents and clusters of lvl 4 q20 agents(where those aren't present already)there, now there is fighting all over npc space"
7/1/2010,"not all npc 0.0 was created equally. maybe my view of npc 0.0 life is too heavily influenced by great wildlands where there are just 3 stations serving 101 systems. don't get me wrong, i like npc space. i just don't like to see it under used like in gw. so i get back to the point that if those stupid thukkers won't do something with it, they should give it up :)"
7/1/2010,come down to curse ;)
7/1/2010,"how about: leave lo-sec alone, add 2-3 more npc regions like curse and stain (either of which are probably used by more people than the whole of lo-sec).npc 0.0 is the natural spawning ground for small and new corps and alliances, and we need more, not less of it.lo-sec does need a boost, but simply making more of it wouldn't help anyone."
7/1/2010,"well said malc. low sec's issues are not mentioned in this thread (the size of lowsec has absolutely nothing to do with it) so let's skip that. npc 0.0 does need more stations, but it also simply needs more space. better and more numerous pipelines to sec space would be a plus (nothing like going to roam in npc space and realizing every way in is blocked by a large alliance gate op)."
7/1/2010,fountain core is the best place ever :smug:
7/1/2010,i like complexity for the challenge and if theres a damn good reason for it
7/1/2010,"1) remove local - either make it more like wh space, or get rid of it entirely. if you get rid of the immediate faces, then you won't know there's an unfriendly person in your system until they want you to know. or leave the faces, but use constellation instead, so you aren't sure if they're right behind you, or 3 jumps over.2) implement afk timer - if a character goes inactive for 1hr, they're booted to the login screen. there's nothing in eve that requires your presence, but not your interaction. and if you say you're a cloaked scout, then you should be reporting back every once in a while, not staring at the enemy for over an hour without a sitrep during that time."
7/1/2010,"funny, because as stated above ccp has said they want it implemented, and there are already modules in the game (but not seeded, ofc) that can probe cloaked ships."
7/1/2010,"cloaks have a purpose, to be 100% totally undetectable. now if you could detect what is the purpose then. even if you could probe them down it would put your self in danger. probing requires a lot of attention and time just to find something that may or may not be worth something. probe in low sec or null sec and your asking to be popped. so no."
7/1/2010,"100% agreed. in fact, i think i suggested that before."
7/1/2010,this is something i could go with. too bad it's not the op.
7/1/2010,"every time you click ""scan"" the client sends a request to the server. the server have to process the request by finding all objects that are in your scan range and send the list to your client. your client then have to process the raw message it got from tq and apply a filter so that only the items that are in your overview (if the ""apply overview settings"" box is checked) would be shown in the scan results. additionally, objects must be filtered by angle of your directional scanner.or even worse, the server itself filters your scan results (it would be an odd programing decision, but who knows).so, basically, you are suggesting that there should be a built in option that sends dozens of mostly useless requests per minute just because you want to feel safer.there should be more options that are solving the lag problem, not making it worse. not supported."
7/1/2010,"how about being able to add it as a shortcut, where instead of clicking with the mouse, we could click our keyboard? (like ctrl + something)"
7/1/2010,straw-man much?
7/1/2010,"no. just a programmer... man, i need a vacation."
7/1/2010,it's not a straw-man if he's actually explaining what it is you're asking for.
7/1/2010,"what i'm asking for and what mr smartguy is trying to explain are two different things, as can be gleaned from my posts in this thread. hope this isn't too challenging."
7/1/2010,are you seriously that stupid? the current form of the d-scanner is not balanced in any way towards a predatory style of play. your d-scanner is probably one of the best tools to keep you from being royally screwed whenever you're in a hostile situation (hint: that means its defensive too! omg!)
7/1/2010,"i'm beginning to think you are.are you aware that a pilot in space can be combat-probed in six seconds or less? and that unless you are spamming the scan button at least that much (read: every 6 seconds) you won't see them coming? please explain how a potential target having to smash a button every 6 seconds reasonable while a predator not only can use combat probes, but can also use the d-scanner to avoid having to keep combat probes out too long for detection.so then i ask you, are you seriously that stupid?"
7/1/2010,"6 seconds or less? as far as i'm aware the best time one can achieve on the scan time is 5 seconds. except to get it to that point they have to do a couple of other scans first, move the probes around etc. it takes longer then 6 seconds to scan something down. if you are that scared of probers just dock up when you see unfamiliar faces in local. or make sure you pay attn to the d-scanner. i've never been jumped unawares when using it. further, supposing i have been jumped unaware it would be because i didn't notice something already available to me (either a new guy in local or a ship on the scan list) i don't see how this proposal would improve upon that in anyway."
7/1/2010,"right. he's explaining what would happen if ccp did it, you're describing a fantasy world where computers don't need to do calculations in order to give you data. directional scanner, not scan probes."
7/1/2010,"it'll just create entrenched industrial class, making it impossible for new characters to compete, even if they max out skills. not supported.t2 bpos need to go. the 2 systems cannot coexist. reimburse the market value and get it over with."
7/1/2010,"yes, the idea is tempting, but as said previously it isn't eve. eve is the only game where you don't get any skills by grinding until your eyes bleed and i like it that way. i agree that t2 bpos are unfair at this moment and i'll bet they will fix them the moment i get my hands on one.not supported in this form.edit: by the way, excellent photoshop skills"
7/1/2010,while i would like to see t2 bpos go i suspect that will never happen.this is pretty close to a ideal solution.
7/1/2010,"ok, so after a couple of weeks i can ""invent"" a t2 bpo of module a from a t1 bpo.so i buy a t1 bpo and make a t2 bpo of it. after adding all the costs i sell it at a ""reasonable"" 10.000% mark up (if i am the first to make it).next day/week/whatever is the time to build it i sell the next at a 1.000% markup as teens of people has done the same.after another cycle i sell at a 1005 markup on my production costs. in the meantime the profits of inventors of module a have gone from good returns to 0 as all the competitors now have bpo. the production of the t2 bpo stay (mostly) in the hands of the few guys that have developed the skill first as inventing become an added cost to develop the skill and producing from invented bpc (at least for ships) will be done at a net, large loss. so unless you reset the counter every time a guy produce a t2 bpo you have just killed the invention market in a few weeks/months.even if the counter is reset you don't cure the basic flaw depicted above, you only make the death slower and more agonizing."
7/1/2010,"no. you did not seem to have read and understood what this is about before posting. you should have an actual look at it. you might like it.after several years of making the same t2 bpc day after day, having your invention queue filled 23/7, your character ""understands what it takes"" and can build t2 products from t1 bpo's. some people seem to think that this is grinding. there is a nomad jump freighter laughing at that idea right now. if you really consider something that takes a month for the bpo to be copied for invention, and if it took a decade for your character to obtain the ability to create nomads from a fenrir bpo, you have an amazingly different view of what 'grinding' is compared to me.there is a comfortable balance here which seems very logical too me."
7/1/2010,"the idea doesn't appear to have been inventing a t2 bpo - the idea is that your character can now build that t2 item from any t1 bpo/bpc. the knowledge was stored in the character sheet, and as such isn't transferrable any more than skillpoints are.again, this seems like a totally reasonable way to conquer the gap between t2 bpos and invention without obsoleting t2 bpos - or even significantly hurting their utility.-liang"
7/1/2010,"heres the problem.your objective is higher profits on invention and higher profits from producing.if there is no risk (the risk of failure), everyone and their dog can do it, this drives the price down. the more people with a 0% failure rate, the more products on the market, the more products on the market, the lower your profit margins.invention was wildly profitable when it was first implemented, and then it was made 10 times easier when ccp discovered a huge t2 bpo cartel that had the main objective of rmt. they wanted to ensure nobody could make a living off of t2 bpo's in real life, and they succeeded at that.inventors themselves drive the price down, the only reason why there is _any_ profit in some items is because of the failures. if there was no failures, it would be just as profitable as t1 production.if you want t2 invention to be just like t1 production, then this is for you.add on top of that, the fact that most inventors can't do math and don't use excel when producing, and don't realise they are losing money and they keep having to buy gtc's to fund their production lines, and you have a situation where you can never profit.there are plenty of items that have no t2 bpo's and they don't produc a profit either.t2 bpos will phase themselves out slowly over time as the old timers quit. a lot of my own t2 prints aren't being used right now, mostly because i'm lazy and i already have the most pimp ships in the game."
7/1/2010,"yes, because making t2 bpo production trivial for any halfway serious industrialist won't make real t2 bpos obsolete. i don't think you've quite thought through the consequences of this proposal after the first few weeks of it being in game."
7/1/2010,"short cut to launch ""which"" drones?some ships have more than one set of drones. i even hear that carriers might have multiple sets, (those cheating bastards) so which drone will get launched when you press your new key?"
7/1/2010,supported!
7/1/2010,"i use drone shortcuts a lot, but i never missed a launch drones command tbh. still useful and supported."
7/1/2010,"well almoust everything can be built at pos except the new starbase structures. a new factory would be wellcome, or adding the ability to build the structures at an existing type of factory. would be beneficial in both high-sec (where npc factories are overcrowded) and deep 0.0 with purpose of colonizing the respective system / constelation / region. even if pi is player orientated all the final products are intended for strict corporate use (p4's)"
7/1/2010,"this was already proposed a couple weeks ago, no need for a second thread."
7/1/2010,"please add a new column to this view that lets you see at a glance what meta level a module is.being able to order by multiple columns would be amazing too; in certain ms products like the dynamics crm, you can hold the shift key and click extra column headers to extend your ordering. for example, this would let you order by high slots that are meta 4.thanks!edit: updated for clarity."
7/1/2010,good idea. would make it much easier to sort/find stuff especially when it comes to things that are not named in a simple way (amarr lasers for example)
7/1/2010,considering the incredibly painful painfulness of sorting through your loot after some missions i dare to say there are very few missionrunners who wouldnt support this
7/1/2010,its amazing how hard it is to see meta level considering what a key stat it is. definitely supported. it should also be listed more clearly in the market overview. would make shopping as a newbie considerably easier.
7/1/2010,"i'm pretty sure that the csm has raised this at least twice already. while i wholeheartedly support the idea, it doesn't need to be raised again."
7/1/2010,"do apologise, i didn't see this topic on the wiki before:"
7/1/2010,yes!or at least offer the option to have the ui remember the password until it is changed.
7/1/2010,fully supported.
7/1/2010,"only half supported.yes this should be done, but coming with this to ccp is only half the story. not only jumpbridge access, also pos shield access should be possible to do completely standing based."
7/1/2010,supported
7/1/2010,1
7/1/2010,i strongly support this idea.
7/1/2010,1
7/1/2010,what the ####?you mean to tell me that what i read about these factions isn't the case in game?bloody hell... that's just wrong.supported.i would fully expect to see these unique stations there.
7/1/2010,approved. the blood raiders also have their own unique battletower/station that looks like a giant fang.
7/1/2010,sounds cool.
7/1/2010,"came expecting rampant stupidity, leaving dissapointed but with a slightly higher opinion of the player base."
7/1/2010,supported.
7/1/2010,"supported. if eve doesn't *already* have this, it should."
7/1/2010,yup.
7/1/2010,just add it allready.
7/1/2010,"personally i like the learning skills they ballence off that ""do i want more now or much more later"" that people should work out for themselves.when i started i trained the first 3 levels of each skill rather quickly and got the basics to 4 while mixing in other skills, as it should be.then the same with the advanced ones.anywaywhen most people say ""remove the learning skills"" they always add in ""and give everyone +10 attributes""why?if it's not worth your time to train the learning skills then why should you, and everyone else, get a free boost?i propose that ccp remove the learning skills out right with no change to attributes so everyone gets set back to base learning skills.then they introduce a number of new implants taking us from a max of +5 to a max of +15 points on the implant.+1 to +10 should be moderatly priced in a way that doesn't gimp pvp when you have a full set in your head or it'll just cripple it more than lag does.possibly even some kind of ""life insurance policy"" could be setup the same as with ships.+11 to +15 should be chicken teeth in price with +15 being painfully expensive.all the extra gunnery bonuses etc should be either moved to the +11 to +15 range or boosted for that range.maybe a 1% on +1s, 2% on +2s, etc.i'd also like to see blueprints for implants and possibly even salvaging of biomass to spir on this new line of production.it'd break cost down (roughly and off the top of my head) as+1 = 1,000+2 = 2,500+3 = 6,250+4 = 15,625+5 = 39,062+6 = 97,656+7 = 244,140+8 = 610,351+9 = 1,525,878+10 = 3,814,697+11 = 9,536,743+12 = 23,841,857+13 = 59,604,644+14 = 149,011,611+15 = 372,529,029that's just multiplying the previous value by 2.5at a minimum i'd like to see reprocessing of biomass for materias so i can build ships out of the dead but that's another thing.so, eveforumgoers, tell me how much i suck :)"
7/1/2010,"i had to lol, because that is exactly the opposite of what i'd propose: remove attribute implants altogether. your proposal exacerbates the following issues:1) it is an additional disadvatage to newer/poorer players; ""pay to advance"" is bad game design.2) even more hassle to keep using jump clones (and wait on timers) for doing pvp to protect expensive implants and be able to benefit from them when not pewing.so: hell no.edit: when removing implants, give players +5 to attributes across the board to compensate. those who already have implants (pluged in and not) can reimburse them for the isk and lp they are worth in the lp store."
7/1/2010,"its not a bad idea. i don't particularly like the ""give everyone 10 attributes"" idea either.prices are a little off though i think. based on your pricing just about anyone would be able to afford a set of +10s, which is comparable to 5/5 learning skills now, and i'm fairly certain most people do not have 5/5 learning. to have the equivalent of 5/4 and a set of +5s, it would be about 60mil per implant. not sure that is a steep enough price to pay, considering +5 implants are what, 100 mil per if not more currently? in any regard, balancing around price is never really a good idea."
7/1/2010,"what about those that buy implants for +% on various skills, like gunnery etc?i'd like to see the jc timers lowered or a skill introduced that lowers them too.in eve, you're constantly paying to advanced, what with it being a time based system.the numbers i used are incredibly rough and would obviously need alot of balancing, it's more to give an idea of concept rather than final numbers."
7/1/2010,"they remain untouched. i only cited attribute implants.yes, me too, but that's another battle...you can't throw it all into the same basket. there are fixed, one-time isk sinks like skillbooks, which everyone wanting to do certain things must pay. i was referring to game mechanics that allow players to advance faster than others by paying currency. like i said, this would again benefit the rich, while at the same time subverting the concept of eve being a time based game."
7/1/2010,i have my guys to the equivelent of the plus nine if you dont count the learning skill itself. that means that instead of buying a plus 5 implant for 115 million i have to pay a 30 mil mark up per slot for that? your pricing is good but when it gets to the high end is a tad out of sync. my carrier clone would need the plus1 13s to be even with what he has now and instead of his head being worth 100 million when he gets podded in his fours its now 300. the one though 10 price is decent. but when you get to implants that actually matter your being quite prohibitive with a 323% percent mark up for the best one compared to now per slot.
7/1/2010,"eve is all about blobbing more then your enemy. very small roams have a big disadvantage and almost everytime get outblobbed.so i was thinking, how do you prevent more people to get into the fight and thus preventing blobbing the enemy. i came up with this:give a pilot the option to put up a bubble, like a pos shield, but with the difference that people can shoot eachother inside the bubble. pilots can leave the bubble but can't get in, not even friendlies. the idea is to keep people out of the fight. the attacking force still needs to scam/web the ship or else it will escape ;)how such a bubble is created is up to the devs. i think a form of launcher (like a probe launcher) would be nice, this way even 1 man gangs can fly the ship they want and use this option."
7/1/2010,"no. eve is all about player co-operation. if i can't ask my corp for assistance, then eve is no longer about tactics or cooperation."
7/1/2010,well.. it forces you to play more with others rather then rat/plex/mine alone
7/1/2010,i cant see how this would *not* be abused. not supported.
7/1/2010,please allow this in high sec so that i can put one ontop of every gate in jita preventing anybody's escape.
7/1/2010,1. scan mission2. bubble the gate so its covered3. laugh when mission runner comes back to salvage4. tears
7/1/2010,"""once and for all""... how naive of you to think that something ccp makes will ever be finished/bugfree/definite.nevertheless, the ui is by far the worst technical aspect of eve (among the things that are not obviously broken at least), so i can support this. it looks and behaves dated like the window manager of an obscure *nix operating system from the 90s, just much buggier. it is an example of practically almost all usability sins that can be committed.lemme just list what i think are the most annoying things of the ui:- randomly repositioning windows - clicking buttons doesnt always yield a result at all (there is a right and wrong moment, which for a new players is not distinguishable) - lists that dont sort as they should- lists showing objects that should be filtered (yep, shoot friendlies)- resetting scrollbar positions (the joy of trying to find a target beginning with m in a large fleet fight)- trying to explain to a newbie how to set up his overview- the nightmare of corp member roles and rights management- the nightmare of managing and configuring poss (includes non-descript options and access configuration which has no effect because the feature never got finished) - missing visual differentiation of items with values differing by a factor of one million- certain server requests make the eve client hang until a response is given- 5th level right-click-submenus- overlapping notification messages- no good solution for dealing with the proliferation of windows- the general amount of clicks or ui steps to achieve a result- when setting something up that takes 20 clicks, only the last click will give an error message if something is missing- no differentiation between alerts of varying importance (this monument represents is displayed exactly the same way as one saying if you do this you will die)- the ugly font- a large portion of the key shortcuts cannot be remappedthe list goes on and on..."
7/1/2010,"i have been pretty tolerant of the broken features after a new release, but today i discover that the autopilot is borked; essentially rendering my day for eve, a day for something else instead. while the post release bugs have often seemed random enough to remind me of what the ms operating system hairball must actually look like, when something as fundamental as autopilot is broken in a release i think that ccp is relying on us end users just a little to much to do their work for them.i propose that the next major upgrade have no new features and consist entirely of fixing everything that has been broken by the last 10 as well as maybe reworking the software architecture a bit to keep them from embarrassing themselves worse than they have by this latest random tragedy."
7/1/2010,"um... the patch you are looking for will be arriving tomorrow. but yeah, i agree with the general point, one expansion of just fleshing out old features and fixing bugs/rebalancing would be nice."
7/1/2010,"time for ccp to dig up their no new features shirts.starting to think that this might be symptom of the eve's bastardisation of the subscription model breaking down.is it the case that plex have caused ccp to chase new subscriptions to the point that their model no longer provides cashflow without feature creep?could this possibly be the reason why ccp is releasing expansion after expansion with no bug fixes or rebalancing etc?are there simply not enough existing customers paying subscription fees, forcing ccp must chase these new customers who buy plex at the expensive of all others?how long is that approach sustainable before eve suffers a mass exodus?"
7/1/2010,"what? i really don't understand how your antecedent leads to your conclusion. if there is a connection between the op and the ""bastard eve subscription model"" you have failed to make it clear in anyway what that actually might be.also you do realize that plex's ultimately derive from cash spent right?"
7/1/2010,i remember the boot.ini bug... that was fundamental. who uses autopilot anyway? especially without cheking the route lol. the bug that sends all minnie mission runners to the same system combined with the ap bug has made low sec what it was always supposed to be. full of targets.
7/1/2010,how does this have anything to do with the point in question?first they came for the autopilot.. then they came for somefeature that you use...
7/1/2010,further clarification:try planning a route without it...careful reading does wonders for the mind.
7/1/2010,"not supported. we pay ccp to do their job - they should do it. ...and you're forgetting about the amount of trolls on this forum believe me, you don't even want to imagine what kind of ""artwork"" would flood the forum."
7/1/2010,ccp seems to hire from their player base quite frequently. it's not talent they are having trouble finding it's the scope of their project. i guarantee you they have a busy art dept. they just have different priorities.
7/1/2010,"sure, but don't stop there when you can have like:1) skills manager - he can ""only"" train the skills you already have and not inject new ones. there's no harm in that.2) r&d agents manager - just because you're on some campaign it doesn't mean that you should not harvest your datacores.3) lp store manager - just because you're on some campaign it doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to cash in your loyalty points....terrible idea. not supported."

7/1/2010,reserved
7/1/2010,"so there's a cap of nine issues, twice a month? that seems remarkably low."
7/1/2010,"yeah, surely giving ccp 19 or 29 issues a month to look at would be more realistic."
7/1/2010,"1) not everything that hits the csm meeting stage gets passed. i'd say you probably lose a third or so to being voted down. 2) it's a maximum, not an average. the average has always been lower than 18 per month except at the very beginning of csm1, but there have been plenty of big meetings with a lot more than nine issues raised - either for reasons of deadlines, or simply because it was a good week on the assembly hall. i'd rather let big meetings happen, because in practice, the result of issues being pushed back is that 2/3 are forgotten entirely. 3) there's a lot of really minor issues out there, and i have no objection to throwing them at ccp's feet en masse. i wrote a blog post about this topic if you care about my thinking in detail, but basically i think the csm needs to split issues into two piles. big stuff needs a more comprehensive process than csm issues have at present, small issues need a faster process than the csm uses right now. if small issues are done in bulk, there's no great reason to limit yourself."
7/1/2010,"we have 10 meetings between now and the next summit and 9 issues per meeting means potentially 90 issues can be discussed. on past performance it is likely the majority will be passed. 9 issues will take between 1.5-2 hours to discuss. the longer a single meeting runs the more likely people won't pay attention.for comparison, csm4 handled 76 issues in total during its term, of which about 17 were rejected. also note that only 2 meetings during csm4 handled more than 9 issues.it is also getting increasingly hard to find well supported issues in the assembly hall which haven't already been raised by a previous csm. most proposals only gain 20-30 supports but to make up the quota get raised anyway.csm already have ~180 issues in the eve backlog and i see little point in trying to double that in the next 6 months. instead we need to focus on raising the most important issues and working with ccp on items already in development. hopefully we can help them avoid making another pi introduction balls-up..."
7/1/2010,"a backlog of 180 issues and a 75% pass rate says to me that the csm needs to apply a much more rigorous standard to passing issues. passing stuff on the basis of ""yeah i guess this would be cool to have and i can't see how it would hurt anything"" is simply not appropriate when ccp evidently dont have the resources available for looking at ""this is a gamebreakingly awful issue that was raised 18 months ago"".if you have 10 meetings a year, then passing an average of one major issue and maybe 1-2 minor tweaks (dont tell me that a lot of coding needs to be done to change the rocket stats) per meeting is enough and more than enough imo.we can ask you as our representatives to load ccp with a backlog sufficient to lst them until sol goes in to it's red giant phase, but if the truly important stuff is getting lost in the noise, then it's harming our game, not helping it."
7/1/2010,"is there any chance that maybe at some point you stop asking ccp for the moon on a stick?you've had your answer, they don't have time to do pretty much anything, so there's not even any point the csm talking about any issue that sounds like it's more than a couple of days work for a single person.i recognise that it would be ""way cool"" to have ccp do something that your name was once on the internet near, but face reality, it's not going to happen.please champion some of these little things for a change. i hear something about rockets a lot, whichever csm5 delegate gets one tiny change out of ccp will gain more kudos than the delegate that has the grandest proposal rejected, yet again, by ccp.how about it?"
7/1/2010,"firstly we raise player proposals most of the time (at least i do) and many of those are ""simple"" fixes. i have no clue where you got the idea that we only champion whole expansion level features.secondly ccp class many of the minor issues we bring up as bugfixes and indicated that our time would be better spent on bigger picture issues (which is why the summit format changed)."
7/1/2010,i would like to raise this issue:eve nebulaevelopedia link
7/1/2010,"firstly, from the last csm meeting minutes.secondly, ccp classing bugfixes as so irrelevant even the csm shouldn't speak of them is good enough reason to speak of them.thirdly, the holiday in iceland yielded precisely nothing according to all your wildly differing blogs/rants/attack pieces. the only thing that differs is the words used to describe the nothingness, ranging from frustrating nothing to extremely positive nothing, with ccp's commitments to anything other than eve as the main reason nothing is getting done.i don't remember the last csm or any csm asking for clickyfarmville on planets, sure you'll be able to find a couple of lines in some meeting where somebody said ""planets, what are they for, can we have those?"" and not a lot else, but the csm can't even get bugs fixed, let alone expansions nailed out.but if you want to go right ahead pretending you're shaping eve i'll be jiggered if i'm going to try and stop you. we'll just keep on not getting listened to by the csm which doesn't get listened to by ccp."
7/1/2010,"you know, there was one csm member who expressed admiration of 'farmville in space'."
7/1/2010,"anyone willing to take this back again?as shown through continued support, this is still wanted.the resurrection: the dead horse pos thread comes back to life!!wikito date we have only ever seen references to what ccp has said about this topic, and no real in depth discussion about it, while we know ccp has talked to the csm about it, can any more information on those discussions be disclosed?on a slightly different issue, the minutes on the last csm summit meeting to iceland were very vague, and didn't go very deep into any details. i at least and most likely quite a few others, would like a copy of the raw notes from this meeting, with just the information that would fall under the nda to be removed. i'm not sure how ccp or the csm feel about it, but i think the notes taken by the csm were better, because they were more detailed."
7/1/2010,"i get it that you dislike the csm, but if you are going to troll at least check the facts before you make a bigger fool of yourself.lets look at the moon on a stick expansion level features raised during the last meeting... improve overload user interface dynamic missions targeting from broadcast history spreading out mission runners colour stars by: systems i can jump to commit to fixing the uiyep, some good moon on a stick things there, glad to see we are ignoring all the little issues like you suggest we are in fact the only one that could be classed as an expansion level feature was fix factional warfare and that was voted down because it was already in the backlog and we had a whole session on it at the summit.also look at csm4 for another long list of smaller fixes suggested by playersyes and no. there is no point spending a 50min session on an issue if it boils down tocsm: x is broken, it is doing y instead of zccp: that is a bug, we'll look into it45 mins of tumbleweedany player can (and should!) bug report things so they get entered into the system. ccp are moving towards using the csm to discuss stuff under nda which they can't discuss with the rest of the players yet.your points would carry more weight if you didn't bring out the old chestnut of ""holiday in iceland"" instead of ""3 days of constant meetings for 8-10 hours"".we can't release the full details of the meetings till ccp publish the minutes and then it will be at least 6 months till we see if anything has been taken on board.or did you expect lag to be fixed as soon as the csm discussed it with ccp?if you can point to where the csm isn't listening to your fabulous proposals instead of whining about ""free holidays"" then perhaps we can help"
7/1/2010,"nothing new to say about this, other than csm keep pushing for it and ccp keep saying it is in the backlog.csm didn't get any raw logs from the csm4 summit so i think it unlikely but we'll bring it up and see what happens."
7/1/2010,"if you think those things are easy, it's you that is making the bigger fool of yourself, as if that were even possible after everything we've had to endure from csm5 so far.did you miss the bit where ccp told you that they had nothing for you, no resources at all? because i didn't miss it, it was pretty damm stark. they might have a person available to make the overload button into a rectangle that's ugly but functional, but you think they're going to make a bit of the ui functional, especially if it's ugly?you spend the 45 minutes discussing why these bugs aren't getting addressed for years, literally years, not figuratively years, not throwing spoons and blogging against each other.if the csm comprised a group of individuals with years of experience at designing things everybody can tolerate instead of a group of people who think they know what they want, i can see a reason for ccp trusting them with heads up data.yours would if something got done. as it is, 3 days in iceland throwing spoons, drinking and blogging sounds a lot like a holiday to me.and as it's all on the hush hush, ccp can claim anything they like about it in the marketing media.for saying i was on about avoiding moons on sticks, that's a pretty neat way to make a big fool of yourself. i did not say csm was ignoring my proposals did i? i don't think i did, maybe you are answering somebody else without realising it?and no, you can't help. i've seen that already. it was for my own education i even looked at the csm since it won't just go away gracefully. sadly, it's as relevant as i had always feared, and it's worthiness is reflected well by ccp's commitment to it, and the careful consideration given by a very small percentage of eligible voters, it will never be relevant without massive reform."
7/1/2010,"reading the raw meeting log, i'll be surprised if they can fit 9 issues in per meeting."
7/1/2010,"""...were in iceland""."
7/1/2010,"i would like to express my gratitude towards all csm members who sacrifice quit some of their game and free time towards helping to better the game.having been in a sortlike position in another direction i can tell it's a lot of work and a lot of times people don't realise that the return for those who do this work is negligeable or even none present.a lot of times they get people telling them how it would have been better, but when looking at it those are always people who never step up to any responcebility when it comes to it.i am going to say something blasphemous now, but i see the csm contributing as much to eve as chribba. each in it's own unique way. i am sure a lot of people won't agree with the previous statement, but that is as i see it.so yes, it's easy to say it's all going too slow or certain issues don't get handled, but when push comes to shove they are going for key issues.seeing the limitations which the csm has to get it's workload done in i can only say i am pleasantly surprised.some leeway towards these players should be given.sincere,kg"
7/1/2010,"i was wondering if the csm could clarify a few questions i have regarding the processes necessary to raise an issue during a meeting.1. how many support votes are necessary before an issue is ""popular"" enough to bring to the meeting?2. are votes really needed at all?3. once an issue is raised, but is turned down by the council majority, can that issue be reworked and be presented again? is there a limit to how many times this can occur?bout it really."
7/1/2010,"1) that's up to the judgement of the individual csm member. 2) not needed per se, but they are a useful method of finding out what the community thinks on an issue. 3) in theory yes, but in practice no issue has ever been brought up more than twice."
7/1/2010,so what you are saying is when tq becomes sentient it will start fixing bugs?
7/1/2010,i like your usage of the word 'when'.
7/1/2010,"she's right, sokratesz is a jerk :)"
7/1/2010,"ankh, whatever your position on issues is, you have produced a very nice summary. thank you."
7/2/2010,"supported. setting up poses right now is superugly, as is the result you get."
7/2/2010,"please! please! please, ccp! im begging you - make some much needed changes to these ships!ive been training for months to get into one, so please: fix this ship at least within 2010.i dont want to wait years to play in a shiptype i actually like.at the very least increase the jumprange and make bridge activation cost not so hurtful for everything above frigatei'd say base jumprange 3ly, to a maximum of 6.75ly, as that is still not enough to traverse huge amount of spaceand less than titan jumprange, which is pretty hillarious if you ask me :) finally, they need _alot_ more hp than they have now. at least 25% total hp buff.although im not really asking for anything other than jumprange boost at the moment.im having a hard time being useful, and the plea is simple: i want to be able to use the ship i like the most."
7/2/2010,supported.
7/2/2010,1
7/2/2010,"supported.not because i see any indication that ccp will ever act upon it, but the least the playerbase can do is to remind them of their shortcomings every single chance we get."
7/2/2010,omg yes
7/2/2010,"dierdra vaal, i have to agree with you on this. what good is adding content if you can not play it because the base it is add too is unstable?most game companies do not realize the impact that this has on them until it is too late."
7/2/2010,"i completely agree. the excellence slogan has become a cruel joke, especially as ccp does the one thing many of us have defended them by claiming will never happen: allowed incarna and dust to take massive developer priority over eve's core experience.we need you to live up to your motto ccp."
7/2/2010,completely agree.
7/2/2010,"the push for more sisi lag testing is a good step, but we need developer time assigned to fixing and iterating features. finish what you start ccp."
7/2/2010,1
7/2/2010,"whilst i loathe the comparison to that awful piece of legislation, i fully support this."
7/2/2010,what better way to spend a free activation than to support this proposal. i dont think there is anything that shows more how great a game eve is then the community around it. even after people have stopped playing because of the lack of development. if ccp commits to dierdras proposal im certain eve will become the first real mmorpg ever made.
7/2/2010,"supportedwhile i support it, i didn't check the box because i think that by making it an aggressive act you impair mission runners, since i don't think there will be a way ccp can recognize whether they are repping you while being attacked by an npc or a player.cheers!"
7/2/2010,"i was thinking, maybe i should petition every single blaster boat i lose because ccp are too lazy to fix this problem. the only thing they might be able to understand is harrassment.give blasters more range ffs!!"
7/2/2010,"blasters+ range boost = pulsesdo not brake races tactics balance.blaster boats need damage boost to compensate all disadvantages (range, cap use, fixed damage, big fitting requirements)"
7/2/2010,"this makes sence. i think this is a must, carriers should have had this when the first one roled off the assembly line. they are a logistics boat after all. i think there should be several options to heal your drone without using your rr. these two are off the top of my head.1) slow passive regen once the repair order is issued (doubled or tripled in traige)2) a quick nanite repair paste fix. (near instant)the first should come nothing near that of capital rr. the nanite quick fix should be really fast. and those people complaining about how the carrier could just keep redocking and paste it, whats the big deal? it just like overheating your weapons, turning them off, naniting them, then turning them back on. carriers need this, where are they supposed to repai drone hull damage in the middle of enemy territory? or worse, fighter hull damage. lets face it, remote hull repair is fail. why would you waste a high slot on it when you could control 1 more drone or run another capital rr module?edit: spell fix"
7/2/2010,"unsupported.you've got this ability already. either use your own fitting bay to put on some remote repairers (which should be in your hangar somewhere), or launch damaged drones + a couple of repair drones and fix them using your own drones.crazy though it sounds, i'd support hull repair drones."
7/2/2010,bump!
7/2/2010,"actually, what almost all of you asking for the learning skills to be removed have asked for is the +10 and +10% bonuses provided by those skills for free. several of us for the skills staying have said that if you want to remove them, than simply take them away and the bonus they provide. there is a big difference between asking that the skills are removed and asking for the bonus they provide for free. if all you're truly concerned about is new players being able to train ""fun"" skills without worry of learning skills, then we don't need the bonuses. i've made this point multiple times now, and you've yet to address why it is you want the bonuses even though you want the skills removed. once again, it's simple evidence that you simply want something for free... instead of it truly being a matter of ""helping the new players enjoy the fun of the game without a stupid time sink with no benefits"". after all, it's a worthless time sink with no benefits, so why should you get the bonuses they provide. i'll support the removal of the learning skills without even a redistribution of said points invested if it meant a true removal and none of this instant gratification nonsense you lot keep spouting."
7/2/2010,"and most people think that doubling or even tripling training times would *not* be a good idea. do you have any good reasons as to why we should want doubled or tripled training times?and while we're at it, we really should get rid of those free remaps and accelerated training bonus, and newbie tutorials, or at least start charging for them. us old timers didn't have them in the beginning.is this really about wanting something free, or is this about getting a better value for our 14.99/month?eh? have you not been paying attention? the whole problem is that it's *not* a worthless time sink. it's such an incredibly useful time sink that if you plan on playing the for any length of time, the most logical course of action is to spend the first month+, first remap, and all of your accelerated training time to get the learning skills up to at least 5/4."
7/2/2010,"you will not know how many more people hated and was driven away by the learning skill because you cannot post here without a active account. i myself deleted my character with +5 implants and speak here at the last. training that stuff simply makes me feel silly that i am paying months for nothing, and i was just hijacked by the skills instead of playing because of feeling fun.i simply want to tell ccp that learning skills absulotely screws rookie experence up and whom skills hurting is not only rookies but also you. 3 quarters of the rookies will be driven away by the freaking waiting for something does no help to gameplay and by those geek veterans who are more than happy to make the game geeker. what ccp doing is just blocking money away just for no reason. all my friends invited quited after a few weeks,leaving a character remains capable for nothing.so stop talking about patience! they play for fun and they don't need a game to teach them how miserable and ridiculous life can be, they just chose to not to feel silly.if 90% of rookies are driven away,it is not about patience, it is about a geek system and a desigener's failure.all innovations will annoy someone.so what? should american keep slavery?although some veterans threaten with quit, i am sure they will not abandon their 50m character just because they get 4.5m more for free. all they really lose is just their superiority built up in a game, and that is just because others in the game are crippled. come on , you are not really that pathetic,are you?a fun game is a good game,not a geek one."
7/2/2010,"so when exactly does the game get fun? when you have 5m sp? or is at 10m sp? is there a magical number where the fun suddenly begins? i thought the first month in the game was very fun. i recently took an alt with 1.8 m sp and went through an epic arc in 0.0 flying a rifter. for me it was challenging and fun.i don't really understand all this obsessing with learning skills. you just need to see the bigger picture, that training learning skills means a little progress in every useful skill you yet have to train. they are not fundamentally different from the skill-system as a whole. i don't say this to gloat or to try to push you down. as a veteran player i really don't have anything against you also having fun. there are things in other games that puts me off too. for example, i just had to read a review of a certain blizzard game to know that i never would play that game. of course i could have gone to their forums and complain about how much their game suck and how they should change it to suit me. point being, no game will suit everyone. some will like it, others will not. eve is obviously not an exception here."
7/2/2010,not supported. i say keep the learning skills. i didnt kill all that time spent training them up just to have my attributes taken away. i prefer being able to reduce my training times. i intend to take all the learning skills to level 5 and thats that. if you dont like training the learning skills then do them later once you have something interesting trained up so that you have something to do while you wait. lazyness will get you nowhere in this game.
7/2/2010,"1. read the op post2. if you still don't get it, read again3. goto24. goto25. goto26. goto27. you should've now realized that none wants to take your invested skill points away8. if not, goto2"
7/2/2010,learning skills are nothing but an unnecessary barrier to new players committing to the game. they do not add to the game or improve anyone's play experience.
7/2/2010,"i was just fed up with those ""hardcore moan"" against ""rookie moan"".--we cannot get better ui because we are hardcore,we cannot get bigger texts because we are hardcore,we have to block rookies away and have fewer players because of that ****.everyone brings up rifter when talking about sp problem. rifter may be fun to an alt character who worriies about nothing and can be alted back any time you like. but rifters are not that fun when all you have is rifter and cannot afford to lose it.i had 15m character,but i fully support of removing ls because it is a fun-destoryer. operating spaceships may be fun in this game, training to make your character grow may be fun. being told that you have to train months for nothing is not,and that is exactly what ls tells rookies.it's not about ruining veteran advantages,it's about less unecessary geek hardcore and let more have fun.i hope that the game take some effort to satisfy more people rather than being a ""hardcore"" **** full of pathetic geek.it is ok if the game was intended to be ""hard"" to play,but now to the rookies ,it feels more like eve is ""forbidden"" to play."
7/2/2010,"actually, the easiest one to point out would be that you're against the very skills that have made you use to the current speed. if the skills never existed, you wouldn't know the difference. so i stand by the complete removal.actually, i would personally be all for that since i personally enjoy games that take forever and encourage long bouts of frustration. if the value isn't currently already worth it, why are you paying it/ you're argument doesn't work in your favor since if the current state of the game isn't ""valuable"" enough to pay the $14.99 than you wouldn't be paying it.eh? have you not been paying attention? the whole problem is that it's *not* a worthless time sink. it's such an incredibly useful time sink that if you plan on playing the for any length of time, the most logical course of action is to spend the first month+, first remap, and all of your accelerated training time to get the learning skills up to at least 5/4.which once again be you asking for a skill based bonus for free. if the skill that reduces the total amount of time it takes for every skill in the game is a problematic time sink, than it's total justification that every skill is a problematic time sink and should be removed because we don't want to spend the time to get the benefits.so reducign the tiem ti takes to learn everything else doesn't add to the game? as for improving peoples' experiences, it makes things go faster. please tell me how that isn't improving peoples' experience? since you don't think it is, apparantly, than you probably would agree on simply removign them completely without givign everyoen the attributes bonus.dead wrong. you train months so that you can shave time off of your total skill plan. a good example is getting a new player into a harpy with t2 guns, ab, warp scrambler, stasis field, and rigging takes 70 days according to evemon... withotu learning skills. with learning skills, it takes 54 days. i would say that it's a pretty big difference considerign that every other skill you train is likewise affected. so it's definitely not ""nothing"".you're calling 2 months of trainign for an entire skill tree ""geek hardcore"" when there are individual skills that are as long? if 2 months is ""hardcore"" than perhaps you shouldn't be playing since times only go up from teh start.edit: wrong word."
7/2/2010,"and that's why the pro learning skills crowd will never quit. as long as some people on one side think eve should be fun, and the other side thinks like cash render here, there's never going to be any agreement."
7/2/2010,"you do realize that some people find being ocd about maxing thigns out to be fun, right? personally, i just prefer a game that frustrates me because it means that it's not a game i'll be done with in a month or two. mind you, i think getting actual skills are fun, but getting benefits for nothing is just plain pathetic and a disgrace. it's the first step toward wow'dom."
7/2/2010,"right, which is why the whole debate is pointless since its down to personal preference as to what one enjoys in a game. in any case, ccp have already lowered the prerequisites on skills in the past, probing, thermodynamics, cloaking etc. so its not unlikely that they'd hand out other advantages to newer players in the future. we'll have to wait and see what move the devs make."
7/2/2010,"debates are never pointless as long as they don't turn into a bunch of insults, slander, and childishness. a good debate is always a healthy thing and gives everyoen a chance to see/hear/read both sides of an argument.and waiting for the devs to decide is the only thing any of us can actually do abotu the subject, but doesn't change that we can discuss what we think is best. important thing is to keep it from becominc personal attacks."
7/2/2010,"yeah. the thing is, we're debating whether learning skills are a good thing for new players. and since obviously those who were so put off by them that they stopped playing aren't here to present their views, only the dev team and their customer survey team knows how many of them there are.plus even if they see that more players are put off by them, they might decide they prefer it that way. wouldn't be the first time they've sidelined players' opinions on things."
7/2/2010,"are you ignoring the multiple new players who posted that they appreciated the learning skills as something to slow them down so they could get perspective on this huge new world?and as i've said many times, anyone who sits in the station while training learning skills needs to find another game, cause they won't survive well in eve. while training those skills, you can do some of the career missions, you can learn how boring mining is (or enjoyable, if you like that sort of thing), you can learn to steel cans from noob minors (not condoning of course), you can even venture into low sec... in fact its best to go into low sec early, so you don't risk implants and it will take a while to get the close-to-risk-free jump clones."
7/2/2010,supported 100%
7/2/2010,the pro learning skills crowd will never quit because the anti learning skills crowd is equally relentless. you would like for this to end? give up now.
7/2/2010,supported
7/2/2010,"for a new player, there are just too many skills need to be trained to get to the same level as some one starting out a few years ago since the game dynamics have changed so much over the years.the learning skills were a good time/isk sink back when there were not many skills in the game and players could make isk just in doing one or two things. now we jump to forward and there are now over 350+ skills in the game. isk making has been nerfed to the point that you have to do 4 to 5 different things to make isk to support your self.pvp'ing has also now changed to the point that t2 cruisers/fitted battleships is a normal de facto if you want to have a fair chance at doing it.they need to go."
7/2/2010,use the current system they just implemented and give skillpoints back to those who invested in learningskills. and yes i know most people benefitted from training learningskills but its still skillpoints removed and it should be reimbursed.supported.
7/2/2010,"i'm not ignoring the pro-learning skills newbies, i recognised that its a personal preference thing a post or two ago. my point was that the anti-learning skills newbies who are *really* put off by them obviously aren't here due to no longer playing eve:)and that only ccp have a full picture of which type are the majority from looking at those surveys people fill out when they unsub.and yes, you don't have to sit in a station while you train ls. but that early exploration you suggested would only be more enjoyable if they could actually train skills relevant to each career path. and if you can find one newbie poster who said that early skill progression would be too fast without learning skills to slow it down, i will be very impressed and a little astounded:)"
7/2/2010,"hey i'm all for being able to train faster - approved.i am rather curious though: ccp just awarded every player a set of skill points to allocate wherever they chose.likewise, they could refund all players the sps they put into learning skills. as for the money spent on the books, ccp could also refund them the npc cost of the skill books required for said skills.what did people not like about this solution?"
7/2/2010,people who disapprove: 70% trolls10% are people who couldn't read the suggestion20% are angry vets with no rl and don't want new players to join the game
7/2/2010,"i have a similarly clever list:people who approve of this:50% self-righteous whiners with a run-away sense of entitlement50% drooling, diaper-****ting, booger eatersyou what my list adds to this discussion that yours doesn't? nothing! they are both equally asinine!"
7/2/2010,"sorry, but this type of arguments is very juvenile:if you don't agree with me you must either be stupid, or a troll or you live in momas basement lololololdon't bring this down to this level please.lets try to keep this as a somewhat civil debate although this subject obviously induce a lot of emotions. i think it has been interesting to read both sides of the argument and the video link shows that ccp is aware of that this is a hot potato. will be interesting to see how this will be resolved. the drama!"
7/2/2010,"i am a noob, started just a couple of weeks ago.i'm not in any particular hurry, so as i went through the tutorials and read the wiki, it seemed to me to be the best strategy to train up to learning 5 and the other learning skills to 4. i did and i enjoyed it. i'll still have a few hundred k points of my 1.6 million bonus after analytical mind 5 completes tomorrow -- 83 skills total, about 680k in learning.i only hope the ccp solution is fair for those of us who spent some of their 100% bonus on learning and who have not played the game long enough to fully reap the long-term benefits thereof -- i.e, the opportunity cost. the proposal doesn't seem to consider this. i admit i have not read the bulk of the other messages, so i do not know if someone else has pointed this out. 2x for learning points spent during the bonus might be fair.i do not understand why (1) is fair to those who spent points on learning because those who did not would receive the same benefit."
7/2/2010,i do not support any modification of the learning skillsi have invested time by my own choosing. train them if you want or don't.
7/2/2010,"there are really only two opportunity costs for investing in learning:1) potential time wasted doing activities you are bored because you don't have access to the skills to do activities you really want to do.2) skill points invested in a ""meta skill"" instead of one that would actually get you something.the devs have no control over time and can't give you that back, but they can reimburse your skill points. the proposal does take this into consideration by giving you a temporary boost in training time equivalent to how many sps you've put into learning.it's fair because, without learning skills, all players would be operating at the same training times (not considering implants). personally, i would prefer that we all train faster rather than slower.i forgot about the initial bonus period. this sounds like a good idea - bigger increase in temporary training time boost for sps allocated during bonus period."
7/2/2010,"i'd support this change. learning skills need to be removed.one change i'd make is to not give everyone +10 to each attribute immediately. instead, i'd phase it in gradually as players gain sp. every 500k sp gives someone +1 to an attribute, until they reach +10. this means that new specialty alts won't be able to train incredibly quickly towards specific builds, while new players who play for a few months will still gradually get the +10 bonus."
7/2/2010,"i like this idea, its similar to one the devs suggested in the fanfest video of having a dual progression of learning and regular skills."
7/2/2010,"now this i would support. it would make sense, instead of learning from a book, you learn by doing.i understand now. thank you for clarifying."
7/2/2010,"ccp set it up without batch jobs for a good reason. they don't want people to have to spend 24/7 doing planetary interaction, but they also don't want people to be able to go for more than a couple days without checking their pi. that's what a mini-game design is supposed to be about, and i applaud ccp for this one. although the 1-click extractors would be nice."
7/2/2010,"supported. while its a good thing that you have to check in more often for more efficiency, it doesnt have to be a drag when you do."
7/2/2010,"i really like pi, and i think that overall, they did a really good job with its ui.as a former game development student, i can appreciate how difficult it is to come up with simple details that convey a lot of information (like the rings on the pins).this is a great idea that would make the ui even better.**approved**"
7/2/2010,"supported.they did a great job with pi, this is my only gripe to date.cheers!dardol"

7/2/2010,"while i support a way that enables new players to somehow compete with old ones, microtransactions and total ""reimbursement"" for time you havent actually played eve are not the way to go imo."
7/2/2010,"if you mean by ""play"" log in to train your skills and log off, that would be exactly the same thing that he's proposing. if you log in only for sp, who cares if you can buy back game time you didnt use ?"
7/2/2010,exactly.
7/2/2010,"i think it is a great idea.i don't really see how there is room for exploit - you aren't buying extra sp, just bringing your character back up to speed.as others have already pointed out- you don't get sps in return for playing the game. rather, you receive sps for the amount of licensed (ie paid for) time has passed since your character's creation.and, as others have also pointed out, you already have the option of buying a pre-skilled character from someone else. the only difference is that you'd be paying for the character that you put time into.on a ""respect for diversity"" note, it allows anyone who's run into financial hardship for a couple months to jump back into the game without being penalized.i can't think of any downsides to this, so i'd be interested to see if anybody can think of any legitimate ones."
7/2/2010,"thumbs downcharacter logs in, skills up to whatever he feels at a whim, cancels subscription, comes back 6 months later. repeat process. so basically all you've proposed is incredibly convenient character farming. absolutely no.losing training cause you couldn't pay for a period of time is also not sufficient enough a reason. you weren't out flying and you weren't hold up in some station. in short you were not involved with the eve universe and deserve no skillpoints. infact the only reasons i can think of besides downtimes that would be acceptable for sp allowances would be if you verifiably got hacked or banned from the game later to be found innocent. those are the only two reasons. if you want easy leveling go play something else."
7/2/2010,"what is the difference between paying per month for an account, train alts and sell them, or paying the equivalent number of months after and have the same amount of sp ?if you properly read all that has been said, you'll see that no valuable reasons have come up to counter my idea.and btw, eve is unique in that way, the only game you can evolve and be offline. thats why this is possible."
7/2/2010,"this would be most useful, especially when the inevitable change in pc comes about."
7/2/2010,"supported.just make it so we can rollback settings changes, or rather backup/restore as required. that way if we bust something we can just roll back."

7/2/2010,"bringing the skill differences into the argument is just wrong. someone with tech 2 has actively put that long training time into the weapons skills and there should be a significant difference to justify it. cut the gap and you end up with a scenario where you could spend that time training defensive skills to a higher level than the guy who specialised in gnus yet still end up doing little less damage. people have the choice of training it or not and if they don't shouldn't ***** about the consequences.t2 ammo costs a mint, it should be good.supported."
7/2/2010,"with very few exceptions, all t2 ammo needs to be looked at. there are only a few worth using at all. i haven't spent the time analyzing the situation as thoroughly as others have, there's plenty of good information in the thread already, so i'll leave it at that.i would like to add that faction ammo seems fine as is; it's t1 ammo that does more damage. that's great. t2 ammo should provide something unique and helpful that faction ammo does not. i would also like to see some balance based on the size of the charge itself. what about a close range ac ammo that does excellent damage, but you can only fit half as many rounds in the gun? this would go along with the minmatar philosophy of guerrilla warfare - get in quick, hit something hard, and get out before the duct tape falls off."

7/2/2010,"dynamic agent quality would not in fact help - and the time that you spend ****ing about finding your next agent will guarantee that nobody at all will mission in low sec. fscking stupid idea. now to address the op: i don't think i agree. the real problem is with 0.3 and 0.4 space - since 0.2 space is passable and 0.1 space is nice. the risk differential between 0.1 and 0.4 space is exactly nil, so i think we can safely argue that there should be no reward difference either. thus, i propose that sec status becomes somewhat meaningless in lowsec - with rewards and game mechanics being the same across all of it.-liang"
7/2/2010,"the ""time spent"" would be 30 seconds looking through the agent list. i'm not seeing the issue."
7/2/2010,"while i agree that that is a much solution, that requres alot of effort to implement, and is much more complex. i would definately prefer that, but this imao is better then nothing at all. stupid idea to try populate low-sec? what exactly is stupid? please, propose a better solution, otherwise your ocmment is not very usefull."
7/2/2010,"border lowsecs are more likely to be gatecamped instead of deep low. 0.1 is usually safer than 0.4.carebears stay in highsec or sov-null because it's safe. the only way to populate low is making it safer. before mission scanning, mission runners were in lowsec. then it got implemented and they all left. rewards were never the determining factor to begin with, it's safety."
7/2/2010,"the stupid idea is ****ing about with finding new agents and moving my **** like some kind of ****ing gypsy. setting up a mission hub is a **** ton of work, and redoing it every couple of days is totally unacceptable. yeah, i could do it because i have a couple of carriers.. but no it isn't going to be fun, no it isn't going to be easy, and yes it'll be a massive nerf when compared to today's mission running. i did. or did you stop reading when i told him that his idea was ******ed? -liang"

7/2/2010,"i'm confused though. you say that you would have to move your mission running operation frequently, but you also say that you guarantee that nobody would use the lowsec agents. but the only way the quality would drop is if a lot of people used the agent, frequently, for a long period of time. so why would you have to move if you guarantee nobody would be running missions?"

7/2/2010,"so since it is common knowledge that big alliances rely heavily on naps and blobbing only to achieve anything i think 0.0 should have a battle scenario that involves equal numbers.i understand most alliances will be raging over the curse word known as 'equal' right about now but i am more interested in smaller alliances having a chance where skill > numbersanyway this is how it will be done, current sov mechanics will allow you to capture still however there will be a new method included which applies when engaging smaller coalition or being attacked by them.your powerblock will now actually by default be in a coalition, similar to corps being in an alliance, this is the only way blues, reds and neuts can be made and strictly for 0.0 only as it requires you to get sov (in other words without being in a powerblock you cant get sov) the reason for this is because huge 45k naps is strategy therefore having powerblocks makes sensesay an enemy wishes to capture your system, if your enemy is part of a coalition 50% or more smaller than yours he can op to attack you in a duel like scenario with 50 ships on each side max, a battle will occur in the system that is contested.this battle will happen within 48hrs and the system will have 2 accel gates, 1 accessible to the attacker and 1 to the defender, once ships are at their point and the countdown is over players will see a beacon appear (visible to people who accessed the gate only) from there they will attack.the scenario will include 3 structures which deal damage, 50km apart from the beacon which must be destroyed, the hp of these structures will be determined on the opposite sides fire power, so more fire power brought in = stronger structures (in both fire power and health) this is to prevent nc laming with 50 titans, these structures can also be repairedthe objective is to kill all structures and players, anyone warping wont be able to warp back either and the accel will be locked to everyone once the fight starts, whoever wins this will keep the system.during the 48hr timer players in the coalition will have to assign 50 people they wish to defend them, these people will only be allowed to access the accel gates, this also will be the only way big powerblocks will be able to take sov from smaller ones.since 0.0 naps cry at the littlest things i wouldnt mind seeing something (doesnt have to be this) in 0.0 where skill determines sov, or at least have something like this in lowsec for the sake of population increase."

7/2/2010,"congratulations on actually having an idea this time instead of just saying you dont like something in say lowsec for factional warfare this sounds like a good idea, and i would support it as a possible faction warfare boost/additionbut for 0.01 on a technical side the ammount of processing and admin needed to judge and control such 'duels' would be prohibitive, 0.0 only gets major server power for reinforcing for big fights, this would take so much more effort2 if a powerblock can set reds blues etc then three small powerblocks who total more than one large powerblock could take them down by individually attacking the large powerblock setting it to red and each other neut/blue, then the system would give advantages to the three smaller blocks that are working together even though in total they had more players, that would make it unfair and would result in rules exploits using the letter to break the spiritbut3 at its heart your still saying you want to tell all 0,0 alliances how they play the game because you dont like it, why do you feel you have the right to dictate to themyour last attempt at a post saying the big naps need to end dissapeared into obscurity with little support, do you really feel it will work any better,"

7/2/2010,there is no way to see howmuch m3 you have put into a contract until you click 'next' after the item selection - which can be very annoying if you have to set up multiples and need to go back every time because you went over the limit. this is also very annoying if you are trying to tailer a contract to a specific hauler. a very easy fix would be to add a counter that keeps howmuch m3 you have until then selected.- sokwiki

7/2/2010,something similar came up on scrapheap around the same time this thread was made ... here was my response:the original thread can be found here.
7/2/2010,"cloaks save my ship.from who? pirates? sov holders? roaming gangs? none of those.they save my ship from the people who run bots all over npc 0.0 space. you see, the first thing they do when they discover their money-makers have automatically docked up from my presence, they start trying to hunt me down. last time i checked, i am the one trying to actually play the game.right now a cloak is the only thing stopping a bot. to stop what the bot runners have (because they have plenty of isk, see) takes a small gang - and that's before the rest of the npc 0.0 hogging alliance shows up."
7/2/2010,"at the moment, cloaks combine with the local channel to tell everyone insystem that there is also a cloaker there. if we got rid of local, wed also get rid of the perceived threat that afk cloakers present to people insystem. i think that would be enough, myself, but here are a couple of other thoughts anyway.1) probing cloaked ships might be ok if it cannot generate a warpable hit.2) probing cloaked ships may not a problem, as long as things still work on-grid the way they do now. even if you obtain a warpable hit on a cloaked ship, and warp so that they are on-grid, the probe system should still not allow a lock onto the cloaked ship. and if we cant lock, then we need to look at the astrometrics deviation numbers to ensure that there is very little chance of coming out of warp within decloaking range, or even smartbomb range, of a cloaked ship which is not sat still. really this needs testing on sisi first though  if warpable hits all end up in smartbomb range, then wed need to rethink.3) we could try something like an alternate ammo for an interdiction sphere launcher which would make cloaked ships within its area of effect become visible (and visible on the overlay) but not lockable. makes interdictors a bit more useful, still requires either smarties or a fast ships to bump the cloaker back to visibility even once they are revealed. i am not entirely comfortable with this idea - i suspect it may be a bad thing when combined with gatecamps, but it might be worth a discussion to see there are further tweaks to work around that issue."

7/2/2010,whoops.
7/2/2010,"last time i checked 5 seconds is less than 6, hence my statement 6 seconds or less.no, you don't. you could just use your directional scanner to ""probe"" down your target, pinpointing it down exclusively with the d-scanner and with as good an accuracy as 1 au. all you really need the probes is for your warpable. that's it. bring your probes out, get a hit. 6 seconds. that's it.it takes longer to scan someone down. i'm not arguing this as you are correct. what i am arguing is that it only takes 6 seconds or less for actual probes to be out and about. that isn't enough time for someone spending 30 minutes to an hour in a mission to notice them or even realize they're being probed down.i don't think you understand when i say the d-scanner is more likely not to pick up probes. so how exactly does the d-scanner save you when there is only a window of about 6 seconds to see the probes for as long as someone is out doing their mission? spamming the button every 6 seconds is not an acceptable counter.docking your mission ship every time a neutral or red appears in local is not a reasonable request and i think you know this, especially in systems with good agents. if i had to stop missioning every time this happened i'd make more mining in high sec than missioning in low sec space."

7/2/2010,you really have no idea what the difference between probing and scanning is :\.this is a waste of time.
7/2/2010,"even assuming your 6 sec window, how would the op help you at all? you'd still have to be looking at the scan list every 6 seconds, you just wouldn't have to push a button. in other words pressing the button when you want to see or looking at the window makes no difference, either way you get the same result. it just so happens that scanning manually saves a hell of a lot of server/client load."
7/2/2010,"jin nib,you're right. this change wouldn't exactly help that much other than shaving off a fraction of a second every process. but that's why i said:here."
7/2/2010,"nobody said anything about making it trivial. i have thought it through. did you? what i would anticipate happening is datacore prices go through the roof on the initial hype because everyone would buy them up. t2 products will sink in price a bit because people would need to get their money back out of the hype. pi will be very profitable, and it would cost a lot to run a pos. however as soon as people start to realize it may take years and tens of billions of isk worth of datacores to get where they want, they will more than likely relax their ""grind"" position. at that point i don't think you would see many people putting their datacores on the market, would only keep them for themselves, and depending on the luck of the inventor, would start to have their first t2 ability in 6 months - 2 years. how does that sit with you?"
7/2/2010,"unsupported.with your proposal, what would basically happen is once you got the ability to use a t1 bpo as a t2 bpo, you'd run out, buy ten of them, and then start producing stuff like a madman, leading to uber profits that would make the original t2 bpo owners weep tears of envy.this suggestion would then move along and destroy any profits available in invention, since every inventor would have the sole objective of getting to the point of being able to run ten factories off their fancy t1-t2 skill. prices would plummet and invention would become non-profitable for all.that's bad."
7/2/2010,"agreed, it would strangle the t2 market. not supported"
7/2/2010,"at first, it seems cool. people go invent stuff, grind towards perfection, and it all seems cool. the first few people flip over, make a killing, a few people *****, but it still looks good. and then the non-obsessives start to tick over in bulk...and the t2 market goes to pot. everything crashes, the profits are at low levels for the people who do have bpo rights, and everyone who doesn't faces the prospect of choosing between losing billions on the now-laughable invention mechanics, or never ever having the ability to produce t2, ever. anyone who joins the game even a month after the mechanic goes live is forever locked out of t2 production, unless they buy a character who has bpo rights - they might not be game-rules locked out, but you'd have to be insane to try, because the initial cost is huge and the margins are low. the datacore market dies a whimpering death, as they start being given away six to a can of quafe, because demand is zero. t2 bpos are curiousities, with no actual industrial need for them - i'd be amazed if they don't lose 90% of their value. most t2 items of any quality lose a third to a half of their value, as the costs stop being set by invention, and start being set by bpo prices - and worse yet, bpo prices for people who are locked into producing them, and don't even have the option to exit a stale market. at this point, the bad t2 ships get even less often flown - why fly a huginn when the rapier is the same price? you will destroy multiple careers, multiple ships, and implement a t2 lock-out that is far and away worse than eve the one that was in place before invention existed. in short, this would be the single biggest screwjob of industry mechanics in eve history. how exactly does it taking six months for that to happen make a difference?"
7/2/2010,"slightly better, but it will still kill invention.1) you are doing a typical error: thinking your solution around t2 ships, so the ""several years part"". but while getting to 100% in ships would require several years, doing the same with modules, if the percentage increase is the same, will allow you to get your t2 building capacity in some week at most.your example show very well this. 2) if you get to use t1 bpo to build t2 items it man you can use 11 slots to build that item. you only need enough t1 bpo.so every time someone develop this ability he get the equivalent of 11 bpo usable only by him. practically as soon as very few players develp it they will corner the production of 1 model of the marauders or of the black ops bs (and every other ship with low production);3) bpo research: the player will get the benefit of the research on the t1 bpo? practically getting high level of research at very low cost in time and isk while t2 npo research is costly, especially in time?4) instead of selling bpo people will be selling t2 bp trained characters. same net result."
7/2/2010,"if you make a lot of assumptions, and have a pre-conceived opinion on the topic, and come here without shedding your previous arguments towards a t2 bpo balance, we will not get anywhere.the ultimate deciding factor of ships on the market comes down to the price of the manufacturing materials. if someone could make 11 t1 bpo's crank out an item at rates beyond what should be available - make a suggestion to tweak it so it is balanced instead of just saying 'no'. progress doesn't come from stubborn attitudes.i made no assumptions on ships, you made an assumption that i made the assumption and used that for an argument. modules being 'grinded out in 2 weeks': no, same rule applies 6 months - 2 years.as for it ""killing invention"" - that comes off to me a lot as a chicken little post. invention would be impacted, yes, but don't fear change simply because it is change. things do counterbalance (which you failed to acknowledge) - if invention starts to die off then datacores become super cheap and it picks right back up.honestly at this point i think the worst part about any t2 bpo solution is that everyone already has their minds made up to the point where they argue ideas that were never even presented. which sadly leaves the community out of having any sort of impact on the resolution."
7/2/2010,"ok, so my thought is this, an npc operated bus service. basically it would be a method of hauling pods around. you could queue up in hek and hop on let the bus take you around on it's merry meandering journey and then you can disembark in amarr. it would be ungodly slow 0.5au (slower than a freighter) and you can only take your pod (read: zero cargo space). it would make a giant loop around the core of new eden. you could program alerts to wake you up when the bus shows up at the stop and to wake you up when you get to your stop. akin to the rl bus if you fall asleep and miss your stop you are sol, so you have to chose to get off the bus.i know, i know you'll say use autopilot... but i say bus!!!"

7/2/2010,"i kinda like the idea - very creative. i know i hate having to travel long distance.that being said, i agree with verys - it doesn't really add anything to the gameplay. you can already ditch cargo space with a shuttle to lower your attractiveness as a gank target, and autopilot takes care of doing the flying for you.not supported (sorry)."

7/2/2010,"1. read the insurance contract.2. lag is not a game mechanic/feature implemented by ccp so it has absolutely no relevance whatsoever in determining insurance payout.3. lag can apply to the victim as well so u want to punish ppl for their connections and for ccp's mistakes, just so they cater to your incompetence.4. lag applying to a suicide ganker results in the victim saving his own butt, just like in low sec/0.0. no gank, no criminal flag, no concord, no difference at all.got anything else besides yet another sorry excuse to be babied?"
7/2/2010,really not sure about this one. ganking is a part of the game and there needs to be risk for all. by the same token the cost to gankers does need to be high enough to discourage casual gankage. i'm not up enough on current insurance values to determine whether that's currently the case though i do know that after making more rens-jita runs than i care to think about over the last couple of years i've never been successfully ganked.but then i will put 20k meters cubed of high value stuff in a freighter rather than an indy and i will fly all the way manually...which i think brings us back to the mini freighter concept that everyone was hoping the orca was going to be...if it really bugs you pay red frog to haul it and let them take the risk..
7/2/2010,"thanks cyberghost for the linkage.in my opinion, it doesn't matter what rl insurance is like, what really matters is the game balance. when i first started reading the thread, i wasn't sure where to weigh in because i don't have enough game time to really feel out the balance of gankage.seeing as ccp had already voiced that they believed gankage is too easy, however, i am in support."
7/2/2010,"i would like to propose the ability to set more hot keys in the hot key menu. most specifically, i would most like to be able to set a hot key for each of the buttons that appears in the ""selected object"" window when you have an object selected in the overview. it surprised me that there wasn't already a way to do this. personally, i find it extremely annoying when my mouse decides that it wants to be slightly off with regards to which button it wants to highlight, and being able to use my keyboard would completely alleviate this problem. hot keys would also be beneficial to every one, so long as they cared enough to actually learn them.because it would be remiss of me to merely state this and not actually give a list of actions that i would like to be able to assign hot keys to, below you will find my personal list. if any one else has any requests they would like to make, i encourage them to add to this thread with their own list.actions that need hot keys: 1). approach 2). warp to 3). align to 4). open target cargo 5). open my cargo 6). run a directional scan 7). analyze probe scan 8). eject 9). switch active target (in the boxes at the top of the screen, switch what will be shot at when you next turn on your weapons)10). keep at default range11). orbit at default range12). jump through a star-gate or worm hole13). dock with a stationfor the time being i can't actually think of any more actions that i regularly use that don't already have a hot key, so i think i will go ahead and leave it at the list above. thank you for even considering this request, and thanks to every one for making the game as much fun as it is to play!~catachan"

7/2/2010,"i might be able to ""blag it"" when it comes to knowing about anything bigger than a battleship, but the main stopper would be ccp's commitment to even having a csm of anything more than a token existence. ccp seem to have significant resource when it comes to editorials, marketing, dust and ""hilarious"" youtube videos, but they seem entirely reluctant to go to town on the whole csm thing.i wouldn't have the first clue as to how one influences ccp into recognising the massive potential of independent appraisal and adjudication. it seems to me that most industries worldwide have an ombudsman and watchdog organisation, though usually at the national level, which are generally paid for by the industry as a whole.i would imagine that online competition is a huge growth area, and whoever gets in first in funding and creating an industry wide framework of regulatory bodies with actual real powers would be in a very strong position indeed. left to it's own, ea will probably do it, and it will likely be very gaudy indeed.at the very least, the csm delegates should be able to demonstrate that they are capable individuals before they even get their name on the ballot, and then they should get paid for the work they do. it's entirely bizarre that you're expected to sit in meetings with people who are being paid to ignore you.yes, i personally have little good to say for the csm as it stands today, but i would be in favour of strengthening it in a correct manner. dust514 is coming like it or not, and assuming it's ""da bomb"" or whatever the cool kids say these days, there too, an international competitive opportunity exists.what would a csm do for dust? would it be the same csm, could it even be the same csm? i suspect not.perhaps the ccp/csm should be discussing what the csm should be, and how it can become something that can be brought to other products by other manufacturers. for sure video gaming is a huge and growing international concern, with massive amounts of taxable revenue that governments are going to take an interest in, though possibly not until the next generation of parliamentarians who know what a consoul is take office.if there is one thing governments like, it's regulation, jobs for the boys, they haven't left anybody else alone, and they won't leave video games alone. we've seen the mess they have made worldwide over things like age restrictions, which results in many different logos on the packaging depending on where the product is from, and being sold to, as all the different moral organisations try to become the masters of what our children watch. but where is our fifa? where is our ioc? where is our fia?that's where i'd like to see the csm heading in the long term, perhaps a decade, otherwise it will get formed through legislation and the appointees will just be another predictable set of old school ties, or even worse the existing bodies take their virtual counterparts into their own domain, so fifa end up deciding up events in virtual soccer competitions.the csm as it exists today, some sort of marketing wet dream of a development idea filtering forum, just seems like a massive waste of an idea, especially as the events leading to it's emergency conception don't bear any relevance to the csm we have."
7/2/2010,"well gav, i agree it would be good for us to sit down with ccp and spend some time figuring out what they want us to do and be exactly, and howat first i thought you were just another idiot, but your recent posts have convinced me that you are at least a sophisticated idiot . we need more people like you to provide feedback so we can improve on ourselves."
7/2/2010,"the problem with this is, first of all, who decides who is ""capable""? certainly you wouldn't want ccp to do that! the election system is far from perfect, but i've yet to hear of a proposal that is better.secondly, the problem with paying csms for the work that they do is that it would be a corrupting influence. consider all the complaints in the rw about the ""professional political class""."
7/2/2010,"i agree with you and gav both, having a serious chat with ccp about expected roles would be a good idea. of course, it's possible that those of us on csm might decide we couldn't live with expectations that are unproductively confining or too much of a departure from what has already been defined as the csm role in official ccp documents.sok--other discussions with gav in the forums here have demonstrated that he (she?) is worth engaging in intelligent conversation."
7/2/2010,"i would expect that the csm would require a permanent head position, who's only responsibility is to ensure the continued operation and integrity of the csm and those selected to serve within it. specifically they would not involve themself with the actions and decisions of the csm, except to support and promote the organisation externally. growing with size, that ceo would require additional aides, financial directors, chairman, technological experts.the csm as a separate legal entity would be required to abide by local laws regarding corruption."
7/2/2010,never!to 2nd alt: i am currently selling my 1st alt status
7/2/2010,god save us from having a fifa or an ioc having a say in how our games are run.
7/2/2010,"it is clear that ccp does feel they need to send someone with a sincere look on his face to meet with and listen to the csm. it's equally clear that ccp does not feel obligated legally or morally to take any action csm recommends nor justify their inaction.what can csm do about this? well you can start quantifying ccps inaction. how?keep a clear list of proposals that are backlogged. prioritize them. for example if there are 180 backlogged items. make them 10 groups of 18 and each of you prioritize them 1-10. average out each of your scores for each item. then instead of basically saying well they did many things we recommend like the skill que but they didnt do others  there is still 180 backlogged items you can give specifics. of the top priority items (say the top half of your proposals) that have been on back log for on average of 2 years they have done 0.5% of the items. yes there will be some things that ccp doesnt do exactly like you want but may still substantially accomplish the goal. the csm can take a vote on whether to give ccp credit for what they did or not. the priorities will change as the csm members change. they will also change as the game mechanics change. some proposals may become obsolete  the csm should vote them off the list. if ccp actually gives a reason for not enacting a proposal (that is a reason other than we are really busy with other stuff) and at least engages the proposal with reasoned argument why they reject it, that should be noted as well so players can see why they rejected it. (again the csm could vote on whether the actual reason(s) given is reasonable or just a way to push it off) this would allow you to say of the 180 backlogged items that have been sitting in backlog for an average of 2 years there were 5 that ccp actually gave a reasoned explanation of why they did not implement it. ccp has not given any sort of articulated explanation as to why the other 175 are ignored. until this stuff gets quantified it will be very easy for ccp to make vague statements about what a great thing csm is. im not saying it has to be this structure. but there must be some sort of scoreboard.the other benefit of this priority system is that the players will be able to make a more educated vote. sure everyone voted for this ui change, or this fw change, or ship model change. but which candidate says its a priority? this would allow players to make a more informed vote."

7/2/2010,"hello csm people,i have a question regarding proposals, and the likelihood that a proposal will get a pass by the csm and implemented by ccp.by a broad proposal, i mean something that has a fairly wide scope. for example, ""many assault frigates are poor and need to be rebalancing. here's ideas for fixing ship a, b, c, d, and e.""by a specific proposal, i mean something that has a very narrow scope. for example, ""the hawk is a poor ship and good improvements can be a, b, and c.""a broad proposal may make it seem like a lot is going to be changed at once (even if it could be implemented over the course of several patches). coming from a software background, large changes are scary. a specific proposal would come across as a small change and easier to control, and if enough of these are passed over time, you end up with the desired end result.do you feel that a specific proposal with a very limited scope has a significantly higher chance of being passed by the csm and implemented by ccp? if this is the case, perhaps we should let people know and we can start to adjust our proposals accordingly."
7/2/2010,i would like to see a feature in the map and maybe on the arrow by the system name that would bring the aura voice up and pronounce the system name. this could also be implemented in the item description as an added help.

7/3/2010,your reading comprehension is in the same category as gaylente ships: pretty bad.
7/3/2010,"i feel it is time to raise these issues (again)the improvement to courier contract size, and the ability to deliver a courier contract by rightclicking on the courier package were great additions in dominion, and have done both the setup of courier contracts, and the completion of courier contracts to a much more enjoyable task.there are however many other improvements that could be made to the courier contract interface to make it even more useful, for both the issuer and the contractor.when setting up courier contracts:it is difficult for the issuer of a contract to see how much m3 he has added to the contract, until the contract is nearly finished. some kind of counter for the m3 would be useful. a size column in addition to the quantity column that already exists would be an easy fix, although a sum of the total volume would be much better (both would be best)add a warning when someone enters an assembled ship into a courier contract, that the insurance will be void (currently, warnings are only given on exchange and auction contracts). better yet, make the insurance resume when the ship is back at its owner again, as long as the contract is not failed.when searching for courier contracts it would be useful with more courier contract friendly filtersfilter on route security (max and min security rating for systems along the route)filter on collateralfilter on rewardfilter on trip length (number of jumps)filter on distance to pickup systemfilter on volume (max and min volume)better sorting options (related to filters)sort on collateralsort on rewardsort on jumps to pickupafter accepting a contract:add a ""show contract"" to the menu when right-clicking on a courier packagemove deliver contract away from repackage and break contract from the righ-click menu on a courier package in a station corporate courier contracts:add a role for accepting courier contracts issued to a corporationmake it possible for contract managers to see who in a corporation has accepted a courier contract issued to the corporationmake sorting of contracts better. currently it is impossible to sort courier contracts properly after completed date or time left for outstanding contracts. when you have more than 100 contracts outstanding to your corporation, and you sort on time left, the oldest contracts appear on page 2, not page 1 as you would expect. last, but not least:give us a contract api, for personal, corporate and alliance contracts, as well as an option to export particular contract details in an easy way to our computer for further parsing.i will gladly invite a dev or a csm representative to our corp for a few days so that he/she can experience the issues with courier contracts firsthand.ps: updated title slightly"
7/3/2010,sensible and reasonable suggestions.
7/3/2010,"locin has offered a concise list improvements from which everyone who uses courier contracts would benefit. they apply to an issuer, an individual hauler, or a corporation that relies heavily on courier contracts.it is a remedy to the ""pain"" that can only be fully understood by those who use courier contracts constantly.this proposal gathers my full support."
7/3/2010,a very detailed and relevant enhancement request. i support this 120%.
7/3/2010,"this is a very good idea. there is something for all sides are concerned dealing with contracts. thanks for taking the time listing it all down for the devs, and also want to thank the devs in advance for thier time!"
7/3/2010,contract api please. would also be great if there was a way to pass courier contracts between pilots. it would help corpmates assist one another and possibly use a dispatch system.
7/3/2010,supported. courier contract ui is terrible in oh so many ways.
7/3/2010,learning skills are going to be removed. i approve of this method.
7/3/2010,this can also be supported in a rp perspectivewhat did the characters do in their university(before the were created by player)? how could all of them graduate without knowing anything even how to learn??
7/3/2010,"ok, having read the various threads and thinking about it some more, i'm willing concede that the 'keep learning skills as is' crowd aren't completely[1] full of it.i think we all can admit that the learning skills are mostly bearable in small doses. you don't need to train charisma if you just want a pvp pilot. you don't need 5/5 in perception and willpower before you train frigates v. we don't need to save every possible minute of training. for us old timers, the learning skills were more bearable in the old days because we had a *choice* as to when we could train the learning skills. our attributes were fixed (no remaps) and there was no accelerated training bonus, so it didn't matter if we trained charisma to 5/4 right away or put it off for a few years. it wasn't a big deal if we stopped training the learning skills to switch to a short term skill that provided more fun factor.the problem is that newbies no longer feel they have a choice on when they can train the learning skills. newbies can get almost 16 days of learning skills before the 1.6 million cut off (evemon- optimized attrubtes, no implants.) any day not spent on learning skills becomes two days of training/boredom later.newbies also get two remaps. the first remap can be used to maximize mem/int for the learning skills. this gives the newbie one final remap with which to focus on their primary interest. further remaps are a year away. thus, there's a strong incentive to get the most out of your first remap which means training the learning skills to a high level.the accelerated bonus time and two free remaps make it possible to, and encourage newbies to specialize in training the learning skills. specialization, by definition, prevents choice. it's this perceived lack of choice that has caused the learning skills to become so hated recently.tl;drthe learning skills aren't the problem. the accelerated training time and two initial remaps are the problem.[1] ""mostly"" is a better word. i'm all about compromise. ;-)"
7/3/2010,"sign, i would be more than happy"
7/3/2010,good bump
7/3/2010,"this i could adn would gladly support. it's not a out of the gate bonus package for instant gratification, and yet still gives the ability for people to ignore the trainign skills and go for the fun stuff.i think this is a very possible thing and could be worth actually discussing. after all, why wouldn't people encourage others to maximize there total trainign time when such an obvious ""push"" method is set in place to accelerate it from the get go. not to mention, new players don't get a feel for eve's true training speed until after the 1.6mil mark."
7/3/2010,totally supportedi really hate learning:(
7/3/2010,"that's a very intelligent way of looking at it, nicely done sir. its not so much of a choice when the system blatantly gives you incentives to get them out of the way. the above idea of slowly giving attributes over time not only makes sense, but also (as the above poster above me shows) draws a larger crowd into the supporting area given that it removes instant-gratification from the argument. this could be the compromise that sets such an action forward."

7/3/2010,"don't agree.different learning plans show the difference of different characteristics and stragetics. although a 5-4 or 4-4 learning could be ""the standard"", ""is that good to learn xxx to lv.5"" is still a topic worth to be argue.hmm... if you think the learning skills block people from join this game. boost the speed bonus could be a solution. just reduce the training time for noobs to get 5-4 or 4-4 then left them to make the ""lv.5 decision"".we need some difference for even counter-strike still has different weapons."
7/3/2010,i believe the learning skills are all the evil sources. kill them as soon as possible

7/3/2010,not supported
7/3/2010,"do keep in mind, as the op has both stated and linked to in a fanfest video, that ccp devs have outright said that ccp has already committed to eliminating learning skills.this thread is about how to go about doing that, not if they should be gotten rid of.i think you are forgetting one very important detail: the old characters actually started with a decent set of applicable skills. the new characters now start with almost nothing.without the accelerated learning time, new characters don't have much of a leg to stand on."
7/3/2010,"no! ccp has said that some of them have regrets about introducing learning skills, and at that time they did not see an easy way of removing them. they have not committed to do anything about learning skills. for all that we know the more recent changes to the npe may have resolved their concerns about learning skills, as it has reduced the time spent training them in half.this thread is for players to discuss their opinions regarding the future of learning skills. that includes voicing the opinion that they should be kept.you seem to have forgetten that old players started with even fewer skills than current characters and did not have accellerated training times. those characters stood well enough.i would love for my army of alts to get an instant upgrade to 5/5 learning skills. i could abuse the extra training speed, especially if i decide to create some more alts. i would also love to redistribute my learning skill sp to some other skills so that i don't need to waste time boosting my characters' charisma or training at a less-than-optimal rate.all-in-all i would come out well ahead if ccp follows the op's suggestion. however, i suspect that it might be over-powered. on the other hand, i thought that 800k sp for a starting character was over-powered when it was first announced. i thought the same again when that was change to double-rate training for the first 1.6m sp. looking back, i see that those changes have turned out alright. therefore, i expect that the removal of learning skills would workout just fine as well."
7/3/2010,yeah i like this idea. it's cool.i can't stand people arguing about different plans of learning skills. that's a waste of time.
7/3/2010,"agreed, new players experience of gameplay should be determined by their skill specialisations not some redundant learning skills. any training that doesn't end in a new module, ship or module enhancement is really boring to do =\"

7/3/2010,"one of my friends plays since 2003 and is still in a noob corp. he calls the game eve offline, because of course of the unique way you can train in eve and because he plays about 10% of the time, the rest of the 90% of the time he's offline, gaining sps.eve is unique and what i propose is directly in the line of what it has as features already."
7/3/2010,"ok heres the deal.... eve ships are visualy lacking in my eyes. eve is falling behind in personalization of assets other then the ability to select which mods/weapons/ammo go onto a ship.before you continue reading i am a college student specializing in network admisition and computer desktop support and id like to see my ideas at least make it to alpha testing.my idea is to allow players to ""paint"" there ship. im not talking make a custom skin in photoshop and upload it so every one has a unique texture, im talking about having a bunch of presets that allow players to at least mix it up a bit. 1.) the textures are already there, mission ships, t1 & t2 ships. all you'd have to do is add a feature to allow some one to select which skin to use on their ship. this would add zero server lag because people already load these textures every day and we aren't adding any.2.) a slight upgrade from above, uploading, for example, 5 or 6 differnt camo colors/patterns and a player is allowed to pick between them. this would not lag servers is textures are kept client side. the ammount of data tranfered between server -> you machine would be a name of a file or part of a file ""camoraven2.jpg"" for example. how much do you possibly think would cause even if it was being sent to 50,000 people? i send more data in a text message from a iphone.3.) have a white texture on all ships, now that might sound odd but it allows us to use a system seen in games like fable 2, armored core and more. it allows us to break the texture into two zones or more if we chose and have a preset pallet of colors, we can pick which zone and which color we want to apply to that zone and make hundreds of thosands of combinations. this would create a little lag computer side if your computers old and limping on one leg to even play eve in the first place but like 1 and 2 not a noticable ammount of server lagnow.... how would you be able to use one of these 3 features should they be implimented?1.) ""color"" rigs, have their own specific rig slot much like the subsystems of t3 ships, depending on which rig you place in depends on what preset texture your ship becomes, works with ideas 1 & 22.) have a window that pops up while at a station, comes default on all stations even 0.0 egg/platforms, acts like insurance or repair, you select a ship, though the window you can select your look (works on 1 2 and 3) and preview (like the fitting window) your ship before finalizing.and as a final added feature add a graphics option in the menu, under this menu you have 1 button, this 1 button is an effect button like missile effects and so on that are allready there, it can be toggled on or off though a hotkey in game to drop graphics levels for big fights or heavily populated systems (such as jita). for those who dont want to see the features listed above, just leave it off.feel free to make suggestions or modifications to my idea, i will ""bump"" them up to a secondary post i make after this one specialy for that so they will be at the top and viewable for readers with out having to search though the entire thread.trolls you will be ignored, i dont dignify your actions with an answer. if you say no and give a reason why other then ""it will create lag"" or ""its a crappy idea"" i wont consider you a troll."

7/3/2010,"i think i supported one of the older purposals on this, but on thinking about it, it might cause some problems.currently, bookmarks are stored on the eve servers, not on your local client foulder. the calls for bookmark locations would therefore all occur on the eve cluster itself, not on the local client (then being sent to the cluster)pile a bajillion bookmarks on top of a gate or something with the same number of people sitting on the gate and you'd have a serious crap-ton of exploitable lag (like bubbles...only invisible )if ccp can code it so that the calls for the bookmark locations don't really bog down the clients/nodes during other activities (pvp, pve, station spinning while looking at p.r0nz), then the ability to see bm's on the overview would be great."

7/3/2010,"yes. by encouraging people to hotswap implants on a per-fight basis, or even switch out of implants in order to pod themselves for the bounty on their heads (furthering an existing ""exploit-but-not-really""'s existence.)removing risk is something we aren't fans of in this game; if you ignore the bleeting sheep on the forum anyway."
7/3/2010,"you can -hotswap- ships and modules at a station, why not clones? especially implants that affect the ship you want to now use.you can already jumpclone to a non-implant clone to be podded for bounties so again there is no difference. there is no reduction in risk by choosing implants when i fit my ship. because of the process is the way it is now i do not use multibillion implant sets because i dont wish to be stuck in them for another 23hrs after ive finished the need for them. so instead there is less risk because im never going to loose them because im never going to buy/use them in the first place."
7/3/2010,"because implants are not ships, neither are they modules, and the whole intention of them is that they are costly, you lose them when unplugging to deter people hotswapping them, and that the choices you make with implants (sort of) matters.by removing this, you act against the gods (ccp) and thus you are bordering upon the act of heresy. you will be held accountable for this heresy, heathen!"
7/3/2010,"wow... you genuinely believe people want this.you know what, i agree with you. i also want the freedom to swap the rigs (without destruction) on my ships, and hell, swap to whatever ship i own, no matter where it is in relation to where i am. i'd like a lot of things.but you know what?[rollingstones]you can't always get what you waannnnt...[/rollingstones]"
7/3/2010,"such things were said in the labs when we were first looking at the prospects of this technology. i will reiterate what was said then:the argument about hotswapping would be an issue if it is performed in combat. this is not however how the technology works, its impossible. implant racks are sent from datalink via the ishukone data centre and can only be retrieved and activated via a station or sma.the way it is now is more a hinderance to potential risk. implants are things that enhance your ship and well you should be able to use them when.. you want to use that ship. having to wait 24hrs is not increasing any risk its just preventing it.capsuleers would like to use expensive implant sets. they would be using a multibillion probing implant set when they are probing. another expensive set for their falcon, another one for their tengu. billions in isk. all ripe for the podding. the current system especially those in wspace isolated from stations but fighting extremely hostile unknown forces is very bad. capsuleers are restricted from utilising top technology because of the current jumpclone-implant relationship."

7/3/2010,"warning: i am going to role-play the part of a designeryou used the wrong font./roleplayedit: i think this is a bad idea, not only from a risk-reward point of view (you gain the reward of increased shield at the risk that you may lose an expensive implant set - being able to switch out of this implant set at a pos is a bit..well, too easy), and from an rp point of view. implants are physical things. if you wanted to hot-swap them, you'd have to hot-swap great big chunks of your clones brain. as more than one clone of the same person cannot reside in the same station at any one time, would you - or any surgeon (bar sansha) be willing to operate on a live clone in order to remove the old implants, and replace them with the new?what's that? you can't move your right hand. sorry, your implant swap has resulted in the penalty of movement minus everythingi can has rp."
7/3/2010,"the idea has more flaws than merits. hotswapping is not something to be sought, it is something to be avoided; and i am sure the lords will smite this idea from afar when they see fit to slot it into their busy smiting schedule."
7/3/2010,"thank you, wish i found that place before i posted"
7/3/2010,"oh great, so that's three subforums it'll be in. /dies"
7/3/2010,"good, instead of one set of people now three sets of people can laugh at your ******ed ideas."
7/3/2010,moved to assembly hall at the request of the op.
7/3/2010,"oh boy, he actually did move it here! now he can be officially shot down.anyways, links to where i've already given my input on the matter:"
7/3/2010,"ideas that are presented to ccp, that ccp agrees to, should be implemented. currently there is no tracking when the issues submitted agreed to and accepted by ccp will ever be implemented. tasking priority is determined by ccp and as currently being reported there ""are no set amount of development cycles to deal with many csm proposals"" ( i am paraphrasing here ) see mynxee's blog"
7/3/2010,"wouldn't it be nice if missiles came from somewhere other than an invisible launcher in the center of your ship? does the idea of making torrent missiles live up to their name and bringing a storm of death and destruction on your opponents appeal to you? then have i got a proposal for you!give missiles hardpoints, like turrets already have! and more importantly, none-center origin points!the sheer coolness of my idea can be summarized in three words: macross missile massacre. now, before you guys freak out, i do not -- in any way -- want missile spam. my proposal is not to change the number of existing entities in a missile launch -- 8 grouped launchers fire only 8 missiles. but the simple fact is, missiles irl don't simply follow the most direct route towards targets -- they need to be, well, launched. having these streaks of light emanate from launchers adds visceral excitement to the otherwise droll usage of missiles... and as a drake pilot, god only knows how frustrating it is to have launchers, but have them completely and utterly ignored. come on, ccp, you can do better than that...""oh crap... looks like that guy's got blasters (lol yeah right). better keep my distance unless i want to be ganked by a noob."" seriously, now. we can already tell how a gunship is loaded (roughly) from a visual standpoint -- it's just an extra, sure, and ship scanners exist, but sometimes you wanna see if that raven is a lightly-armed support ship... or a missile-laden banshee from hell.__________________________________________________________________________________________________now, to address some opposing issues... others exist, and feel free to bring them up! debate is good for these matters!i'll grant you that there are plenty of 'little things' that ccp could fix, but this proposal falls into the realm of things that would greatly improve the graphical treat that is eve online. i know i'm not the only missile guy out there, not by a longshot, but we seem to be pushed aside anyways. balance issues, of course, are a big part of it, but so too is the pretty colors that other guys enjoy. wow, how exciting! we fired an orb of white light at the enemy -- let's just say that it contains 6 missiles and let that be! meanwhile, turret-users are able to get the visual experience of watching a broadside assault on the enemy, with anywhere from one or two to eight turrets unleashing their fury on the target. missile guys get a single nondescript blob. if missiles could be treated as turrets, or even launched from designated 'missile bays' on ships, rather than the center of the ship, it would take eve another step closer towards matching any offline spaceshipz games in the intensity of its graphics.really? because you know, you can chain-fire (fire one at a time) launchers... may not be as efficient, but each launch generates a unique entity, and if you are moving as you launch (or if the target is moving), each has a unique track. need i say more? directly opposes this point. next?"
7/3/2010,"(continued from post 1...)this is true, and certainly a strong factor against my idea. i realize that the current turret weapons are essentially 'hitscan' weapons, with instantaneous impact when fired; missiles, however, are actual objects that have a programmed flight time. this said, my proposal addresses this; by introducing turreted missile launchers/bays, it would make it so that missiles are no farther from the target than regular gun turrets. unless i'm very much mistaken, turrets have their range already predetermined by the center of the ship, not by where the turrets are placed; accordingly, a dreadnought mounted with guns aligned parallel with a target will not have the forward batteries hit and the rear ones not hit the target (optimum range notwithstanding); all are treated as if they were fired from the center of the ship, just graphically offset to appear to emerge from designated turrets. missiles would be no different in this regard: while the inevitable whiners would petition because the missile appeared to have come from somewhere that was too far away, the simple fact is that eve is already rife with issues of lag and positioning errors. correct me if i'm wrong, but nothing is determined visually on eve servers - or else giant fleet battles with the amazing sideways-flying caps wouldn't be treated as a matter of course (well, there are complaints about lag, but that's a different issue altogether). this point was summarized well by a fellow supporter here.perhaps the biggest roadblock my idea has, yes. now, i could simply say ""lol but what about stations exploding and missile impact effects?"" and leave people with less-powerful systems in the dust. but many people who say this forget about a graphics option in your menu - ""turn off turret effects""! would it be so difficult for ccp to do the same for my proposal - a ""turn off missile barraging"" or similar toggle? if they go so far as to implement it, then surely there'd be a way to turn it off for people with systems that aren't up to snuff - just like every other visual effect does!"
7/3/2010,"this hearkens back to counterpoint 2; the server can already handle unique missile tracks for each manifested entity. this argument hinges on the lost tenth of a second while the missile launches and orients, during which a few hundred meters are lost. if your missiles are already pushing maximum range, then there really should be no problem with adding this overall change -- if you missed it, your missiles do a little jink at the end of their burn when they hit their target, indicating that the server has deemed the target to be 'in-range' by the time the missile reaches it, and no matter how the target is moving, the missile will hit the target at that point no matter what (although, of course, the efficacy of the impact depends on the missile type, target speed, etc...). extending the range of this 'final stage' by a few hundred meters easily offsets any questions of whether the missile lost flight time while launching -- and quite frankly, if a target is right at the end of engagement range, most missileers will not at all be surprised by a miss, given the fact that the target is moving, possibly away, and if it was towards you, then they will definitely hit anyway. if you start going ""omg i launched exactly at 65.5 km but it didn't hit wtf this sucks"", then you shouldn't be using missiles... such inaccuracies and inconsistencies are only to be expected. indeed, it could be taken as a step towards making eve more realistic (well, if you know what i mean; eve obviously isn't realistic) -- do you launch your missiles right when you hit max range, and hope they hit? or do you wait 5km or so (like, say, i already do anyway) to make sure a hit will be guaranteed? my proposal changes nothing but visual effects, when all's said and done."
7/3/2010,"sounds good, especially visual cue for missile mounted hardpoints. can't tell a neut phon from torp ganker atm, but can tell for neut/blaster domi."
7/3/2010,"i have to say that i was very excited when i found out i would be getting a free ship from ccp... erm... ore. whatever. anyway, i want my free primae but neither my main character nor my titan pilot can get it. why?because i don't fit in npc stations.now, i could try to dock in an npc station, but the last guy who tried to do that with his nyx made a big frakkin hole in it and started an rp war. it was pretty serious stuff.i don't want to start a war. i just want my awesome free ship for pi. why does ore hate supercap pilots? we're people too!!!"
7/3/2010,"seriously, it's just not fair. you'd think the ore ship delivery fairies could sneak your free toy into your caps' ship maintenance bay. wrapped in a ribbon and everything."
7/3/2010,this is an outrage. i will gladly raise the flag and crusade against ccp to get justice for my fellow spaceman.i think the solution to this pressing issue is to finally allow us to dock in titans. then since he is a station he can get all the free ships.
7/3/2010,"when the speed changes arrived, ccp nerfed the web strength considerably. the problem imo is that the stacking penalties for webs that worked fine with the old web strengths are too severe now when compared to the existing peak web strengths.even when piling 3-4 webs on a target you can only get the speed of a target down to about 80-85% of it's top speed, which isn't enough to hold something trying to get back to a gate and/or dock range. i propose that stacking penalties for webs be completely removed so that 3-4 webs will reduce a target's speed to 5% or so. 1v1 encounters won't be affected that much, if at all, and those that choose to sacrifice their mid slots for multiple webs will be rewarded with increased effectiveness.ccp has continued to change the game in favor of the defender and this needs to be reversed."
7/3/2010,"webefiers have no stacking penalties, do some reasearch before you post please. every web cuts the speed of the target in half, it's as simple as that."
7/3/2010,"pretty sure they didnt change it, so webs should still have stacking penalties.i like the way bellum is thinking, but then reversed. massively increase stacking penalties of webs, now only encourages blobbing single targets in gatecamps. higher stacking penalties for webs = more fights less ganks. (to be honest, didnt really think of it myself, got the idea from some shc topic where someone proposed only one ecm module per target)."
7/3/2010,supported.
7/3/2010,"yes, more research is required before posting. but, not by the op. anyways, webs are not supposed to be able to stop a ship completely any more, regardless of how many are used. that is why their strength was reduced in the first plance.stacking penalties remain in effect, thank you."
7/3/2010,"if a player is blobbed, he's dead anyway. all the above does is help solo players complete a kill instead of allowing yet another target to get away."
7/3/2010,"no if you jump as solo player in a gate camp you can gatecrash and survive, you want to make the blob stronger there.and only the blob, your proposal doesnt help solo players in any way. afaik webs have normal stacking penalties, so second web is still 87% effective, which is pretty close to 100%. no solo player will ever fit more than 2 webs, and that is already very special. so the only thing you will boost is blobs."
7/3/2010,"you talk about 'equal' & fair as if this were a game of basketball. while it is a game, it is a game with a very strong foundation in war & combat. these are subjects i can speak on from personal experience.let's look at a real world scenario through your eyes for a second.....i'm in afghanistan on a patrol through a village when we come under small arms fire. one of my guys is able to determine that there are 4 little bastards holed up in a little building, so i tell him to grab 3 more guys, not 4 or 5 or 6, but 3, and go kill them. as they attempt to engage, 2 are killed and a third wounded because some bleeding-heart wanted war to be 'fair'.now, the real life version...i'm in afghanistan on a patrol through a village when we come under small arms fire. one of my guys is able to determine that there are 4 little bastards holed up in a little building, so i maneuver, either through side streets, use of smoke/covering fire to get close enough to put a lot of bullets and or explosives on that structure, making sure to utilize all the personel and assets i have at my disposal to eliminate the enemy. if i am unable to accomplish any of the above tasks for whatever reason, i will asses the potential for civialian casualties and collateral damage and if the situation warrants, i will have artillery or air support level said structure to ensure that the enemy is defeated decisively.combat is not fair. that's why we have saying's like 'peace through superior firepower', not 'peace through fair and equal firepower.'if you want fair then you should probably just cancel your account right now and move on with your life."
7/3/2010,another stupid assembly hall idea.
7/3/2010,"oh, nice... a pvp arena as a solution.not supported."
7/3/2010,"i am opposedit can:be installed jump clones to it, jump to operation area with the mining ships inside of it.. and ppl can jc out to it."
7/3/2010,he means that the mining ships can use all those things to get there. the rorq simply use its own jump drive.
7/3/2010,"well, why not?"
7/3/2010,"i like it.why shouldn't industrialists get a ship that is capable of creating a jump bridge?it certainly makes sense. ore has all this money and they decide ""nah, we'll just clone jump a handful of pilots instead of enabling a massive mining effort.""i think not.**approved**"
7/3/2010,the idea itself is good but that ability should not be on a roqual!why? it's simple roqual is simply to cheap.. that ability should come at a higher price around 10-14b build cost like supercarrier. and maybe give it some neat features and not just jumpbrigde in short all the things the roqual is missing..:)
7/3/2010,right now the customs office does not show up on the directional scanner. put it on the directional scanner so i am able to find p.i. care bears and kill them.
7/3/2010,"ccp has strange habbit of not adding new stuff they introduce to the scanner, first the probes, not the cargo link, this needs to be adressed.!"
7/3/2010,i hate to agree with red.overlord on well... anything but she may have a point.
7/3/2010,couldn't you just add the office to your overview and scan for ships in that direction?i don't understand what adding it to the d scanner will achieve.
7/3/2010,this sounds more like a bug. did you report it already?
7/3/2010,this!
7/3/2010,"it's called specialization-opportunity. people who skill-longer and spend more isk deserve better stuffs in that area than those who don't. having it segmented, instead of just having the max, and the minimum, also lets players gain something from each level. they don't do that evenly very often, but they do it in some circumstances. gallente get an industrial for each level of industrials trained for instance. where as matari get 3, and the amarr only get 2. the practical explanation is they probably didn't want to waste so much time on modeling 5 kinds of inudstrial ships for each race. the role-play explanation is probably that different races prioritize trade ships differently. concerning pi, i think risk-vs-reawrd being balanced by start-up costs and planning. if you plan ahead, and put a really advanced colony down to start with, you can keep it running until you decide to delete it. no one can blow it up, or take it from you yet, so you're only really playing against yourself in how you use pi at the moment. later on, when actual pi conflicts become part of the game, you might want to control your risk level through keeping your colony costs low instead of putting up the best possible colony you can. basically i think it's more important to give players enough choices so that they can play the game the way they want, than it is to keep it simple.ps: there's 3 sizes of control towers in the game, anyone else think that's odd? i don't."
7/3/2010,this isn't already in game?supported then.
7/3/2010,anything that makes it easier to set up courier contracts are supported by me.
7/3/2010,"if you want to respec, go play wow."
7/3/2010,"that isn't eve we all played for years. i like eve because i'm responsible for my in-game actions. if you do something stupid, it will cost you.if you're tired of the industrial game style, then sell your industrial character and buy a pvp one. good industrial characters can get a very fair price.not supported."
7/3/2010,"hate to break it to you but getting people into low sec has nothing to do with missioning. the obvious place to go for people who like missioning is high sec and the people who come out to low sec for the most part couldn't care less about missions.there are other far better incentives possible then god awful boring ass missions. you know, incentives that would actually appeal more to the people who live there."
7/3/2010,"you want to populate low sec? do you really, really want to populate low sec?then remove ability to scram ships which dont have warp disruptor or scrambler fitted...there you go.without backup, or meta gaming...using pve fitted ships in place where everyone and theirs grandmother can web and scram you is idiotic.but i can feel big waves of ""no"" is coming this way. not because you are genuinely interested to fix broken low sec, or some diversity in mission running...but only new targets.and when i say new i mean less experienced players who are desperately trying to grind for theirs plex, and after it theirs new and maybe one of the first ships for pvp.yes that's the reason why many people are doing missions, not because they are hamsters and want to have hundreds of billions of liquid isk but to afford to pvp."
7/3/2010,dynamic agent quality is great. the key to herding mission runners is to focus on their strongest common characteristic: greed. exploit that and they'll go wherever you want them to.
7/3/2010,"you know why this wouldn't last long? because of lo sec pirates' strongest common characteristic: stupidity. they'd drive their prey out to extinction again, leaving lo sec as dry as it was before and then in their all mighty glory wonder what happened.still it's a good idea so gets my thumbs up."
7/3/2010,"yes for dynamic quality in high sec, no for low sec and 0.0. why would you want to punish the people running in the 1.5 remaining low sec mission hubs?no need to create larger disparity between agent quality, what would it add? the disparity is already more than large enough, if anything make it smaller. you can make low sec more popular than by higher bounties are more lp (there already is a security status modifier of lp, no need to improve low sec by higher agent quality when it is way more logical to improve it by just increasing that modifier.then, contrary to what you propose, dont make 0.5 better bounties than 1.0, they already get way more lp, and that difference should also become smaller since there is barely difference between 0.5 and 1.0. then remove all difference between 0.1 and 0.4 space for bounties/lp. it is just plain stupid to keep/add that since there is for players no difference.still this is all nice and dandy, but you can already make quite a bit more in theory in low sec. the problem is how easy it is to kill a mission runner for a pirate without any significant risk or challenge. either the mission runner isnt tackled and he survives, or he is tackled and he dies. until this is fixed you can do what you want with low sec, you wont get more easy ganks there, which is in the end what you want.and lp payouts small? have you actually ever bothered to run missions in low sec?we have had better proposals imo and:whiel i wouldnt say before you add dynamic agent quality, it is a good point."
7/3/2010,"though i dont agree with the probe idea i agree that cloaked ships are too hard to find. rl if we had cloaking it would not be 100% perfectly indedectable, you cannot hide mass, you cannot hide heat, you cannot hide eletrical or magenetic fields, energy output from sensors, radio communications between ships and probes, electronical systems heating and wearing out (set how long a cloaked ship can stay cloaked untill it drops to cool down) or something. every cloaking device or form of camo in history has a flaw, time to add one to eve's cloaking and a way to find that flaw."
7/3/2010,"take note gallente navy, stop disguising your ships as trees!"
7/3/2010,"can we also make black ops less useful so that they can be used even less!?!there are things that could be done to make covert ships harder to use - perhaps bump skill requirements, but i think that actual cloaking mechanics work properly."
7/3/2010,no.cloakies are fun.go away.
7/3/2010,******ed idiot post is ******ed.permaban op.
7/3/2010,the assembly hall and the csm is nothing but a joke.
7/3/2010,"statement? why don't you go out there and do it yourself.take it from an experienced combat prober, any probes even with max skills will remain in visibility for at least ten seconds while you're probing down your target. stay on your toes, stay aligned out, and refresh the scanner constantly while you're being preyed upon.and?do you need any more counters? stay aligned, or stop ****ing making money when there's a threat. why are you making money? isn't it to fight? well, there's your ****ing opportunity to fight.excuse me? you can dock your mission ship and bring something to make sure the neutral or red goes away. nobody's forcing you to hide and cower. you want complete safety? go play hello kitty online."
7/3/2010,"thanks. already have. all relevant skills at 5 (yes, including astrometric rangefinding) with sisters equipment.i've had this discussion before. and won't waste my time with angry people like you. suffice it to say i'm quite capable of staying aligned when my mission gets busted. it's still doesn't fix the profit ratio once my mission location is compromised and camped to hell. you seem like the person that wouldn't understand this anyway so i'll keep it at that.as i said you won't see it. you're locked into your own tunnel-vision. the scanner is well and dandy. happy? :).how does staying aligned make missioning in low security space profitable? does it protect my mission spot?profit. i don't expect you to understand this, but docking my profit-earning ship to do anything else (including pvp) runs my profit to the ground. anyway, i won't be discussing this here anymore. it's a waste of time arguing with the elite ""pvp is the only way!"" crowd of eve :). you all have yourselves a good night."
7/3/2010,you are actively being hunted by people and all you care about is profit ratio? i rest my case.
7/3/2010,confessions of a noob starship politicianenjoy (for small values of enjoy)
7/3/2010,"trebor, you are certainly very skilled at writing.good read.reminds me of our class president in high school- he ran for office as a joke just to prove how fruitless it was, and how ""unpopular"" he was.surprise surprise."
7/3/2010,well written blog.keep 'em cumming.
7/3/2010,"added to active opml. bookmarked, etc etc :dkeep it up"
7/3/2010,nice read
7/3/2010,"this is a minor issue, and i'm not sure if this is exactly the right place to bring this up, but it's kind of annoying.ever since i trained remote sensing i can't see a planet in its natural state anymore. i either see a dark blob or a white gradient whenever i pass one.i feel that i should be able to see the natural planet textures when i am not in ""planet mode."""
7/3/2010,we all heard a lot of promises and things during the election process. we should be keeping track of who is taking their position in the csm seriously and who lied their ass off just to get free trips and free account subscriptions.who out of the csm are actually following thru with what they said they would do and who is doing the worst?no trolling and keep it on topic people.
7/3/2010,"this seems slightly premature, since we've not even been in office for one month yet. but i'm curious to see what people think as time goes on, and by what metrics we are judged (considering that achieving the metric by which we are popularly judged, e.g., the number of csm-submitted issues to be implemented in-game, is essentially hamstrung by forces totally outside our control atm)."
7/3/2010,"you are really asking two questions:1) are broad proposals likely to get lost in the backlog and never get dev time? answer: absolutely. something that is going to require multiple dev-months is just not going to get done unless someone in ccp has their own reasons for pushing for it. but such proposals may influence their thinking.2) is it tougher for broad proposals to get approved by csm? answer: somewhat, mostly because we all understand (1), so we're inclined to pick stuff that might actually get implemented in the near term. we're just being practical.the way i am trying to approach this problem -- which may not work at all but i'm giving it a shot -- is to try and craft ""shotgun"" proposals with lots of sub-elements that can be independently implemented and still provide benefits to the players."
7/3/2010,"how about organizing proposals/issues by scope? you have broad/general categories and specific ideas/solutions. so you sort the specific ones into general categories and bring the category to ccp with all the collected solutions and ideas that got voted into those category.so nothing small gets lost and the big issues also get addressed, often enough overlapping with the small ones. ccp can then pick and chose what to do out of the plethora of options and ideas given.this could also be used to organize collection of issues in the assembly hall where people can support a broad issue and bring in specific ideas to solve that issue which can gather support by itself and can get put into the category.imho, the assembly hall should only be used for supporting/voting on ideas/issues and all solution/idea development been done in the f&i forum. threads are then simply cross-linked where appropriate.with this organization, discussion and voting would be more organized and clear as people don't need to discuss a specific idea on the assembly hall, obfuscating the actual support for a broad issue.also, broad issues will no longer be dismissed because the specific solution voted on is not to the liking of the majority. voting would then be whether or not such a category should be opened and then specific solutions can be voted to be bundled in as option for a solution.after all, one of the purposes the csm has is to channel and sort player feedback for ccp."
7/3/2010,"andrea, i think small, specific proposals have the very best chance of getting done, especially if they simply involve a tweak to an existing mechanic. but in reality, it all appears to boil down to how csm-raised issues coincide with stuff ccp is already planning to do or what they are willing to make room for. last couple of csms, there appears to have been little to no synergy with ccp's development cycle at all. once the summit minutes are published, i think you'll gain a much better understanding of the nature of csm's frustration in getting ccp to take action on any of our issues. the dismaying thing is that it probably wouldn't even take that much to reverse negative opinions about ccp's lack of responsiveness. if they did even a handful of small discrete changes from csm's backlogged issues in each release, both the csm and the community would begin to feel hope again. i'm sure positive messages would ripple throughout the community as a result. that certainly wouldn't let ccp off the hook, but it would demonstrate that they are listening to the community.meanwhile, we sit and try to figure out which approaches will increase our odds of success, kinda like you're doing."
7/3/2010,"in a perfect world, this would be a good idea. but to expand on what mynxee just said, there are communications issues that csm has to resolve with ccp before we can try something so ambitious. we need to get specific feedback on what parts of such proposals are the most feasible, and be able to iterate them down to something that ccp will agree to and the players will accept. without a quick feedback loop, large proposals are doomed, other than as source material for a ccp insider's pet-project, which will then probably include things that the player's will hate, because csm won't be consulted until it's too late.if our bright and shiny new stakeholder status is to have any real meaning, csm/ccp interaction has to be a much tighter loop than twice a year."

7/4/2010,it's a good idea to remove them because they are annoying for new players nah i would go as far as to say they are annoying for all of us!but heres a question what will happen to my 4-5m sp in learnings on nearly all of my 8 toons? i mean that counts for a total of ~36m sp. and they are not even close to have pay'd back what i've invested in them i.e skilltime! so i would expect that if learnings get removed i see them reinbusted thought the system ccp intruduced in the last patch. otherwise i'm against removing them because that would be like cheating me.. i.e taking something from my toons without any return after all i pay'd for that skilltime. 4-5m sp in learnings are around 2 month skilltime meaing 30!greets
7/4/2010,"absolutely! having all players training at the same speed is completely ridiculous! because, erm, stuff. and things."
7/4/2010,"yeah! because all the evil noobs trained cybernetics to v and have spare half billion of isk lying around. ccp, better don't dare to make the game more noob-friendly!"
7/4/2010,please ccp hurry up and do this!
7/4/2010,not supported keep the skills ccp
7/4/2010,not supported!
7/4/2010,i do not see how your idea will help eve. not supported
7/4/2010,/supported. learning skills are part of the problem for newer players (3 months training learning skills before you even leave station???). dump em and reimburse the players for their wasted time.
7/4/2010,"this is funny because its a blatant fallacybut okay, keep believing what you want to"
7/4/2010,"i just returned after a 2 year break. i ran some of the old level 4 missions i was doing 2 years ago, and they got boring just as fast as i remember (i'm not quite skilled enough to make them go quickly... so they drag even worse than normal). pi has been very interesting, at least the set up... but the biggest thing that has me thinking i might actually stick around for a long time, this time, is exploration.i think the basic mechanics of exploration are a lot of fun - scanning stuff down is cool, the whole treasure hunt feel of it is great. the probe interface, moving them around, triangulating positions - amazing space sim + exploration stuff. i'm impressed.but magnetometric sites are pretty much taking the wind out of my sails. these should be the best sites for an explorer - rare archaeology that takes hour(s) to find, but is sometimes worth big bucks. instead it's a constant disappointment.how could they spend so much time making such a cool process like exploration, and then totally screw it up at the last minute by not juicing up the loot table?! it doesn't even have to make me rich, but i should definitely not feel like i would be making more money by afk-mining some veld in a retrofitted stabber.and i'm not even getting into the more development-involved possibilities for explorer loot... stuff like ""treasure map"" type items, something that would actually appeal to explorers. i guess i feel much the same way about exploration as i do about pi - great initial execution, great setup, very fun learning curve... but the long term rewards (in the case of exploration) or the maintenance (pi) just ruins the whole experience."
7/4/2010,"they need to drop much better rewards if they're to be worth scanning out, and they're absolutely terrible compared to their sister radar sites. having them drop a small amount of tech 2 salvage would be the obvious solution."
7/4/2010,intact salvage is the probably the answer. it needs to be seeded.
7/4/2010,absolutely not.
7/4/2010,"having to wait for skills is probably one of the most important features keeping customer retention rates up - this will seriously hurt eve, especially people that have been loyal customers and supported eve will hate it. also many people will gain an unfair advantage when game mechanics are changed and they are first in line to abuse it. also it is impossible to calculate ""training loss"" because skill training rates vary a lot (less than 450 sp/h to 2772 sp/h), which makes things even more complicated.i really hate this idea, and i'm certainly not alone. you should use a different subforum for your idea, you will hardly find a majority that supports this, which is fundamental for csm issues."
7/4/2010,it's just a less convenient variant on buying skills for $$$.thumbs down.
7/4/2010,"""if you properly read all that has been said, you'll see that no valuable reasons have come up to counter my idea."""
7/4/2010,"i can't help but read that sentence as ""i'm right, and i refuse to acknowledge or address any opposition as warrants a proper debate."""
7/4/2010,supported. i don't really see how it would imbalance the game.
7/4/2010,supported!please give the goodness back.
7/4/2010,"supported. i have heard plenty of people that want this to happen. i know there have been several threads that have been put up about it as well, over the last few years. i don't quite understand why it takes so long to redo ship textures, like the scorpion, and the other ships don't get overhauls as well. and if you are going to overhaul the textures, why not implement a basic system like this? it's not something you need an expansion to dedicate to.it doesn't take a marketting class to show that if a product is broken, people won't keep paying for it. if you have problems with the program, take your own advice and go back to playing fable or the sims. ccp needs to get their product straight. these threads are to show what people want implemented to make the product better. do we honestly need to tell ccp to fix lag or update a ui that is almost 10 years old? if we do, we shouldn't be buying their product. that being said, at least they have the balls to address issues when they occur instead of trying to cover them up unlike some other game producers out there and make users deal with it for weeks on end - like the autopilot bug last week.however, these threads are for suggestions, not put-downs. if you can't comfort your manliness issues in game, well, again, see your previous advice. or maybe you need to go back to my little pony or hello kitty island adventure.maybe people don't post because these threads can be rather hard to scroll through all the posts that exist on the board. i mean, i haven't counted them, but that's because i have better things to do, like go out for burgers with friends, enjoy fresh air... blow people's ships up. so i wouldn't quite call a lack of 'interest' a rejection, since gaining notice is the first part of gaining interest. speaking of blowing ships up though... do you usually fly based on blind assumptions. because i wouldn't mind blindly coming across you and making a blinding flash out of your ship...btw: ccp can deal with issues of thread abusers. actually, that's their job here, not yours."
7/4/2010,"i don't think you understand how the assembly hall works. ideas don't get rejected, they just get passed or ignored. as for the idea itself, it's non-terrible, but i'd wager that the technical difficulties are far higher than you would ever believe, and that's why it hasn't happened."
7/4/2010,"the ""color"" rigs idea is awesome - exactly what i was thinking from just reading the title - and is probably not difficult to implement (copy and paste rigs code - change the effects - done; i know it is easier said than done but the concept is really simple.)simple idea, simple implementation, a great deal of fun, why not?if ccp fear it is going to make new eden too colorful, just make it super-expensive to do a paint job, like... it will be as difficult as getting the officer items.+1"
7/4/2010,"instead of a paint shop...maybe make it an industrial processing thing.implementing each item with a color option when it is produced would clog up the market quite a bit, since you'd have color options. but industrialists could potentially take a base item, modify it, and make it a color... which could be lost when repackaged, so people could still sell the said good.gives industrialists a way to burn off extra 'cheap' minerals and compete on a per order basis rather than 0.01isk price wars on the market.only question is how would you change the color of a rigged ship?.. ah well, you'd lose the rigs on them to repackage them as is, so what does it matter?"
7/4/2010,"+1 of course.you would obviously only see (and get from the server) your own bookmarks. so if you make ten bilions of them around a gate for whatever ******ed reason, you only lag yourself to death."
7/4/2010,i do think out of all the things mentioned so far this seem the most feasible idea and the easiest to implement.wile i'm in here i do not think it would take away from pi or would make it a step closer to wow
7/4/2010,"makes sense, and it takes a whole 10 seconds of coding work. why not have it ccp?"
7/4/2010,"i, too, am frustrated by the corporate hangar and ship maintenance bays being closed when my orca docks, undocks or jumps between systems."
7/4/2010,"yeah, this is dumb."
7/4/2010,"look, while dierdra's proposal for ccp to actually focus on the many issues plaguing the game is a step in the right direction, i think ccp needs to, for a single expansion, focus on this above all else. we need no flashy new features, no walking in stations, nothing like that, we need ccp to put a shine on this game. implement features that have been promised, and make what's already there better. for a short list of possible things that should be fixed: laghacking, specifically python injectiongraphical errorslearning skillsstupid agression mechanicsbroken t2 ammoui updatestreatiesdid i mention lag?i'd like to point out this is list is by no means complete, feel free to post additional topics that need fixing in your comments.if your art team will get bored, have them make a primae class salvager or tech one tier 3 bcs for each race or something."
7/4/2010,"wouldnt be ""no lag"" a new feature too?"
7/4/2010,fully supported.
7/4/2010,"you can wish , no one can stop you but ccp is allready spread thin on incarna/dust."
7/4/2010,wtb better aggression mechanics. no more station games plox
7/4/2010,"i'll support this, but i'm under no illusions. ccp will not listen, and will continue to pump out half-finished, untested and badly designed ""features"", rather than ever focus on fixing existing content."
7/4/2010,"i'm under no illusions. ccp probably won't listen to something like this unless it becomes a mega-hyper threadnaut like dierdra's proposal. even so, it can't hurt to try, and if ccp does listen to their customers, having this idea out there is good."
7/4/2010,buttes.
7/4/2010,^ what they said.
7/4/2010,"i have gathered together as many of the good pi suggestions as i could find into a single omnibus proposal, which you can read here:"
7/4/2010,"many great ideas ,allthough i am afraid that making rescanning extractors to easy will make pi market crash.remember we have no way to eliminate competition ( yet )."
7/4/2010,"can you explain your concern in more detail (in other words, what is the chain of consequences, and how would you tweak things in order to mitigate them)?"
7/4/2010,i would wait with this particular change until we can conquer planets/kill other people infrastructure.
7/4/2010,"many people - myself included - are avoiding pi because the level of clicking involved is too high. as the interface gets less godawful, people who are avoiding it might start participating in it, thereby increasing the supply and lowering prices. as someone who fuels several towers, i like this thought, but it's an entirely believable consequence. same reason why i think that inventors might not be as happy as they'd like to think they will be if ccp ever allows batched installations of science jobs."
7/4/2010,"but by that logic, ccp should actively try and make pi as mind-numbing as possible, so that it has fewer players, therefore less competition for producers, which means higher prices, until the point where the profit is so high that even herschel yamamoto will throw himself into the hell of ten thousand clicks. if someone can make a plausible argument that a particular feature request has unintended consequences, great -- that's the kind of iteration i want to see, and that i want to encourage ccp to do with csm (and through csm, with informed players). but ""gee, this might cause prices to change"" won't cut it.you of all people, herschel, should be in favor of changes that favor thinkers over clickers.or did you perhaps forget your <sarcasm> tags?"
7/4/2010,"to be honest, pi is completely unsalvageable.ccp designed a low level micromanagement design with no higher level strategy at all. it's a carbon copy of pos reactions.as such, no matter how much you refine the ui, the underlining mechanics prevent the feature from being meaningful in any way.a better system would work by taking the current one and replacing the micromanagement with a macro view of the planet, managing colonies from a high level strategic view with optional micromanaging. if i could just tell my colonies to extract in a general area, and produce whatever and optionally directly interfere with that process, the system would be much better.a simple area of influence could represent the area in which you can build, growing by planting special pins (similar to the settlers/anno). when two borders touch, there is a conflict zone (tie-in to dust). border influence should be influenced by shipping/producing military related hardware, which neatly lays ground work for dust while opening room for territorial disputes over local resources.the current system lacks any opportunities for high level gameplay, interaction, competition or conflict. it's a purely mechanical system.basically, any minigame that i lose to simple recorded mouse movements is garbage. pi is such a ""game""."
7/4/2010,"oh, don't get me wrong, i support making it easier. carpal tunnel is a medical condition, not a game balance tool. i'm just saying, that when you remove the pain from painful-but-profitable game activities, you usually remove a good pile of the profit too. it's not enough to make me stop supporting it(especially for a game mechanic i don't even partake in), but i can see why it'd be a concern for some.the more i think about it, the more i agree with this guy. pi is based on farmville, when it should have been based on simcity or civilization. i'm not actually sure how it can be made into a good system."
7/4/2010,"yep same here, i'm really curious how ccp is going to build all that 'conflict' and 'combat' for dust into pi as it is now.~o~"
7/4/2010,"this. the only fun part of pi is the first part setting up everything then it just stops. making people click a bunch of **** for no reason is not game play, it's just pointless make work."
7/4/2010,"actually, thinking about it some more, pi devs should probably take a look at the settlers 2 for a game that features a map of localized resources, area of influence and complex micromanagement combined with high level strategy with conflict added in."
7/4/2010,"completely agree.the very basic level of pi is designed in the way which inevitably puts us into a ""bottleneck"" - anything that is left to improve is a way to clickity click more comfortably.it is not even a ""minigame"". a game element is present outside of pi - watch markets, decide what to produce, plan your hauling, etc. pi itself is not a game at all - just apply some planetary layout, which are already designed, and then just click click click for many years to come.sorry to sound so pessimistic... current pi implementation can have lots of improvements ofc, and proposed ones are well thought out, but it is just like doing a make-up for a corpse. it will look much better, but still 100% dead."
7/4/2010,"trebor, i haven't touched pi at all because i find the whole concept more like my rl job than a game, with none of the benefits like rl money. that said, you've obviously put a lot of hard, professional work into your proposal, and i'll support you even if only for that. also, i voted for you and i like to see my tax iskies being put to good use"
7/4/2010,"processors should be given a setting that allows them to consume more than 3000 units every 30 minutes. this toggle could be found under the ""stats"" heading and have 3 levels -level 1 - as it functions now.level 2 - double the processing (6000 units processed into 40 units every 30 minutes), at a cost of four times the processor's normal cpu.level 3 - doubled again (12000 units processed into 80 units every 30 minutes), at a cost of four times the processor's cpu again.what this does is allows planets to use all that extra cpu they have, and prevents planets focused on extraction from having to devote half their powergrid to processing. some of my setups in highsec perma-run 5-6 processors with only 7 extractors, i assume it's far worse in nullsec.this also helps alleviate the supply crunch going on in p2 and p3 products, and makes p4 production less of a logistical nightmare. even more so if the toggle is also given to advanced processors.also, one suggestion that's been brought up that i didn't see on your list:make links cost no powergrid, only cpu: encourages more spread-out colonies, stops punishing pi setups that don't keep links as few and as short as possible."
7/4/2010,"not sure i agree with this one. you want to impose costs to make people think a bit more about colony design. but if you get a f&i thread going on this and there is significant support, i will add it.as for the processor tweak, i'm more dubious about that one just because of the extra programming it's going to take -- it might displace fixing 2-3 other things that would be higher priority.i understand that some people have, shall we say, strong feelings about the pi design. but realistically it is not going to get a from-scratch redesign, so the issue is how to iterate it into something that more eve players will like and use."
7/4/2010,"the point is: all the whine about ""how much time it takes to restart the processors"" is simply not true. i just checked my daily restart routine and watched the time used: 80 seconds for one colony with 12 extractors. this is hardly much, considering that it has to be done only once a day if in 23h mode. so making it even easier is basically giving out isk for free. if you can't even be bothered to invest 10 minutes a day, why should you get any money at all from it?"
7/4/2010,"awesome i got moved!please consider this.wormholes contain the top end content in eve pve.the wormholes this content can have different effects- shield tanking wormholes, armor tanking wormholes.this content at this top level requires group team work.the nature of wormholes also involves scanning, pvp and is isolated from empire.so you have an environment that is dynamic, shield tank op this wormhole, armour tank the next one, change to scanning ships to find them.its endgame eve. you use the best ships. you use the best modules. you work in groups.you can swap ships, you can reconfigure ships. but to use implants with this top end content is near impossible. hence the ultimate reason for the changes. implants and jumpclones do not scale well with content. for the base/simple user its not an issue. but at this end of the park its messed up.the suggestions i have made are trying to address this in the most elegant manner possible. please think of the entire game, i have had lots of posts from people that have probably never seen the inside of wspace. they make generalised catch phrase statements such as 'want it all' 'risk vs reward' 'choices you make' without actually making valid arguments. one day you people that are not effected so much by this might have multi-skilled characters in wspace running c5/c6 sleepers and you will understand where i am coming from. the implants tied to jumpclone system has some real issues with modern wspace content."
7/4/2010,ohhh mai gawd!!!ok earlier i thought i had found the worst ****ing idea ever.this however is even worse!i'm not even going to bother describing why this idea sucks or waste time explaining how this violates about 80 bijillion different elements of ccp/eve tradition.hell no not supported!
7/4/2010,i thank you for your detailed point of view. you argue the points well. can you please answer some simple questions? i am interested in your reply.how long have you lived in deep wspace? how do you find the ability to swap between your implants in wspace? do you think that it would be a good thing to use your scanning implants when you want to use your scanning ship? your shield tanking implants for when you want to use your shield tanking ship? your armour tanking implants for your armour tanking ship?do you run sleeper sites? do you run different {armour/shield} gangs on sleeper sites depending on the wormhole bonuses?do you even use combat implants? do you fly more than one ship in a 24hr period?what is in your opinion the best feature about being stuck in your implants for 24hrs?
7/4/2010,"not supported , i want to kill you with your expensive implants in your head an laugh."
7/4/2010,"sigh, another reply with no substance. did you read any of the thread linked in the op? did you read the part where i explain how i would love to actually use the multi-billion isk implants but due to the nature of the 24hr timer it makes it totally impracticable? that the current system actually restricts risk vs reward?most likely not. if you really did read and actually comprehend it, it would have been nice for you to at the very least explain why the implants tied to 24hr jump clone is good gameplay?anyway.well i have played eve for many years.this the only suggestion i have offered and most likely the only one. overall i love this game.i am sorry that the particular opponents in my thread fail to realise that the result of this change would mean more risk vs rewards not less.despite all the posts i still do not see anyone bringing up any good game play points in implants being tied to a 24hr jump clone timer. there is no good risk vs reward in the current wait 24hr mechanism. the 'risk' is actually rather lame [haha you are now in scanning implants for the next 24hrs because you wanted to use/risk a good scanning ship - is not good game play]. it is particularly evident in dynamic wspace and stifles people from using more/better implants.being able to use implants that are specific to what you want to do however does provide good game play as well as great risk vs reward potential. i have wasted enough time trying to explain all this on the forums so i shall retire from my threads and get back to the game. i hope intelligent people can understand the issues and what i am talking about. lots of <3 ccp and capsuleers. eve is an awesome game. wspace is the bomb. keep up the good work."
7/4/2010,"the assembly hall is an out-of-character forum. next time, try something like ""make implant sets separate from jump clones, so that we can switch implants without needing to jump across the galaxy"". and no, not supported."
7/4/2010,"while this sounds appealing, it's not actually a practical way to run anything. for one, the csm is an advisory body, not the boss. for two, i'm not going to demand that it get done the way that was specified on the assembly hall if ccp comes up with something better/more practical. i'd like to see ccp follow the csm's lead more often, but this isn't the way to make that happen."
7/4/2010,not a practical way to run anything? the one tool we are given is to propose a change ...this is a change is it not? for the last 5 csm's what has actually been done that we the player base wants?
7/4/2010,"not all change is desirable, or practical, or likely to happen. there are better places for csm to focus their energies than this."
7/4/2010,moved from jita park speakers corner.
7/4/2010,"while it would be great for settling debates, like the age-old ""jih-ta"" vs ""jee-ta"" one, this seems like a good way to promote interface clutter without actually adding to the game. it's not worth it."
7/4/2010,"already an active thread on this, however you presented it much better, i like how you used point/couterpoint to show whats good and bad about it. alot of threads these days are 'gimm3 th1s, n0 g00d r3az0n i just w4nt 1t!!!1!' and when people say its a bad idea the op gets poed and counterattacks will require some ships to have slight modding, others like the drake and rifter already have have built in missile luanch points. dunno how ccp would change ships like the hurricane which doesn't have a single point where a missile could possibily come from. also, you have the pheonix which is a few km long. if one luancher is at the front, one in the middle, and on at the afk, you would need to be closer for the one in the aft to hit the target. but then agian who said that the visual missile has to be the actual missile, they could just make the missile eye candy and have the actual missile basically invisible. sadly i don't think that ccp will ever do this, they are too busy adding useless and half finished additions to eve like pi.edit: forgot to support"
7/4/2010,"supported. this issue is especially annoying with ships like the drake, where the ships origin is actually in empty space and you can see the missiles appear out of nowhere. i think anyone who says it would cause too much lag is just desperately searching for a way to knock this idea and 'keep eve conservative"". can't see why it would cause much lag considering turret ships have up to 16 separately moving models with multiple rotating parts that can shoot in multiple directions. just make missiles have turrets with big chunky barrels on them. problem solved. (for ships like the drake and crow, just place the missile origins at the pre-existing launchers, maybe?"
7/4/2010,absolutely outrageous. i fully support this.if the player is in a supercap then delivery to their hanger should be possible.
7/4/2010,agreed. let us redeem ships in ships that can hold ships!!! roit! roit! roit!*insert angry mob*

7/4/2010,"the discrimination and hatred must stop, ore!"
7/4/2010,"there are many pvpers that have alts for mission running to make some isk. for them, enough increased reward for going to low sec would be worth it."
7/4/2010,solo player won't have so many webs to stack. speed is the one thing that can let you survive when blobbed. no buff to blob. this is a buff to noob-griefing/industrial popping and nerf to real pvp. not supported.
7/4/2010,"oh, those poor blobbers, not able to kill a solo target because their quad webs don't work well enough. not supported."
7/4/2010,"because of all this rage on the forums about learning skills, i thought i'd put in my 2 cents on a possible proposal. please feel free to support it or criticize it. so here it is.-keep learning skills in the game (best possible solution in my opinion as anything else would polarize the eve community too much)introduce a new skill with pre-reqs (learnings to 4/4 or 5/4?)-new skill can just be a 1 lvl skill which will knock a certain skill's rank down depending on the base rank. -i.e. rank 3 becomes 2...rank 2 becomes 1....rank 1 becomes something like 75% of it..rank 5 to rank 3 and so on. kind of like a sliding scale.this proposal would benefit older players as well as motivate newer players to actually train the learning skills."
7/4/2010,"even as a supporter of learning skills... wow, no. you're actually saying the solution is to add more skills?to be frank, all of the ""anti"" crowd will be on you like ants on roadkill. that's their main point of contention."
7/4/2010,"that would make the problem worse. there are two perceived problems with the learning skills:a) they're boring and should be removed from the game on general principles, andb) because of the two free remaps and accelerated training bonus, new characters feel the need to spend the first month+ on training the learning skills, which is a bad way to introduce the game.this proposal solves neither problem."
7/4/2010,this isnt the first time i or others have said this but as a learning skills supporter i feel the best way to anger the least amount of people would be to give everyone the learning skills and use the new sp re-imbursement system to give sp to the players that already trained them.

7/4/2010,"as any bustling tradesman will tell you, keeping track of the dozens, if not hundreds, of individual orders can be quite the time-consuming task. just as individual market items can be placed in folders in the quickbar tab, i propose the same should be done for the selling and buying sections on the orders tab for current and future orders. for example, say you make a majority of your money producing a multitude of battlecruisers. instead of looking through your list to check on those individual orders, you can instead place these orders under a folder you designate, such as ""manufactured ships"". another possibility would be to have the wallet ""remember"" what orders you create and put them in their folder category automatically. advantages:quick, easy access to specific orders of greater importance to the user. easily keep track of specific orders that are frequently updated.a cleaner order interfaceif the wallet ""remembers"" order categories, moving an item into its category is only needed once.disadvantages:potential increased server load for ""remembering"" categories. a simple check/uncheck system could alleviate this however.instead of an order list with individual items, it'll be cluttered with folders.more work putting each item into its own specific category"

7/4/2010,i have gathered together as many of the good pi suggestions as i could find into a single omnibus proposal:
7/4/2010,"mynxee is normally cool-headed, so one would assume that there's a lot happening behind the scenes in order for a spate of posts on forums to drive her to this kind of rage post.as anyone who has worked with/around children will know, the catch with trying to negotiate with a two year old is that you start negotiating like a two year old. getting mynxee riled up like this indicates to me that sokratesz is behaving like a two year old. reading the minutes of csm meetings will enlighten people further.mynxee's rage-post was very informative, as it sheds light on what she perceives as being important: csm working as a team and contributing positively to the future of the game. it also shows us that mynxee is human, and not a suit-wearing robot, just in case there was any doubt in the matter.two thumbs up from me, mynxee."
7/4/2010,"*hugs* maratbh, sok is a smart and pleasant guy in rl (sorry to out you, sok!). i was rattled and disappointed by the dichotomy between that and his (imo) unnecessary mention of ""spoongate"" which was clearly going to wind up the trolls. so i raged. probably in conjunction with a hot flash....errr, i mean power surge. that accomplished nothing but feeding the trolls more and certainly didn't reflect the kind of image i hope players get of csm, which is inspired in part by the behavior of its delegates. but hey, as you said, i'm only human. and you know...i'm better now. the men in the white coats said so."

7/5/2010,i'm with the crowd that says if you're going to remove learning skills then you only reimburse the sp put into the learning skills and nothing else. why should you get +10 to your attributes after the skills are gone. strip the skills and drop everyone to the base level stats instead. that would even the playing field just as easily with less concern about giving all the older players some sort of rate adjusted sp bonus for what should have been this supposed +10 the whole time.

7/5/2010,this
7/5/2010,i vote yes! remove learning skills and imburse the invested amount of skillpoints
7/5/2010,"oh, this again. obviously most people don't like the base training speed since they pick up the learning skills in the first place. its just that not everyone likes the means for acquiring it.is the proposed solution something for nothing? absolutely. they could look at alternate means of new players ""earning"" the learning skills, such as gaining them automatically with time played or on finishing the tutorial etc, but its not strictly necessary. ultimately ccp will decide how fast they want newbies to advance in the game in the beginning, if that's faster then they do currently, so be it. if a few veterans can't handle this, tough."
7/5/2010,"let me propose a solution and you can tell me what you think. it really is not that well thought so any input good or bad would be appreciated.generally from what i can understand the problem with learning skills is the time you have to put into training them, especially the second set. the first one includes only rank 1 skills so it's not so tragic. as far as the second one goes i would propose a change from rank 3 to rank 2.now you have two categories of people (maybe 3 including the ones that don't want to train them at all): 1) the ones who are reluctant to train the second learning skills to 5 because of the days they would put into and as a consequence they feel disadvantaged. training a rank 2 skill on the other hand is more tolerable.2) the other ones who have already trained them could get the remaining sp back but in a way that would be fair(-looking) to other players. get some sp per month, for say 6 months, until you use all the remaining sp (about 1,25 mil) or get faster training times for the same amount of sp.this way you don't need to eliminate the learning skills at this point and the players that didn't train them won't feel at a great disadvantage against the other who would be taking back 1,25 mil sp (compared to 5,3 if they eliminate the learning skills altogether)...tell me what you think...cheersps. i don't know if someone suggested the same thing again.if so ignore it..."
7/5/2010,all supported but the 3rd point. sp reimbursement should be done with the new sp injection system.
7/5/2010,the author's solution was before the sp injection system was put in place. i'm with the crowd that thinks ccp was testing out mass injection of sp with the 100k bonus.

7/5/2010,"even though i only began playing in 2008. i still think it would be nice to have these changes. yes i have maxed out learning skills. but if they prevent newer players from enjoying the game to the fullest, similarly to me now, i think the original ideas in this post are great.agreed and signed and hope newer players can get the benefit of these changes too."

7/5/2010,"/signedi approve of this change. it will allow newbies to get right to the interesting skills and allow veterans several million sp to do w/e they want with.edit: and yes, learning skills are a deterrent to new players. my cousin quit two weeks after he started because he didn't want to sit for 2 months doing nothing. my brother decided to just play other games while the skills trained. how is this good game design? it baffles me how so many people are saying ""lolol, don't like it don't train it! quit if you want, whiners!"" i sincerely hope these people never run their own business. mmorpgs are dependent on subscriptions. want more content? more updates? more players = more revenue = more content/updates. not deterring potential subscribers is better for everyone. employees and servers don't pay for themselves."
7/5/2010,"you want a valid rebut to your assinine idea? here goes.you know how every account in eve has three slots to create three seperate and unique characters? well guess what, neither eve nor ccp have any clue which is your main and which is your alt. so the idea you are proposing is that any alt characters on a single account would be applicable for this instant sp. i have an alt that was created years ago and have barely trained anything at all on him. but who (except for me) is to say if he is my main or not?to further crush your troll, there is a mechanism in place already where you can spend money to get sp. not sure if you realized this but you can buy a character from another player who wants to sell one. you can do this with isk which incidentally can be bought for real money.buying a character that has been validly trained is fine. implanting sp onto an inactive character that was arbitrarily created at a time in the distant past is game breaking. it would affect so much more than just the character receiving the sp. if you can't see that, than you are beyond reasoning with."
7/5/2010,"1. main char are easy to notice, its the one with the most sp...2. like when you can claim a gift, you could do it only once per account.3. i said already that you could purchase a max of 1 year of unplayed game time worth, and again, whats the difference between paying now or later ?4. buying a new character is a completly different thing and since eve have already those kind of features, dont you think what im asking is mild compared to that ?thx, have a good day."
7/5/2010,"here is my proposal to the csm.in july 2009, we were given an informative dev blog about the then cosmos and now eve gate. amongst the information in this blog is this line:so far, the eve online api has seen very few additions since that time. we've still got titles-only for eve mails, nothing for pi, huge numbers of bugs and quirks in the way the api functions, and recently we've seen even more comments from devs that strange behavior is becoming more common; skillpoint oddities and the like.since the release of eve gate, we've had no support from the devs about the api or accessing any features of eve gate programmatically. we've had threats of bans for crawling/scraping, though the eula and tos have not been updated to reflect this. and we've had no response to any queries we've openly put to the devs on the matter of new api features (for example, full eve mail access - we only get titles in the api) and fixing old bugs. we've had one or two fixes in the last few expansions- that's all.i feel that ccp has taken the wrong approach with eve gate and would like them to reconsider the approach they are taking, and potentially shift it. social networks like facebook thrive on integration and applications. eve gate offers no facility for either of these, instead limiting people to only doing what ccp provides, and only on ccp's website in the way that ccp wants them to do. this removes a vast amount of potential from the site. standards like opensocial permit for high levels of integration without exposing personal data beyond that agreed with the application on install; this is covered further towards the end of this post.my proposal is essentially to ask ccp to place an emphasis on making new apis, on bringing support for third party applications and open integration into eve gate through existing open standards, and to place a new priority on maintaining and improving the api to maintain openness of data- anything that is available through eve gate should be available through apis with the same level of permissions.permissions is my other point. because ccp has not made apis available a large amount of applications which require a user's eve login to function have started cropping up. this is going backwards- before the api we had this situation, where you had to give your eve login to third party apps for them to function. clearly from a security standpoint this is extremely worrying. the solution is easy - ensure api equivalents are exposed for all eve gate features.in addition to this problem, with the large number of api functions already available and the large number of additional functions that would be made available should ccp actually replicate eve gate features into the api, a two or even three key system for api permissions is simply not enough to provide sufficient granularity. open standards for application authentication and permissions should be adopted as a matter of urgency. this would enable users to grant applications only the permissions that application needs to function, and nothing else, and would let users see exactly what an application will have access to prior to granting it access. such protocols include oauth, used heavily by twitter and facebook.the changes proposed above would not require a large increase in development time, but would require nontrivial redistribution of time that would otherwise be spent on new features, but i am confident the playerbase would in general welcome changes proposed above.if nothing else, ccp would gain a multitude of useful apps and tools which would increase use of their own platform, rather than drive people from it, increasing return on investment for invested developer time and cost by improving the user experience."

7/5/2010,"i've run the numbers on it, and for any good t2 ship bpos, the advanced arrays do make good sense - your margins are fat enough that +10% cost for -25% time is still an increase in profit/hour. a plant-upgraded amarr outpost is better, but not everyone has access to that. that said, just because there's a niche situation where they're correct doesn't mean that they're as good as they ought to be. i see no good reason why we shouldn't be allowed to build t2 ships at their standard costs in pos lines. i'd like to see a change of some sort added here."

7/5/2010,t3 ships are not logistics ships; doing this would step all over the toes of the t2 logistics cruisers. it's similar to giving the proteus 125mb drone bandwidth... it would then would be better than the ishtar which is the specialised drone cruiser.
7/5/2010,no it wouldn't.logistics have a lot of advantages over t3 which wouldn't change at all with better range.
7/5/2010,so your school of thought is that a t3 ship should never match a specialist ship even when the t3 ship itself is set up in such a way that specializes it?
7/5/2010,"i don't necessarily support all the points the op brought up, but a development cycle with no new major content (even though i don't think tyranis qualifies as major content anyway) is long overdue. finish the last several expansions you've only half-developed and fix the major bugs those expansions have introduced. the game is getting worse, not better, and ccp needs to acknowledge that fact and devote their energy to reversing that trend."

7/5/2010,"ok, i did my ranting, now let's do this refreshing of a corpse.just would like to clarify:""windows and panes * move the pi interface into standard eve windows. ""does it only mean making pin info window with the same functionality as others (resizing, color schemes) - which would be good, but not crucial.or it means also moving the main interface (the one with ""submit"" button) into a window. current fixed placement is extremely annoying and inconsistent with other ui. of course, this was noticed at a test phase and proposed, and of course nothing happened."
7/5/2010,"completely true. i just want to discourage the ""one button to restart them all"". everything in eve should have an opportunity cost. if the need to invest time diminishes the opportunity cost goes down.pi mostly makes my 0.0 logistics a bit easier. it is not the highlight of my day. i wouldn't call it ""not fun"" because it saves me tedious trips to empire to fuel a pos."
7/5/2010,you deconstructed pi in just three sentences. not bad.
7/5/2010,"the latter. everything but the actual planet backdrop should be in eve-style windows, so they can be moved to suit the tastes of the player. i have edited the proposal to make this more clear.and tbh, it would be nice to have the ship control interface visible when in space and in planetary mode. any reasons why that shouldn't be added?i totally agree with the concept of opportunity cost, i just don't think the cost should be mindless clicking. just to throw out an idea as an example, pi might be tweaked so that resource degrade over time, so just clicking to restart all the processors has diminishing returns. if however, you were able to move pins, then if you wanted to take the extra time to resurvey, you could optimize your returns. time vs. profit, and at least a bit of thinking involved -- is the cost of moving the pins worth the additional income, and how will my nearby competitors react?"
7/5/2010,"i don't have competition in 0.0 so far. :)i do agree that clicking isn't the best way to go. on the other hand: we both don't expect pi to get a radical change in the near future. as long as pi doesn't need much interaction after setting it up (which is kinda fun...) there needs to be at least some effort involved timewise. i don't think moving pins would change the way i'd do my pi unless i lose all my resources otherwise. i already overproduce raw materials and stockpile them even without actively trying to do so. i could not bother for 2 days until i'd start to run out. i do not know how that works out in highsec though where resources are more scarce. the ""best"" thing of course would be to redesign pi a bit to involve more ""interaction"" in the whole planetary thing as others already pointed out. simply removing one source of funlessness without replacing the time-investment cannot be."

7/5/2010,"there should be a bidding process for empire wardecs, if not mutual, decced corp can pay to block wardec, dec goes through if deccing corp can fork over more isk to concord. losing bids not refunded. it has the potential to become an enormous isk sink and benefit eve economy as a whole.highsec griefer corps won't like this, but there's lowsec if you want unrestricted pvp, htfu."
7/5/2010,the only person here who needs to htfu is you.
7/5/2010,"additional isk sinks are of no benefit to the eve economy - they would, in fact, be an awful idea. the idea itself is pretty lacking, too - why do wars and mercenaries need such an overwhelming nerf?"
7/5/2010,"looks good. merc dec costs are paid by employer, as is currently the case. it would just mean employer may have to pay more depending on target. the mercs nerfed by this are kb padders who's hired by no one and therefore will have to pay up themselves. oh well, that's okay.isk sink benefits game economy. devs says so. it's also a rule in all mmorpgs.htfu lol"
7/5/2010,"why would i ever pay for mercs when just counter-bidding the wardeccers is so much cheaper? eve has been in a state of persistent deflation for several years. if anything, we need fewer isk sinks and/or more sources. i'll wait to see how the tyrannis changes shake out, because there were a few significant ones, but those look to have been deflationary on net as well, so i doubt they'll change my mind. the only reason isk sinks are a rule in mmorpgs is that most of them experience crippling inflation. eve does not, because of its different game mechanics(mostly the fact that stuff blows up when you die, which both dramatically increases the amount of goods you need to consume and dramatically decreases how much of a perfectionist you are with acquisition of those goods). no inflation = no need for additional isk sinking. i've often stated that i can teach someone economics in ten minutes, but you have to actually spend those ten minutes."
7/5/2010,"real wardeccers based on underlying reason won't give up so easily when counterbidded, unlike casual kb padders and griefers. people will still hire merc for both offensive and defensive decs based on beef, pos spot, market share, or other underlying reasons. depending on teary griefed noobie corps under griefers' boots isn't the only way to make a living for mercs. before ccp lowered dec costs, mercs made a living fighting real wars. no reason why they couldn't do the same again.item sink does not conteract inflation, it's the opposite. fewer items available means higher value. market responds to higher value by producing more items. the current mudflation of top tier deadspace/officer mods is due to too many people having too much disposable isk looking to buy them, causing market to respond by having more ppl farming plex, where they get comfortable and continuously spewing those mods. isk sink is good for game economy.despite what you may think, mmorpg economy is very different from irl economy. many of the same rules don't apply. isk is created from nothing (isk faucet) and disappear into nothing (isk drain). it's an artificial, arbitrary system. it takes very little knowledge in economics to spot this."
7/5/2010,"what i said was that an item sink counteracts the tendencies that lead towards mudflation - namely, perfectionism. an ever-increasing amount of money enters the game, but each player only needs one weapon, one helm, two rings, etc., so that money is chasing a fixed, and very small, number of items. there's also a market in lower-end items, but that gets so badly distorted by all the rich high-level players that the prices are too high for the people who need them, and cheap as free for alts. hence the need for cash sinks - the game can't handle any significant increase in the money supply per player without massive inflation on the handful of items that are actually worth buying. eve has no such problem. the demand for goods is vastly higher - i own over two dozen pvp ships, and that's without any special stockpiling for combat - and there's nowhere near the same push for perfection. yeah, there'll be pressure in different directions on different items, and i'm not surprised that high-end loot is going up as the rich get richer. but if this is your idea of inflation, you're simply wrong. and yes, i am quite well-versed in the difference between eve's economy and rl's. there are some noticeable differences. however, inflation is pretty much the same in both cases. the only differences will be the technicalities of how you measure money supply and price levels."

7/5/2010,"i vote no. you don't need to fit customized implants for every possible scenario when you can:a) use generic implants,b) swap out rigs,c) bring extra or more powerful ships,d) use a bonused ship (such as for scanning)e) don't necessarily have to armor tank a shield unfriendly wormhole.is there really any content or scenario that requires the use of highly specialized implants to successfully complete? if not, then allowing for the easy swapping of implants is just a case of one character trying be good at everything at once.(yes, i would love the ability to easily and quickly swap out implants, but it's not worth the dev time to work on it. it wouldn't make even significantly better.)"
7/5/2010,"thanks for your input :d it is appreciated! that is totally true. but by that reasoning why even have implants that effect ships or skills then? i do not also need dead space or faction gear either but i can use it if i wish. to bring this down to the lowest common set up that would work is shrinking the sandbox. there are 10 implant slots that can give 10 bonuses to your ships. that is pretty significant. the range of implants and ships, rigs, modules are so varied, they work together. however the implant side of it has both some signficant scalability and accessability issues. you touch on the scalability issues when you stated: lets look at this. if my character only flys caldari ships and generally lives in hi sec running missions. i really dont need to swap implant sets ever. if i am a bit more advanced i might also pvp. so i might have a jumpclone with pvp implants in. or simply a clone with cheaper learning implants. i stay in these setups for perhaps days/weeks. or a player has a pve character and a pvp character both with separate implants. these people do not suffer any kind of impact from the 24hr jumpclone timer relationship. what inconvience it is minor and is just considered normal way the game is.on the other end of the scale a player that: has very high sp; can fly many types of ships; is very active and swaps between many ships and roles in a day. this is where the scalability problems come in with the implant system as it currently is. 10 slots of bonuses for those many ships but are stuck on 24hr timers and in jumpclones. while that player can jump from a scanning ship to a pvp ship to a pve ship instantly in station or a sma he cannot do this with the implants that provide bonuses for those ships.there is no good reason for this. it has the effect as you said:that is me right now and the point of my whole posting! :di am using generic implants. i would like to use lots of good ones. while i will be rewarded with bonuses to my ship/role i also have the risk of loosing those implants and the potentially large sum of isk i spent on them.was not mean to change the entire universe heh. however there is more to this. you see this change would actually open up the market more for these exclusive and expensive implants. i personally also think it would see a huge uptake in people using implants because they might see how useful they can be. learning implants have had a huge impact on the way implants are viewed by players. when you start the game the first implants you will use are learning ones. most people then attach the idea of risk vs reward in implants is based on loosing your learning implants or not. eve is a much greater/deeper game than that. implants are more than learning. they are very much based to your ship and ingame activities. so then this leads to the accesibility issues. you have great ship, great implants, great modules and a job you need to do for an hour, scanning for a complex say. while you can use your best scanning ship, best implants, best rigs for that hour, you are stuck with your billion dollar scanning implant set for the next 24hrs. i do not see how this is good or makes sense. it stifles the use of implants. it reduces potential risk vs reward. its not something you would *drop everything for* but it has merits and should be considered at some point.thanks again for taking the time to read, reply and reasons for your vote."

7/5/2010,"only if ccp is ******ed. sadly, i think that they are, but i could design a non-bottlenecked industry system in my sleep. and i guarantee that the transition would work better than the npc-to-pi transition did."
7/5/2010,dyspro/prom -> technetiumnpc trade goods -> pi....just saying.
7/5/2010,"read the link in my previous post - i go into this phenomenon in significant detail. basically, ccp designs industry systems to have unavoidable bottlenecks. t2 and t3 both have fixed ratios of supply, fixed ratios of demand, and the two don't match. whatever has the lowest supply/demand ratio is the bottleneck, anything with a similar ratio(e.g., promethium, dysprosium) is valuable, and anything else is trash. salvage has supply and demand that both vary somewhat, so there's no single bottleneck, making it work a fair bit better. and while minerals are very fixed on the demand side there's immense flexibility of supply, meaning that there's no real ability for a bottleneck to form(at least, not since the stealth buff to veld spawn last summer). if ccp designed sane industry systems, with actual variance in supply and demand options, the bottleneck problem would vanish, just as it has in the mineral market. introduce comet mining for t2 goo, while making ships consume a wider spread of materials. for t3 have salvage ratios vary by sleeper class and salvage demand vary by race/subsystem. poof, bottlenecks are gone. it's not hard, it would just require them to think things through. but i suppose it's so much easier to just up spawn rates on the current bottleneck instead and enjoy the three-day period before your stupidity becomes obvious.also, max, can you fix the capitalization of the thread title plz?"
7/5/2010,normal salvage does not have a single bottleneck.

7/5/2010,"the trouble is the anti training skill crowd want free stuff.the pro training skill crowd see the investment/reward from learning skills.personally, if it was me, i'd remove them, give back the sp for them on people that trained them.and nothing elsethen see how much people scream that ""learning takes too much time, do something about it"""
7/5/2010,"and when ccp respond to this issue by increasing attributes/base training speed, you'd be totally ok with that right?"
7/5/2010,"this is terribly naive. you dismiss their pov because you say they want ""free stuff"", yet you ignore that the main reason people suggest getting rid of learning skills and boosting everyone's attributes is because it is the best way. removing learning and boosting everyone's stats bypasses the core problems with other suggestions.whether or not they reimburse learning skills is really immaterial (to me) - especially to those of us who've had them trained for a few years now. but... the reimbursement is not immaterial to the poor sap who just spent the 3 million sp training learning skills.honestly, the only ""free stuff"" i want is for the game to be a better game - and removing learning skills is a good way to start down that path.and that's a completely ******ed view to take:- it slows down people's progression in the game, a lot. this means that new recruits will take even longer to get their skills up to a place that is generically useful.- it gives players who already trained learning skills years ago what will become a 10-15 year advantage instead of what is currently a 3-4 year advantage. btw, a 10 year jump in learning abilities is ""free stuff"".yeah, who's the one wanting ""free stuff"". -lianged: and to the op: no. adding more skills is not the answer."
7/5/2010,"no more learning skills please. whatever benefits are conferred from the skills we have now (liang, shush now, even if you think those arguments are insuficient to justify the learning skills they're still there), the time those skills take is easily enough already.besides, the whole argument is moot. ccp can't fix rockets in 2 years, a change which is universally agreed upon, and which merely requires changing 2 numbers, then what are the odds that such a major change as learning skills reform will take place?we dont have a working bounty system after 7 years; what chance has learning skills reform?and so on. given the whole slew of glaring design problems and inconsistencies that eve is riddled with, learning skills are a very small fish in the pond. dont invest too much emotional energy in to the idea that they're getting changed."

7/5/2010,"i for one prefer to give it some time. expecting results from the csm from day one is like expecting a newly installed government issueing new laws and such from day one. it ain't gonna happen because after people get elected they will have to talk with eachother first.and guess what, not everyone has the same log in times.next to that every issue brought forward can't be handled because of two simple reasons.1: you need a majority vote from csm members first about the topic. 2: there just isn't enough time nor room to cover everything and as such the csm will have to work out which things get work and which will have to wait."

7/6/2010,"/not-supported.if the crybabies want to play a sookie game, go and play sims and you and your boyfriends can dress each other up.ccp have not mentioned that they wish to remove them - just the crowd who drive around in the whaaaaaambulance.now get away from our game you sook."
7/6/2010,"remove learning skills!oh really? you'd be wrong! they've wanted to remove them for years, but didn't have a satisfactory means for doing so. they do now."
7/6/2010,"it is clear that this is a divisive issue within the player base. perhaps i can offer a distinct perspective, as a csm who has now had his baptism-in-lava in iceland.the key thing to understand is that for issues like this, what drives ccp decisionmaking is simple: customer retention.that is, they are looking for things that will turn more clueless noobs into bitter old vet crack-w****s, while at the same time not disgusting the bitter old vet crack-w****s so much they will switch to another drug.when it comes to creating new crack-w****s, learning skills are the worst feature in eve. they actively drive noobs away from the game, because noobs are all about instant gratification -- they want the ""rush"" of a new drug -- and learning skills delay that. the bitter old vet crack-w****s (hereinafter bovcws), on the other hand, are all about getting their regular fix so they don't ""get sick"".much of the argument against removing learning skills boils down to this: ""when i was a noob, i had to **** a lot of **** to get my crack, and the new b*****s should have to do the same thing.""well, the bovcws need to get over that, and the reason is simple: more new crack-w****s = more money for pimp-daddy ccp = more resources put into developing tastier crack (at least, if csm has anything to say about it!).now, that said, here's my 2 isk about how to implement it:* kill the learning skills.* respec all skills by +10 (5+4 + 10% = 9.9, close enough)* leave the implants as they are.* refund all accumulated learning skill skillpoints. as a sop to the hyper-optimizers, give a small bonus to people who actually trained advanced skills to v (such as an extra 10% for points spent training above iv on an advanced learning skill).* if possible, provide one extra respec -- or at least, reset everyone's respec cooldown.* improve the interface for allocating bonus skillpoints - even a ""allocate bonus points to train this skill to next level"" right-click would be enough.* run the numbers and determine the optimum initial skill settings for noobs, based on the skills they have historically trained (not including the learning skills, of course!). use these for noobs.* add a new reward for completing the npe - a small pool of bonus skillpoints (bovcws would get this as well during the changeover). this is, to my mind, a crucial element -- you give them a big hit of the true eve crack to get them started on the path to bovcw-dom. i personally would do this instead of double-rate training.i would like to see more discussion on this issue, but i want to go on record as saying that if i don't read any show-stoppers, i am going to raise this as a csm proposal -- and i welcome co-sponsors (that means you, sok!)"
7/6/2010,what is a sop? also the 10% is important only if they keep remaps.i like the extra remap idea too. 2 million sp though not alot is enough for some people to use that extra map to polish off some arcane skill set then go back to their old map if they still have their old map.
7/6/2010,"something given to pacify or quiet, or as a bribe.for example, ""ccp gave the csms an extra trip to iceland as a sop."""

7/6/2010,"well, tbh, given that i don't drink, you are better off promising to send the beer to the devs who do the actual work......as a sop, of course."
7/6/2010,let's do it!
7/6/2010,"you deem yourself a representative, and then you put out generalized garbage like this? you couldn't more clearly be cementing yourself on the anti-learning side, and have thrown objectivity out the window.a small number of pro-learning people hold the above position, yes, but most support the skills because they add a strategy to the game. cry all you want, but learning skills at 5/5 is not normal. everyone anti-learning says ""well if you want to play the game then they're pretty much mandatory."" that's where most of the problem lies; new players are told by all these bitter old vets (who are bitter because they also convinced themselves that they had to max learning skills, not because of the 'back in my day' syndrome you suggest) that the only way to play eve is to train learning skills right away; and then of course, the anti crowd exaggerates this and says ""yeah staring at a bar isn't my idea of fun."" you know why tier 2 learning books are so expensive? because they were only ever meant to be attained after a while of playing (you know, when you could make that kind of money), and added in to your training regimen to make all those rank 10+ skills go that much easier to reach. the net lost time from not doing tier 2 skills for, say, a month or so is within the realm of a few hours. don't believe me? i put together a one-month plan for a minmatar newbie, with basic and standard certs mixed and training up to battlecruiser. time before learning skills? 17 days. time after learning skills? 12 days. time after removing tier 2 learning skills evemon told me to put in? 12.5 days.that's 12 hours' difference.now, while many people would min/max and say ""that makes all the difference!!!1!1"", consider the fact that i haven't yet done neural remapping to see how i could make it better still, nor will most new players have learning skills tier 2 purchasable. and why should they? nor are they required to sit in a station all day (detractors' claims to the contrary) -- takes all of one hour each to put some points into basic skills, and then the new players can go do tutorials while their skills level up, make enough to buy learning books, buy learning books (tier 1), go get them, add them to the queue, and do it strategically -- ""okay, i wanna grind my core competency first, so i'll do intelligence""; ""i want to be able to shoot stuff, so i'll get my perception and will skills up; then i can jump right into ship skilling afterwards.""; and yes, even ""i want to make sure i have my learning skills, so i'll 2 days just letting them level up (note: how long the learning skills evemon recommended would take alone) and then start other stuff.""what the anti crowd always seems to neglect (or conveniently forget) is that there is a lot of waiting for a new player. i know that, while to players who have been playing for a while it isn't a long time, the day and a half or two days or whatever that frigate iv took when i trained it two months ago seemed to take forever. and you know what, looking back, i'm 100% okay with that, because that's a drop in the bucket compared to the rank 8s that i'm eying right now. the anti-learning people aren't; they simply want to minimize the wait, not because of any real concern for the new players (or if there is, it's in a small number of their population), but because they just want more, faster.trebor, while i appreciate you expressing your interest in serving your csm duties, i ask that you take a good hard look at this and other threads where debate has arisen, and step back from any personal feelings you have. consider the arguments coming from my, umm, colleagues and i. think about whether you're serving the majority, or just the most vocal side."
7/6/2010,"dunno, i think that a +10attrib, +10% would be too much.rather a +7 attrib, +8% would be better (4+3 attrib skills and lvl 4 learning)a full reimbursement of sp spent on learning skills would be good.here's where it gets more complicated:a pro-rated sp pool is given to all players based on the +7,+8% training model, adjusted for cybernetic bonuses.in other words, the guy who never trained learning skills and has been training other skills will get a huge bonus in sp, bringing him up to the level of what a character who trained to +7,+8% would be at.the guy who skill trained all attributes from +7 to +10 and trained learning from +8% to +10% or only gets bonuses to skills trained before that time.he would be reasonably close to what his skillpoints should be anyhow, if not more.the current toons who are maxed out with learning skills will slow down some (-3attrib, -2%) post fix, but will not lose anything already trained.the toons who are at +7attrib, +8% will stay pretty much even.the toons who minimally trained learning gets a big catchup boost.everyone gets some ""free"" sp, except for brand new toons, who will never have to slog through learning skills(reward enough imo)overall effects: base training times speed up for almost everyone, new players get to train useful skills outta the box, older players who trained learning skills get reimbursed for wasted time, older players who minimally trained learning get a big boost(really how many of these are out there?)i think that overall the idea is great, just needs some changes to it>supported"
7/6/2010,"just because i'm a csm doesn't mean i can't have strong opinions about the game -- and yes, i think that the learning skills are net-negative for eve. however, please don't assume that i can't be objective. i have been a practicing skeptic for all of my adult life, so if you can come up with a decent argument that a position i hold is incorrect, i am honor-bound to accept your argument and revise my opinion.furthermore, don't let my tendency to leaven my arguments with humor give you the impression that i don't take things seriously.with that in mind...i understand and appreciate this position. i will go further -- i agree that it adds a strategy to the game.the real question, however, is this: ""is what learning skills add to the game worth what it costs the game?""in particular, do learning skills put off noobs, who we all want to become hopelessly addicted crack-w****s like ourselves? (after all, misery loves company!) if so, they are a huge negative for the game as a whole. i am of the opinion that there is significant evidence that this is the case -- and if i am wrong about this, then most of the argument for killing learning skills is blown out of the water.the counter-argument is that learning skills are cumulative; the earlier you get them boosted; yeah, you might only save a few hours getting to bc, but the deeper you intend to go in the game, the more you need them.furthermore, even without evemon, the reasonably optimal learning skills training plan is pretty obvious. the strategy aspect of learning skills is not ""if"" but ""when"" you will get everything but the charisma skills to v/iii or v/iv.the problem with if/when decisions is that for a noob, they present an opportunity to delay gratification. this is very bad. the key to noob retention is instant gratification. they are noobs, baby eve players; they want it right now. imho the double-rate training was ccp's first iteration on addressing this issue.i somewhat agree with you. however, keep in mind you and i are not representative of the typical noob. most noobs stop playing; we are the atypical noobs who did not stop playing. so we have to be careful projecting our own feelings onto the typical noob.finally, from a purely tactical standpoint (in the csm minigame i get to play), whether you believe the statements that ""ccp wants to get rid of learning skills"" or not, it makes sense to me to present them with a player-designed option.if they don't think learning skills affect player retention, they'll stick it in the backlog to rot.if on the other hand they do want to make a change, wouldn't you prefer them to implement something the players have debated? one that has some benefits for everyone?"
7/6/2010,"i do not support this.in the interests of arguing the point, the only ""fair"" thing to do if the learning skills (and the points they granted) are removed is to grant back the players the actual skill points applied to learning skills. no additional attribute points, no speed to training boosts - just raw skill points (much like the downtime gift) to be redistributed as the player wishes. sure, this doesn't provide anything to those who haven't trained learning skills, or new players - but it levels the field and removes the learning skills but not the time spent on them.for those who are all about the fear that new pilots don't like training learning skills, this resolves that issue. no learning skills = no ""delay"" in training other skills.for those who did not choose to train learning skills, it does nothing for them. they did not spend the time or skillpoints or isk, therefore they would have no argument for reimbursement.for those who trained learning skills, the bonuses they provided are history (as attributes would revert to non-learning skill levels), but the actual skillpoints are returned to a general pool so the isk and time spent on those skills maintains some value.all this proposal should do is reduce the advantage provided by learning skills going forward.i still don't support it."
7/6/2010,"well yeah, i started back in 2006. after the tutorial i had, 100k isk, a +1 implant and an atron. that was it! i didnt have this bull**** 2x training time up to 1.6 million sp. i never got all this free stuff for starting the game. i just got that and a good luck dont die from ccp and fellow players.so i dont see what the real problem is. using this 2x training time to in the begining to train learning skills is more than enough compensation. instead fo 25 days to train all the basic learnings from lvl 4 to lvl 5 it is now 13. (assumption 4 days per level 5 skill.)now ccp's goal is payer retention right? well why not up the 2x training time to 2 million sp, or adjust char creation to have more learning skills. say all the basics to lvl 2?but no, removing learnign skills is bad."
7/6/2010,"it's ""mandatory"" to train them up front because of the accelerated training. 5/4 learning skills can pay for themselves in just three months...example:alice and bob are new characters. both remap their attributes to perception 12 and intelligence 12 (for flying and fitting skills.) alice uses her accelerated training bonus to train flying/fitting skills immediately. bob decides to train the learning skills up first.if bob takes 14 days to train the learning skills to 4/4/4 (basic to iv, advanced to iv, and learning to iv,) he will catch up to alice in less two months. meaning that in two months, bob will have all the skills that alice has, plus 4/4/4 in learning skills.if bob takes 42 days to train the learning skills to 5/4/5, then in just three months he have all the skills that alice has, plus 5/4/5 in learning skills. (if bob had used both remaps, he could have gotten the 42 days down to 33.5 days and then remapped to 12/12 in perc/int.)three months for 5/4/5 to pay for itself? you would have to be crazy not to train the damn learning skills for the first month.it's not the learning skills that are the problem, it's the accelerated training bonus and two free remaps that forces/encourages newbies to front load the learning skills. if you really want to torpedo the 'give everyone +10 attributes' proposal then petition to have the learning skills unaffected by the accelerated training bonus and only provide one remap to newbies."
7/6/2010,i would approve of this changes. though it would not necessarily have to be done by a learning speed boost but by the new system they implemented.
7/6/2010,"the strategic aspect of learning skills many pro-learners support is already duplicated by the prospect of neural remapping and implants. both have tangible risks and rewards; in the first, the reward is increased training time for certain skills while the risk is slower training time should you train any non-spec'd skills -- in the second, implants give an increase in training time but at a hefty isk cost. the only tangible risk for learning skills is of new players deciding they don't want to have to spend the first month of the game training learning skills and not playing, particularly when the free trial time lasts for a shorter period than it would actually take to train these skills.point being there are already other gameplay features in place that players can manipulate to get faster or shorter training times, none of which are nearly as frustrating or new player-impeding as learning skills."
7/6/2010,bump
7/6/2010,just let it go man
7/6/2010,"this.and /thread.i support the idea. maybe it can be good to limit it to a one-time only, to avoid a possible bad usage (i don't see where, whatever the previous posters said) but eve players can be imaginative.but it is absolutely important that the skill points must be calculated according to implants and learning the character had before he left."
7/6/2010,"net present value. this is why you can't give them $15 now and get something that you passed on 2 years ago.i had a character in 2003, should that character be able to have 100m+ sp now? even though i didn't really start playing until 2+ years later?beyond that, what about the days before the training queue? people who hit snooze on their alarm clock at 4am (that had been set specifically to change skills) and thus lost 3 hours of training time (repeatedly) have a better claim on ""missing"" sp if you want to go down that road. but, even though i am in that boat, i don't think this is appropriate either.if you snooze, you lose."
7/6/2010,"like i said before, only 1 year worth of sp / game time could be bought back, so no 2003 freak could be created.and for the time b4 the training queue : thank god it doesnt exist anymore. eve is a futuristic game, look to teh futur, not the past.new features like this one and respecing are coming."
7/6/2010,"supported.hell yes. imo, there should be no read-only feature in evegate that is not fully implemented in the api.i'm not so convinced on write-access via api though."
7/6/2010,"granular keys are a necessity, and the player base has been asking for them (directly or not) since the api came out."
7/6/2010,api improvments - yesspacebook - no
7/6/2010,"if write access is available on eve gate, it should be available on the api, or we're back to square one- lots of people just scripting eve gate.i do think that granular keys (or rather permission based keys) should be a prerequisite to this, however - you want to have total control over what can write."
7/6/2010,"too late.the evegate team was run by someone with zero understanding of social networking.they decided not to use any open standards, while being stuck on ms servers the choices are limited anyway.when questioned on it at fanfest the team leader went into an ego driven rant about how he knew better.eve api should be oauth instead of/aswell as keys.evegate should be an openid provider with oauth extension.evegate should have an opensocial container (apache shindig is 50,000 hours of free code) for users to develop fleet/calendar/event/organisation apps.99.99% of the potential of evegate has been squandered by making it proprietry closed system with no integration points."
7/6/2010,"agreed, however with the current tiers of api keys, adding write access would be potentially bad. currently the ""full"" api key does not allow write access. so if ccp went and granted write access through the full api key, you've potentially got a security disaster there. that's why i don't support it right now.with the addition of a new ""really full api"" key that allows full access + write, then it's all good."

7/6/2010,"the idea behind the rig i mentioned its like a sub system for t3 ships, you can make them, buy them on the market, use them like normal rigs. depending on which one depends on what texture your ship is assigned when it loads on your or another players screen. if you play with a t3 cruiser in the preview window opened from the info window you can see each subsystem modifys not only the texture placed on the ship but the model used as well, so they allready have the coding in place to support this kind of system they just have to add a slot on every ship and add the rigs themselfs, but like all rigs this is a perminant modification unless it is destroyed which would keep the market open and.... alive. as far as bidding wars and the 0.1 isk wars and what not, its part of having a open player controled market, im sorry but live with it or go play a npc single player game with a complete npc market.ok i agree sending a preset number would be easier then just the name of a file and would be possible in my eyes. as far as your fleet fights. dont ***** at me over it ccp hasnt gotten off their ass and fixed massive fight lag in almost a year as it is now, take into consideration i added a ""switch"" to turn this graphical feature off which means it will cut down on server demand and computer graphics demand for these fights much like turning off ""turrent effects"" ""effects"" ""missile effects"" and so on, so far my postings are the only one to impliment such an idea with this ""package"""
7/6/2010,"yeah, you definitely don't understand how the assembly hall works. supports are basically just a straw poll - they don't mean anything. there's some cutoff where if you get several thousand then ccp has to look at it, but nothing has ever come close, so that's a theoretical limit. the csm has nine members, not 7(although some meeting have as few as 7 in attendance, so 4/3 votes do happen). and ccp doesn't code things for the purpose of just testing them - if it gets written, it's because someone expects it to make it to tq. csm/ccp meetings are talking about the issues, not the details on where the testing happens."
7/6/2010,yeah the fact that all shots hit the same spot is awkward.
7/6/2010,"seems pretty critical, would love to hear something about this issue."
7/6/2010,supported with a a++++
7/6/2010,it is funny that all of you people want to make stuff you mine worthless.
7/6/2010,yes please!that would be the more interesting option ofc.
7/6/2010,"not exactly. i'd just rather not see other ships simply duplicated by t3. why not just take a logistics? also, using the previous example a logistics ship with proteus ehp would be plain better than the specialised t2 hull."
7/6/2010,"logistics have more advantages over t3 ships than just range. signature, cap transfers, cap bonuses, fitting bonuses.t3 currently have a bonus to repair amount, which is useless with such limited range."
7/6/2010,"give it more range, but it should still be much shorter then a logi ship. logistics ships are fragile, so they need to be able to sit away from the fight. t3 ships have some of the toughest teanks around, can have cloacks and interdiction nullifiers, so there is no reaosn they should sit 60 km away. you can boost their range for ~20km, but nothing drastic please."
7/6/2010,"i like the uniqueness of bonus to rep amount and i don't want to obsolete logistics cruisers.with that said, range does need to be increased a tad. 25-30km at lvl 5 defensive sub would be okay imo."
7/6/2010,"the only t3 ship with a smaller sig radius would be the loki, teh rest would all be larger than their t2 counterparts. much, much, larger in the case of the tengu."
7/6/2010,i'm not opposed to any changes. just making the point that care should be taken with t3 roles.i think some of the above posts hit the nail on the head. a range of around 20km would let them have a bit of mobility but not overshadow logistics. also they could let them maintain mobility in little rr groups.
7/6/2010,"giving them a 30% bonus to rep range per level would be resonable imo. that would give them a 15km range, (13.2km with subsystem skill @ level 4) on best named medium reps. and 21km, (18.5km with subsystem skill @ level 4) on a best named large rep. which sounds pretty decent to me."
7/6/2010,i completely agree.
7/6/2010,"i don't know about the other t3, but the tengu can easily mount a large shield transporter, full rack of launchers, resists + buffer.just thought i'd throw that out there as i think i have now seen 2 people mention them using medium reps. throw in the sensor strength subsystem + some eccm mods and you could have a really nasty remote rep circle to break"
7/6/2010,and get outrepped five fold by a logistics ship.
7/6/2010,"my proposal is to add more systems to eve. high sec is fine as it is. low sec is quiet and 0.0 is crowded. my proposal is to add more 0.0 systems to eve. expand current 0.0 systems by x5 or 10. the online user amount has been ten folded in the past 2-3 years, why not the amount of systems. this will decrease the amount of stress on the server and will cause less lagg. with the recent server move it is possible if ccp is willing to invest in there clients.discuss"
7/6/2010,"much of 0.0 is empty. there are 0.0 station systems which players rarely enter. also, the ""online user amount"" has not been increased ten-fold in three years, it has maybe quadrupled, not ten-fold.systems share a blade with many other systems. fleet lag occurs when a lot of pilots are doing stuff all on the same cpu(s). so, that cascades across multiple systems. you always know something interesting is happening when life gets laggy for no reason.what is the purpose of having more 0.0 systems?"
7/6/2010,"the best way to make eve bigger is to make individual systems bigger. dominion was a good start, but i think more is probably in order. adding new regions feels unnecessary to me."
7/6/2010,i think your problem stems from the fact that you are comparing t2 ammo to faction ammo which usually cost in the region of 10 times as much.compare the t2 ammo to t1 standard.
7/6/2010,"hello.ecm, by far the most powerful form of electronic warfare, is almost universally hated controversal game mechanic. the effects of other forms of electronic warfare could be somewhat negated by proper piloting. the only way to semi-reliably protect yourself from ecm is to sacrifice 2 mid slots for eccm (lol) or to sacrifice low slots for some terribly ineffective sensor backup arrays. sensor strength-increasing implants available from faction warfare lp stores are far too expensive to be viable and prevent you from plugging in some actually useful implant sets -- not to mention that a whole set of implants is something you probably don't want to take on a nullsec roam unless you have an abnormally massive genitalia.the main problem with ecm *as i see it* is that it's simply game-breaking for solo pilots with no way to counter it via maneuvering or smart ship fitting, effectively making a fight completely hopeless. to elaborate on this,sensor dampening can be countered by getting closer or waiting our the longer lock time. equipement-wise, the effects can be diminished by fitting a sensor booster, which isn't the most useful module in the world, but at least it does something other than protecting you against some specific form of electronic warfare.tracking disruption can be countered by minimizing transversal or, again, by getting closer to your target. furthermore, tracking enhancers (and, to the lesser extent, tracking computers) are great modules and there is a huge number of ships that benefit from fitting them anyway. using sooth sayer, drop or frentix boosters can also help with this.target painting is a very specific form of electronic warfare. most of the time you don't even need to counter it, although using x-instinct boosters can certainly help.considering that ccp doesn't like to modify existing game mechanics, prefering to add new features instead i propose an introduction of a sensor strength-increasing combat booster.what is a combat booster? (from relevant eve online wiki article). it can work like this:synth 10% sensr str increase.standard 50%improved 90%strong 130%alternatively, the booster can modify base sensor strength, which will make it useful for small ships like frigates and destroyers.the drawbacks could be:a penalty to strength of electronic warfare modules.a penatly to range of electronic warfare modules.a penalty to their capacitor efficiency.a penalty to locking range.how this will change fleet/huge gang warfare:this will not change fleet/huge gang warfare in any way.how this will change pve side of the game:this will not affect pve in any meaningful way: considering current booster prices, using standard, improved or strong boosters for pve simply isn't cost-effective.do we really need more unprobable ships in this game?we don't, but it's already p. easy to make your t3 cruiser both unprobable and command link/level 4 mission-capable. also, popping boosters every 20 minutes to stay unprobable just isn't practical most of the time. so this won't change anything.how this will change solo/small gang pvp:dramatically. i don't even have to explain."
7/6/2010,"tl;dr:ccp doesn't like to mess with existing mechanics, so it's naive to expect any sort of ""fix"" to ecm.ccp loves introducing new features.introduce a sensor strength-increasing combat booster.people who think that ecm somehow makes small gang pvp in any way better remind of that guy who put his house cat in a microwave to dry it up a bit.people who fly solo or in small gangs will benefit a lot from this; everyone else will remain unaffected. ecm will still be a strong (and ******ed) game mechanic."
7/6/2010,supporting this
7/6/2010,two thumbs up
7/6/2010,i'm not sure that ecm ships need yet another nerf. i understand that the mechanic is annoying - and i agree. but this is little more than yet another nerf to ships that i don't even fly anymore because they're so ineffective.not supported.-liang
7/6/2010,this is not about nerfing ecm.this is about giving pilots the ability to counter ecm in a similar manner to that which is available to counter the other forms of ewar.
7/6/2010,"hmm have a loot at at8 matches. if ecm was such a game breaking , ecm teams would have won everytime. but it isnt the case!from what i have seen , ecm teams have a success rate of 50%if you get caught by ecm , then you're not prepared!"
7/6/2010,"by prepared, i assume you mean, by fitting a eccm module that has no use other than defense against ecm. sensor stength boosters would simple give you another way to be prepared.also i should note that alliance tourney doesn't exactly equate to most pvp situations. for one thing, more slots are generally devoted to eccm than is usually practical for most non-tourney setups. small ships especially do not have slots to spare, and thus, have zero ways to counter ecm."
7/6/2010,"awesome idea, two thumbs up."
7/6/2010,i like it
7/6/2010,"i don't care what you think it's about. what it's actually about is nerfing ecm. boosting the counters against something, or creating more of them, is a nerf to it. you are suggesting nerfing ecm ships. if the mechanic annoys you, suggest changing the mechanic.-liang"
7/6/2010,"liang, if you think about how few people actually use combat boosters, you'll realize this isn't something that would change ecm on the whole.one thing i might change about the suggestion though, is the percentage increase suggested. it probably needs to be significantly lower"
7/6/2010,"this suggestion is actually pretty good, since it doesn't directly nerf ecm ships, keeping those ships invaluable in fleet battles. not everyone will be using these boosters when they're fighting, since they'll have penalties to other attributes when being used. we have drop and x-instinct to counter tracking disruptors and target painters, so a sensor strength booster would be pretty cool.a booster that decreases lock time or increases locking range would be nice to counter sensor damps as well.ccp make it happen!"
7/6/2010,"calm down.this will not affect you in any way, unless you are blobbing some poor guy or a microscopic 2-4 men gang with ecm."
7/6/2010,you just got sensor strength implant sets. thats not enough?not supported.
7/6/2010,"since that is never going to happen, i'd still go with what dierdra suggested: increase the expansion interval to maybe 9 months and use the gained time to polish/fix stuff."
7/6/2010,"supported. if they're going to fix issues the 3d animators wont have much to do the next 6 months. couldn't they fix this ""variation"" cr*p? visual enhancement may be trivial, but it's still something worth working on. tl;dr, unique hulls for everyone!"
7/6/2010,supported.fix.
7/6/2010,are they truly so determined to run their flagship in to the ground?that's kind of a shame.
7/6/2010,"agreed, the odds and ends really need to be tidied up a bit. i'll throw black ops, faction armor plates/shield extenders and fw mechanics into the mix as well."
7/6/2010,"these issues are mostly minor, i would rather have the cool stuff instead."
7/6/2010,"you forget that incarna was promised... five? six? years ago. players were talking about planetary flight when i first started playing... four years ago. these things were promised from ccp before a lot of the stuff that has come out lately.if i had to guess, ccp has been tossing these recent expansions out in the manner they have been released because they are trying to give us something to keep us interested while they try to fulfill their promises of incarna and planetary flight. in fact, most of these expansions seem to be the groundwork for towards both of those features.obviously, it would be nice if the expansions worked better. from the ""we don't have any devs available to work on those"" comment from nathan(?), i get the impression that incarna is not ahead of schedule. that worries me."
7/6/2010,i want store fronts though
7/6/2010,"*warning: shameless self-promotion imminent*i agree that there has to be some sort of reward for dedicated pibears, but the current system only serves to reward poopsockers, not critical thinkers. what pi needs is something that requires brainsweat; like someone above said, eve players prefer to think for an hour and click for a minute vs thinking for a min and clicking for an hour. personally i think rethinking how the extractor mechanic works would make pi more fun. one idea that i threw out might alleviate some of those issues (namely the rewarding poopsockers system)"
7/6/2010,"excellent list.one minor thing to add though: make planet textures viewable againi know it's minor, but it can be important - i can't view planets with their natural textures after getting remote sensing. even when i'm in normal mode, i just see black or white blobs.nothing game breaking, but there have been contests that award plex for screenshots, and i don't want to miss out on a 300 mil isk prize simply because i trained a particular skill."
7/6/2010,"would be nice to add a ""allow queing of the next 30min\5hrs\23hrs\4days mode in extractor , when it is already in the last cycle (the one the current mode ends after)"" to the list. would allow less downtime , less chances to miss the time.if possible also add the option to feed resource a equally to a group of processors , or to all the processors that use this resource. like when we gather 3000 and have 3 processors using it - each would get 1000. would be helpfull in more complexed less clear-numbered situations.anyway is a very good list , would be happy to see at least something implemented."
7/6/2010,less clicks. the amount of isk made in pi is not worth all the clicking.
7/6/2010,"dear ccp,im sorry to say it but the cycle times on the extractors are truly epic fail. everything needs to be adjusted outwards. short cycle  1 daymedium cycle  3 daysstandard cycle  7 daysextended cycle  30 daysthis is clickity click click crap is an annoyance and ads little value in terms of game play. its really an annoyance to people who have real lives, careers and what not - to have to be obligated to log in every single day to ensure the extractors are running so we can help keep the fuel coming for the corp poss. you definitely made the game a job with this move. as people who run eve, im sure it doesnt bother you too much. im sure it doesnt bother the kiddies who are on summer break or even when they are in school. but youve completely overlooked the contingent of people who have careers and rl obligations, we dont need or want more obligations we want to contribute and this definitely crosses the line in terms of obligation."
7/6/2010,"you made a wrong assumption that you must make your own fuel. you don't.you can get it old way, like all did just month before. and, if rl distracts you so much (disclaimer, i pretty much respect that) - but then how you manage to care about pos'es at all ? i think you way overuse that rl argument here."
7/6/2010,"totally in support.i'm still new, so i haven't actually used the gang links for shields yet...and i'm glad i read about it first because i'd be seriously p***ed to find out in game that the bonus isn't applied right away.as far as the regen bonus is concerned, take it i don't care. an extra .5% hp per sec versus an instant 10-15%?i'll take the big numbers thank you.a couple of hours to obtain the same bonus that an armor tanker gets instantly? this is a no brainer people."
7/6/2010,from the perspective of a shield tanker in fw the regen rate increase is insignificant really considering the current primary calling tactics in the warzone. ships w/o logi support in most cases won't last more than a minute or 2 which makes the extra 1 or 2 hp/sec useless whereas the extra 10% shield might allow me to get another weapon cycle off and help my fleet win. i'd prefer it if the regen bonus was kept but don't really care as long as the hp boost is applied immeadiatly. to the people asking for a passive armor regen fine but give up your 1600mm plates. your base armor resists already more than make up for the gain shield tankers get in fleet ops from passive regen so if you want the bonus of shield regen give up your 1600mm plates which provide twice the buffer as anything us shield tankers can fit. shield tankers get passive regen armor tankers get massive buffer tanks
7/6/2010,"yes please, also allow people to configure a list so someone could mail to a mailing list without being able to receive mails to that list."
7/6/2010,nice features.
7/6/2010,pop3/smtp/imap access would be nice too.
7/6/2010,+1good idea.
7/6/2010,why not.not going to happen as we'd start getting spammed and phished from outside.
7/6/2010,"no, you wouldn't. smtp/imap should accept mails and send them only for eve accounts, so only spam'd start sending only registered eve users (this isn't difficult to tune, believe me).and, of course, pop3/smtp should be available only for paid accounts.btw, pop3 will be enough. smtp'd be nice feature, but pop3 is must have, imho."
7/6/2010,terrible idea. this would not change the highsec wars - this would eliminate them.
7/6/2010,"""terrible idea. this would not change the highsec wars - this would eliminate them.""where there is a reason (ie not just griefing for kicks and random km's) there will still be plenty of wars. it will however take commitment from the wardec'ing corp, as opposed to the current all care and no responsibility casual wardec of today (heck, many smaller corps may still not be able to stump up the counter-bid isk so for that scenario its no change).only people i could see against this would be the 'casual' or semi-random griefer corps who if they are hard corp pvp as they say can still go to low-sec for their easy kill kicks.hi-sec will be what imho it should be - generaly quiet except for the occasional larger scale or at least more professionaly run (ie commited) well funded 'corporate business by another means'. still a hostile environment (in many ways more so, or certainly more expensive to prosper)."
7/6/2010,"while i do see a point in increasing costs of high-sec wars, this is definately not the direction it should be going. this idea is horrible, makes no sence, and would ruin gameplay."
7/6/2010,"ccp has no right to eliminate wars based on what is and what isn't a morally or economically valid war.if someone's flying a bling mission boat, he deserves to be decced.if someone doesn't play eve properly by highsec mining and missioning instead of doing some form of pvp (like trading and pew-pew), he deserves to be decced.if someone has more isk than me and i can get him to spread the wealth, he deserves to be decced.of course, whether he ""deserves to be decced"" or not is irrelevant: eve is supposed to be a sandbox mmo and allowing wealthy players (or any player) to opt out of pvp because they're more wealthy than their attackers is contrary to that notion."
7/6/2010,"another wonderful example of ""if you don't play my way you are playing it wrong"".with logic like this no wonder the game is half broken."
7/6/2010,you need to have all implants sets attached to your clone at one time.they still get dstroyed when you remove them and cannot interchange between set racks.increased benefits should come with increased risk. i said it before in the other thread and i'll say it again hereonly then will you have an idea worth supporting.
7/6/2010,is anybody else getting a broken link due to the language filter?
7/6/2010,"yeah, i am too. bizarre. i don't know what part of it is getting censored, but the link is"
7/6/2010,"excellent description of the problem and good solution proposal, herschel. supporting that one. (@maxsim: maybe you can improve your opening post)"
7/6/2010,this would be very nice. i'm tired of playing the nano-ribbon lottery whenever i take out a sleeper site. i can come away with a fortune or practically empty handed purely based on the drop rate of one item. even normal salvage atleast has a few different high value items among the trash.
7/6/2010,"this is exactly why i am not supporting this idea. bottlenecks for t2 is without a doubt stupid. but for t3? its great. you forget what wormholes are all about? its exploration! the best part of exploration is plundering the unknown. yesterday i was cleaning up 2 c4 sites i did, each worth about 66mil in tags.now i don't usually salvage but today i figured why not, and without fail, the first 10-15 wrecks i salvaged yielded 1 nanoribbon total. then i got to one particular sleepless upholder wreck and the damn thing just wouldn't salvage. after about 10 minutes of cycles, i was about ready to give up when lo and behold, salvage complete and 12 nanoribbons filled my cargo. that is the great feeling that exploration and the ""nanoribbon lottery"" provide. yeah, sometimes you walk away with nothing, but sometimes you strike gold.if you want steady, guaranteed isk, either don't bother to salvage and move on to another site or go back and farm missions."
7/6/2010,"i still fail to see how that makes nanoribbon lottery desirable. if you whant to play lottery, you might just as well only make one item with low chanse of dropping, effect is the same. now, if ccp added 20 items instead of one, i assume they should all have a purpose and not be trash."
7/6/2010,"you claim in your article that alchemy alleviated the bottleneck, as was already said in this thread, it just moved the bottleneck... to technetium. a war was waged because of this change (the southern alliances taking geminate from wi.) because tech is worth 3x-4x dyspro and prom now.as for t1 salvage, i remember when trit bars were millions each. this was partially reduced from the nano nerf, but it is still the most valuable t1 salvage.then there was zydrine. then there was... then there was... the design of manufacturing in eve will lead to a cascade of bottlenecks. the more tinkering done, the more out of balance it becomes. a true fix would require a re-evaluation of drop rates (and moon distribution) and manufacturing requirements. that would be ugly.t3 has a better chance as they can add more systems, adjust spawn rates, adjust loot tables, etc... all things that aren't very obvious."
7/6/2010,"i'm sure many, if not all of you, have had experiences with spammers. nearly all of them use bots to do this, some as simple as repeatedly posting the same message/link over and over again, or more complex ones, which post several messages, such as the age-old:""send me isk and i'll send 10x back"" which is usually followed by""*insert random character link here* *insert random amount of isk here* sent!""while i fully agree with scamming being an integral part of the game, using macros, should not be.i propose that the ""report isk spammer"" button be expanded to report anybody using macros/repeatedly posting the same message too many times. so what would happen if enough people report a spammer in local? as this, to ccp, is less important than isk selling, the spammer's posting history can be run though a program that looks for similarities in each post, or any bot-like behavior. if the results are positive, the character gets some kind of warning, while it is up, prevents the client from doing anything else, which includes posting. (many other pop-up windows already achieve this, such as the petition window)immediately, this stops nearly all macros, as, unlike the sophisticated macros used in mining or ratting, the ones used for spamming are simple, and easy to outsmart. (this is because not nearly as many people spam, compared to macro mining)if the character, or an alt on the same account is reported to be spamming after the warning message, the character gets a second warning, which does not rely on people reporting it, but but the program used before, which can monitor the account a while after the first warning. if the account continues, the account then gets a ban from posting anything in any public channel, including local. this can be revoked if the character convinces a gm through a petition to do so.how does this help stop spamming using bots?1) it stops bots being able to spam indefinitely.2) it forces people who use bots to spam constantly to change accounts often, as they would probably not be able to prove to gms that they were not using bots.i know you can block anyone who spams in local, but lets be honest, this does not stop them, and people should not have to keep on blocking spammers. if you can stop people from actually wanting to spam in the first place, you are effectively cutting it at the roots.how does this help?1) it makes it possible to actually have conversations in trade hubs, without having your post disappear under multiple bot posts within seconds, before anyone can read it. 2) it makes it possible for real people be able to effectively show their wares in local, without the same problems.whether you want to accept it or not, people using macros to spam in heavily populated systems is a problem. it should be fixed, soon."
7/6/2010,"one of the problems with ideas like this is that while they work reasonably most of the time, they can be abused for the purposes of griefing.a potentially better solution is to ""tarpit"" local, so that the more often a player posts in local, the larger the timeout until he can post again. the tarpit intensity can be adjusted based on system population.as a rough example, with nice round numbers to make it easier to follow the process (the actual numbers would be different, and adjustable).jita has 1000 players in local. the maximum tarpit delay is # of players / 10, thus 100 seconds.the first time someone posts, there is no tarpit delay; the post appears immediately. the player's post count is incremented by 1.the player immediately tries to post again. the tarpit delay is (max_delay) / (10 -max(post_count,9). his post does not appear until 10 seconds later. his post count goes to 2.he posts again. his post does not appear for 20 seconds. his post count goes to 3. and so on.every max_delay seconds, everyone's post count is decremented by 1.result: regular players and honest sellers are not inconvenienced. spammers, scammers and inconsiderate people who use local for long chats in crowded systems are annoyed.this concept has often been using on mailservers to deal with spam."
7/6/2010,i like jita spam.
7/6/2010,i like trebor's fix simple yet would have a real benefit
7/6/2010,"part 1: reduce effective status of overpopulated systems:ah, jita we hate you. imagine, if you will, concord, challenged by a reduced budget and increased sansha incursions, announcing that they will no longer provide public security in overpopulated systems. when an empire system (0.5 or above, obviously) reaches a pre-defined capacity (at our around 150 pilots), concord no longer responds to attacks, and local empire forces only defend at gates and stations (station/gate guns still defend everywhere). accessing a gate into an overpopulated system includes the new warning: ""this system is so densely populated that concord does not respond to criminal acts. do you wish to proceed?"" the end of the jita market hub, forcing players to redistribute the various market forces across new eden. the only exception would be the ""introductory"" 1.0 systems where new pilots are spawned. these systems would have full concord defense regardless of pilot count.part 2: re-balance of security status of all systemsas part of this redistribution of concord security forces, concord will now have random (small) patrols into low-security space. much as the world's navies now combat the pirate threat of somalia (poorly), concord will be there (maybe) if you are headed into lowsec. never fear, intrepid pirates - concord will always announce that they are patrolling a system in local, and only be ""available"" in a given losec system for 30-60 minutes. when entering a losec system where the concord patrol is active, a notice appears ""concord is currently patrolling in this system. all acts of aggression will face retaliation. continue?"" in addition, concord ships in these losec patrols will not be invincible - a well equipped group of locals could conceivably defend their losec home from concord, ending the concord defense early (obviously with greater security status hit that podding mere capsuleers). in addition, the quality of the concord patrol increases as the relative security status of systems drop. once you leave hisec, you may see a small concord squad in 0.4, but a good sized fleet in 0.1. obviously 0.0 space is still not patrolled.in addition, faction militia pilots have ""police"" authority in sovereign losec systems. obviously tied into contested and swapped sovereignty, when a system is occupied by the opposing militia they become the local police force, and in contested systems the current ""holding"" militia (prior to contested status) continues police duties until the contested status is resolved. in the event of a pvp event, all militia in the local system receive a notice that ""unsanctioned criminal action has been detected - intervene?"" with a positive response leading to a fleet warp to the combat site."
7/6/2010,so you just broke virtually every system in highsec and yet managed to somehow make low sec worse.congratulations!
7/6/2010,"0/10 for troll.of the several hundred hisec systems, only a handful (mission hubs, trade hubs and mining farms) would be impacted. if the impact at 150 is too high, set it higher. the point is to combat lag in hisec and distribute pilots more throughout space. and, admittedly, to destroy jita as the sole trade hub in the universe.how is losec worse? all this does is introduce intermittent pve with a more potent opponent than the rats you fall asleep shooting, and a new unexpected nature to non-consensual pvp with the militia police. oh, wait - you don't like pvp when it comes to you, only when you plan it?"
7/6/2010,"primarily because hubs provide an ecology all to themselves. if you remove the hub you don't just nerf traders, miners, and mission runners you nerf the whole game. pirates, flippers, salvagers, scammers, industrialists, researchers, basically anyone that undocks gets completely screwed over by this change. your nerf will do nothing but hurt other professions and create larger regional hubs that fall just under the population requirements because traders will simply operate in a backwater system using remote buy/sell orders to keep the in system population down. all this is is a massive nerf to high sec under the guise of fixing lag when high sec lag is virtually non existent right now.it's worse because now all those people with a security status too low to enter high sec are going to randomly get ganked by roving concord patrols without providing an iota of purpose beyond that. you do understand that fighting concord isn't pve it's death right? they don't lose. so congratulations on randomly offing every pirate in eve. in the mean time there isn't a single pos in high sec anymore because any .0 entity can jump in their 1000 man bs fleet and wipe out every pos in the system without a war dec or worrying about concord attacking their low security members. now the market is completely screwed a tier 1frigate costs 150 million isk to buy. everyone undocks their credit cards from the game and ccp goes **** up.once again congrats."
7/6/2010,there is no part of this proposal that's a good idea.
7/6/2010,"haha, oh wow."
7/6/2010,"^^ this.also op, as to your fluff, densely populated areas tend to have higher authority presence then lower population zones. for obvious reasons."
7/6/2010,"this idea wont remove lag at all. it will just give another reason for griefers to do their deeds in high-sec. you said it yourself, no more concord except in certain places. lol.for low sec, pirates already have low security status, they dont give a crap if they shoot anyone anymore, especially if they are -10.0. lolnot supported at all.if you want to ""fix"" the lag problem and remove people in jita. attack at the core. jita is a trading hub. isk is involved. well attack with isk. high tax rate for transactions that happens in jita. less profit in the end so they will go away. this is just a theory though."
7/6/2010,"lol - the griefer gets griefed and has a whine? it's game mechanics boyo, suck it up and htfu!!sad panda is sad for you"
7/6/2010,"i'm in support of this, only on the condition that it is legal war targets only.i agree that suicide gankers, while operating perfectly within intended game mechanics, should not get rights to the loot.so i'll hold off checking the box thingy until the op gets edited to say ""legal war targets only."""
7/6/2010,"not supported. even if a two day alt is flagged to you, it still means zero risk to the person flying the alt, as losing that alt just means he has to try again or perhaps two two day alts around next time."
7/6/2010,this change would make a lot of sense. think about it. in real life when an aggressor kills someone all the victim's properties now legally belong to the aggressor. it is actually the police's job to defend and make sure that the aggressor can now pick up what now legally belongs to him.
7/6/2010,"this. also, marlona sky for king of badgers."
7/6/2010,"umm... what?in real life, when an aggressor kills someone, they go to jail...unless you're talking about self-defense or something... in which all the victims' property belongs to the family of the deceased."
7/6/2010,"makes sense in regard to wardecs, which are not criminal.but would add corp members of the victim as players not flagged for looting, to prevent a good idea for wardecs to be abused in other situations."
7/6/2010,"proposed skill: skillbook pre-injectiondescription: each level of this skill allows you to inject 1 skillbook that the character does not have the prerequisite skills for.a pre-injected skill can be placed in the training queue, but only if the prerequisite skill levels are queued before it.once the prerequisite skills are trained, the character gets the pre-injection slot back.skill catagory: learningprerequisite: none or learning 2 or learning 3primary attribute: memorysecondary attribute: intelligencetraining time multiplier: 1xstructure:volume: 0.01m3the upshot of this skill is to be able to inject planned skillbooks ahead of time.game mechanics must be in place to prevent a pre-injected skill to be trained before the prerequisite skills, however.i feel this skill would be a good complement to the current skill queue system.it would allow a player to train advanced skills seamlessly, so you don't lose training time if you cannot log in during an off hour.example:character has science iii queued, pre-injects cybernetics, and can then queue cybernetics i and ii.if the character then removes science iii from the training queue, then cybernetics i and ii are also automatically removed.if the character tries to place cybernetics i into the queue alone, it will not be allowed. a message will pop up stating that prerequisite skills must be queued before you can queue this skill.once science iii is trained, the character can then pre-inject another skill (up to the character's maximum pre-injection limit)pre-injected skills should be tagged as such in the character skill sheet and training queue sheet."
7/6/2010,"worst of both worlds, imo. if they're going to allow pre-injection, it shouldn't be artificially limited."
7/6/2010,"this tbh.i'd prefer a system which allowed me to pre-inject any skill i own, but prevent me from learning it unless i have the prerequisites trained. this would at least allow me to queue up skills that will be valid once the current skill completes (i.e. training ham to 5, inject ham specialisation and add it to the queue (as long as there is <24 hours remaining on the current skill ofc))."
7/6/2010,that. make a post and i will support it. :)-liang
7/6/2010,"seems like supercapitals are a dime a dozen these days, mostly because right now the only barrier to constructing them is isk, which isn't a barrier at all to large alliances. i'd like to see ccp limit the number of new supercapitals that can be built by adding a new mineral used only for supercap production and refined from a new ore. this ore would be very rare (say a few single-belt spawns per region in terms of numbers, though distributed across all of 0.0 at random), but unlike current ores, it could spawn in *any* 0.0 system, regardless of region or truesec. it could only be mined with t2 modulated deep core strip miners; no ninja-mining this stuff in a burst. make each spawn yield at least a few iteron vs full of ore so that it requires some planning or teamwork to carry it home. with this new ore and mineral, ccp can set the refinery yield and supercap mineral requirements to put a hard limit on the maximum rate at which new supercaps can be built. ideally this limit would be significantly lower than the current supercap death rate (and would hopefully remain a bit lower than the eventual death rate once everyone starts being much more careful about flinging around their supercaps willy-nilly). benefits:* keeps eve from becoming supercapitals online* adds a new limited resource that can be exploited by anyone willing to brave a bit of 0.0 exploration and mining. unlike moon minerals, it doesn't require significant investment or alliance-level logistics to obtain.* spawning in any 0.0 system gives people a reason to explore the many currently empty areas of 0.0 space.* makes supercapital kills mean something again instead of just being ""oh well, we lost a titan, good thing we have six more coming out this month...""* lots of opportunities for market shenanigans as the big alliances scramble to collect the mineral for their own construction or just to keep it out of their enemies' hands."
7/6/2010,i mine the orei sell the orethe supercap builder buys the orethe supercap pilot only pays isk to supercap builderyou only make the supercap more expencive.
7/6/2010,because goons already have enough supercaps?
7/6/2010,"just invent death stars , so we have something even bigger to build.moon sized space ships that can fit 8 racial doomdays.200% per level reduction in doomsday recharge time."
7/6/2010,"not nearly as many as other alliances.but the underlying problem you and maxsim make are valid - this would either succeed, and deter new aspiring powers from catching up so easily to the established giants and their supercap armadas, or it would fail miserably because the new ore would be farmed in 0.0, moved to jita, and just added to the shopping list of minerals needed to build a titan.a retweaking of supercap capabilities combined with fixing the servers to more reliably allow fights on the scale where supercaps die (in action, rather than whilst staring at blank screens) would be a more welcome change."
7/6/2010,"csm item lists do include prioritization of the issues. they also include a lot of face-to-face discussion, for the purpose of making sure that ccp knows what it is we want, why we want it, and how much we're willing to give up in order to get it. as for allocating csm issues dev time, this has already been brought up and disposed of by csm4. csm4 asked for a dev time budget in order to ensure that they weren't shuffled off to the side, ccp said that nobody else anywhere in the company got that, and proposed stakeholder status instead. it's probably for the best anyways - i don't want a good expansion-sized csm-raised issue to get ignored just because they only have a third of an expansion left in their dev budget for this year, and i don't want devs working on trivial bull**** the csm raised instead of fixing other more important stuff just because the csm agenda was light last time. a dev budget is too far outside ccp processes, and too inflexible, to be the right solution. as long as ccp takes them seriously, stakeholder status is the right call. part of the fun of csm5 will be to see if that actually happens or not. you're trying to rebuild a system that's already in place, and you're doing it in complete ignorance of how it's set up at present. that's a recipe for disaster."
7/6/2010,"your points are valid until you actually read what the chairwoman of the csm wrote...""during the course of discussions on various topics, csm was consistently told that ccp cannot guarantee putting any resources on our current or future backlogged changes. this was a huge wtf moment for me. as in, wtf does csm-as-stakeholder mean if we cant influence priority any more than that?""that is 1 year....and ""but because development resources are already committed to other work for the duration of our term, csm5 may accomplish little in the way of measurable metrics. i believe our real charter is to pave the way for csm6.""i do not understand what they can accomplish if everything is already spoken for in development, make all the damn lists you want....if they never get done the only ones to suffer are us and the csm folks who bring these ideas forward.so please explain to me how i do not understand the process if the chairwoman of the csm 5 tells us this?tl;drif they know what we want and still never do anything why make a damn list of issues?"
7/6/2010,"you ever done me research in highsec? you seem like the type who would look at the lines, see that there's a two month waiting period, and come back in two months looking for all the free lines. it doesn't work that way. if ccp schedules major expansions a year or two in advance, you need to be there a year or two in advance too, lobbying for what you want to see. it's not fast, and it's not glamorous, but it's how stuff has to work. one csm meeting is not going to make ccp scrap incarna or even push it back very far. and, like it or not, that's the biggest thing on ccp's plate right now. anything we want to get needs to either fit in beside it in the expansion schedule(reasonable, for small stuff), or be slotted after it. so yeah, csm 5 asking for the moon won;t get them much more than a moon pie, even if ccp bends over backwards for us. it's what comes later that's the problem. for what it's worth, i don't want to defend ccp too much here. if they were serious about doing csm stuff, csm1 issues would be coming online pretty frequently these days, and they're not. even stuff like sorting inventory by meta, which i think csm2 raised, and was told it'd be a trivial thing to add, still isn't in game. ccp is hardly blameless in this. but they're too big a company to turn on a dime, and on anything but a few coffee-break-sized issues, i wouldn't want them to try. this stakeholder thing might be a genuine change on their part, or it might be a filthy lie designed to keep us off their backs. frankly, there's no great way to tell for a year or so, short of a dev getting plastered and saying that vuk made one homoerotic joke too many and now they aren't listening to us any more. but whether the news is good or bad, your request won't do squat."
7/6/2010,of course they have their schedules and maybe they even make them one year or more in advance.but that still does not keep them from appointing a release a change is schedule for.if they have a roadmap for the next 2 expansions that means 1 year of fixed schedules.but this would also mean they can add it to the expansion after that; but they just don't do that.they rather keep telling people a fix will come some day (either knowing this day will come in 2 years or not).just look at the rocket fix it's hilarious.i support the idea to give the players some kind of prediction when a (accepted) change will be released.

7/6/2010,"what i once had as idea, and might propose here if enough like the idea:make jc distance dependant. (light years easiest probably). so op here wouldnt have any advantage since he wasnts to jump to other side of map. but the idea is if you just want to get to other clone for the implants/moving a little bit you have a short timer, lets say 12 hours. if you want to travel to other side of universe you get a timer of a few days. would make blobs harder since you cant just jc all the time accross half the universe, would make pvp for carebears more attractive since they can get to implantless clone easier."
7/6/2010,"ccp, like most growing software companies, always has far more potential ideas than resources. currently, incarna & dust & the lag issue greatly exacerbate the shortage of development resources.it would be very problematic to let the csm (or other stakeholders) add features to the mix. but i think the csm could provide some real value to helping keep things focused. say any (non-security/accounting) feature that is going to take more than x person-weeks of effort gets run by the csm in advance. it is so much more efficient to never begin/pause things early rather than work on them and pull them from a late scrum. naturally, ccp ""veto"" would not be binding, but a recommendation to not try to add a feature in the next release could add some value.this buys ccp some cover with the player base.this provides a calmer outside voice, free from ccp internal development history/politics/turmoil.it is consistent with what a lot of people said about wanting ""excellent""/complete features - tanstaafl, so that means fewer things need to be attempted if they are to be done better."

7/6/2010,"speaking of which, i read in the summit minutes something about extending the term from 6 months to a full year.did ccp approve that at all, or was that just another discussion that they put on the backlog?"
7/6/2010,"it's already in place. csm5 is serving a 10-month term(they wanted to change when in the year the elections fell), and then csm6+ will be 12-month terms."
7/6/2010,"and it was ccp's idea, not ours."
7/6/2010,"and it was done so that csm summits could be conducted at the start of each six-month development cycle, the intention being that csm priorities could be taken into timely consideration for each cycle. although this was decided during csm4's term and although the first csm5 summit did indeed occur at the start of a dev cycle, we got no commitments from ccp for putting any csm backlogged items in the winter expansion. the only (distant) possibility i recall is a ""we will investigate the feasibility to put this in to the winter expansion."" response to a csm4 item (t3 refitting subsystems at pos / carrier) that csm5 carried forward. we otherwise have no idea what if any csm backlogged items are being considered for inclusion on the winter expansion (or interim patches, for that matter), nor is there any easy way to get a list of csm items in the backlog or their status because those items are not tagged with a csm identifier. at the summit, we requested such a list and the implementation of a process for tagging csm items going forward. ccp committed to doing this--by the next summit six months from now. i find that time-frame somewhat ridiculous, tbh. how hard exactly could this job be? and ummm...gee, maybe it would be easier and faster if the csm were employed somehow to aid in the process. but...no dice. i'm tracking the status of that and other deliverables on my blog, though. will cheerfully give credit where due when ccp delivers and in the meanwhile will post updates for each follow-up to check the status of these ccp commitments."

7/7/2010,100 % correct. everyone has a choice.
7/7/2010,"i have been playing for over four years now. when i first started, the learning skill were already in the game. as history has presented, the number of players and subscriptions has risen as the game became more popular. yet for some unknown reason, the new players today just can not cope with the learning skills and want them removed with the stipulation that the bonuses offered from the skills are freely granted. how did this game survive, much less expand when these same daunting skills have been in the game for so long, ~inflicting~ their ills upon the player base?ccp has gotten softer over the years in my opinion. before the probing changes, exploration was a dedicated profession with high risks and potentially grand rewards. the probes were broken into specific areas of expertise with distinct sets of continuously smaller range, but stronger signal probes required to lock down a target. the probes were like ammo - once launched, the probes were consumed. ccp changed the whole profession into a simpler task to allow everyone to go exploring. all the probes were converted into a singular type that was also a reusable probe. those that had blueprints researched for the older style of probes were told tough luck - no compensation. those luckless players were not greater than the new majority pushed into finding wormholes.other skills over the years had their requirements lowered to allow more people to gain those skills faster, including the first tier learning skills. the skill queue was a debated topic for a while before ccp implemented that program. the pro-queue players rallied that it was unfair that extended or unannounced downtime took away from them changing skills. so many years later, ccp has an extended downtime and gives away skill points. going soft again...with the release of dominion, the lag in null security space went off the charts. while i do not have actually numbers, i would harbor a good guess that a majority of players in those regions of space are older veterans. and i would guess that their overall numbers are less than those that hang out in empire space (author included ). another expansion was released with the intent that brand new players can start messing up planets. the lag continued, and again in my opinion, ccp not worried about the older veterans since they been with the game for quite some time - we're not liable to throw it all away. but has anyone looked into the character bazaar forum lately and noticed a good number of null sec pilots offered for sale?ccp is expanding to create dust 514 for the console, which is usually stereotyped as the younger crowd with the twitch reflexes. console shelf life is measured in months, not years. long ago ccp stated to have a ten year plan for eve and with the eighth alliance tournament behind us... you can do the math.so will ccp remove the learning skills and grant new players everything on a silver platter to gain those subscription numbers and profits? of course they will since we crusty old veterans are probably more a hindrance while we've already profited them greatly. instead of ccp worrying about how to entice the veterans with new goals to parallel our expanded skill point totals, ccp can sit back and the new players ""work"" their way up to where we are today. by then, the ten year plan will be completed and ccp can then concentrate upon their new release - probably the world of darkness game with white wolf as backing materials. and since ccp gained the goodwill of all the new players granted life on a silver platter, their new game will have a solid starting base.and we crusty old bitter veterans - our total numbers would not dent the bottom line if we played or not.my humble opinion, of course, - guttripper..."
7/7/2010,"the game has had an atrocious ui all those years as well, i guess we should leave that unchanged also since subscriptions still grew during that period? what you've said in your post is true, but its hardly a good way to argue to keep an old system in place. any decision ccp makes will likely be based on their estimates of how many potential players are sufficiently put off by the learning skill system that they don't subscribe, vs the number of players that would quit if it was removed."
7/7/2010,"oh, i agree the interface needs work. but based upon ankhesentapemkah's blog, ccp has (supposedly) stated:""unfortunately, nathan, ccps producer, became very defensive and attempted to justify ccps development process. he also said that ccp cannot commit to big issues right now, as a lot of their developers are tied down building incarna and dust.""(skip.)""the csm met with the team responsible for the user interface during this afternoon. the csm stated that the ui is the first impression players get of eve, and that many players are overwhelmed by it, or annoyed by the poor usability. overhauling the ui would help retaining a lot of the new players, so the csm claimed. disappointingly enough, ccp does not want to commit to a ui overhaul. the csm proceeded to list smaller problems in the current ui, which were noted by the dev team.""(skip.)""unfortunately, the csm heard time and again that ccp simply does not have any resources to commit to anything. this frustrated the csm, which said that some of the issues have been brought up by every csm to date (corp roles review, alliances in fw), and were not closer to being addressed than they were two years ago. ccp developers said that many of their own issues have not made it in-game either and called the csm to be realistic. the csm openly questioned their purpose at this point, as they said there was little point in raising player issues if they were never going to get addressed, no matter how small they were or how highly they prioritized them, as ccp would just run off doing its own thing.""-----so takseen, as much as you and i can debate points back and forth (even though you are *cough* gallente *cough*) , until ccp has a commitment to address players' points, it does seem they will have their own agenda to follow. and that agenda seems to be to snag the potentially new players gained from dust and incarna. i doubt these two new platforms of players are going to worry whether the learning skills remain or not since i would think dust will be like any other shooter (no stats) and incarna will not be affected by attributes according to ccp.so ummm, been watching the world cup? germany looks pretty strong this year..."
7/7/2010,"if everyone is so worried about 'new players' just skilling up in learning and not playing the game.why not just put a skill pre-requisite for any learning skills.something like 5million skill points required to do any of them.problem solved. they play the game. its a bonus to get after you are commited to a game as extra skills.i do not support the original change. i like learning skills - its part of the sandbox. do them, or do not do them."
7/7/2010,"supported lets have newbies play for their first few months instead of just ""playing counterstrike for a month"" as soundwave said at fanfest :p"
7/7/2010,"not supported. no-one needs to train the learning skills to 5/5 right off the bat. it is their choice to be bored. when i started, i balanced learning skills with the training of my normal skills as well. i had fun and did not care that i lost a couple of hours here and there to not having the leet learning skills right from the start, instead i was killing things and mining rocks.currently i have them at 4/4 and guess what? i have some plans in evemon right now that show almost no gain in training them to level v even with a year of training planned in advance! so the complainers must be the ones that thought it would be good to train them to level v to save a couple minutes of training out of a year, and now want their sp back for their bad decision.what really needs to happen, is new players should be taught to balance their training rather than sitting in the station training things to level v. the game is what you make of it, if you want to sit in station and spin out of boredom you will, if you want to have fun you will, learning skills do not change that."
7/7/2010,"i'm not going to read through this rather lengthy thread so my apology in advance if this was covered already.personally, i support the removal of the learning skills. i wouldn't be surprised in fact if the method ccp used recently to reimburse us for the extended downtime was a program created specifically to do away with them. although that's just hopeful theory crafting. better that than they just making them go poof. sorry guys! personally, i say give those who trained the learning skills the sp they've invested in that category to do with as they please, just as they did with the gifted sp recently. from there on, base the attributes off of whatever that player has their attributes mapped to. whether everyone gets the points you'd gained from having all the learning skills at 5, or those points disappear entirely, is completely irrelevant imo and i really dont see the point of arguing it. either way, every one is equal across the board. your attributes and how fast you learn are then solely based on how they are mapped as well as the implants you have injected.the older players complain its not fair. that they invested all that time in learning those skills. that its another good level of separation between players or whatever your argument may be. at first, that may sound all well and good and a solid argument..but nit and grit is that its total bs and nothing but pure tears. youve played for so many odd years. youve stuck with it through hundreds of other changes. youre still here even with the game crushing lag. i too have trained those skills. i too have seen the benefits of doing so. and i too have seen the complete and utter uselessness of having to sit for those some odd days training skills that nearly everyone, even ccp, agree was a horrible idea.the thing many of you seem to forget is that ccp is a company. and as a company, like the ones you all work for or own, theyre in the business to make money, to turn a profit and to continue to grow and develop. if a market test was done to see if the learning skills had any effect on new players sticking with the game and discovered it did, then you can bet your butt theyre going to do away with them, whether you like it or not. because frankly, money speaks louder than you. if thats a problem with you.well htfu. personally, anything that helps to increase the interest and popularity of eve is, imo, a good thing!frankly though, i dont see the problem. with this idea, you get your sp and in essence your time back that you spent training them. youre also still ahead of the newer players and will continue to be so because wed all be on a level playing field in terms of training time. if a newer player passes you in gunnery because your attributes are mapped elsewhere and that bothers you, well then thats your own fault because you mapped your attributes the way you did."
7/7/2010,"a couple of minutes? try two months knocked off the first year (or 16 months of training in the first year.)assuming that i haven't borked the math, a newbie who burns a remap can pay off the 5/5/5 skills in up to eight months (not counting implants.) according to evemon it takes 113 days (3.8 months) to train to 5/5/5.) with 5/5/5 skills you'll have a 194% learning rate (not considering implants,) which means that for the last four months of the year, you'll get in nearly eight months of training.the math:max base rate: 15 + 5/2 = 19.5 skill points per minute. this is the max rate you can train with no learning skills.according to evemon, it takes 113 days (3.8 months) to get to 5/5/5 (remap + 1.6m training speed bonus)5/5/5 rate: ((15+10) + (9+10)/2 ) * 1.1 = 37.95 skill points/min37.95 / 19.5 = 1.946. the 5/5/5 rate produces 194.6% of the skill points per time unit versus the max base rate.how long will it take for the 5/5/5 rate to catch up to the max base rate?a) 1.946x - 113 = 1.0x + 1.0 * 113""1.946x - 113"": this is the 5/5/5 side of the equation. x is days. 1.946 is the training rate. -113 is because we spent 113 days training 5/5/5.""1.0x + 1.0 * 113"": this is the no learning skills side. x is days. we have a 113 day head start training at 1.0 base rate.b) 1.946x - x = 226c) .946x = 226d) x = 226 / .946e) x = 238.9 days so about eight months for 5/5/5 to pay off in the worst case, not considering implants.if you're outside of the accelerated training bonus you're looking at 130 days to get to 5/5/5 with a remap. payoff is in: 260 / .946 = 274.8 days or a little over 9 months, worst case and no implants.edit: yes, i'm aware that going from iv to v can result in a years long payback (diminishing returns and non-linear curve.) the point is that even if you spend 3.8 months getting to v you'll still see a relatively quick payback. lies, damn lies, and statistics. =)"

7/7/2010,"another one that didnt read properly...let me re-write the possible rules that could be implemented : - it can be done only once per account, (to help those who realy need it, that way it cant be farmed)- you can buy back up to 1 year worth of game time maximum, (so an old character woudnt be a possible monster)- the number of sp available is based on the average sp per month the character chosen has trained, (if an old toon just played 2 months, the average sp he did in those 2 first months are quite low, so even if he decide to buy a year back, it wont mean alot of sp)and i could add a new rule :- the process cant be done on a transfered character. (characters have to be created from scratch in the account to be eligible)with all these rules and ccp could add even more, it will target those who realy need it and with the features already available in eve, this is just another one in the same league.resum<U+FFFD> : whats the difference between paying now or paying the same later ? p.s : to those that post after this, if you dont support this idea, be sure to read everything that was said before posting. thx."

7/7/2010,ideas about how to refine the ship have ended up here and here. people have ideas all over the place about it.
7/7/2010,"something has got to be done. right now there is the dramiel, and then there is everything else as far as frigs go.why fly any other frigate when a dramiel can do everything better??i propose the dramiel be balanced.lower the power grid my 20%!"
7/7/2010,"usually topics like this get more support when there's an actual proposal involved. some sort of evidence that you've put thought into the idea and how it'll affect eve. a good start would be exactly what about the dramiel you think is overpowered, and specifically how to fix it."
7/7/2010,"fair enough, i'll edit my op then."
7/7/2010,there are many things that can be used to counter the dramiel. get an imagination ffs.
7/7/2010,"supported, other frigates need to be viable. right now it's either dramiel or gtfo.specifically, lowering the powergrid is a good idea since it wouldn't take away what makes dramiels special (their speed and agility, though they should be made reasonable too) but it would mean that they couldn't fit a medium shield extender and use dual propulsion at the same time.their tank should be their speed, not their hitpoints."
7/7/2010,so people kill dramiels solo in:- frigates()- cruisers (bellicose lol)- battlecruisers (even with blasters!)- battleships ().doesnt look that overpowered for me. maybe you should get creative and think about how you can beat them instead of trying to nerf them?
7/7/2010,"the dram isn't that hard to counter tbh. sure it's good, but it's also quite expensive. it's greatest ability is getting out of a fight that's not going well. my only concern was that it was a little too fast - overloaded & with snakes it can past 10km/sec which, as i understand it, was a problem a while back (hence the speed nerf).perhaps just lower it's base speed by 5%."
7/7/2010,your just jellin cuz u dont have 80 mil for a dram
7/7/2010,"like a badger.seriously though, a curse is the end of a dramiel. i've escaped dramiels with neuts on various ships. it really isn't that hard. they usually don't have much cap to spare.there are other ships with crazy speed besides the dramiel... the daredevil (4 low slots) is one. the firetail is another. the succubus is slower, but it does more damage and can fit two neuts up top to shut down faster frigates."
7/7/2010,"dont forget. cruors, comets. both can even kill dramiels, if piloted correctly."
7/7/2010,"a couple of thoughts.... yes, the dramiel can be countered and killed. that doesn't change the balance issue with the dramiel: given a dramiel w/ a vanilla fit: [dramiel, dramiel - vanilla]damage control iimicro auxiliary power core igyrostabilizer ii1mn afterburner iimedium f-s9 regolith shield inductionfaint epsilon warp scrambler icatalyzed cold-gas i arcjet thrusters125mm gatling autocannon ii, barrage ssmall unstable power fluctuator i125mm gatling autocannon ii, barrage ssmall auxiliary thrusters ismall auxiliary thrusters ismall core defence field extender ihobgoblin ii x3hobgoblin ii x11.) its a faction frigate that is faster and more agile than an interceptor. even non-faction fit, a typical dramiel will go just under 1900 m/s w/ ab and 5400 m/s w/ a mwd. alone, this is not a problem. coupled with the folowing benefits is where the dramiel becomes overpowered. 2.) its a faction frigate that is not gimped on dps. while i don't have eft in front of me, this fit can do over 150 dps (w/ rf emp). there are several assault frigates that can't put this much dps out! 3.) it is not gimped on tank. this frigate has over 6000 ehp, as it can fit a mse and a dcu. with faction fittings, everything is improved (you can fit bigger guns, similar tank, and go much faster!). ships are typically balanced amoung these three attributes, and the dramiel is just good or amazing at all of them! to balance it, one of these things needs to be hindered a bit. lowering the power grid so it can't fit dual prop and a mse seems a reasonable change in my opinion!*edit*before i support such an idea, i would want to see some thought as to how much is reasonable, etc. also, if other ships are getting a boost, (t3 frigates, ab boost to af, etc) then the dramiel might be perfect as is."
7/7/2010,"ffs, i don't think people seem to get the point of a ""faction"" frigate. its a powerful frigate hull that comes with a pretty pricey tag (80 mil isk)...if anything, they should boost the other faction frigs so they can counter the dramiel better. that would make the game a lot funner instead of just nerfing everything."
7/7/2010,"dramiel doesn't need to be nerfed, gtfo with your nonsense.also, go ahead and drop the pg by 15%. i'll just downgrade to best named stuff and a navy mapc, and fly it just as i always have."
7/7/2010,"i like the idea. will probably need work as far as required skills go, but thats the wunnerful thing about this game, infinite room for skill expansion!supported!"
7/7/2010,"i was very happy when i read the ship description and it stated that it was a salvage vessel. i was very disappointed when i found it was mostly just hangar decoration. i figure leave it at its current mass (battlecruiser i think)and propulsion. give it a cargo bay somewhere between 500-1000m3, 3 rigging points and a 4/3/4 slot layout with no weapon hardpoints. put a role bonus for tractor beams. maybe +50% range and velocity so it doesn't compete too directly with marauders or the orca. give an on skill bonus for cap capacity or reduced salvage cycle duration. (or salvage chance) a max range of 45km or so with a weak scan res would keep it being used in its intended role without some extremes of creativity. and, of course, keep it unrestricted as far as mission gates are concerned. it wouldn't necessarily be ""better"" than using a destroyer for the same purpose, but it would make it not useless."
7/7/2010,"obviously. just saying that this subsystem would make t3 pretty sweet for rr gangs, being able to provide good rep at a reasonable range (20-25km), decent damage with hm, point, and have all the advantages of being a cruiser (agile, small).you seem to be of the opinion that t3 logistics fits should be mirror images of logistics cruisers. i see them as cruiser sized rr battleships.::shrug::i agree they need a boost to range, just not more than 30km at lvl 5 defensive sub skill."
7/7/2010,"actually i completely agree with you. but i think medium reps should get the range of around 25km, if someone shoehorns in a large they will get a longer range with the missile setup you already stated"
7/7/2010,"i completly agress that a 25-30k ish range on med reps on a t3 would make the logistics module worthwhile,when they did the economic report it showed only one or two modules of each sub are really in demand this is because only one or two are practically useful, the logistics module lacks range, the overheating module relies on someone using overheat a last ditch technique as standard policyyes dont let a t3 equal a logistics full range but let it get half as far at least"
7/7/2010,"ccp has not given enough information for why it removed ankh from csm. all it said she did was ""violat[e] the nondisclosure agreement.""did she reveal things that were said in iceland? if so, was it for publishing her own minutes for the players she represents? if so, explain how her minutes violate the non-disclosure agreement but other csm members' minutes don't.i'm no fan of ankh's; in fact, i think she does not understand core game principles, but ccp needs to give its paying customers more information on why one of the members they elected were removed from csm.obviously, revealing what she disclosed that violated the non-disclosure agreement would eliminate the point of the non-disclosure agreement, but ccp could at least say whether she violated the nda in her blog, or give us a few hints about what exactly violated the nda. for example, a lot of people have speculated that it's because ankh said that ccp is spending most of its resorces on walking in stations and dust; by keeping quiet about why ankh was removed ccp is feeding this rumor and making it seem more plausible.saying, ""we're removing her from csm because she revealed a secret, so we can't tell you what secret it is so you'll just have to trust us"" hasn't floated well with ccp's paying customers."
7/7/2010,we weren't told much either but i doubt that raising it as proposal will gain you much
7/7/2010,she spoke ccp stuff is spread thin for incarna/dust and have no time to deal with current eve.i am sure that make them angry.
7/7/2010,"i know, but posting it in assembly hall allows csm to bring it up to ccp, so ccp could theoretically address it.that was smart of them. it's not like ccp's gonna see a backlash or anything."
7/7/2010,ccp was very vague with the whole thing but i think this may answer a few of the questions
7/7/2010,"not really. if you're implying the ankh was kicked for publicly criticizing ccp, then mynxee would have been kicked also. in any case the overall tone of that article was reasonably positive. hardly a ""hate piece"".besides, if ccp started punishing people for criticizing them, then eve would only have about 43 subscribers left."
7/7/2010,"if ccp choses to keep this private, they have every right to do so tbh."
7/7/2010,it might be tricky to provide more details on a breach of a non disclosure agreement without drawing more attention to the information that was supposed to be non-disclosed in the first place.just sayin.
7/7/2010,"it's tough to disclose information on a breach of an nda since in disclosing that information you have to break the nda again and make the problem worse. i've seen this happen when beta-testing other games, where the company had to kick beta-testers for breaching the nda but couldn't release any information about what was disclosed. but at the same time, it's also the perfect thing to get rid of someone you don't like for the exact reason that you can't disclose much information. i'm more inclined to go with the former reason in this case because everyone criticizes ccp."
7/7/2010,"she revealed information that is critical of ccp, so while she technically disclosed information that violated the nda, it's likely that the reason they booted her was because she told everyone that they were focusing on dust and walking in stations.other csm's disclosed information about future development too in their minutes of the meeting in iceland, but they weren't kicked because they were careful enough to exclude specifics critical of ccp."
7/7/2010,by that logic they'd have to kickban half of csm.
7/7/2010,what part of this did you not understand?nda being broken implies some stuff was leaked. why would ccp open the faucet even more?
7/7/2010,the stuff leaked was not related to the csm.
7/7/2010,"indeed. also the punishment really isn't that significant, she wasn't banned and she wasn't sued... so..."
7/7/2010,"so, will there be an election to find her replacement??i think it is only fair, though i expect ccp will deny us it"
7/7/2010,"first alternate will take his place, that is the person with most votes that didn't make it in.the breach was probably a ridiculously insignificant one that was used to get rid of a non-yes man. no one left to pressure ccp with force sufficient to make meaningful change .. more lag, more useless fluff coming our way might have had some odd notions to say the least and a bit on the vocal side, but sometimes screaming is the only way to break down barriers (kids know this all too well, nasty little buggers )."
7/7/2010,"tbh, posting ""issue"" threads about stuff that really isnt an ""issue"" should be a forum ban-able offense."

7/7/2010,more counters for a ship class that is hardly worth flying anymore is a bad idea. sorry.yeah... like 100% lower.-liang
7/7/2010,"not supported.of course, you realize that the ecm ship engaging you has usually dedicated his entire fit to e-war, whereas you may have dedicated one or two modules (and now a booster) to countering his fit... yeah, that's fair.e-war vessels typically have minimal damage/tanking bonuses in favour of e-war bonuses intended to make them actually viable ecm platforms. this means that with those ecm modules neutralized or countered, they are very weak indeed compared to other vessels.i might be more in support of your suggestion if there was a corresponding booster available that increased ecm strength by similar amounts. more depth in strategy, counter-strategy and counter-counter-strategy is good. nerfing ultraspecialized ships is not."
7/7/2010,"if you wanna talk about fair, let's talk about that falcon or blackbird jamming out an entire 5-6 man cruiser gang with relative impunity. maybe you should *try* small gang pvp before you make a comment on it. also liang stop with the knee-jerk hyperbole comments that make you look like a massive ******."
7/7/2010,"being the eve drug user/lord that i am, i like this idea. a lot. to address a few concerns posted:1. as the op said this will hardly impact large gang warfare. see below for a minor issue i have with it.2. unprobable ships: make it so this drug takes the same slot of x-instinct (sig reduction).3. nerfing ecm: yeah its a slight nerf but honestly, i doubt this booster will be so op that it gains widespread use.one thing i would change is the scan resolution penalty: make this a locking range penalty instead. this way, sniper fleets have a serious risk of using this booster.with biology lvl 5 (rank 1 skill, no reason to not have it at 5 if you are using boosters), you get an hour. i have used blue pill, exile, and x-instinct in pve. just sayin"
7/7/2010,"that single ecm ship that has dedicated his entire fit to ecm perma-jamming 2-3 eccm'd battleships who've dedicated their entire fit[/i] to combat certainly is much more fair, no?ecm ships are a force multiplier[/i] by drastically reducing the effective combat capability of an enemy force, a job they do hands-down better than any other ship ever, period. of course, this isn't even counting the tremendous effectiveness of ecm drones -- ever been jammed for three cycles in a row by a flight of ec-300's in a double eccm'd battleship? it's gotten to the point now that many people have replaced warriors and valks with ec-300s and ec-600's, and are running ridiculous amounts of ecm ships in terrible ecm:non-ecm ratios in gangs. the result? 10v10 gang fights become 10v4's and when running in a smaller gang trying to engage a larger gang, it's commonplace for the larger gang to have more ecm ships than the smaller has ships total.it's funny you talk about ""more depth in strategy"", ""counter-strategy and counter-counter-strategy"", since there really is no viable counter to an ecm ship save for running as many eccm's as they have ecm's -- on every ship in your gang or simply outnumbering the enemy by two ships for every ecm boat they have (even then, you can't actively defend against ecm)."
7/7/2010,"so you have a 5men gang and didnt have a plan for ""blackbird on the field""?imho you deserve to die."
7/7/2010,nice idea.we just need to get sure this new booster won't share booster slot with blue pills and exile.
7/7/2010,"i've done a lot of small-gang pvp, and i can tell you right now said blackbird pilot was comically fortunate to pull that off. and the failure of even one jam can result in death.perhaps you should argue with facts instead of resorting to ad-hominem tactics such as calling people ******s, eh?"
7/7/2010,this is a good suggestion. i would like the booster to give you much better sig strength than any of the mods currently available. stats need to be worked out but for now the idea to balance/counter ecm without it being a direct nerf is welcome.
7/7/2010,"warping off and leaving whoever is tackled to die isn't really a valid counter in my books. having most, if not all, of your entire gang basically forced to sit there and die while being able to do literally nothing except hope for a missed cycle is not only horrible gameplay, it encourages bringing more numbers(aka blobbing).now, sure it is possible to get these ships off the field, but with the time it takes to either get in range(and hope to not be jammed) or get a warp-in(and hope to not be jammed when you land), you will have already lost one or more of your gang, thereby multiplying the effectiveness of the ecm ships.of course if mr. ""i-pwn-at-eve"" wants to bring a 5 man cruiser gang over to bleaks/devoid/heimatar then i'll be plenty happy to show you just how bat**** overpowered ecm ships are in the context of small gang and solo pvp."
7/7/2010,"i've been in a pretty damn near max skilled scorpion and failed to jam one battleship. one. single. battleship. for every story where a blackbird/scorpion permajams ""an entire fleet"", i can show you a recent story where it failed to get the jams off that it needed. like i said - i'm pretty big into efficiency and ecm just isn't it anymore. yeah, you see the occasional solo rook flying about, but honestly they're hardly a threat anymore.ecm isn't a ""plague"" anymore, and we don't need to nerf it again. if you want a eccm booster, i kindly request a booster for ecm (and damp and td and painter while i'm at it) strength as well.nope. but i've sat there in a no-eccm hurricane and been unjammed for 2-3 minutes with a cloud of ec-600s on me. ecm is chance based, and ymmv. you only remember the ""epically annoying"" times and fail to account for all the times that someone tried to jam you and failed.a single ship that is eccm'ed up will either kill or drive off every ecm ship on the field. i've done it, so don't tell me it can't be done.-lianged: formatting. ah, there it is. in the post i quoted. how frustrating."
7/7/2010,"i've flown them. i've done it and had it done to me. so yeah, i'm speaking from experience."
7/7/2010,"an excellent point. op edited.<3it would be logical for this booster to occupy the same slot as x-instict, but the problem is that x-instinct is slot 1, the same slot all those great solo-relevant tanking boosters occupy. the best solution would be to add the ecm booster to slot 2 and move x-instinct to slot 2 as well."
7/7/2010,"as a sometimes ecm pilot, i find that drones are a good counter to ecm. a tanked blackbird can't last long agains a flight of medium drones."
7/7/2010,supported
7/7/2010,"i'm going to support this, but i think it needs a little tweaking.perhaps the solution to ecm isn't in combat boosters.- lower jam strength?- faster cycle times?- effects similar to ecm bursts and lockbreakers?- skills/rigs/highslots that improve sensor strength?just some ideas. they prolly suck... but think about them,"
7/7/2010,"even lower? the jam strength is really just a problem for cruiser and below.think it through. faster cycle time means more chances to get jammed. so it is effectively a boost. and longer cycle time would mean, failed jam hits way too hard and the ship becomes useless. lets say we up the cycle time to 60s. you always have to keep in mind, the whole thing is chance based. one failed jam and you have to wait 1minute until i get a next chance. 1minute where my primary defense is down. thats like 1minute where your shield booster/armor rep takes a break. sounds fair to you?so instant relock?you already got mid slots, low slots and implants that can boost your sensor strength to ""almost impossible to jam"".they do suck for sure.i think liang hit the nail on the head, people only remember all the successful jams against them and never count all the failed cycles against them that made them kill the other gang."
7/7/2010,"well, limiting the losses can be worth it. but it depends on the situation.how about having one long range hitting ship (aka a caracal) burning away from the fight until it has a good distance to the blackbird? chance is range dependent. so suddenly you get a few volleys off from the caracal or even get the sensor damp on the blackbird. a very simple counter. imho.uhm ... you make it sound like it is not fair when you loose ships while being jammed but it is totally fine if you loose them to a dps slug fest.been there. done that."
7/7/2010,"wholeheartedly supported, a great and viable solution to the constant unreasonable menace posed by ecm, compared to other forms of electronic warfare ecm not only accomplishes their relevant functions but completely dominates the engagement. an i-win button is not welcome in any sized engagement. this solution shows a great sense of ingenuity and creative thinking."
7/7/2010,now this is a boost to ecm warfare that makes sense. definitely supported.
7/7/2010,supported. ecm has no effective counter and remains entirely to reliable at eliminating multiple opponents with ease. this is the start of a taking a balanced approach.
7/7/2010,did you just say that ecm ships are not worth flying? you deserve to be crucified.
7/7/2010,"proposal does absolutely squat for anyone except bc/bs hulls, which coincidently have little issues due to more slots and higher base strength.adding a percentage only does not help the ships that actually need help, cruisers and down, as they have negligible sensors to begin with.unless it is combined it will either be too little to matter or make them useless for bc/bs .. numbers, numbers, numbers.since those occasional failed jams require 600m+ in implants and at least one slot to even be possible when flying cruiser down i think it is more than fair to ignore them.by the way, the lower cycle time is a perfectly sound idea when combined with lock-breaking. requires bs/bc to keep spamming eccm (and sebos) as lock time can be atrocious, while allowing smaller ships to avoid/survive what is currently a guaranteed perma-jam almost regardless of fit, skills, implants etc.the only problem is that it would require ecm pilots to actually pay attention (ie. no longer an alt job function) as a sebo interceptor could no longer be evaded indefinitely by slapping a single racial on it. not supported as it completely ignores the ships that are actually in need of help against ecm."
7/7/2010,very good
7/7/2010,before talking about booter drugs for sensor strengh first we should talk about the most bugged part of ewar. the ecm drones.. how the hell is it possible that you get jammed by a cupple of ec-300 with a sensor strenght of 102 points and most times not just one cycle or two but up to tree or four thats just plain stupid. it just doesnt seem right that you get screw'd or gotta run away with a 2b clone and a ship for roughtly 3b just because youre up against 2 hurricanes who deploy ecm-300 drones. or did i miss something?
7/7/2010,"f*** yes.also, anyone who thinks ecm ships are not worth flying is self-evidently playing some kind of game that is completely unrelated to eve."
7/7/2010,that's probably what devs said about the area effect doomsday device and titans long ago.
7/7/2010,"every 6 months the ""narf ecm"" stampede comes along...there is a counter, its called eccm. it's not because you concider eccm a waste of slots, that it actualy is..."
7/7/2010,not supported.i am not trying to offend any ecm-haters when i say: grab a blackbird and try it out.. you will see how much it fails right now.other arguments were covered very well by liang et al.
7/7/2010,"interesting proposal, tho personally i still prefer my own."
7/7/2010,"while i'm not normally sympathetic to ecm whine threads, your solution is one that i actually like. it'd need to be part of a bigger overhaul to drugs, since drug mechanics suck right now, but adding in an eccm drug is actually a pretty cool idea."
7/7/2010,after some thought i'm going to support this. drugs are woefully ignored by the general game in any case and this could also help in that area.
7/7/2010,"i'm okay with having a drug that functions like eccm. there's a drug for almost everything else. what i've always wondered is why have eccm and sensor boosters. why don't sensor boosters, you know... boost the sensors? i think that would've been the better change to ecm, rather than nerfing the range of ecm ships.the more counters put into the game against ecm, the more those poor, paper-thin ships need their long range back.edit: support. conditionally."
7/7/2010,"there hasn't been a ""counter ecm"" thread that i liked - until now. the booster idea is great becasue i think it will work well for a solo pilot - yet have a limitted effect on gangs/fleets. often times it takes fleets close to an hour to pull out of station. the negative to cap/range will hurt the logistics pilots so they probably wont use it often- or risk gimping their effectiveness. sometimes when i just a have a half hour or so to play i will go out solo and take the bait knowing i will likely die. but knowing that you are going to get jammed right before i can kill the bait makes it a complete waste = don't bother logging in unless you can wait for a fleet. this idea seems to address that without ruining ecms effectiveness in the gang/fleet context."
7/7/2010,"not supported.nerf ecm some more and with missiles already heavily nerfed and with limited usability outside pve, you have effectively kicked caldari out of the pvp forever."
7/7/2010,"that's funny. -i- don't hate it. plenty of my corp mates don't hate it. please, speak for everyone more.ecm is fine. caldari is already bad enough for pvp, don't take away their little viability. also, just because you consider the solution to be bad, doesn't mean that it -is- bad. they've dedicated their entire fitting and a considerable amount of training to being a dedicated ecm boat. you need to sacrifice a slot or two if you want to counter that. an unjammed ship can make quick work of a blackbird. claiming they keep 5man gangs entirely locked out is exaggerating and would require a huge amount of luck. get jammed on."
7/7/2010,"you dont actually expect people to use those, do you?i mean, that would be like using eccm.we need a counter that doesnt need us to make a sacrifice dammit!!!!111/sarcasm"
7/7/2010,"this isn't a nerf against ecm. i fly ecm ships often and have nothing against this except...funny how much these drawbacks are anti-ew. make the negative effects outside of the ew scope and i'd support. also, why is it you haven't modified your post to support a booster that would help ew pilots? what is good for the goose is good for the gander....as you point out in your op this would have limited and desirable changes."
7/7/2010,put the ecm optimal range on a falcon at 15km and give it no fall off like the neut range on a pilgrim. then you will know what a nerfed recon feels like.
7/7/2010,your pilgrim also has 2 ewar bonuses. just as a falcon. and with the tracking disruptor bonus you actually got a chance to survive inside 15km. and none of your ewar is chance based. cry some more please.
7/7/2010,"while this has absolutely zero chance of happening, it would be the right thing to do."

7/7/2010,how could anyone not want walking in stations more than a game that actually works?
7/7/2010,"currently it is next to impossible to use blasters in missions, because you cannot approach the npc quickly, and end up spending more time chasing npc's then actually shooting them. many gallente ships have bonuces to mwd, but misisons do not let them be used.solution: allow mwd use on ships of sise apropriate to the mission onlythe reason mwd use was banned, as i understand it, is that people used to kite damage in frigates. my proposal is to allow use of mwd's on cruisers and up in lvl 2 misisons, bc and up in lvl 3 misions, and bs and up in lvl 4 missions. that will allow gallente to use blasters in missions while not allowing people to use interceptors with mwd's. i would like to note that mwd where allowed for use in all nuyll-security sites, and that does not seem to be a problem, while enabling more interesting pve and hybrid fits/"
7/7/2010,"2 things bother me a bit about your proposal:1. speed tanking rats in a frigate is actually easier with an ab than it would be with a mwd.i run lvl4s solo in an afs without any problems.2. if you fit an ab on battleships you should normally be faster than the npcs. torp golem with ab is quite fun. i am not saying it would work for all missions. but there are many missions which you can run in a blaster mega or so. damsel, veng (atleast sansha version), the extravaganza missions, assault vs serps. just to name a few."
7/7/2010,"wi am not sure about the first point, that was named to be as the reason you are not allowed to use mwd in missions. if that reason is not valid, that is one less con.while you are faster then most npc's with an ab, it takes ages to close in range. for example, let's take a typical gallente battleship, with a t2 ab will go 300-350 m/s, depending on rigs. most npc's go 120-200 m/s. that means that you will be aproaching them at speed of 100- 230 m/s (because they will floy away from you), now when you have 20+ npc's to approach, and they orbit you at 40+ km, that's a hell of alot of time you will spend chasing them. on the other hand, mwd let's you get in range quickly, kill the npc, get to the next one, and so on."
7/7/2010,i'd like to put forward a very small idea just to help the player base concerning pi extractors and resetting them after the cycle's are complete.having 10 planets over 2 toons with excess of 80 extractors its a terrible click fest which serves only to waste 20-30 mins of my life just to reset them all on a daily basis. eve is an enjoyable game but aspects of it do become very tiresome. this extractor resetting process is one of them.can a drag box not be implemented so players can select multiple extractors in one go and reset them all piecemeal? ensure that if the user does this all extractors have to run to the same cycle time. if the player wants to vary his cycles then he must reset the extractors in the same process we all have to use currently.this simple method would really make life just a little easier for everyone and cut down on a very needless and long winded click fest.
7/7/2010,bump
7/7/2010,f........ yes!
7/7/2010,"not supported in your version. there is no point in tipping the balance the other way, that does not accomplish anything for the game."
7/7/2010,i have a levi on the test server. if i hop out of it and back into it it blasts my shields down to 54% of 3.5 or so million on a resist fit boat. granted i doubt that people will have a reason to unboard the titan and get back in it on tq like that but maybe they want their primae just that badly. if you guys want i can even get fraps and record how long regens work so theres video proof of the times that they are giving. (sokratesz if you want me to hide the mods in the video i can if they want me to actually do it. its your bird.)
7/7/2010,"first: woah this thread is still alive!second: i don't think a video would be needed, tbh, the numbers speak for themselves"
7/7/2010,yeah i was just saying it because reading though on the no votes it seems like a lot think that the numbers on time measurement think its an exaggeration.
7/7/2010,"this is an updated proposal. the main issue discussed was the possibility of pre-injecting skillbooks. the main purpose for this feature is to be able to queue skills requiring prerequisites to train while training the prerequisite skills themselves. the current game mechanics require the prerequisite skills to be trained fully before injecting the more advanced skill.tbh, my initial proposal was clunky, and others had better ideas on how to deal with this. my thanks to herschel yamamoto, liang nuren, and especially van'klomp for thier suggestions.this from van'klomp:""i'd prefer a system which allowed me to pre-inject any skill i own, but prevent me from learning it unless i have the prerequisites trained. this would at least allow me to queue up skills that will be valid once the current skill completes (i.e. training ham to 5, inject ham specialisation and add it to the queue (as long as there is <24 hours remaining on the current skill ofc)).""i cannot phrase this better than he, and any changes to the system would have to be 100% dev based, so i will let the proposal stand at his quote."
7/7/2010,supported.
7/7/2010,i <3 it.-liang
7/7/2010,"yes, i've been wanting something like this since the skill queue was introduced.but i see a few practical problems:say your prerequisite skill is short and at the end of the queue and you add your new skill behind it. then you get pod killed, losing attribute implants, which increase your skill training time that your new skill or even the prereq skill drop off from the 24h queue. what happens with the skill(book)? is it re-instanced at the station where your clone was or do you want to make it so that any skill can be injected regardless of prereqs, but only trained if the requirements are fulfilled? edit: saw that you meant the latter."
7/7/2010,"i could have sworn that the learning tutorial even said something like this is possible -- ""if you want to train a skill, all relevant prerequisites will be added) or something like that.... maybe i was just misreading something.anyways, supported."

7/7/2010,"+1, learning chains of short skills is always a pain."
7/7/2010,i like it
7/7/2010,"allow injection, disallow queueing the skill unless requisites are trained, disallow removing a skill from the queue unless its dependencies are removed first. seems a simple enough solution, and it'll make the learning curve far less annoying."
7/7/2010,"supported but with a little change:usually if i have a skill i have to inject which has a prereq in the queue, i have to add some other long skill to the end so that i don't waste time. for example:someone is training large projectile v so they can use large arty spec. since they cant inject large arty spec until large projectile v is complete, they could choose to:1) waste some training time and the next time they check their queue after large projectile v ends they can add large arty spec.2) put some other skill after large projectile v, and it will get a tiny bit of training until you remove it and put large arty spec.what i think should happen though is not have the ability to inject every skill book you buy, but only ones which the pre-req is learnable.for example you could not inject large arty spec until you have large projectile iv complete - thus able to learn its pre-req of large projectile v. you can still only add it to the queue after large projectile v, and if you remove large projectile v from the queue, then large arty spec would be removed as well since its pre-req is removed."
7/7/2010,i still don't know why the queue wasn't setup to work this way initially.

7/7/2010,"bad news: the entire game is designed around nobody being immune to pvp. ""his way"" is ccp's way. by letting rich players pay their way out of any and all pvp, you have now created a group of people that is immune to pvp, and that opens up a slippery slope of people complaining about haves vs. have notes, and before you know it they'll have to make miners and mission runners safe too.face it, this is a pvp game. if you don't like it, give me your stuff then quit."
7/7/2010,"umm, this isn't a pvp game. this isn't a pve game either. it's a game based around the delicate balance (one group creates supply, one group creates demand). it's a complex marketing simulation.that said, i'm not sure whether this idea would be successful, but it seems to be the best solution posited so far to fix what is a broken mechanic. i have been on the receiving end of wardecs with some of my alts, and it's no fun, and too cheap (i can make enough isk to fund a wardec against an entire alliance for a month with just two hours of mission running).wardecs are perhaps the main reason why there are so many people in npc corps, even with the 11% tax rate they recently introduced. wardecs are in need of an overhaul, alongside other issues with the corporation (ui, poses, roles, etc).i have read a lot of whining about isk sinks, and some of them are valid, but it doesn't counter the original argument. if this is not the right solution, please propose one which would fix it."

7/7/2010,"i propose not that we eliminate wtz persay, but eliminate the ability to accurately warp to x without some form of random deviation.it is debatable whether or not the game was healthier before wtz, what is not debatable is that the game is much better off without the thousands of bms that we had.how this would work:-you would still have your list of warp to xxkm.-you still have the ability to create bmswhat this feature would introduce is that, across the board, whenever you warp to xxkm you would actually land (randomly) between +15km or -15km of your intended target (you might warp at 2km, you might warp at 0km, you might warp at 15km)we all know 0.0 has bubbles, i'm not trying to make them obsolete or anything like that. what this would do is slow down travel a small amount. a few seconds per jump in most cases, more larger entities(ie: get a scout or escort per usual sop).this would allow for more opportunity to.... engage with the local system inhabitants? other possible effects (top of my head):-moar pvp -boost to low sec (kinda ties in w/ moar pvp)-slower travel = more work to haul region to region (likely boost to hauling as a trade)-less 0.0 camping? (see below) -many other aspects would come into play as one can imagine. we don't just warp to gates do we? we warp to pos's, stations, belts, wormholes etc etc etc... in each case the same logic applies. more of an opportunity to meet people of new and interesting cultures (and kill them) you otherwise would have not stopped to meet. as a closing comment, i'd like to say once upon a time old salts like me viewed eve as a very large game. we have not gained/lost significant space however changes such as warp to zero, jump clones, jump bridges, jump freighters (probably forgetting some) have made this game significantly smaller. while for some of these changes this has opened up opportunity for new professions, other changes have simply made the game needlessly smaller. nothing in eve should be overly easy, especially travel and avoiding conflict. while in 0.0 you can put bubbles all along a given high traffic route, this is not an option for low sec or high sec pvp.ultimately this would lead to more gfs in low and high sec, and in 0.0 the ability to report a target in x system and have a chance to intercept later in the route without having to resort to a drag bubble camp (though still an option!) may lessen some of the need to camp overly large bubble camps.submitted for your approval. unless you just really feel travel should be as quick and painless as possible, i can't imagine this not being a much better solution to an issue 'fixed' by implementing what we now know as wtz."

7/7/2010,"you people are so shortsighted, unable to comphrehend nor ponder the long term consequences of your actions. you seek this change of course to make pvp easier for you, but did you for once think, that if you get things changed in the game and make things to hard for your desired victims, that they will simply stop going to low and nullsec? your kills will go way down. your trying to make it extremly hard for ""carebears"" in the game, and seemingly unable to see how that might negatively effect your kill stats.if you make things to hard for your prey they will simply leave. this is a horrid idea. the only way people will venture into systems where they can be killed is if they know they have an out. you take away warp to zero that just makes it that much more risky, and people are less likely to venture into dangerous areas."
7/7/2010,"i love this idea!you can also add a skill with it, to improve accuracy by 1km per lvl.so with max skills it would be +/- 10km.there is alot of potential here, diffrent ship types could also be given diffrent max deviations so as to make certain ships slower/more dangerous to travel in and other faster/safer."
7/7/2010,on behalf of the professional freighting community:nothank yougabe
7/7/2010,"appreciate you commenting.please remember, eve lived with warp to 15 for a long time! some of us that have been here for both wt15 and wtz have had the ability to weight the pros and cons of both.i do not seek 'easy pvp' however if you interpret this as ""extremely hard for carebears"" all i can say is, when i was a carebear i used to move to 0.0 one ship at a time, with a scout (often get ganked) and still made a profit. nothing in eve is supposed to be overly easy. eve revolves around opportunity and opposition, it's what makes it a great game. and while i can respect that many people here may not agree with how i wish the mechanics to shift i respectfully suggest that what you and they want for yourselves may not be what is best for the game. if anything, the past has shown us that even the most fluffy of carebears were able to survive and adapt with wt15. and keep in mind, this mechanic would be even softer than wt15 was. (you might land 2km, you might land 0, you might land 12km....)"
7/7/2010,"yes, but now they have wtz. if you give someone something, then take it away, it angers them much more then if you just hadn;t given it to them in the first place."
7/7/2010,"thing is, the game didn't survive with it nearly as long as you think. the reason warp to zero came in was to clear up the millions upon millions of bookmarks people created to circumvent the warp to 15 system that was in place - essentially, people had already beaten the system and ccp simply bowed their heads in defeat and made it so. this was also a time far removed from the eve of today - the game has evolved for years based on the presence of warp to zero allowing for things like freighters to be useful. what worked back then, with a much smaller playerbase, with many fewer ships, with an entirely different development status, will not necessarily work today."
7/7/2010,"god no. having to make a 27 jump jita run to resupply even with wtz is tedious. without it, in an indy ship? do you have any idea how long it takes to go 15km in one?"

7/7/2010,"not supported, on the grounds that it will encourage bookmarking of stargates and stations, anyway.i keep the following in neocom > notepad under the title ""stargate sizes"" simply because i was curious:amarr system . . . . . .4946 mamarr constellation . . .4646 mamarr region . . . . . ...14 kmamarr border . . . . . ..26 kmcaldari system . . . . ..7065 mcaldari constellation . ..8998 mcaldari region . . . . . .15 kmcaldari border . . . . ...28 kmgallente system . . . . .6754 mgallente constellation . 9412 mgallente region . . . . ..10 kmgallente border . . . . .38 kmminmatar system . . . .4995 mminmatar constellation. 25 kmminmatar region . . .. ..24 kmminmatar border . . . .42 kmsmuggler gate . . . . ..i've only seen a smuggler gate on singularity, and i didn't write down the ""size"" that appeared in my overview, so i'm not sure how big it is. the periods are just to keep the almost evenly spaced in the in-game notepad. note that these sizes are diameters, so their radii are exactly half. we're concerned with the radii here.most stargates are ""system"" gates, rather than ""constellation"", ""region"", and ""border"". thus, most stargates have a 2.5 km radius, and a 2.5 km jump range beyond that. to minimize the effect of a random 15 kilometer deviation, players will start creating custom bookmarks for stargates again by flying a small ship right into the middle of the stargate. theoretically, when one warps to a bookmark at the exact center of a stargate, the ship can land no further out than 10 km from the jump limit. this would be useful to some pilots (like freighter pilots) to minimize travel time between dropping from warp and reaching the gate.a moderate-sized minority of stargates are significantly larger than this, so a bookmark placed at their centers would have even less maximum deviation from the jump limit than for small stargates. a few stargates are just so massive that their radii-plus-jump-distance are larger than 15 kilometers, so warping to a bookmark at their center will guarantee still being within jump range: these include (and are limited to) all four ""border"" stargates, ""minmatar constellation"", and ""minmatar region"" gates.stations are also susceptible to being bookmarked in this manner. many stations have a geometry such that it's possible to get a small ship near the center of a station to bookmark the center. docking requests are accepted once a ship is within 500 meters of a station's outer boundary sphere (that is, at a distance of 0.5 * ""size"" + 500 meters from the center of the station). most stations, however, are gigantic when compared to system gates, and all stations can be bookmarked in such a way that a 15 kilometer random deviation is still within the docking perimeter.besides the problems with the particular proposed mechanic, as described above, finding some other way to eliminate warp-to-zero that players can't work around using bookmarks sounds like a bad idea because it will just frustrate normal travel that happens during the majority of the time when pvp isn't happening during travel."
7/7/2010,"not supported.besides the obvious issues with moving a large slow ship like a freighter around, imagine having to move an entire fleet... every gate the entire fleet would have to stop, wait for all the bs to approach gate, etc. in addition it would cause issues with stealth bombers setting up bombing runs, warping to a certain distance from a titan to bridge through and then oh no you are way too far or you land right on top and bump them.. the problems with this are endless."
7/7/2010,"um no. travel takes up so much time already, it was a change for the better to have wtz. i would even make autopilot wtz, but i am aware of the intended tradeoff. second, tactical positioning is the key in small gangs - how would you like your rr group being spread out 30k from each other every time you do a tactical warp?if you want to gank random haulers going through gates, put up a bubble."
7/7/2010,"i don't like it. here is why:interceptors, covert ops and recon class: those ships need to be able to get to places fast and accurately.haulers, freighters: those things are slow, very slow and people who use them and play actively when moving about will hate it. if they wanted to autopilot they would.acceleration gates: ever had to warp out and then slowboat to a gate in a mission or a plex? imagine having to do 15 more km in a battleship.warping at range: you want to warp to 50km to be at your optimal, you can now land at 65km and therefor your tactic is now ruined.probably a lot more things wrong with this."
7/7/2010,this.
7/7/2010,"supported, but i want it modified.personally, i'd prefer the deviation to be greater the farther you have to warp to get to the gate. ex: a 88 au warp from one side of the system to another would land you within 15-10 km of the gate.a sort of ""lock-on"" strength."
7/7/2010,"not as ""curious"" as seamus but most people are aware there's a radius and will bm to kill as much of the deviation as possible. as a former iss bookmarker i can tell you going back to working with bm on every single gate and station from every possible angle is not desirable. not desirable! no support."
7/7/2010,"i see you suffer from selective memory, let me remember something from the time when warp to 15 was in effect:people used millions of insta bookmarks to warp to 0 and don't forget that at the time 20k player on line was a high number. so in reality warp to 15 km was operative for: noobs, people without the isk to buy the insta for multiple regions, people that hadn't before in that region, people that hadn't the time to do insta for whole regions. essentially wtz was in effect for 90% of the player with more than a few weeks of experience living low sec and 0.0.so there is not a ""golden age"" age to return to."

7/7/2010,"i am not sure if i understand what you mean by have them all attached to your clone at one time?do you mean if i get podded i lose all my 5 racks? or just the current active rack?because if you just mean the current rack then yes that is exactly what i mean. if i enable my rack 1 scanning set and undock in my buzzard, i risk my rack 1 scanning set. i get podded, all the implants from rack 1 are toast.but if you mean when you are podded you lose all your implants from all your racks then that would not be very good. i should not lose potentially 50 implants to fly with 10. it would again reduce the viability of expensive implants or using any more than one set and be worse than the current system.to summarise:-you can change between which rack you want active only at a station or sma.-you cannot replace installed implants, they must be removed/destroyed. -you cannot move an implant from one rack to another rack. -if you are flying in your active set and you get podded you lose your active set. i 100% agree. bugger these generic 200mil implants i have now. when im in my scanning buzzard i want to use the multibillion implants for that hour of scanning. increased reward by actually being viable to do so, increase risk in loosing the bloody things if someone pods me. its actually not a big change. its really fixing a flaw in the way it works now that bottlenecks implants. i believe this bottleneck is unintended and takes away from the game rather than gives. it is all a matter of perspective, people will not see the implant system is flawed until they are in a situation that makes it apparent. so while a reader may think now that this is all a big hurf blurf about something that does not effect them, further down the road in their eve career they might view this thread in a different light.its not an easy thing for me to explain, i am not the greatest writer. i am sorry if my lack of concise writing ability has made people inadvertently miscomprehended this whole suggestion. this change is not gamebreaking for me. i will survive on regardless. i just wanted to point the flaw out and a way to fix it. i see a lot of positives and very few negatives. until then im sticking to my generic implants and well to anyone that is trying to sell a low-grade virtue set, sorry bro not yet, maybe one day you will get my isk :dedit: also thanks for your feedback it is appreciated!"
7/7/2010,"i have no idea if it's already been suggested but here's my solution.you learn skills points in each of your attibutes instead of learning a skill. how many sp you get in each attributes still depends on your attributes. once you have enough sp you can buy the skill(s). so no need to log in on monday at 21:00 to get new skills in queue per exemple. all skills will have to be modified to get the amount of skillpoints for the 2 required attributes (which would require a bit of simple math with the formula in use). since this solution is in conflict with the learning skills, get rid of them. as it was already porposed, give everyone a refund and a +10 to their attributes.edit : main advantage is that you can be away from the game for a very long period of time and no need to log in. cathrina can go down on your house, once the house is rebuild you can buy the skills you want. training can't get interrupted.when you log for the first time, you select the combo of skills in which you learn skill points[] intel / memory[x] perception / willpower[] charisma / willpower.....each skills will now display the number of sp required for each attributes."
7/7/2010,"i believe everyone wants to fly one of those shiny concord hulls, they're just too pretty to be left alone right? well, i have an idea that would let us use concord ships, but still with a rp feeling about it. so, we have faction warfare, which lets you fight for your faction. what if there was a concordd signup, where you can work for concord while you're in their corp. it could work out like this, when you sign up you transfer from your old corp to concord (or a new corp if ccp wants to keep concord for themselves). concord's role is to punish criminals right? so, all players in the corp concord would share killrights with every player in highsec. don't want to canflip anymore, do you? but we don't want everyone to cruise around in awesome ships either, right? so to limit the use, concord pilots should not be able to accept missions or leave highsec. but to compensate for the losses, you'll be allowed to use the beautiful concord ships. i saw some thread regarding concord ships, how they'd require all faction frig/cruiser/bs skills to a certain lvl to pilot, which i believe is fair. opinions?"
7/7/2010,"read this.this is an old idea, and not likely to be one we see getting implemented any time soon."
7/7/2010,since the csm has been removed for breaking the nda is it not logical for us to have another election?
7/7/2010,i know absolutely nothing about the csm. but i assume the runner up would get her spot.
7/7/2010,wut
7/7/2010,that'd be about as logical as talking about how ugly someone's baby is.
7/7/2010,only one member of the csm has been removed. and this is why we have alternates.
7/7/2010,"first of all i am aware there's another remove learning skills proposal by kaya divine, which as a far simpler solution i support. i decided to make another as it offers alternatives to what seems to be one of the biggest objections by those opposed to removal of learning skills, kaya's point number 1, that everyone gets +10, +10% to attributes (equivalent to current max learning skills). as well as addressing the claim by some to want ""strategy"" or more complexity in regard to skill training.kaya's points 2 and 3 remain the same in this proposal:2) learning skills are removed from the game.3) players are redeemed all the skill points invested in learning to train elsewhere.point 1) changes:1) players get +9 to attributes and no + percentage (probably slightly less than what the typical older player has now when you take the lack of 10% into account)1b) new skill added, advanced cyberneticsadvanced cybernetics allows the use of newly discovered takmahl cybernetic implants. requires cybernetics vskill level 1 allows the use of a 5 + 2% to attribute implantskill level ii allows the use of a 5 + 4% to attribute implantskill level iii allows the use of a 6 + 2% to attribute implantskill level iv allows the use of a 6 + 4% to attribute implantskill level v allows the use of a 6 + 6% to attribute implantmax advanced cybernetics + top tier implants will put a player at close to what max learning skills are now, - 4% bonus to attributes. this is a path for the wealthy and long term planner.(where these skills and implants come from isn't critical to the proposal, other than they be hard to get, rare, and therefore expensive).1c) new profession of implant harvesting combining with a sub profession of drug manufacturing to create learning booster drugsnew skill added takmahl drug manufacturinga skill that allows the manufacture of learning booster drugs from resources harvested from implants of corpses. higher skill allows for the manufacture of better boosters than lower skill.requires drug manufacturing vfound at archeology sites. new skill added implant harvestinga skill that allows the extraction of resources used in the making of learning booster drugs from the implants installed in the corpses of pod pilots. higher skill extracts more resources from a corpse's implants than lower skill.requires biology vfound at pirate faction lp stores. learning booster drugs* give anywhere from 4% to 24% temporary boost to an attribute for a period of 24 hours. * boosters of the same attribute type will not stack.* higher percentage bonus drugs require better resources, which in turn require corpses with better implants installed. (the exact quantity of corpses/implants required to manufacture a learning booster drug would need to be balanced in such a way to make intentionally podding alts an expensive proposition).legality: all learning booster drugs and their manufacture is considered such a heinous crime that concord has become directly involved and has taken a zero tolerance stance.* possession of either the drugs themselves or raw resources for making them in high security space will result in the seizure of the illegal items, the destruction of the ship carrying them by concord, and a security penalty on the pilot equivalent to have illegally podded another pilot.* pilots currently on learning booster drugs will be treated as if they are outlaws of the worst kind, forfeiting the protection of concord and subject to attack by concord in high security space as if they had -10 security rating. the standings are temporary, and the pilot will return to normal security standing once the effects of the drugs end and no more are taken.* harvesting of implants may only be done in a player controlled outpost or pirate controlled station with a medical bay.* manufacture of learning boosters is the same as regular boosters."
7/7/2010,"i don't think that the solution to the learning skills problem is by adding more skills. that includes advanced cybernetics, because everyone would have to train that in order to progress the same way everyone else does.as for the suggestion of learning boosters, if you think more about it you will see that this is buying skill points for isk. well, maybe not directly since you are boosting skill training time, but it's basically the same. the limitations you've mentioned would not stop the free and massive production and distribution of those boosters everywhere in game, including highsec. player have been and always will smuggle large quantities of illegal boosters deep inside highsec.i appreciate your effort, but i can't support your idea."
7/7/2010,"i like this idea. an additional thing about the ""salvaged implants"" would be the possibility to combine those, example: 4*+1 imp = +2 imp4*+2 imp = +3 imp4*+3 imp = +4 imp4*+4 imp = +5 imp"
7/7/2010,"perhaps, i for one would be satisfied with simply removing learning skills and giving +10 /10% to everyone's attributes or close to those numbers, and calling it a day. however, a significant minority strongly object to that solution, and proposal is an attempt at compromise. also, aiming to influence what i consider positive changes in other aspects of the game, rather than just having a shallow time sink like the current learning skills.the proposal is at it's heart more of a conceptual one, the details and numbers are flexible.goals:remove any pointless time sinks: done simply by removing learning skills and replacing them with both free bonuses and active/dynamic means of boosting attributes.not hurting the new player experience: new players get +9 to their attributes like everyone else, can slowly move up the cybernetics skills tree as they can afford the implants, and get learning boosters once they're ready to leave high sec. there's no artificial barriers any more to them to get in game and play it. giving the 5/5 learning skill people something that should appeal to them. advanced cybernetics isn't for everyone, i personally wouldn't train it very high if at all. like the current advanced learning skills it's a training investment that's only going to pay off in the very long term. however, now it's also tied into the market and has risk attached to it as well, as implants can be lost and are costly to replace.rewarding risk takers, getting more people out of high sec, and encouraging more pvp: that's what the learning boosters are about. one big problem i have with eve is that to advance your character you feel compelled to play it safe. well unless you plan on sitting your character in a low sec or nullsec station for the duration learning boosters require you live a little.. and maybe die a bit too. it's also another isk making avenue that for once can come from pvp, not just pve.the points you make are a concern, but i don't think it's as bad as you make out.it may well be possible somehow to smuggle these drugs into high sec, i'm not sure how myself, but i'll accept the possibility. however, i don't think that's a big problem, because unlike regular boosters with these the second you undock on these drugs, concord is going to blow up your ship and your going to take a huge security hit. given the drugs give a percentage bonus to attributes and it's only going to really impact learning time with regular consistent use, there's no big advantage by using these locked up in a high sec station.as to buying skill points with isk. i don't think this is the same. there's a limit to how much bonus you can get, there's risk involved, and it's tied to a limited resource (implants). in short in terms of isk for skill points it's not much different from attribute boosting implants.i didn't expect a lot of support. most players have rallied behind either keeping learning skills as they are or removing them and adding the 10/10% to everyone. there's not a lot of middle ground, and given ccp is more likely to go with something simple and easy than something complex like i've offered no ones likely to budge from those positions for now."
7/7/2010,"the t1 salvage prices are in a much better condition then the t3 salvage. so are the t1 ores. there has never been an 11,111 times difference in ores."
7/7/2010,"having perused the csm white pages, the restaffing of the csm alternates is not really mentioned - at least not clearly. i do believe that the csm needs all the alternates that it can muster. having looked at the attendance of the first three meetings, at least one alternate has been required in every meeting; in the first meeting two were required and only one attended. now with one alternate (mazzilliu) being promoted to full csm membership, i think it would behoove the csm to have a full cache of alternates at its disposal. especially since, of the remaining four alternates, there is a combined attendance of 3 meetings. as far as promotion, the most pragmatic approach would be to go off previous voting results, so the 15th place finisher would be the new alternate :smug:"
7/7/2010,supported.
7/7/2010,i approve of this handsome idea
7/7/2010,tl;dr supported cos elise is pr0
7/7/2010,"i, too, support this initiative."
7/7/2010,"if attendance turns out to be an issue, then ccp can look into this, same as they did in csm1. but mid-year promotions being a rule seems a bit silly. it should be a judgement call, imo."
7/7/2010,the colour of the planets in the scan feature (planet view mode) makes everything confusing.why mot make the planets black and white in scan? scan colours would be clearly visible.it would be like a real survey map!
7/7/2010,"blast, i'm not the first one.begone!nothing to see."
7/7/2010,"my proposal is to have a version of the primae that functions as a mobile customs office with the same functions and capacity for planetary material (25k m3).this serves three purposes, the first of which is giving the ship a real purpose to exist.secondly, instead of having to go to a stationary customs office that becomes a central hub for ganking you have a mobile platform that isn't quite as easy to ambush. this allows people to float cans far enough away from the warp-in point of planets to give them some reaction time to get out of harm's way in low sec.thirdly, i really dislike the idea of customs offices in wormholes. it makes a lot more sense that you'd have to bring your own facilities inside the wormhole."
7/7/2010,"i support this idea on the condition that you are forced to bring the primae on-grid with the planet's warpin pointonce on grid and out of warp, you can import/export materials just like you could from a planetary customs office.combined with a lack of planetary customs in wspace this would make a lot of sense rp-wise, as well as making things more interesting in lowsec."
7/7/2010,"without ganking, pi would and even more risk-free form of passive income.but it doesn't make sense to have customs offices wormholes so something needs to be done about them."
7/7/2010,"supported. although i believe 25k m3 is maybe a bit too much to ask for. to make this ship more vulnerable maybe add a contact timer, so it would require the mco (mobile customs office) to stay put for a certain amount of time before the load reaches the mco.just some ideas to balance things out"
7/7/2010,"i kinda agree with this.25k m3 is far too large though. maybe something smaller like 10-15k, making it a modified industrial hauler. also, give it a high-slot so cloaking can be done, but make it so that the ship cannot be cloaked when launching a container or retrieving one.overall, the primae was another of ccp's pattern - a great idea with faulty implementation. modifying it and releasing it on the open market would be a great thing."
7/7/2010,"a couple things...1) you'd have to be decloaked (if a cloak were ever an option) to send or receive.2) you'd have to be in orbit of the planet in question, though not necessarily at the wtz. requiring wtz proximity makes it no different than the customs gankfest. of course, you can always probe down the ship...3) you wouldn't have as much capacity. 25k is fine for an established satellite. but the ship should be smaller, so you're still inclined to use the customs now and then.as for wh mechanics, i agree that having customs is a bit odd. another odd thing, is the fees for transport. i pay to import, i pay to export... but where are those iskies going? it's not like we have regular convoys taking colonists back out to k-space."
7/7/2010,"supported in principle, but 25 thousand cubic meters might be a bit much. 20 thousand, perhaps? this would match the capacity of two planetside launchpads."
7/7/2010,"someone from the csm should remind ccp of a little expansion that a group of players created at the small vegas gathering last year...eve online: corruption.if none of you know what this is, i'll describe it a bit later on. i'm just throwing this out there"
7/7/2010,"so the back story to this is i logged in this morning to finish a mission i had not completed before having to leave town on a family emergency, and found that i got a mail within a second of logging on. ohnoes, my agent was angry with me. but amusingly, the system time (this is immediately after logging in, not long enough for local lag effects) is 10:39 and the mail time is 10:40. either me or my agent is a time traveler. and i've been ""ccp'd"" out of my standings.so one thing i've noticed is there's no consistency in rounding rules. some things get rounded up (or down if negative value) and other things don't. clearly the agents round up to the next minute. something that gets most of us fire in the real world. concord rounds down on sec status. you can't enter highsec once you hit a real status of -4.5 (and progressively up for the less negative sec statii (yeah, sure that's a word)). but faction police are lazy and they don't start pestering you until your faction stating hits a ""real"" -5.rounding should be consistent. across all the systems. there's already a lot of complexity in this game. i think we don't need fuzzy math for extra oomph on that =)"
7/7/2010,"that's stupid, make them all use the real values."
7/7/2010,you aren't risking anything more than the miners. if you aren't interested in leaving high-sec your income should be much lower than those that are.
7/7/2010,"not supported of course.btw, does somebody have a rough figure by how many % the isk/h income for missions decreased?"
7/7/2010,"pathetic, amongst the variety of things i do in eve i grind missions in hisec when i can't avoid it and the so called ""nerf"" has had a minimal effect on my or my corpies income from those missions. as to the risk with a properly fit ship there is no risk in hisec missions, unless you count the high possibility of falling asleep from boredom and waking up with a copy of the keyboard stamped across your face. if your having problems with missions diversify and find something more rewarding there is plenty out there to do."
7/7/2010,"and now having a conversation in local is impossible, meaning it might as well not be there."
7/7/2010,"unsupported.if this came in, all you'd see is vast hordes of pirates and their alts in noob ships (to pad the numbers high enough to cause a concord non-response) marching through high sec smashing everyone in sight, to hilarious results. and, unfortunately, account cancellations.and lastly, the ""safety level"" of a system would change on a constant basis. not everyone is able to just ""relocate"" on a whim to another location and still be able to play effectively. you'd be hurting those people's playstyles just to try and solve the jita problem indirectly, when you could just try and solve the jita problem directly."
7/7/2010,"also you say you want to 'destroy jita as the sole trade hub' rens, dodixie and amarr would like to have words with you,secondly jita evolved naturally due to a combination of central location, quality agents drawing in mission runners, in the early days ccp removed the belts, the agents and so forth but it was far too late jita has become a self sustaining phenomena, it was made by players and thus its part of the holy grail of ccp = player driven, stop trying to kill one of the demonstrations of natural economic development"
7/7/2010,so basically you want to move rens to ammol? and all the other tradehubs to other starting systems?dont really see the difference. also: leave low sec alone!
7/7/2010,"proposing a change to security status of systems is the oldest troll in this game. please try harder, your trolling is not creative."
7/7/2010,"this is it - the worst idea in the history of the assembly hall. in years to come your clone babies will ask you ""where were you when cifese made that ****ing awful proposal, daddy?"" and you can say ""i was there, son. i was there.""the horror.the horror."
7/7/2010,"agreed 100%pretty much anything where someone can damage you and you have no way to protect against is stupid imho.i killed the guy, i took heavy armor damage to do so and need the money to pay for it.also there is everyone saying ""go to lowsec"".guess what? i tried going to lowsec, and very quickly got multi-bs ganked. in high-sec i can actually get a fair fight with someone of equal size to me, much more fun that way.this, coupled with pitboss' earlier thread of neutral rrepping would fox high-sec pvp for me almost entirely.edit: apparently i already supported this thread earlier on."
7/7/2010,"but some of us make a very tidy living off the wrecks of the victim of gankers. they (the gankers) don't like it for obvious reasons, but it's seriously fun to do. but the really clever part is that with the game mechanics, i can reroll an industrial flying alt every day (no sec status hit you see) perfectly legally - so you'll never know if that empty speed fitted hauler sitting on the inbound path to a gate or on the undock to a station, is gonna snatch ya loot right from under your nose. nothing like ruining someone's day when they see that all that hard work goes to nothing as their juicy target ends up in someone else's hold. now those are very sweet tears to suck on."
7/7/2010,"i dont know why people are going to support this, it wont change. ccp has said before the wreck belongs to the victim and no one else, and who ever gets there first gets the spoils of war. and they already get flagged to that player who owns the wreck and the entire corp they belong to.sooooo......move along now, nothing to see here."
7/7/2010,"all good points that take my base problem identification and provides a more elegant solution. thanks for the input. need to rewrite this so it can be supportable. now, how to do it... hmm..."
7/7/2010,"/signed on the condition of aforementioned edit ;)although i remember reading something about injecting not-yet-trainable skills in one of the csm-ccp meeting minutes, and ccp's response was something along the lines of wanting to keep the character sheets consistent.tbh, i have on many occasions wished to have such a feature, but then again, i usually just queue up whatever is next in my plan and inject and queue the newly available skill when i log on next. so it is a bit annoying, but not terribly so."
7/7/2010,"| newtoday eva ""ankhesentapemkah"" jobse was removed from the council of stellar management due to a breach of the non-disclosure agreement (nda). we are deeply saddened but feel that it was the only possible solution in order to protect the integrity of the council of stellar management. as this is a matter regarding confidential data we do consider this to be a private issue between eva and ccp, therefore we are unable to comment further.evas response so far:further information:article on massivelyevas blognote: as has been stated by several csm members now, the critical stance in her blog and/or her blog have nothing to do with this. please keep the conversation civilized and do not spread more rumors."
7/7/2010,"so uh, since i was 15th does this mean i'm now an alternate 8)"
7/7/2010,i suppose some dev went emo about what she wrote in that blog?
7/7/2010,ye i'm gonna go ahead and say this was because she made the comment about ccp's position regarding them doing jack **** about fixing the game as shinies are more important to them.guess ccp don't read shc forums or anywhere else as mynxee and other csm's said exactly the same thing lol
7/7/2010,"inb4 ankh carebear white knight squ.... nvmi would hope she also got banned ingame aswell? need update, as anything less would be an injustice."
7/7/2010,why would she be banned in game? larkonis wasnt.
7/7/2010,"lark did get banned, it was just a 30-day."
7/7/2010,"haha, feels really good to hear. ccp now announce that you're gonna remove the learning skills and it will be the one of the most happy days ever!"
7/7/2010,"why would such a comment get her booted?every eve player who's been in game more than two expansions knows they release stuff half-done and never touch it again except (maybe) to shut off the isk faucet of farming (cosmos plexes, fw lp exploiting) without touching the core failures of the expansion.it's the life of eve."
7/7/2010,nap-c takes full credit for thisalthough more information would be nice br anyone?
7/7/2010,she was also so unfit for csm that it couldnt be any worse. perfectly she is gone. i hope she also get a ban!she was nothing buy a power hungry wannabee that lied and spammed en mass.
7/7/2010,"the csm white paper has been adjusted since then and it's not as if she enjoys the game ...they say immitation is the highest form of flattery and i, for one, welcome our new mazz overlord (how horribly ironic).in all seriousness i think everyone needs to chill the **** out until the facts are known."
7/7/2010,"my mistake (you can breath again, relax).as long as there is no reason given there is no reason to assume she did something worse than lark. maybe she was also asked to resign but refused. lark attempted to get ingame advantage using his csm info, if ankh just leaked something it isnt as bad imo. but that is pretty pointless speculation."
7/7/2010,removed personal attacks and spam.
7/7/2010,"ah, furb killer, always quick to jump the defend-ankh bandwagon.i for one am happy to say that i also do not know what she did and thus i cannot comment on whether it was 'worse' than what lark did. (apparently there is a clearly defined scale of those things somewhere, please point me to it!).in fact it doesn't matter what she did, the consequence is what matters."
7/7/2010,good question.i don't believe that happened during larkgate (best gate) but as csm5 still has 9 months left who knows what ccp will decide.
7/7/2010,"nice going ccp, so you are kicking out the only csm that actually dares to stand up for the playerbase, that doesn't just use the csm charade (because that's what it is) as a way to get a free trip to iceland, and for what? for actually trying to keep the community informed, for being the only one promote the transparency which was the whole point with the csm in the first place?and her replacement? another elitist pvp'er, the people that ccp so love to favor. the csm is a sham, a pr ploy and that's it, it's more obvious now than it ever has been before; ccp doesn't care about what the playerbase thinks, it's all just damage control from a terribly managed company with a serious lack of professionalism or business ethics. it's just sad to see good people who actually mean well get dragged into it and humiliated publicly in this manner. i fully expect this post to be deleted/censored, fully in line with ccp's policy to get rid of anyone/anything that doesn't blindly fanboi and defend them. removed discussion of moderation. zymurgist"
7/7/2010,or not.
7/7/2010,"i didnt know i had to post a full scale of possible actions and how bad i would think they are, before i get your permission to make a post. i am sorry for this oversight and will correct it next time.it seems pretty logical to me though, using the info for ingame advantage is worse for me than for example telling people ccp doesnt think fw is a problem if that was under nda. but like i already said, and apparently you missed (you honestly miss quite often stuff that is written), it is all pointless speculation."
7/7/2010,"in her blog, eva discusses measures that ccp are planing to implement to reduce lag. she mentions two specific actions that they are planing. since this is technical insider knowledge, i am pretty sure this is covered by the nda.you can read her blog at:"
7/7/2010,well thank god for that.
7/7/2010,"ehm in what way? she certainly doesn't represent my interests in any way, shape, or form, and doesn't in the slightest ""stand up for"" anything i'd like to take to or from the csm meetings.good. seems suitable, being a pvp game and all"
7/7/2010,the only players she represented are the whiny little carebears that have helped erode this game over the past couple of years...
7/7/2010,just a general fyi; she was *not* kicked over stuff mentioned in her csm blog.
7/7/2010,"actually, all that information is years old. it's been in ccp's development pipeline since about 2008. they had devblogs on it and i've mentioned it in articles i've written so it's all public knowledge."
7/7/2010,"my 10 dollars is on ""ankh throws spoons at people, how can we get rid of her subtly!? oh look! breach of nda!"" *punt*cleared a personal attack - adida"
7/7/2010,"you all realize that the csm is nothing more than a pr thing for ccp. i love ccp, i consider myself a fanboi, but in reality any type of player interaction on that kind of level is just a pr thing. will they use the interaction with the csm for planning development to some degree? yes. will it really make any huge difference in the direction of eve? not really.why would you sit there and bite the hand that feeds you so to speak and not expect consequences for it? it's not surprising she got booted, if i was ccp, i'd be kicking her to the curb too, it's bad pr to have crap like that said when you're supposed to be doing something to improve public relations for them.i would not be surprised if her ""observations"" on ccps attitude were a wee bit skewed anyways. ccp isn't some giant governemental agency out to oppress it's players etc...they will do what they need to do to produce a product that will garner more sales for them, that's the whole point of being an entertainment company. too many people treat gaming companies and developers like they are ""the man"" and do this angsty teen rebellion crap.she seemed pretty useless anyways.i would not be surprised if they ended up cancelling the csm soon and just rely on feedback from some of the more vocal and level-headed posters on the forums like a lot of gaming companies do. the csm was a good idea on paper, but from watching it here and there, i think it's turning into a pr disaster."
7/7/2010,"wow, not only is there some heavy drama within new eden currently, but on the csm too!listen, i've never been an ankh fan in general for the csm, however, i do hope this has nothing to do with her blog summarizing the summit. if so, that's kinda petty. that being said, i don't know all the facts, and she does have a tendency to say stuff that perhaps she shouldn't on other occasions, so who knows what she said when... we'll just have to wait and see if any further info comes out. whatever the case, it seems as though her longtime reign in the csm has come to an end.although i didn't want you on the csm in the first place, you did put a lot of effort and time into your campaign, so i will say, i'm sorry ankh. bummer."
7/7/2010,"thanks. i am a bit surprised actually, since that was the first mention of those specific actions that i have seen, and yes i do read the devblogs, especially the technical ones.i am guessing some of the wild rumours that have been flying around has some truth to them after all. :)"
7/7/2010,this is very much like an old school totalitarian purge. yesterday's hero is today's enemy of the people and the trial already ended with a guilty verdict. you'd better not ask for what crime or you'll get the knock on the door in the middle of the night too.
7/7/2010,that was one. if i'm lucky it'll be two.
7/7/2010,"this.i don't actually dislike her, but if you agree to a nda than it seems reasonable, that you get into trouble if you break it. if ccp can't trust her, she really had no future as a csm member and put the need to tell about the things she heard above presenting the people who voted for her."
7/7/2010,who's this yesterday's hero you're talking about?
7/7/2010,"if you have evidence that ankh didn't breach the nda, that's one thing. otherwise, you're defending her purely based on her personality, which is immaterial here (either way).i also take issue with your assertion that the other csms don't ""stand up for the playerbase"". her decision to promote her own personal csm wiki rather than work with others, by the way, is the opposite of transparency."
7/7/2010,justice was done today. i wish to thank ccp for the removal of this unsavory candidate.
7/7/2010,"perhaps ccp was going to implement a new turret that launched spoons, and her chucking it at a meeting was breaching the nda?humor aside, i feel this is a good change to the csm."
7/7/2010,it sounds like you know what was breached and through saying what that information is not you have narrowed the search space and through that also disclosed confidential information thereby breaching the nda yourself.
7/7/2010,"well this was an obvious conclusion since multiple csm members posted the sentiments that were echoed in her blog, so no, i am not breaking the nda here. in fact we aren't being told anything either so i'm in the dark as much as you."
7/7/2010,about time dam time ankhesentapemkah got kicked. and yes - my lvl 120 legendary paladin helmet allows me to see through the laughable attempts to defend by ankhesentapemkah white knights.
7/7/2010,"everyone knows the csm is a waste of time, ccp spending subscription money on shipping some players to iceland instead of buying better hardware and improving the game especially in 0.0."
7/7/2010,^ what the wise man said.
7/7/2010,"she leaked information about mechanical parts, apparently something that will cause a huge price spike for those."
7/7/2010,"i've been one of ankh's harshest critics, but i have got to say this rubs me the wrong way. we have no idea what kind of material ankh released, no idea how serious the nda breach was, no idea about anything, really. to be perfectly frank it looks as though ccp is trying to intimidate the csm after the disaster that was the iceland summit. ccp, we need details. you cannot simply fire a player-elected representative without explaining to us what the hell is going on.well, i guess you can--but it won't make you look very good."
7/7/2010,"smoothly done, that man."
7/7/2010,"is p.obvious that it was a hell of a lot more serious then larkonisgate as ccp havn't released any info.i'm under the assumption that she leaked subscriber info or game plans to another company, rather then messing around with the balance of eve (market manipulation lol)wouldnt be suprised if ankh finds herself in ""real"" trouble if this is the case.ps did i say lol arleady, roll on t'amber for a sub."
7/7/2010,"everyone already suspected that ccp has been doing nothing nothing nothing about performance issues on the server.issues we've had since december.code problems that somehow were to be fixed with a networking upgrade? (lol)i've had this rotting feeling in my gut that it wasn't that ccp didn't want to fix the problem, it's that they have no one there that can, that actually knows how. and they dont! all the people that know code are off working on some other ******ed project. so here we are 7 months out from the beginning of the problems, and likely another 7 months before you (ccp) even attempts to address the problem. (..carry the 2) i'm supposed to shell out literally hundreds of dollars in subscription to a game you bastards know isn't going to work at any given time and take dust and incarna development as my reconciliation?????how about noseriously, have you not heard at all that the vast majority of your players want function over form! we want to be able to play eve. #1 first and foremostwe do not care about shiny this and that crap, are you lot ******ed? how can you have such a massive amount of fail priorities!?!?i shouldn't be surprised, i'm sure some 'manager' that gets paid too much to think about things he knows nothing about has ordered full steam ahead on development of new features.that nice steady incline of customers you've seen? wait till they realize you care less about retaining them and more about attracting more new ones.i'm having real trouble justifying my account payments now. i do not want to quit eve, but if this is the only option i have left to voice my opinion then what else should i do.it's not like you lot are listening. fix the ******* game. it's that simple. it's not like we aren't used to waiting for features long after their promised (or never get delivered at all) at the end of the day we want to be able to play the ******* game.find the idiot that thinks new shinys are good idea and wants to blame csm people for telling the truth when his stupid ideas are ruining eve and have them read this post. then try to convey to him just how many of his customers feel the exact same way."
7/7/2010,"now come mynxee, socratez, teadaze and traebor didn't get kicked as well then?"
7/7/2010,what is this larkonisgate thing? back from when apoc came out and gates went ******ed? i didn't pay attention to csm until recently.
7/7/2010,"well all know ccp is all about the integrity of their various relationships with the players so this is no surpriselol, for real. why not just say they booted her cause they felt like it? ccp doesn't give a crap about the csm or the average player either, everyone knows that. they aren't ""protecting"" anything other than their own butthurt feelings probably"
7/7/2010,sup bro.agreed and fixed.
7/7/2010,"larkonis trassler was in the csm.after a meeting with ccp where they announced the complete revamp of the t2 material requirements, he bought a ****load of technitium, aka inside trading. although he said he had looked at the market and saw a big spike in demand, so assumed the secret was already out.he was forced to resign."
7/7/2010,"let's hope sok get's sacked too yes, he can't stop screaming on the net about how he doesn't take his csm job 'super serious' and stuff like that..."
7/7/2010,"trust, as we learn playing eve, is a difficult thing...i can't really say i'm sorry to see eva go, as i didn't get along with her really well... however i'm very sad this happened to the csm.most of us on the csm are people with whom ccp has learned to dialog with, and the newest additions (mynxee and trebor) fared well in that regard.anything that undermines ccp's ability/propension to have open and honest discussions with us annoys me.i don't know what eva did. what i do know however is that it's different from larkonis. larkonis got drunk, ****ed up, and admitted it to ccp, he got offered the chance to resign, and he took it.eva seems to be a different thing altogether, since she got booted, and didn't resign... what for? i have no idea... maybe we'll know, maybe we won't."
7/7/2010,"i'm fairly sure she wasn't representing you and your ilk, so what you say can't be true."
7/7/2010,"it wasn't tech. it was in fact something that went down in value post dominion :sadtrombone: and no specific details of changes (moongoo or otherwise) were released to us. the spike was caused by a (rather rich) corpmate of mine acting on his own to try and manipulate the market for that particular good (he wasn't aware of anything that i knew), hard to believe i know, but trust me on this. in my semi inebriated state i put two and two together, got 5 and foolishly acted."
7/7/2010,"mostly this. shame it had to happen two years in a row. as a player i appreciate the attempts of ccp to create a channel to the player base, even though it does not result in any immediate/visible changes."
7/7/2010,"or maybe she got the option to resign and didnt take it?but dont let me stop the speculation.btw, open and honest discussion? does it really matter if ccp tells you open and honest they completely ignore the csm instead of lying about it?"
7/7/2010,"seems i was wrong in assuming why she got booted, but still, the csm is a good idea on paper, horrible pr disaster in reality.ccp would be better off courting certain players and reading their own forums (which they do actually read the forums :p) than trying this csm garbage. the biggest problem with the csm is it is putting inflated expectations out there that just simply won't be met. people's imaginations on what kind of impact the csm will have on development went wild, now it's just breeding annimosity from what i can see.the biggest problem with involving players at the level of the csm is many of them are not software developers (even though everyone that plays mmos claims to be one). there is a lot to software development and maintenance that the average player doesn't understand, and won't understand, no matter how many times you explain it. they percieve the explanations as apathy rather than actual limitations of what can be done in the immediate future, and most gamers can't think past the next month in most cases."
7/7/2010,doesn't she work for another game development company? seems like that would/should disqualify you from the get go.not surprised on this one.
7/7/2010,this is an unfortunate occurance. also this would make mazzilliu csm member.
7/7/2010,"so she got kicked for breaching the nda with her inconvenient blog, but she's not the only csm to write a blog. so we must wonder why she has been singled out. to bystanders (i voted for some body else) this looks like the hate campaign succeeded.i guess those haters gotta hate"
7/7/2010,violating a nda in a serious manner as a game designer is pretty much career suicide.
7/7/2010,"when in the course of typical mmo asshattery it becomes necessary for a developer to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with an elected player representative, a decent respect for the opinions of said electorate requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."
7/7/2010,not only that but she lists ccp as her employer on her c.v cleared baseless personal attack - adida
7/7/2010,that won't look good on her cv.
7/7/2010,"need more information on why the nda was breached. i don't know ankh or really have a position one way or the other, but given she seems to be unpopular there's always going to be an undercurrent of this being done politically rather than due to an actual breach.please give more info when its possible to do so."
7/7/2010,qft. i don't like ankh but we deserve to know why she got booted.
7/7/2010,good riddance to bad rubbish.
7/7/2010,i was always wondering why he kept disappearing into those hidden bunkers at night!
7/7/2010,"hmm, sounds like someone does know."
7/7/2010,"no we don't, since there's nothing anywhere that stipulates we have the right to. in fact, the opposite is more likely true."
7/7/2010,"i don't particularly like the way ankh does things or the way it's reported she was acting at the summit but this just seems too convenient to me tbh, right after ccp gets bad press from the csm the one who wrote the first blog against them suddenly has some 2 year old nda breach noticed and actioned against, thats some awesome timing right there tbh"
7/7/2010,i've not yet blogged about the summit in any detail because i'm waiting for the official minutes (so i can pick them to bits). i felt it was a bad idea to do so however it doesn't appear to be the cause of the nda issue.it would be nice if ccp would clarify the situation a bit because the lack of details are just causing more wild speculation...
7/7/2010,"if this occurred well before she took office, why the hell was she allowed to take office in the first place? actually, i guess i just answered my own question, they didn't bother to look."
7/7/2010,"bolded for those with selective reading habits ;) i've read the blogs from the various csm delegates during and since the summit. nothing eva's blog or anyone else's contained any new information that would constitute a breach of the nda. furthermore, the release from wrangler says *specifically* confidential data was involved. this tells me she got her hands on something she wasnt supposed to and action is being taken either because of what she got, how she got it, or what she did/was planning to do with it.i really dont think ccp would outright remove someone from csm because they talked about something in the minutes before they came out or something like that. lark f'd up and essentially committed insider trading due to his foreknowledge of game changes. it's not clear what ankh did to get removed, but it must have been considerably more serious than telling people stuff they already knew on her blog. in any case, i hope all the ""take care"" supporters take care to be more responsible in the candidates they support going forward."
7/7/2010,"can we get some kind of information other than ""she violated the nda and was removed""? i mean, i don't particularly like what she wants to implement at all but if any csm member can get removed like that with, with almost no explanation whatsoever, it doesn't bode well for the future...can't believe i'm sticking up a bit for ankh."
7/7/2010,perhaps it took place before she took office and ccp just found out? huh? but that wouldn't fit the ccp/csm haterz plot to vilify both..best to wait on an official report before putting your foot in it... hmmmm
7/7/2010,"we do know.it was for nda violations. that's all we're going to get, most likely."
7/7/2010,are you ****ing serious?
7/7/2010,that's what i said . i think a background check should be done for each and every csm candidate as thoroughly as possible. it is a liaison position after all.
7/7/2010,ccp while you have ur boots on you should fire sok.....why don't you just clean house and start over
7/7/2010,wish i had voted for ankh... then i could claim i knew the future and saw this coming and used it forthe lulz
7/7/2010,"omg she said she was in the csm on her cv, get to the forum mobile!!!!11!!1what exactly is the point? that on a document on her personal internet site she calls it employment history and not something else?"
7/7/2010,so do you white knight often or just for ankh?
7/7/2010,"so, when are you having the talk about working at ccp, or have you had it already"
7/7/2010,"that document, my friend is a curriculum vitae, also known as a resume to our yank brethern.... she lists ccp as her employer.. you know as in she works there and gets paid, and that isn't kosher."
7/7/2010,such a coincidence...yeah right. out and out powerplay by ccp. reknowned for their love of constructive criticism as they are. blog as a cause? rofl. i think standing up to ccp is more than enough for this to happen. sacking a member for a 2 year old offence? don't make me laugh.sacking the csm with the 2nd highest vote? p***taking of the highest order. nice one ccp. you've just spectacularly lost any confidence i may have retained in you.check this well considered response and continue to watch this space for further infoz. i expect the next few weeks to be quite eventful. unfortunately.personal attack removed. zymurgist
7/7/2010,not sure about other countries? but i believe i am right in saying in the uk at least lying on your cv is against the law?
7/7/2010,"removed an image that revealed personal data - adidain that case btw furb, since i had lunch at starbucks today, i am the ceo of starbucks now."
7/7/2010,it's all a conspiracy of the anti-ankh-sentiment-bandwagon!!!!!!
7/7/2010,"actually it's standard practice to list ""voluntary"" work on your cv under employment and as it clearly states in the cv you linked it's non profit ie voluntary in those posts so there is nothing wrong with her cv altho it's a really ****ing ugly layout on that website"
7/7/2010,edit: nm i saw her full resume...
7/7/2010,"more plausible explanation than being fired for posting identical information that other csm members wrote about.but i think it's clear ccp hates us all. i've gathered that by reading this thread. some parents beat their kids, ccp allows lag to occur in a 1600 ship system. i feel like this frog to ccp's monkey all too often these days. we live in dark times, gentlemen."
7/7/2010,ding dong the witch is dead..
7/7/2010,"she just said she was in the csm, she was. i wont stop you if you say you had lunch at starbucks on your cv.on mine i also got an internship listed under employment history, still waiting on the cops coming to get me..."
7/7/2010,"although ccp said it was confidential stuff i'd still like an explanation. preferably no more then two words, just to stomp out the bushfire of speculation. ""not spoongate"" would be fine. otherwise people will (and already have) just go zomg ceeceepee powertrippin' and that would be bad."
7/7/2010,"except that you never list them as employer, since they are not, and implying they are is as far as i am aware actually illegal here. ... and especially not don when you work in game design and then get booted for nda breach, after visiting a well established software house and being given access to sensitive materials there effectively committing career suicide."
7/7/2010,"you would list voluntary under another heading like ""hobbys"" or even ""voluntary work"" rather than ""employment"" like she did.if she were to get a job with a uk based company with that cv then she would be in serious trouble. getting a job by lying on your cv is a criminal offence under the fraud act."
7/7/2010,massively has posted an article on this (wow they're quick):
7/7/2010,cv? speak english!!!! it's called a resume.
7/7/2010,"this is all speculation until we know something concrete. for example, it is quite common for whistle-blowers to be scapegoated, and for pretexts to be used to eliminate those who are unpopular with those in power. or if as dierdra says, this violation of the nda occurred before csm5, then it may not even be relevant to her serving in that capacity. for instance, she might be banned from the game for a time, but still fulfill her responsibilities on the csm5. and then again, ank might have done something seriously wrong and deserve to be removed. i'd like to suggest we hold off from arguing the pros and cons of ank herself. we've been through that before and it does no one any good. i do appreciate the fair mindedness of many of you who have opposed ank in the past, but recognize there are larger issues at stake here. i'd also like to urge the members of the csm to take a step back from editorializing, and focus on ensuring that a fellow member of the csm was treated fairly and with respect. this matters as much for you and future members of the csm, as it does for ank. recall that the csm was formed because of ccp's serious issues with a perceived lack of transparency, accountability and fairness. ank's removal concerns all of us. for the time being, we should all focus on getting a straight answer from ccp as well as ank herself.delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/7/2010,"and an even more plausible explanation is that she posted information that the other csm members were sensible enough to keep to themselves, in accordance with the nda. if you're going to spell it that way, at least put the diacritics in there so it can't be confused with something that continues"
7/7/2010,"you are seriously deluding yourself if you believe that.she was in the csm, she has that on her cv. that it might be in wrong area is not something the cops (or anyone else) give a crap about. one google by a potential employer shows what the csm is, if he is too lazy to do that it also isnt relevant."
7/7/2010,"a shame to see her removed, it was nice to have variety on the csm.kinda fitting that we have a bunch of clones on there now though"
7/7/2010,"in fact it's called a ""r<U+FFFD>sum<U+FFFD>"" and it's a french word :)"
7/7/2010,infact it's called a curriculum vitae
7/7/2010,no matter what she did ankh clearly thought she was above the law or at the very least thought she could get away with it. good riddance.
7/7/2010,eva's reaction:
7/7/2010,i knew it was a mistake to let such a fractious personality 'represent the people'. looks like i was correct.'take care' ankh.
7/7/2010,"you are posting rubbish, fyi.and so are you. my blog posts were online before hers, and i voiced the same sentiments that she did, so that was *not* what she was removed for."
7/7/2010,"this sucks ccp. if you don't respect the vote of the playerbase and kick csm members for flimsy reasons, you should finish this ludicrous project completely, or at least stop calling it ""democracy""."
7/7/2010,"even if the logs show nothing, this is one ship^ht loss i'll happily accept.can we have maz back now :).move along now, nothing too see here."
7/7/2010,"to be honest, i'm quite surprised her working for a separate gaming entity, small or not, didn't bar her from running in the first place. as that could have been easily considered a conflict of interest."
7/7/2010,"i say good riddance.it didn't take a lot of research into her character to see she wasn't fit for the job. a particular chat log where she completely loses her cool over interweb spaceships and makes personal attacks comes to mind... i believe it was covered in one of a few threads about her prior to the csm election.for those of you who voted for her, sorry you threw away your votes. pay more attention next time."
7/7/2010,"this, tbh. it's a shame that instead of voting for a valid candidate, so many people threw their votes away. ah well... sometimes you have to cut off your nose to spite your face, i guess."
7/7/2010,"that's bullcrap, and you should know that. csm was created to create transparacy and an insight into ccp after the t20 incident. internal affairs is just as shady as ccp's behaviour themselves. if this particular case is one where we don't need details, as it might harm the development of the game, that should be put forward more straight up.having a nda for the csm is just wrong by it's own tbh, since that kills the whole idea of transparacy. and a csm without it's original role, just turn into a pr trick for ccp and a big waste of money that could be better spent, no? that's another discussion, tho.hell, you even see csm candidates asking ccp to tell us more on this particular matter."
7/7/2010,"i'm betting her work on the csm will no longer appear on her resume. oh and miyamoto isoruku you are an ank fanboy. true to ank fanboy style, you are just trying to deny it."
7/7/2010,"candidates (who thus did not get elected) have no special privileges beyond those of any other eve player. csm members likely find these things out as quickly as anyone else, and ankh claims she will say more tomorrow."
7/7/2010,"ugh, i knew i'd write one word wrong and have some english talking kid hit me in the head.mom!"
7/7/2010,if her blog is even 50% accurate then the csm is nothing more than a trip to iceland.
7/7/2010,if your statement was 50% accurate then...wait nvm
7/7/2010,"confirming that free trips to iceland to talk about internet spaceships is srs business.so serious, it would look good on your r<U+FFFD>sum<U+FFFD>"
7/7/2010,"spoke to her in iceland a little during fanfest '09, she seemed alright and perfectly civil when not talking about eve.sadly she's one of those people who hasn't got a damn clue about eve, how it works, or the vision for the future.glad she's off the csm tbh, for the best part her ideas and input were horrendous."
7/7/2010,marked for deletion - adida
7/7/2010,im not defending ank----- at all.but this does draw attention to how unrepresentaive the csm are of the player base.the organized minority of serious corps/alliances dominate the csm pool but they are actually a minority of totalplayers. most players play a game specifically avoiding large organizations that remind them of real life jobs.
7/7/2010,"haha, you do bring up a good point about large orginazations reminding people of real life jobs. probably why i'm still part of a smaller corp :p"
7/7/2010,the csm is representative of the population who bothered to vote.
7/7/2010,"i voted for ankh and no i am not a carebear, and yes i actually know a few things about eve.but for lack of representation for high sec dwellers that atleast had some commitment i voted for ankh.call me a fool or whatever, but having representation of only 0.0 stakeholders and 'or their pets on the csm hardly reflects the playerbase.it's now easy to sling more dung like finnagain loves to do and some other people in this thread.but untill ccp actually grasps their own balls and acts on the transparancy they claim to work towards to it's all guessing work.nobody knows why ankh got booted from the csm and the few that do hush up as tight as possible because else they find themselves in the same position.ccp should at the very least clarify if this nda breach was in regards with the current csm or as claimed by others towards something of 2 years ago.so actually the ball is in ccp's courtyard and people can hatemonger or white knight as much as they want. it still remains rumour and speculation."
7/7/2010,this process is being handled exceptionally poorly.
7/7/2010,"since ank is in this field i wouldn't expect much info. her career may suffer by saying the wrong thing. this means she will shut up. ccp could get sued for libel if they misspeak. i think ccp was hoping for ank to be more forthright (like larkonis was) on how things went down. that didn't happen so i bet both sides clam up publicly, rattle sabers at each other privately until they can negotiate an agreement or ank files suit for libel. sure as a player i want to know more, but its unlikely."
7/7/2010,marked for deletion - adida
7/7/2010,shh be careful what you are writing about. big brother is watching. just look how many times they changed inconvenient posts.you have a choice - get a full time job in 0.0 or shut up - this is how this 'democracy' works ;/
7/7/2010,"it reflects the part of the player base that cares about what goes on with the development in the game (and who think that they can have any kind of influence on what ccp rolls out).if they don't care, they well don't care, so it doesn't matter that they aren't represented."
7/7/2010,"wtf ccp?ankh csm, best csm!also, who read blogs?"
7/7/2010,"you've never looked up the definition of the word ""irony"", eh?"
7/7/2010,"ow, so only the pvp player's of eve that are stakeholders in 0.0 or their pets care about what goes on in eve?talk about narrowminded.if you have absolute and irrefutable proof that high sec dwellers have no love for eve and don't care about eve and it's progress then please put that forward.if you can't produce such proof doesn't this statement of your's qualify you as a classic troll then?"
7/7/2010,wrongits representative of groups who voted in blocks. learn to think.
7/7/2010,they live in highsec.
7/7/2010,empire simply has to vote for a better candidate next time.
7/7/2010,"nope, even though english is like my third language i don't need to sit with a dictionary at the pc as some others.plus i copy paste in general only whole comments to respond to and not partial clips to better suit my purposes."
7/7/2010,nothing good will ever come from empire.nothing.
7/7/2010,"there are plenty of good 'carebear' candidates, you just need to look a bit further than the first forcefed propaganda video."
7/7/2010,"how about the fact that, in spite of their supposed numerical superiority, they apparently only managed to get one representative onto the csm?as for narrow-minded, i noticed that you only picked up on one part of what i said, when it could reasonably be suspected that the other part is more indicative of why the representation looks the way it does"
7/7/2010,"csm has no more details than you guys do. until ccp or eva choose to share more about the situation, there's a real danger of wild speculation leading to insanely wrong conclusions. while ""what if's"" and ""i betcha's"" are fun, they are often inaccurate.eva's contributions to the june summit were positive and useful (the triviality of ""spoongate"" aside). i think once the minutes are published, you'll see that this is true. by the way, the minutes have been reviewed/edited by csm and are back in ccp's hands. i understand we'll have the opportunity for a second ""approval"" review once ccp has finalized their review and further edits. we all apologize for the minutes taking so long, but it was a lot of hours of meetings covering a lot of territory and we're all interested in making sure that the minutes provide the player base with a good sense of what went on during the meetings. the draft i submitted to ccp after csm revisions were done was something like 32 pages."
7/7/2010,i should apply for csm as a carebear candidate. -liang
7/7/2010,"i'm a highsec dweller not involved in large corps, blah blah blah...vote for me next time if i bother to run"
7/7/2010,"as much as i would like to see this occur, who's to say that ankh will not completely exclude the choice bits of info which put her in this current negative light to begin with? i'd like two sides to this story, so somewhere in the middle the truth can be found.yea, yea /tinfoilhat"
7/7/2010,"please, for gods sake, don't lump all highsec dwellers, we aren't all ""carebears"", we aren't all afraid of pvp and we aren't all failed pies like the flipers & greifers.we all didn't vote for ank either. my votes went on ""abstain"" and will continue to do so until i see a candidate that suits my industrialist/fw gamestyle."
7/7/2010,"this is actually quite funny, seeing as everyone in eve comes form empire. however it is quite true."
7/7/2010,awesome
7/7/2010,"fair enough  after all, i did the same, for much the same reason.still, the point remains: the csm representation comes from those parties who take and interest in, and who believe they can influence, the route ccp will take. i seem to recall that our ""abstain"" votes didn't account to much  certainly not enough to put anyone in the running  and the vote itself covered every kind of reaction from ""no suitable candidate"" to ""scrap csm"", so i'm doubtful it would have made any difference even if a good candidate did exist.either way, the core complaint here is that ""onoz, highsec lost its only csm"", which, as you point out, is just bunk because she didn't represent highsec."
7/7/2010,"welcome to democracy 101 aka poll riggingimagine you have 10,000 voters and 10 candidates. the population is split into roughly 50/50 between city folks and country folks. the country folks are split into five regions. each region has one candidate for elections, while the city has 5. there is room for 6 candidates in government. each country region will get a candidate in, but the vote for city candidates gets spread out between the lot of them - only made worse by the fact that some city folk are also hobby farmers so they vote for a country region candidate.if there had only been two city candidates instead of 5, the two candidates could have easily taken two seats in government.choice is bad, m'kay?"
7/7/2010,"i would apply for a csm 'carebear' position, if i had the time(6year+ eve carebear, lol)i`m known by a few, but whether it would be enough??those of you who think carebears have no place as csm, are rather narrowminded (i admit i`m a carebear, but that does not mean i cannot change roles?..i have enough sp to do that quite easily)"
7/7/2010,"no offence, but democracy is a very broken goverment mechanics.sadly the best of all tried so far."
7/7/2010,"no, that's the point. of course 'bears have a place on the csm, a very necessary place. but rather than electing a viable candidate who'd look out for their interests, the voters voted for someone who was known to be unstable and unqualified. people get the leaders they vote for, unfortunately. hopefully next cycle we can get a really solid 'bear or two onto the csm who's willing to work with other play styles and who knows what the game is about."
7/7/2010,"are you commenting on the western world, or eve-online? i'm asking because your post has no relevance to eve"
7/7/2010,"no matter what ccp says regarding ""you're now stakeholders!"", the truth is, you're not. you're consumers with a voice. if they choose to listen to your voice, then yes, the csm gets things accomplished. if they choose not to, then no, they won't.ccp is a privately held company, which means that a closed person or group of individuals gets to make all the big decisions, and if they want, all the little ones too. as a business that now has at least three products either released or in the pipeline (not including anything white wolf may or may not publish, which is a gripe from white wolf customers), eve's priority may not be #1. and saying ""stakeholders"" just really means that you're people with an interest in what ccp decides to do. while you can vote with your feet if it gets too bad, you don't really have any power beyond that threat. and there's no reason that you should be surprised if things change in ways you are opposed to them changing. if ccp were publicly traded, a player might amass a significant portion of stock and demand actual changes in priority or business method. (in fact, there are some players that have significant resources and might be more than happy to do so... sadly, i am not one. if you can, give me moneys. or a job. or something.) ahem.when i say three products, i don't refer to incarna either. dust is a separate product, eve is another, and the mysterious but heralded world of darkness mmo is the third.personally, i think it pretty much sets the tone when the csm doesn't have a chance to at least say hello to the ceo. sure, he's busy, but doesn't everyone want to meet a real viking giant?"
7/7/2010,"kick everyone off the csm. next year, instead of buying airplane tickets for worthless csm candidates, ccp buys a pool table for their offices. it would be money better spent."
7/7/2010,"i been voting they put a beer fountain in the lobby.brought that up as soon as the announcement of csm. if they're gonna throw away rl money, at least do it in style."
7/7/2010,"not everyone who lives in highsec votes for ankhe. i got many carebear votes (i'm a carebear), as did teadaze and dierdra, at the very least... highsec proposals are not going to fall on the wayside because the one <expletive removed> member.actually this should be better without her in the way to emorage on every highsec proposal, that's my opinion."
7/7/2010,"yah, but you're a modified carebear."
7/7/2010,"next election i may put myself forward for csmi admit i`m a carebear, but i also understand many other careers, as i have been playing eve nonstop since early 2004i admit i`m fallible, and will listen to all sides in any argument...but that is a long time away"
7/7/2010,"did you really use the word ""danger?"""
7/7/2010,you really should.
7/7/2010,"absolutely, this."
7/7/2010,"this ^^but in all seriousness, it's a tax write-off anyways, at least in the us it would be, so really no real money is being spent in the long run, a beer fountain though, i think would be a wee bit difficult to write off on your taxes lol."
7/7/2010,lo ****ing l...you better be ****ing kidding me! that is quite pathetic actually.
7/7/2010,"representation. anything goes there, extra good for bar tabs. in all seriousness, does anyone take csm serious? because seriously, that'd be quite hilarious."
7/7/2010,"lots of game companies do almost exactly what the csm does, but they don't hold elections for it, you get in ""the program"" from your history interacting with the developers, which is where ccp should take their csm deal. soe has a group of players similar to the csm, but they were picked by community reps for the respecitve games, and no, the people in those ""focus groups"" aren't all the ass-kissers on the forums."
7/7/2010,"ccp should also dump any csm member who makes personal public attacks against other csm members. this undermines the csm in general and makes the whole thing look like more of a joke than it already is. and maybe screen for ***holes while they're at it, and people who make a complete mockery of the process. and if thats not possible, just dump the whole csm thing.there are a few csm members who conduct themselves in an adult, semi-professional, appropriate manner. some of these other jokers just f everything up. while ccp could benefit from the input of a group that represents large swaths of the player base, what ccp (or the players) don't need is representation from the chuckleheads that lurk in the game."
7/7/2010,does it really matter? this csm is a bigger joke than the rest.
7/7/2010,i've abstained on all my chars every single csm it's a joke
7/7/2010,"meissa, please give some thought before posting denigrating comments about other members of the csm. speculation combined with animus only reflects badly on you. mynxee has scolded you before for this (e.g. spoongate), and many of us expect better from you as one of our csm representatives. if it is helpful, consider ccp fallout's words on a related matter of trolling. delilah wildfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/7/2010,"could be me, but according to massively, eva responded that ""i do not share ccp's conclusion that there has in fact been an nda breach"". so...who has the popcorn? unsalted please!;-)"
7/7/2010,"i love watching delilah and finn. one's rabidly for ankh, the other is rabidly against. maybe one day they'll fall madly in love in spite of their political differences and get married or something. feel good romantic drama of the year!so, initial reaction: hahaha, oh wow.secondary reaction:if this were anybody else on the csm, i wouldn't so much as bat an eyelid. but the fact that it's ankh makes me suspicious. not suspicious that she did something evil or vile, but suspicious that this is just a simple nda breach. it could be just a complete coincidence that the most talked about and controversial csm member got blasted for an nda breach.personally, i don't believe in coincidence."
7/7/2010,"ok so we going to lose ankha from the csm she had the second greatest number of votes , with no alliance/corp block vote supporting her. most of her votes gained by campaining.in her place we get mazzilliu, voted in with an alliance block vote.she tried to campaign on the low sec vote ( showed she had no clue about how low sec worked.)her alliances low sec involvement appears to be dropping super caps on a few bs, or smaller ships , for risk free ganks.made a cheesy campaign video that basically said `look at me i am a girl , vote for me`posted on the pl forums that she is not ugly, fat , or stupid so deserves votes (its worth getting a copy of her post )personally i dont think this will be improving the csm in any way shape or form."
7/7/2010,"imho, the whole csm should be re-run, with bloc-voting disallowed"
7/7/2010,"i guess ccp don't like hearing the truth.however, her evemailing spamming was frustrating around csm election. she should of been globally muted for the spam."
7/7/2010,"hold on - this is a csm member being removed, not just a player of eve. the csm is *meant* to represent us, the players. if one them gets removed then we're entitled to a reason why. ccp declared the csm as a transparent, player-elected body. thousands of people voted for this person and they deserve to be informed why she's being removed? ccp = transparent as long as they look good"
7/7/2010,"good. seems suitable, being a pvp game and all it's not just a pvp game, it's a sanbox. you play your way, let the rest of us play our way."
7/7/2010,how would you do that?
7/7/2010,"well presumably in ky vatta bizarro-world, alliance members are disenfranchised."
7/7/2010,"you must be joking. how would you even define a powerblock? also why would you do this?bloc-voting is a consequence of democracy and the mindset of most votes - ""he's our guy"", rather than ""this candidate seems fit"". there's no way to prevent it while preserving the democracy."
7/7/2010,"qft. i've never seen anhk in game and i have zero knowledge of what her position on pve etc was, but the megahatred of her on these forums seems, from my perspective, to be totally over the top. if she messed up and broke the nda, then it's her problem and ccps. since it was an nda violation, i doubt we'll ever find out what it was. she seems pretty obstinate, though, from all i've read about her, so i don't imagine she'll quit the game, unless ccp boot her out. she could, however, if she's clever (not that she seems to be) sue ccp for allowing the mass mobbing that has been going on against her in the forums. the courts seem to take these things seriously these days.i think i need some popcorn and beer. this is better than the world cup."
7/7/2010,"hi black, i've said this in other ways, but it bears repeating. i am not rabidly for ank. yes, my thoughts on the games principles and mechanics often align with hers, and thus are at odds with the views of others. still, i suspect most of us share a greater measure of agreement than disagreement over eve. moreover, were i to have my druthers, i'd like us to find ways to benefit all the sectors of eve. there are certainly many great ideas out there, from carebears and pirates and the alliance blocs. indeed, were the angels of our better natures to speak more often on this forum, i think we would have a very productive conversation. what i rabidly object to is the verbal bullying and trashing that has been directed ank's way. she is not perfect (none of us are), and i don't pretend to know whether her removal from the csm is justified or not. but the character assassination (no pun intended) directed at her is undeserved, shames its perpetrators, and shames those of us who stand by and gawk but say nothing. i know the anonymity of forums breeds irresponsible and contemptuous behaviour. sometimes it goes beyond the pale and needs to be called to account. i'm pleased and grateful that many of you have been doing just that. thank you. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/7/2010,i think black is more interested in whether you're rabidly for finn.
7/7/2010,"until there's a second shard where there are ""pvp flags"" that are turned off, there's only one server, and pvp is allowed on every single square inch of it as long as you're undocked. and you can't just 'play the game how you want' because it's an mmo, and ccp has deliberately designed it so that no matter who you are, and where you are, and what you're doing, someone can come and pvp with you whether you like it or not. nah, i'm not rabidly against ank and it's not personal. i am pro honesty, integrity, intelligence and for a stronger eve online game. i found that ank behaved dishonestly, withgout integrity and intelligence and acted against the best interests of eve online. if she's behaved differently there'd have been no problem, just like la vista vista is a solid carebear but he's also an awesome guy who i had a lot of contact with during and after his time on the csm. i've got no problem with industrialists or carebears, but people who act like ank did deserve to be called out for it."
7/7/2010,"it might have something to do with her saying these things:as you can clearly see, ankh is the very picture of mental stability, and any rumors of her using cutlery to assault any other csm members are strictly not relevant. at all. really. please?tl;drankh likes to call people psychopaths irl, while being completely bonkers herself."
7/7/2010,"so how much did he pay? because i must say, that's one hell of a sneaky way to give him a promotion."
7/7/2010,what did she know and when did she know it?ps csm e-drama best e-drama
7/7/2010,its just me. but if you reraised issues wouldn't that get ccp to realize that we really really want feature x?
7/7/2010,price just went up by 800 bil
7/7/2010,how much for the spoon`?serioushow much?
7/7/2010,"man and i thought my name was good...also i'm pro sokratesz, heshe is for shield buffs working like armor buffs!"
7/7/2010,was it this spoon?
7/7/2010,"i liked the first version much better. dealt with the op on his level, it did.edit: also, necrozoo-something's link is golden"
7/7/2010,it's nice to know that ccp really could give a crap about it's player base and what they want. and that they also could care less about fixing bugs that they have previously admitted they knew about. anyone want to take bets on how much money they lose with dust? devoting an entire development team and most of another to an fps that has to compete with games like halo and cod sounds like a recipe for disaster. especially when they can't fix issues in their current game. (which of course is a completely different genre.)
7/7/2010,"i'm beginning to be afraid that dust could kill eve, not just from poor resource allocation, but also because if it is not integrated absolutely perfectly, it will make eve dependent on a startup mmofps that could very easily flop. in the meantime, the bugs still aren't getting fixed."
7/7/2010,"on a more positive note i hope some of this ""low hanging fruit"" includes balancing issues i.e. af's, rockets, hybrids, etc. seriously it seems like you just have to change a few numbers and ta da subscribers get somethings they have been asking for.mongo"
7/7/2010,"if it was a long-standing product then i'd say that dust could save eve.... diversity, creating a universe bigger then eve, a universe that can't disappear.however....it's a console fps game, these come and go every week.being a console game the hosting will likely be cheap p2p connections between players, which means anywhere other then the us/eu/japan the player experience will be 300-400ms latency.without dedicated servers no community will grow and dust will slowly die over a period of weeks or months.console fps games are a cash grab, they are generally cheap builds on existing engines that are released for quick cash around xmas time.the console game market is not about quality products or long-standing franchise, it's a world of flash in the pan cash grabs on poor product.compare this to pc fps games which still have many dedicated servers, clans, and players years after release.so..... where does this leave eve?well if they lie about what dev resources are being spent and continue to allocate resources to dust at the expense of eve......the mass exodus could be just around the corner if they continue to drop the ball with such stunning consistency.if they get back onto eve soon rather then ignoring it then they may well save the game from collapse."
7/7/2010,"that is unlikely, i don't think ccp will forgo centralized control, given their current infrastructure and know how. also, since the dust world still has to interact with the eve cluster, depending on the tightness of the integration there is little to be gained by p2p connection.ccp hasn't stated if players are grouped by region, but it is likely, you can't expect people to play fps with 250ms+ latency, so they'll put up regional servers.i foresee the same result, but with a different cause: there are dozens of excellent console shooters out there and i don't see ccp producing a triple a title able to compete in that market. i don't think the mmo integration as selling point will be enough to keep it alive. eve is a brilliant concept with less than stellar execution. it seems ccp thinks it can apply the same strategy in the console shooter market, which is doomed to fail imo: with eve ccp can get away with it because 1) there is nothing similar gamers could flock to, 2) the game design attracts a very distinct player group which is above average accepting/capable of living with the deficiencies. both points do not apply to console shooters.i completely agree, which is the reason i think eve and console fps don't blend.i feel the same.one can only hope that the csm managed to deliver a few wake-up calls as stated"
7/7/2010,"have a feeling it's going to be global p2p with the central ""server"" being done via xbox/ps3 ""achievements""ccp have said nothing to allay these fears. there has been no talk of dedicated servers and without dedicated servers,i can 100% guarantee there is zero point in playing dust from australia.the major concern however is that ccp responds to csm requests for eve fixes with:""no. we have no programming resources available"".and""i don't like that feature so you don't get it fixed!"""
7/7/2010,"we'll see if they're that stupid.on the other hand, the sooner dust dies, the less resources will have bee spent on it, and the better the chance ccp won't be ruined.that's not a concern. that's reality."
7/7/2010,"oh no, who will represent empire? grumpy and the sleestak?"
7/7/2010,"so the only csm member who really stood up for the csm and not just playing along for the free visit to iceland just got removed because of ""nda breach""?how convenient."
7/7/2010,0/10 for trolling mah boiii
7/7/2010,"turns out you're the biggest fraudster out of all of us*tips hat*well played, well played!"
7/7/2010,"or not.don't count your chickens.when the truth will out, then we will see."
7/7/2010,"ccp's not talking, ankh's not talking, and nobody else seems to know anything that they're willing to let on. assuming this state of affairs keeps up, the truth is as out as it'll ever be. have fun waiting for more."
7/7/2010,i never thought i'd say this especially after darius's attrocious job at commentating at the tourny. but darius was good compared to you lot glad i didnt bother voting this time as my utter contempt of the csm has been confirmed.
7/7/2010,"i have no confirmation of this, but rumour has it she has been banned from eve......"
7/7/2010,"the pope has been banned from praying!i have no confirmation of this, but rumor has it he has been banned from praying.tldr: stop spreading rumors you jackass"
7/7/2010,no doubt anything which is considered a breach of nda would also be considered tos violation (nr 18 for example).
7/7/2010,this probably applies here just as much as elsewhere.

7/8/2010,"as a person who regularly experiences the pain of agile's 'oh we can release with x and do y later' followed quickly by 'y isn't high priority compared to new z', i know this stuff all too well. supported for more polish & followup; it's something that all too many agile adopters fall into (not necessarily the methodology's fault, more the application of it).and to answer yani's question - it's not a matter of 'who should pay for this' but a matter of prioritisation. more time allocated to bug fixes; ring-fenced time for followup & polish on released features. it just slows down new features; it doesn't cost anything more (from a dev perspective - from a sales perspective you have the question as to whether new feature z will yield more sales of subscriptions)."

7/8/2010,not supported. 1. all attributes to 30.2. amount of sp's in learning skills should be redistributed by pilots them selfs.for me this is only acceptable solution to this problem.

7/8/2010,"i do not want to see the learning skills removed, definitely not, i like their role and i've invested a lot of time and sp in it (all maxxed) and now to see some1 who hasn't bothered training learning skills at all to have the same atributes as i do is ridiculous (no offence). there is a point to these skills, don't remove them. however, if you do, yes, kaya divine's suggestion is good."
7/8/2010,"what point? driving new players away who got a brain and don't want to waste their 3 months sub time just to sit in a station and train learnings? good point, truly good point."
7/8/2010,who ever said u have to sit in the station doing nothing while training learning?
7/8/2010,most idiotic stupid ******ed solution ive ever seen.#not supported
7/8/2010,"exactly. i had a great time my first few months in eve. i explored, i mined, i shot things and got shot. i slowly worked learning skills in-between other skills for mods and ships i wanted to play with. my first few months in eve rank among my most fun times in the game (been playing almost 5 years), along with my first move out to 0.0 and the time right after the introduction of wormholes. anyone who doesn't leave the station until they train all learning has a self inflicted problem, it's not the game's fault. there's lots of things a new pilot with no skills can and should do to have fun. still not supporting the removal of learning skills."
7/8/2010,i don't think everyone should receive +10 and 10%. i think that is a little bit too fast for training. i think everyone should receive like +8 and 10%. (but i guess it doesn't matter much)also i think ccp should refund the learning skill sp in lump sum - like the 100k sp we just received.

7/8/2010,"this thread is now a year old, as a celebration i'm drinking rum and took a vengeance out for a spin.still can't work out why i was the last person in our wolfpack to be primaried"
7/8/2010,"this proposal, by the way, was raised and passed by csm4. wiki is here. what ccp's response was (if any), i have no idea. the op or someone else might want to follow up with dierdra vaal (who raised the issue in csm4) and get encourage an update be posted here (and in the wiki page itself)."
7/8/2010,i will raise this issue at saturday's csm meeting.
7/8/2010,loads of supporti to think this is a good idea
7/8/2010,"yes, please."
7/8/2010,what has two thumbs and can only give thumb one up...boooob kel...wait. wrong forum.
7/8/2010,"lets do it! i've been wanting this for a while.oh and in case not mentioned somewhere, i wanted it for overview. i don't get the ""grid"" thing other than being somewhere on screen? i probably won't check back here though as i already said i support it and it looks like it doesn't need much checking on. :p"
7/8/2010,"yes, please."
7/8/2010,"it's very sad when the csm must campaign for simple bugfixes, because ccp prefers to divert ressources on half assed stuff nobody particularly wanted..."
7/8/2010,i am decently sure the change was intentional. that being said logging off in a supercap with 100% cap and logging on with 10% is annoying as ****. fix this ****
7/8/2010,once again clicking the thumb in a sok thread of awesomeness.idk if it goes along the same systems as shields do. but i did manage to have a domi not manage to passive rep its shields after being logged off in space with half shields for a month... the pilot of the domi has capital level shield skills too so its not like he was lacking in that department
7/8/2010,"this is downright stupid, needs to be fixed."
7/8/2010,bumping and supporting my own proposal.i live in w-space and it is a pain having to go to k-space to build t2 ships.
7/8/2010,i like logos
7/8/2010,"sorry, i've been kinda busy, i come back and see some people scared of blaster change, that's awesome. cuz i'm tired of scorch. blasters must be the scariest.seriously, i have trouble believing you've ever flown a blaster ship.did you even read the first post? blaster already have the most dps and best tracking(same as acs), they do not need a boost th either of them. the problem is extremely poor optimal range makes it impossible to deliver the 'paper' dps. this has to change. what eaxctly is the problem with 38+20(not good at numbers, are you?) optimal + falloff and 840 dps? abaddon will hit 910 dps at 45+10, armageddon will hit 985 dps at 45+10. also you are using tracking enhancer on this rokh of yours, put tracking enhancer on abaddon/geddon, they will hit 52+13. and scorch apoc will hit out to 100kms easily. !!!!shockomgwtf??!!!"
7/8/2010,"support... in halfsomething might need to be tweeked, but not major changes.. rails need more love than blasters. web/speed nurf did hurt blaster boats... just nothign was changed to ammend this. and the new tourny ships.... oh you should really have done something similar to that!as a gal char, i'd like to fly gal more."
7/8/2010,"we allready have 3 weapon systems that perform well at medium range, we don't need a 4. to do so.the probem with blaster ships is they it lack the dps in small gangs, for solo they simply lack the stoping power in web range. it is not a fleet warfare weapon, it is a pure small gang/solo weapon(not because it is very good at it now, but because it worked this way before qr).rails could use a bit more dps, and more importent more tracking to make them usefull in sitations that you can't cover with blasters. a lighter fitting would also help a lot to make more medium hulls usefull in rail setups(im looking mostly at the 200mm rail here)."
7/8/2010,"forget blasters theyre fine for now. if you dont like not hitting cruisers fly a domi, thats why gallente use drones.as for rails, i do think they need tweaking, but just adding dps makes them a poor excuse for artillery. to actually see what needs to be done to them i think you need to look at the other 2 races of turret based dps ships;the tachyon does medium to high damage, with medium alpha at long rangeartilley (which are awesome btw dont change these thanks) does huge alpha, with medium dps, at medium rangewhat we need, in my opinion is a gun that does medium to high damage, with low alpha, at medium to long ranges. it fills a hole that the other two race long range guns doesnt. give hybrids a huge rof bonus, and reduce the cap need in line to that of something like an apoc using tachs. what will result is a steady stream of average dps, which we dont get from using any other sniper boat. it fills a niche that the other races dont, and makes things more interesting and balanced."
7/8/2010,"i changed the proposal to be a reduction of 20%being able to have a medium shield extender, scram, and dual propulsion an a frigate is game breaking."
7/8/2010,i have to agree with this.
7/8/2010,ever heard of a daredevil?
7/8/2010,maybe you should think this through before starting a proposal. changing the content of the proposal every few replies isnt really good.
7/8/2010,"yes, please."
7/8/2010,i will raise this issue in saturday's csm meeting.
7/8/2010,support
7/8/2010,/supported
7/8/2010,"whether or not this is accepted, drones should be improved."
7/8/2010,less filling and tastes great
7/8/2010,"i have bookmarked this proposal and will carefully review it for potentially raising in a future csm meeting. i realize it is well supported and has been around for a little bit, but i haven't had time to read it and form an opinion nor do the research to see what similar proposals might already have been addressed by csm. that's why it's not on my list of proposals to raise for this saturday's csm meeting."
7/8/2010,a new ship from say sansha having been developed to break a person's communication ability.when the player activates it against another player. the victim's chat channels stop functioning. similarly eve voice goes wonky. as in the modulation of the other people talking goes all high pitched or low pitched or gender bended.so lets say i tackle this newb in a belt. if i jam his comms and his only method of calling for help was alliance/corp chat. he'd be screwed :)
7/8/2010,does vent/ts still work?
7/8/2010,"it is 3 times the cost, and it hardly matters in pvp, if you don't plan to shot down a pos or a couple triage carriers. and next to nobody uses t1 ammo in pvp."
7/8/2010,"cost is a bad balancing factor, take a look at the number of titans in game to see what i mean.and when you spend 150 mil on a ship, you do not care about additional 3 mil for the ammo. because without it, you just condemned your ship to death.long story short, only t2 ammo that actually works is barrage and scorch."

7/8/2010,"hello,just a small idea i was consdering. an alternative to the learning skill system that focuses on pro-active gameplay rather than limiting your training for several months while training learning skills.each skill in-game has a base attribute. for example a lot of industrial skills rely on intelligence. with the removal of learning skills, attributes would return to their base numbers. players could choose to focus those with a remap or leave them balanced.instead of raising attributes with learning skills, your skill training will do it. for example if a player is spending time training industrial skills endlessly, their intelligence will begin to see a bonus over time (up to the maximum bonus that'd be possible if they'd trained their intel learning skills). however should they decide to change their path, they'd need to train towards a different skill set to see the other attributes raise. eventually you'd cap the attributes after lots of skill training. the end result is that instead of leaving a character to train for motnhs on end or bouncing back and forth between your skill goals and learning skills, you'll raise your attributes while focusing on your chosen professions/paths."
7/8/2010,"now thats creative, good job.supported"
7/8/2010,"i think that is a reasonable method. no instant gratification and a move away from the ""forced"" two month grind. i'll throw my support in on this idea."
7/8/2010,"actually i rather like this idea. cautious support, pending any good objections raised later."
7/8/2010,"i agree with malcanis on the cautious support. the potential problems i see are:1) assessing how the bonus characteristic should be assigned to older players;2) the possibility to maximize the effect thanks to the remaps;3) the low number of charisma based skills and the unbalance in some other characteristic, leading to underdevelopment for some characteristic even if a player has trained most of the skills having it as a primary stat."
7/8/2010,this has merit and should be examined further.
7/8/2010,"should be brought to more people's attention for possible issues and balancing, but the idea is good.+1 from me"
7/8/2010,"i also cautiously support this, with a note that it should take as long as it would to normally train those skills.after about a month of playing you should be close to a iv/iii in all learning skills."
7/8/2010,"this is the tricky one. i think it might just eventually come down to instant skill point compensation. the reason is by now they'd most likely have lots of skills trained which would mean they have already done 'what it would take' to raise the attributes. so it'd be just easier to give back what was spent on learning skills. that way anyone who did the '2 month stretch' will find they are now 2 months closer to something else and at full attributes. someone just starting or only partially through the learning skills would be rewarded similarly but have to raise the rest with the new system (which is not really a setback). not sure how to explain that one. but the way i see it is that if a player chose to remap and pump up their intel, then train intel skills, that's their bonus. it's a bonus that is still accessible to others and then it'll make raising a perception combat skill slower and mean those attributes will raise slower. perhaps instead of making it skill points over time it could be the total time invested in a skill. charisma may just become the common factor. so training a fair chunk of charisma skills would give you the majority of the learning skill bonus. to counter this they could increase the effect or increase the prerequisites/materials for implants making them more important.yes this is something i had in mind. it's meant to provide a revision of the system. to keep attribute training an important part of the game, but without the apparent grind or lack of productivity. quite simply the most efficient way to raise learning skills is to hit them all with the skill bonus. but it does mean you can't do much else in the meantime.that way it doesn't ruin things for veteran players but it does make it a little more interesting. the first time you do it isn't so bad but on an alternate character it is a chore."
7/8/2010,"always liked learn-by-doing systems, and this would be a good eve version of it, especially for beginners.but things do get a bit hairy for chars who put a lot of time in learning already, because however attributes would be recalculated, ccp can expect a lot of ranting...all in all, great idea that should be discussed in finer details, and i support it."
7/8/2010,"isnt it much easier to just remove them and raise our base attributes with 10 (or 9) points? i dont really see what this adds.and the ones with most benefit will be highly specialised alts, not rookies who want to look which direction they want to go to with eve."
7/8/2010,"furb-killer translator: ""which gives me the opportunity to train up more griefing alts even faster."""
7/8/2010,"you're right, a simple solution is to just remove the learning skills and give us a baseline for our attributes. the main goal of this idea is to preserve the original attribute building aspect. to preserve some traditional rpg mechanics rather than just remove the system entirely.initially yes. but eventually it'll even out. just like a new character is ""behind"" in terms of skills, within a few months they will become competitive in pvp regardless of how many million sp their opponent has."
7/8/2010,had a similar idea with a little difference: you'll slowly lose the attribute points you gained through focused training if the associated skills are not trained for a long time.
7/8/2010,"i'd prefer if they just remove learnings and give everyone +10 stats, but this idea is also good."
7/8/2010,"this would be great for someone like me - an older player, who already has a very solid base of skills, and who wants to focus in on one type of skill for a long period of time. but you'll utterly shaft the newbies, who have to switch back and forth a lot to cover for the fact that they need to train everything. this seems like a textbook case of malcanis' law - you're trying to help newbies by getting rid of learning skills, but the replacement you propose is only helpful to older players(or focused alts, who tend to be run by older players)."
7/8/2010,"huh? maybe reread my post.@herschel, i thought so too first, but it isnt that bad since it doesnt decline in the proposal when you train other skills. if that was the case it would be really bad for newbs."
7/8/2010,"this is actually a really good idea, would make training long skills less annoying.ccp would have to decide on how much of your attributes would switch over obviously to make it balanced etc but i would really like this idea to be implemented.+1 internet for you sir"
7/8/2010,"amongst what i assume is already a laundry list of fw fixes, the player community would be quite enriched were we able to fight for the smaller/pirate factions, over perhaps smaller contested regions. rather than lumping everyone into 4 groups, players would be able to pledge allegiance to any number of the smaller factions, with conflicts spread out and hopefully a little more fun, along multiple fronts. examples of 'factions' players could join:blood raidersguristasangel cartelkhanid kingdomsansha's nationthe popularity of the recent ccp sansha events has shown plenty of people willing to assist a smaller faction (sansha) against the main empires. obviously i understand there are plenty of fw fixes that need to be made, but i don't imagine it terribly difficult to select some border systems sprinkled throughout the empires and implement the fw mechanics for some of the smaller factions in a future patch. thoughts?"
7/8/2010,sounds like a good idea to me. more fw fronts and more dynamic politics might also breathe some life into the less-traveled low-sec areas.
7/8/2010,"you can't change this dynamic with a change in game mechanics, it's social behavior. to subvert the nap system one would need to do a coup/civil war type action in each of the napped alliances, so they split themselves apart--alternately one could just start shooting blues until they were kicked out of the alliance. this kind of is high-risk-low-reward unless you just want to see the world burn--but it happens. (if you're feeling destructive like this you probably would profit by turning coats to one of the other big naps first.) but, to actually pull it off in any status-changing way would require lots of willing conspirators due to the size of the big 3. but, stuff like that happens with smaller alliances and large corps everyday. and smaller alliances get their standings reset with the larger alliances pretty frequently due to politics, isk-tribute, failure to perform well in defense of their own turf--etc. here's the thing, even if you break them up temporarily, they'll more or less form up again. maybe under new leadership, maybe not. naps may be boring but they are good for someone's isk account. here's another thing, over time bigger alliances and stronger coalitions become more insolated, and organized--because of shared idealogies, history and accomplishments. smaller alliances have trouble organizing and holding their **** together because they don't really focus on building idealogies, a history, and accomplishments. they don't do the babysteps that the other alliances had to do to get where they are. they don't count the cost. if you rebooted eve completely, and everyone had to start over in noob ships, and gain skill points from zero till now. my money would be on the same general political/nap blocs being in control of 00 as there are today with lots of the same people trying and failing to get a piece. its player mechanics more than game mechanics."
7/8/2010,dis is an outrage!ccp should force friendly alliances to shoot at each other.it doesn't make sense any other way.
7/8/2010,"woman.but yeah you are right. just look at all the brown-nosers in this forum. agreed. in part.the only problem is that most parents get slacky on the education, and just raise brats who think that being an ass is the way to do it. screaming is good, but the example with kids is actually the worse you could get."
7/8/2010,"i kinda wondered when i read her blog.i definitely appreciated the effort she went through to put in so much detail, but it did seem more than what i'd heard was allowable to disclose before the official minutes.it probably didn't help that she had a tendency to let her guard down tact wise.minor though both infractions might be, they certainly provide enough ammo when combined to legally justify a dismissal."
7/8/2010,"as much as you like to hate ank, she did go to iceland and be vocal and push ccp to fix things.everyone else just seemed to be there for the cake and did nothing they said they would do during their run for csm.i guess the initiative and having someone on their hands from the csm that meant business was too much for ccp to handle. so sacking her was the best course of action.pr0 tip: do not actually do what you said you would do to get elected if you want to stay in the csm."
7/8/2010,"i am glad that this happened, and i don't really care for the details, but curiosity is started to get sparked"
7/8/2010,well ahk gave it the good old try at least we know ccp heared what probly needed to be said.and no i'm not a ahk fan but i would support my worst enemy in taking one for the team as a hole as ahk probly did.
7/8/2010,"we will be getting mazzilu as a substitute? /facepalmi have some problem seeing what was this so serious breach that there was the need to forcibly remove her. larkonis was given the option to step down before being throw out so ccp should feel it is something really serious.i would like some clearer statement but doing that without increasing the information leak probably is impossible, so i can't support the request."
7/8/2010,more info definitely needed here. the csm isn't much good if mildly vocal members get removed at a whim by ccp without explaining exactly why.
7/8/2010,for the love of god people. what exactly is it about 'breach was not related to her blogs or csm5' that you do not understand?
7/8/2010,well i guess she will have more trouble trying to convince ccp to implement her idea to charge players real life cash the more players they kill in game then. damn shame that.
7/8/2010,"i lol'dibtl.if its a nda breach it most likely had something to do with dust514 or incarna.who knows, why is this such a big deal?also, if ccp wanted this to remain unseen, and kept `quiet`, why did they post a news item on the front page of eve for everyone to see?ccps waving of the banhammer s'posed to be scary?i got no serious feeling out of this bit, csm still seems like a big joke to me."
7/8/2010,"i believe you are wrong, when they held an election etc, they have a ""moral"" obligation to do right by it. they've dragged real people into this, with real names, used them as posterboys and girls to get good press, and now they ditch someone just because. i, as a voter want more details, and it is indeed possible to give them if they so choose. i can wait a few feew weeks. i would also like to know more about how it was handled (why didn't she leave quietly etc). csm is about transparancy (sp.?), and this case is anything but.in short, internet spaceships is serious business. i want answers."
7/8/2010,have you considered the possibility that her nda breach and subsequent expulsion had nothing to do with the csm?
7/8/2010,"it has to have something to do with the csm, because there isn't a nda for anyone else who plays eve afaik.if you mean *this* csm, you may be right though."
7/8/2010,"you have repeatedly posted that her ban had nothing to do with her blog post. do you know why she was banned? because the csm chair said csm wasn't told. and if you don't know why she was banned, why are you running around telling everyone why she was or was not banned?"
7/8/2010,"actually, you're oversimplifying the issue.it is entirely possible that she got information that had nothing to with what the csm was discussing (thus outside the purview of the csm) and then acted on that information. that would be a breah of the nda, yet have nothing to do with her csm duties per se.one example: ""saw an emai over the shoulder of some dev i was watching work. check out what ccp is doing next!"" don't assume that just because the csm's have to sign an nda that her breach of it was because of her ""official"" duties.in fact, i am more inclined to believe it wasn't, simply because of what happened to lark. lark's was clearly based on information passed on directly from ccp to the csm (based on the details we were provided) and both lark and ccp were far more open about it.*shrugs* it's a moot point, anyway. my guess is if ankh comes out and talks about it directly, they'll invoke that part of the nda that says they can sue you, and ccp obviously isn't going to give, so all this discussion is really just us rabbling around."
7/8/2010,"i guess, but it depends how you define csm duties. to me, that would seem to be breaching the csm nda whilst doing csm-y things - therefore the breach is about csm stuff. i'm fairly certain though that it is not a larkonis-gate style breach though, as all the other csm members seem just as confused as us, though who knows what they're really thinking..."
7/8/2010,"because 4 other csm members posted the same stuff on blogs and weren't reprimanded for it, and because none of it was nda sensitive material in the first place?you're wrong, as de'veldrin nicely illustrated above."
7/8/2010,"because 4 other csm members posted the same stuff on blogs and weren't reprimanded for it, and because none of it was nda sensitive material in the first place?on the one hand, your point is valid. but it is still an assumption. perhaps ccp is unaware of the other blogs. perhaps ccp considers each of them to be a breach, but is being selective about enforcement. perhaps the problem comes from her work with the reporter last year. perhaps it has to do with something several years ago that ccp didn't choose to persue until just now. here is my point: none of the posters -- nor csm -- knows for sure why she was sacked. if you want to join the speculation that's fine. but posting a flat ""that's not why she was dismissed"" when you don't know anymore than the rest of us is misleading people who might see your csm tag and think you are speaking from knowledge instead of assumption.i'm willing to believe ccp that she did something against their nda other than a blog post. but i also believe that ccp should inform the csm of more details of what she did. ccp unilaterally removing a csm delegate without telling the csm why just reinforces the point that the csm has no power other than what ccp decides to temporarily allocate them. and certainly isn't transparent or communicating with the playerbase."
7/8/2010,"you're just looking for a reason so you can say ccp treated her unfairly?if you remember correctly, my blog was up long before hers and received quite a bit of attention here and on other boards. mynxee's is a lot harsher about ccp on certain points so no, it had nothing to do with it, now let go of the idea."
7/8/2010,"so, here's a funny little fact:ankh was booted from csm because she breached the nda. in other words, revealing information that she was not supposed to reveal. another way of putting it is: ankh let the cat out of the bag.ccp does not want to inform us of what excactly it was that she disclosed, even though it has already been revealed another way to put it: ccp wants to keep the cat that got out of the bag inside the bag.one last thought: gimme a break. the cats out, at least tell us where the cat is so we can avoid getting our eyes scratched out because accidently sit on it."
7/8/2010,"implement the shares feature on a bigger scale. 1. you can buy shares from all npc corps, their prices will fluctuate on a weekly basis based on real eve events. simple example, if the number of wars increase, the r&d npc corp will see their shares increase a little bit. if eve players buy shares, the increase will be greater. another exemple, if the demands of minerals is greater, all npc mining corps will see their shares increase a little bit, if players get into it, the increase will be better... if the number of barges and exhumers kills goes up, the shares of npc mining corps will go down. those simple events can simulate prices. and if enough players buy when the price go down, you could actually reverse the tendency. so you have a certain control over the trends, if you inject enough cash into it. 2. when you buy, you have to sell, since there are many npc corps and the number of eve players buying shares might not be constant, you need to sell, but to whom ? the npc corps would buy back a certain amount of shares daily to simulate a real market !3. of course the solution to all this seems impossible, but it's not. all you need is to run scripts on a daily/weekly basis to get statistics on the eve events. those scripts will get answers to determine if prices go up or down. per example, a script would run to calculate the number of minerals sold per race, another to calculate the number caldari ships sold etc... since those hundreds of scripts are doing select only, they don't need to run on downtime. then, once a week, prices of the shares are update at downtime, with the help of the data previously acquired.4. you'll need to implement a buy/sell share program like in the real world (stop loss orders, limit orders etc.) and graphs of course.5. this solution will finally introduce a widespread use of shares that could evolve with popularity, if popularity doesn't take, it still implements a living share market, where you can make a small profit on your investment, and there's no chance of anyone robbing you. if people get into it, you could make bigger and quicker profits.a few more details need to be figured out, with a little bit of imagination and math you can go a long way, i'll leave it to those who are paid to think about this stuff"
7/8/2010,"another thing that would be really cool is if prices were tied to ingame things, like how well a faction was doing in faction warfare, how many of its npc convoys are getting destroyed, or how many missions are being completed for them."
7/8/2010,"that would be pretty awesome. i think that taking it one step further, would be setting up more incentives for players to report player corp operations so the same sort market statistics could be applied to real corps. imagine if say corp war decs another, that gets put up somewhere, and players could buy shares of who they expect to win sorta deal. it would make sense cause if a corp does win then now they'll be able to pay out dividends and shares become worth more. from all this market information on player run corps, we could see something evolve along the lines of fortune 500 tracking stuff.now that would be cool."
7/8/2010,"i support the idea absolutely but i wonder how it would work. i mean most corporations in the real world have obvious roles that they fill and people buying into those companies know what they produce. you know lockheed stock is going to be based on aircraft orders and fuel prices.but corps in eve don't have to disclose what they make, so how would you ever know what you are buying into? what would profit be based on? what would the ""stock"" that you are buying represent as far as hard assets go? how do you handle fraud?i'm just not sure how you would *do* this, as much as i'd love to see it."
7/8/2010,"well i think like i said earlier that the key to making that system work would be making an incentive to reporting what your corp is doing. a lot like the corps that create ipo's. that sorta deal, except constantly updating."
7/8/2010,"per exemple, when you search a corp to join in the ""recruitement"" tab, you can check several options like pirate, mining, pve, manufacturing... i've never been ceo of a corp, maybe there's already a checkbox where you set the role of your corp, if not, it won't be too hard to add this choice."
7/8/2010,"i really really really like the idea!maybe skip the playercorps thing, could be too difficult, but factors for player corporations could be:bigger corp wallet / incomeincrease in members (account only ofc)member activity------but i really like the npc corp deal - lets say deep core mining specializes in veldspar while others may specialize in kernite - so if prices to up for veldspar on global market, increase in share value for deep core mining :)for combat npc corps such as spacelane partol, the more missions done for them , the higher share value :)- aracus out!"
7/8/2010,"if the market thing is going to work then a corp needs to be able to generate isk from it's shares and shareholders need to be able to profit based on increased real value, not just a demand-driven price. dividend payments should be automated to curtail the most obvious fraud.if a traded corp want to have a pr man post reports and such, that's fine, but any publicly traded corp should have a public wallet--a read only log of transactions so that prospective investors can see what the corp really does.limiting the stock market to npc corps would create a ccp-run market casino, useful only for speculation.i would like to see some coupling between ""news"" stories and markets. if a food shortage is reported, then npc buy orders should be present to drive up food prices."
7/8/2010,good idea. supported.
7/8/2010,supported. + i would make it an half-weekly event.
7/8/2010,"i only support this idea so long as the only guy concord can be paid to shoot, is ""jason edwards""! the only version of your idea that makes good sense is just disolve concord and let players at each other's throats everywhere... that would be a brave new world, but i don't even want to think about how much real life isk ccp would loose if they killed highsec for players of more solitary and passive dispositions. think of it this way--all those super-carebears are giving ccp money to do basically nothing. that money ccp pumps back into their game thru expansions, and into new games like dust. it may spoil your fun that you can't isntantly grief everyone in the game all at once with an epic win button, but it doesn't bother me so much because eve isn't just a game, it's a virtual reality."
7/8/2010,why don't you go gank him yourself? instead of getting concord to do it..
7/8/2010,worst idea everhighering concord which is overpowered and would blob the **** outta you and the pilot been paid against carnt do ****not supported
7/8/2010,not supported.not just because its dumb but because its cowardly and dumb.
7/8/2010,"not supported. go hire a merc corp. they exist for a reason. or train for pvp and pop him yourself. if hes griefing you that much, hes probably flagged hostile meaning you can shoot him legally."
7/8/2010,"the side effects he's got there are just some suggestions, nothing that wouldn't need to be considered/tweaked.the idea of an additional ecm bonus booster isn't actually too bad of an idea. boosters in general need a good deal of love."
7/8/2010,bump. more discussion is needed on this particular topic
7/8/2010,"i actually like this idea. keep the bonuses relatively low, but something akin to the electronic superiority warfare link would be cool (boost to ewar strength). among the penalties should definitely be ewar range and then others possibly to shield hp/armor hp/signature radius.*op you should add this in and maybe some of the ecm white knights wouldn't be so mad"
7/8/2010,"pray tell which other ewar requires one to spend half a billion or more and all set-implant slots in order to be 'a counter'?imagine if you will if sebo's or tc's were more or less useless on anything not bc or bigger, thus requiring you to invest 2 months worth of isk just to give them the oomph needed for them to be useful .. there is a mind-boggling difference between a slot module costing peanuts and implants that vaporize in the first lag-spike on ship-destruction.op needs to add:- eccm rigs for all sizes, with smalls adding fixed number rather than percentage.- comparable ecm boosting dope.- dual nature to eccm dope that adds fixed number or percentage.do this and you might have a case. personally not convinced that the ecm turd can be polished into anything worth looking at. it has to be redesigned entirely if there is to be any hope of it being remotely close to balanced with other ewar types."
7/8/2010,"one difference between the caldari recons and the other races is this:caldari has all bonuses going towards one module while gallante, minmitar and amarr are split between two different ones.fitting both module types to get the full bonuses is simply not a realistic option for any size fleets.so while caldari can fit their one module gets full bonuses, the rest are stuck with half the bonuses."
7/8/2010,"adding eccm rigs is an interesting idea, but i don't think it's quite the best solution to help solo pilots and more of a general nerf to ecm. eccm rigs are the sort of thing you might see en masse in large fleets, as a standard fitting, especially on sniper bs, and i don't think that's a good thing. the booster idea is specifically designed to make it targeted towards solo/small gang implementation.i don't think your suggestion for a fixed bonus really works either. i like that it's an out of the box suggestion a bit, but why exactly should small ships get a disproportionate eccm boost? as a solo pilot who regularly flys small ships i think it's perfectly fine that that are proportionally easier to jam than larger ones. if, in fact, small ships are going to get more protection from ecm, couldn't that just be done by a straight up higher sensor strength on the hulls?"
7/8/2010,what he said...well...at least with dust514 there will be k00l d00ds shooting each other for control over planet resources no one wants to harvest anyway. so that's a new feature we're all gonna love.
7/8/2010,"i think that is the problem ccp is facing. which is why we got a free ship. which is why they are actually saying they are looking into fixing pi. there isn't a mass interest in pi. people aren't clamoring for their own part of a planet. so, adding dust514 is going to be adding a huge supply of ""planet takers"" and... there isn't a demand for them.in any event, i do support ccp putting off incarna/dust/etc to fix up some of the current problems in eve."
7/8/2010,i concur.
7/8/2010,or just fit rails and still kill them quicker than a mwd + blaster setup because you didnt have to fly anywhere to get in range.
7/8/2010,and please tell me why do gallente have to be robbed of using their main weapon system?
7/8/2010,"even if fitting blasters for l4 is completely pointless(and yes i did a blockade with working mwd in my gank mega while waiting for a raven to log back in), i would like missions that allow the use of the mwd for other reasons."
7/8/2010,you have no clue how much more fun missions can be when you dont sit around all the time but actually have to do some flying. thats why all my mission boats are fitted with short range weapons now.
7/8/2010,"doing l4 with a range extended puls abaddon or ak pest is fun and effective, doing it with a blaster mega is just boring and ineffective."
7/8/2010,"honestly think the blasters should be revamped. they should get the falloff boost similar to minmatar weaponry.kronos should have a falloff bonus instead of the stasis webifier velocity bonus. with aformention native blaster falloff increase, and kronos bonused falloff increase it would be more in line with the vargur, golem, and paladin then.kronos with blasters is about useless at this point because of blasters horribly limited range.vargur is top killer when it comes to level 4 missions, being able to kill favourite missions like blockade or pirate invasion in only one cycle of bounty. long range fitted marauders would have trouble being this efficient.the maelstrom is also on the top of the board for efficiency of mission running, because of the recent boost to minmatar weapons.this boost to matar weapons brought them inline with caldari and amarr ships of the same general fitting idea. medium range gank and tank. perfect for mission running.gallente needs the same love.the only reason i would ask for microwarp in missions is so i dont have to fly a special fitting to gank someone in low-sec who is in a deadspace complex/missiontl;dr - fix blaster falloff. close range guns on slow as hell armor tanked ships? *boggle*/thread"
7/8/2010,"while i would love autocanon-class faloff on my blasterships, that would make blasters better autocanons that consume cap, and that we probably don't whant (or so i think)."
7/8/2010,"the only other way to compensate is by making gallente ships faster. they lost the brute force of blaster dps when they lost a significant amount of their speed.this is why people who don't know any better still fly the skirmish fit diemos.i'm not saying make them like autocannons, but i am saying they do need and increase in range, ever since the speed nerf.a kronos with null, hitting at 55km instead of 33km for 50% of its maximum dps would be siffucient i'd say.currently a vargur will hit 50% of its maximum dps somewhere around 95km, with 800mm and barrage."
7/8/2010,i would support this as i too find it really annoying and i only have 6 extractors atm!!!
7/8/2010,then you are gonna go crazy!i support!
7/8/2010,"i defentiv support this, because its a waste of time and a pretty boring-needless-feature, which turns my interest in planetary interaction into a terrible click fest, i will stay away in future.a solution would be grouping extractors. based on first steps into using npcs to do it.like mining teams in diffrent qualitys, which bonus is :- as better they are, as more extractors they can combine.probally some lower skills in social interaction as an improvment to planetary interaction.it would make things muche asier, and hopefully interesting.my 2 centsbreg mac"
7/8/2010,"if you can't manage a colony, then don't do pi. out of all the industry professions this is the easiest time you'll be making money. ccp gave you a way to make isk out of thin air, all you have to do is click a couple extractors."
7/8/2010,"i can make money out of trading just the same way, with less clicking, out of thin air. this is not an argument. i make money out of thin air while missioning in my domi, i only have to click ctrl+f1, ctrl+f2, ctrl+f3 for my tank, and right-click- launch drones. then i can go have a nap. same argument, more money, less clicking."
7/8/2010,"sorry, but you can't compare pi that requires very little initial investment or maintnance to trade. you also can't compare it to mission running either since it doesn't require constant attention. mission running doesn't produce you profit 24/7 either and requires alot more sp and investment into ships, ammunition etc.edit: my point is, pi requires you to put only slight amount of money into it and it'll return you back 10 times more each day untill the hell freezes over. it's far from comparable to any other form of making money."
7/8/2010,"a bit less clicks to safe time for other things, thats all.pos fuel/ materials producers will love it.if the possibillity would cost a bit skilling time u have nothing to loose."
7/8/2010,"look, things like manufacturing, invention, research, they all require investment that with work will slowly start chuckling out some profit. in pi you invest in a cc and installations, and get your resaults right away or perhaps with a slight delay when processed further. beside this things like mission running require attention and time, you have to include time into your profit calculations whatever you're doing, running missions, ratting or exploring. exactly the same considerations go into pi, it's up to you if you want to spend time setting things up more often to get more profit or you can't really be bothered so you get a low income.i don't understand why would pi ever require even more perks then it currently has."
7/8/2010,"you don't have to click ""a couple extractors"", you have to do thousands of clicks per extractor - for millions of extractors.and now vote this proposal up, please. you will love it too."
7/8/2010,"but you can compare it to r&d agents. a few clicks, maybe 15 minutes of hauling per month, and you can pull in a load of isk. pi needs to be less click-intensive."
7/8/2010,pos gunning needs a slight update.allow alliance members to be pos gunners in pos's that dont belong to their corp. this would aid a lot in strategic objectives for alliances.fairly simple proposition. cant take longer than 5 minutes to implement.thanks.
7/8/2010,1
7/8/2010,forgot to support it.
7/8/2010,"consider the following scenario:i. you have jump bridge at deathstar posii. you jump around freighters and other easy to kill (with pos guns) shipsiii. you have no information that the sitting in the pos alliance member is ""a spy""iv. spy sacrifices this char identity and kills your (or your friends) valued ship/s by scrambling and killing them with (possibly your own) pos guns???profit?//having starbase defense management at iv costs about 1084784 skill points?i do not support this"
7/8/2010,fealy seems you dont know pos gunning mechanics.you still need pos-gunner rights to be able to use the guns. if your really that bothered to kill the freighter you can join the other corp and get pos gunning rights.
7/8/2010,doesn't that make it way easier for spies to obtain gunner rights than ever before?
7/8/2010,"spies are your own problems, let us choose."
7/8/2010,"yeah, spies are not an ingame mechanic. metagaming should not prevent benefits ingame."
7/8/2010,it should be a toggle on the tower's defence settings.
7/8/2010,"yes, it's one of these threads again... here goes nothing:i see the main issue of lowsec is its risk/reward ratio. hisec has almost no risk, and little reward; 0.0 has huge risks, and huge rewards; lowsec has almost the same risk as 0.0, but crap rewards. wh space is basically 0.0, with less risk.hisec: level 4 missions with some lp and loot, crap ores, crap pi, crap complexes, crap belt ratslowsec: level 4(5) missions with more loot and lp than hisec, crap ores, a bit better pi, a bit better complexes, a bit better belt rats0.0: level 4(5) missions with loads of loot and lps, abc ores, great pi, amazing complexes, mostly bs belt ratsas you can see, the rewards do go up linearly, but since the risk in lowsec is almost the same as in 0.0 (the main difference is that you can't cyno jam a system/ claim sovereignty or put up bubbles).therefore lowsec isn't really worth living in, except for pvp.what i think should be done is the following: just make it 0.0 and hisec, not this fail lowsec nonsense. not literally, but bear with me:1. improve lowsec belts yet again, make it so that even 0.4 spawns bs rats all the time, just make the bs worth 500-800k isk max. triple 200-300k isk bc spawns would do too. they do spawn currently, but only occasionaly and in <0.3 sec.2. improve the belts! add abc ores to all <0.4 systems, so 0.3 and lower. we might actually see miners move into lowsec more if the rewards are worth the risk. more miners = more targets for pirates.3. increase pi resources a bit more in lowsec.4. optionally increase the quality of complexes in lowsec.5. i think a good idea would be to remove security status loss in lowsec, and keep it only in 0.5 and higher. why? when you pass through a lowsec gate the first time, you do get a warning window. if you agree with the text, you agree with non-consensual pvp, so why should lowsec pvpers get -10 for fighting there, if fighting is not really forbidden there?i still think security status losses should be kept for hisec suicide gankers and so on, but not in lowsec. if concord can't be arsed to avenge you, it shouldn't be arsed to punish the aggressors."
7/8/2010,"if you kill somebody and they don't catch you, it does not mean that you are innocent. yes to everything except for sec status, otherwise you turn low-sec into 0.0/"
7/8/2010,"sov-null alliances will move in, drive pirates away, shut down the systems from everyone else and farm it, if rewards are too high. boosting rewards was never a viable solution because of this. the only direction left to go is decrease risk.sov-null is not ""huge rewards, huge risk,"" it's ""huge rewards, no risk."" you can go on for weeks on end in some of those backwater sov-null systems without seeing a single hostile. in highsec, idiots suicide gank you. you're more likely to get killed there than in some sov-null backwater systems.before mission scanning, mission running carebears were in lowsec. then it got implemented, and they left. you can come with whatever fixes you want, in the end, only one will work. lowsec weren't always broken. there was a time when it's not. we already know what worked in the past, all that's left is bringing it back."
7/8/2010,"yes, security status thingy is optional, as i said, but really... hisec = concord = security hits, lowsec, 0.0 = no concord = no security hits would make more sense to me, at least.even if 0.0 powerblocks try to move into lowsec, they still won't be able to bubble gates and defend cap ship attacks, so while they may move in, people can still go through their camps easily, making holding large areas of lowsec a lot harder than holding the same amount of 0.0 systems.and i agree that in some cases 0.0 is safer than hisec, just getting to the safe places is a bit risky, whereas in hisec you can be suicide ganked, but only if you're an idiot (300m in a t1 hauler, faction fit active tanked hulk, officer fit missioning ship etc.)."
7/8/2010,"mmm, on the right track but i think you also miss what a gem low sec really is. what i would like to see is a small but noticeable boost. give it better belt rats, 0.4 should spawn atleast 65k isk cruisers in the initial spawn (instead of 12k isk dessies) and work up from there.missions should be given a greater reward boost. i'd favor an automatic 100% pay increase for the fact that it's in low sec, this is in addition to the normal security effects. i think low sec ores are mostly fine, only bots mine anyways. whether those bots are in high/low/null sec sec doesn't really matter.low sec anomalies could use a boost too. there really only seems to be 3 types of anomalies when you get right down to it. high sec that can be solo'd with a rookie ship, low sec that can be done in a t1 fitted cruiser and null sec that requires a carrier to solo. there is room for a few additional levels in there i think and they all belong in low sec principally. the actual plex's that require probing are generally well balanced i think.low sec needs to remain sufficiently poor to keep it's lawless no man's land status. so it can't be boosted to much. but a little love is a good thing. i also agree that probing ships needs to be more difficult. so i'll throw my request to have deviation tripled and combat probe strength halved once again. station/gate guns could also use a bit of a boost too. maybe double the damage on them."
7/8/2010,"low sec isn't broken, nor is 0.0 (although instant, always reliable local chat is way overpowered).high sec is the area that's 'broken' as far as risk vs. reward goes.while i'm not against boosting lowsec, i think it is a false pretense to say low sec needs boosting and not to just say that high sec rewards need nerfing."
7/8/2010,"ahh... i agree, 0.0 and lowsec would be fine, if there were only lvl 1 and 2 missions in hisec. but we all know how all the carebears are going to whine if lvl4s get removed from hisec. we also know it will never happen. ever. ccp likes their rl isk too much to basically lose 100k subscriptions.... ok, even if it's 10k, a lot of 'people'... i mean, pinatas, would stop playing.rothgar: i agree with everything except the probing changes. either make missions unprobable or don't mess with stuff that isn't broken. probing tears in hisec/lowsec/0.0/wh is already a bore, and it would take 6x as long as it takes now to probe someone. although, i would agree with a lowsec-only probe nerf. say... the pirate factions are using probe jammers or something all over lowsec (and optionally npc 0.0), which lowers your chances of probing someone out significantly, or something. i guess that could bring some of the pinatas into lowsec.about the ores... there a a lot of mining corps out there, none mine in lowsec (either hisec or 0.0/wh space), and this is why. you may not be an ore expert, but it's obvious that there are only two types of ore: the 300 isk+ per m3, and the 70-100 isk per m3. the figures there are not exact, but generally, lowsec ores are only marginally better than hisec ores, and mining them in lowsec is stupid - risk is too high for a very small increase in reward. we might see an increase in lowsec mining ops, bringing more pvp and life into lowsec, if abc ores were added to all lowsec belts, obviously in smaller quantities than in 0.0.i agree that mining is for bots, but i also know there are a lot of living, breathing miners out there, and they would benefit greatly from this :) (and so would piwates )"
7/8/2010,"self destructing is a pretty lame way to avoid getting killmails.is there anyway the system can be changed so that a killmail is generated to the top damage dealer when a enemy self destructs.had a enemy self destruct 2 carriers yesterday just to avoid getting lossmails, seems like a pretty pathetic way of doing things.if someone self destructs without anything shooting at them the current system is fine. i just think it should be changed however when a fight has been going on...any thoughts?"
7/8/2010,this has been discussed by csm4 already and was approved.
7/8/2010,makes perfect sense to me
7/8/2010,approved and supported. killmails do not enhance my e-genitals enough. we need more ways to make epeens grow bigger.
7/8/2010,don't panic
7/8/2010,supported for the lolz.
7/8/2010,"if i had a towel, im sure someone would give me a [] that i misplaced."
7/8/2010,oh yea
7/8/2010,i definitely need 42 towels in my hangar.ccp needs to do this!
7/8/2010,"i don't know how many of you have noticed, but blizzard is apparently going to require posters on their forums to use their real names:"
7/8/2010,"hehe i think they are already regretting that idea. one of their employees posted his real name to show ""it isnt that bad"". ;)people started collecting and posting all available about him. he needs a new phone number and twitter account now. ;)payback is a b*tch."
7/8/2010,highly supported!i also compliment the ccp staff on their effectiveness of the moderation of the eve forums!ha where the hell did this happen?
7/8/2010,fun starts at posting 16
7/8/2010,"seriously this would kill plenty of markets. some people have a side business of moving skillbooks to 0.0, with the inherent risks (and inherent rewards). now people would just clonejump to empire once a year or so and inject one year worth of skills, prerequisite known or not.this is removing some player interaction for the sake of a very small convenience. the revised proposal alleviates it a bit but tbh i prefer the system as it is."
7/8/2010,supported!
7/8/2010,definitely supported.
7/8/2010,"/supportedthis would be convenient, but then again i found this in the meeting minutes for september 2009:"
7/8/2010,pls pls pls make this happen.
7/8/2010,supported.mainly because i hate keeping track of all the skill books. i can't train yet.
7/8/2010,"not drone drones but lets say i'm flying a mega. i have my defense drone in my cargobay. i jump into a camp, i eject and anchor it. it then will shoot down and stop all damage happening to you until there is no energy left. this works only if it is able to intercept the attacks. so more anti-long range sort of attacks. drones and short range weapons would still be hitting the target. similarly this would be how you destroy the enemy."
7/8/2010,"come on man, this is a pretty weak attempt. normally your posts at least manage to present the bad idea you're proposing in a coherent fashion, that could possibly make a couple people think that it might be good. this is just nonsense, in the most literal meaning of the word."
7/8/2010,sorry was typing it at work and had a couple interruptions. i'll try to be more coherent with my awesome ideas.
7/8/2010,3-6 month ban must have been lifted.>.<;;
7/8/2010,i havent ever been banned. i just finished last year of school.. got my degree with top marks... and now working. so the mmog of real life is keeping me very busy. tourny got me back into the game and thusly back to posting my great ideas.
7/8/2010,"let's see, there are currently 183 pages of proposals in here, requests for changes to be made to the game, suggestions for fixes. some a very good and make a good deal of sense. some are so so and would benefit one group at the expense of another. some are just downright stupid and provide us with a good laugh.but of all these 183 pages of proposals - not one has been discussed at the csm, and then been implemented by ccp. not one.so why are we bothering to continue with the charade of the csm?i formally call for it to be disbanded (not that it will happen as hey, nothing else in here ever has)"
7/8/2010,yes i am sure the csm will get right around proposing this to ccp nice troll bro
7/8/2010,"incredible. if you put up the minimal effort of looking up previous meeting minutes or the wiki pages it should be abundantly clear that a lot of issues, including those most heavily requested, have indeed been discussed by the respective csm and also brought to ccp's attention.as for the end of that quote, well, if ccp has not bothered to allocate resources to solving these issues or implementing these proposals, then the csm is hardly at fault. on the contrary, their effort to at least try to get ccp to commit should be commended./not signed, obviously"
7/8/2010,"the key problem is that people who think the csm is ineffective and should be disbanded aren't reading this forum. i'm only reading it because of the recent drama. but hey, if ccp wants to provide airfare for a bunch of players, then ignore them for the next year that's their business."
7/8/2010,"upon reading your proposal one could say that the csm is working as planned by ccp. more facts would help your case, such as cost vs benefit of the csm and i must also say that upon reading the minutes of some of the previous incarnations of the csm some of the proposals in this forum have been discussed and put to ccp both in the online meetings and on the iceland trip.example, fw bugs and developmentlinkagerelevant threadslinkagelinkageyou can access the relevant threads for the other issues in these minutes from the post itself. what does disappoint me is that such comprehensive minutes do not seem to be posted by the current csm, i assume that to much of their energies have been directed towards infighting.now i am tired having exhausted my small reservoir of ""can give a damn"" and must bid you good day."
7/8/2010,the problem is not csm but ccp that have no resources to make any changes.dust is more importent.
7/8/2010,"let's see.you think the csm has accomplished nothing in terms of having proposals discussed and reviewed. so your idea is to propose that the csm is disbanded. but, if no proposals are ever followed through, how do you expect this proposal to follow through? quite the cunundrum."
7/8/2010,"meh, most of csm guys are null alliance farmers, blobers, and killmail humpers that are out of touch with the high&low sec dwelling majority. some of their proposals may do more harm than good, not that ccp will ever implement them.supported. csm is just a scapegoat for ccp to placate the masses and avoid criticism themselves. to give the illusion that something is in the works, when nothing is. if it's dissolved, the additional petitions and bug reports may suck up enough resources that ccp may deem it worthy to actually do something."
7/8/2010,which members are they?
7/8/2010,"naming names and flaming flame... not gonna bite. i can say ankhesentapemkah isn't among them, but he got the boot, so that's a moot point. rest you can pretty much tell from corps and alliances they're in."
7/8/2010,i wish my world was as simple as yours.
7/8/2010,"you're all bluster and no balls, aren't you?"
7/8/2010,"yes it is funnily enough - and also quite the illustration as to why the whole concept of the csm is a just a crock of smelly brown stuff.i also notice that one of the - ahem - illustrious ""chosen"" few deigns not to offer a valid rebuttal, but just trots out the standard line. wonder if he has been promised a super cap reimbursement for his alliances next loss"
7/8/2010,"good small changes. the idea that fixing a whole bunch of small simple things would go a long way toward making the ui far less irritating and easier to use was mentioned by csm at the june 2010 summit. if we ever get the promised list of csm-raised issues in the backlog and their status, maybe we'll know where some of the ui proposals that csm has raised stand in the development ""plan."""
7/8/2010,i support it
7/8/2010,i like this idea. looks nice.
7/8/2010,"i don't like this idea. i don't see anyway to make it good either, except to say it's just bad. many people have given good reasons as to why it's bad. but heres an idea, join an alliance and raise the cost of the wardec considerably. if they really want to wardec your alliance, they will. here's another idea, beg for mercy? pay them the isk as a sign of surrender, and actually surrender to the wardec? basically, current game mechanics already allow you to counter-bid the war by pleading for peace. will doing so entertain your enemies, probably, but if you're outgunned the options you have are: 1-make a stand and get blown up. 2-hide in stations. 3-run to the otherside of the unvierse. 4-cloak-up. 5-pay for mercenaries to fight with/or for you. 6-diplo the other corp for terms of surrender. 7-close your corp form a new one. 8-join an alliance to make war against you more costly. over all, there's so many evasive options that waging an effective war against another corp is pretty challenging as it is. so, i absolutely do not support this idea."
7/8/2010,"25 mil for alliance dec is nothing. joining mid dec will just give the deccer more targets for even less isk. join an alliance in itself does not help.if you pay anything to anyone, you'll have an endless stream of decs from others who want to get paid. it make things worse.1)get blown up attract kb padders. you'll end up with endless stream of decs.2)hide in station denies your access to game, while still paying monthly subscription. you may as well cancel your subscription.3)leaving everything behind and running denies your access to game. highsec isn't large, they may chase after you. pos can't run.4)can't do anything when cloaked. denies access to game, may as well unsubscribe.5)paying mercs don't cancel out current wardec. your hulk can't fight.6)terms are isk, or popping certain number of ships for kb padding, both of which attract endless wardecs.7)killing the patient is not a cure.8)again, 25mil is still chump change.you've just illustrated everything that's broken about current wardec mechanics.ccp should never have lowered highsec wardec costs. it's too easily exploited, and need to be reversed."
7/8/2010,yes
7/8/2010,"ok, so i know this is pretty much flogging a dead horse here but,i have put a lot of time in thinking about how to properly allowsuper capital ships to dock, so before you go screaming no, readthis and you'll understand why i've set it up like this so thereis no docking games with super capitals.1.first off it has to be a system with the super capital upgrades.2.players must train a skill called adv docking3.must have fitted docking computer on ship, this module can not beremoved while docked in the station.adv breakdown of requirements1 is a giving the system must have this upgrade2 this skill should be a 14x multiplier just like all the other skills and should follow theselinesprimary skills requireddisc: skill at using advance docking computers and their understanding12 seconds reduction per a level of advance docking computeradvanced space ship command vcapital ship iv3. this is a mid slot module that must be fitted before docking begins and is requiredto stay on the ship the whole time the ship is docked.item breakdown: advanced docking computerdisc: due to the enormous size of super capital ships, concord outlawed the attempts ofdocking these massive ship to all capsuleer. many corporations within new eden have beenworking on ways to dock these ship. to everyone's amazement ore came forth with an advanceddocking computer capable of the precision maneuvers needed.activation time 120 secondscool down time 3600 seconds(cool down doesn't start till ship is in space)while docking computers are fitted ships can not be traded.fittingsmid slotcpu 650power grid 250,000can only be fitted on super carriers, titans5,000 m3seeing a 60 minute cool shouldn't allow these ships to play docking games. or remove themodule till the cool down time is over.if you notice they will have to off line some mods to fit the computer.this wouldn't remove the fact you'll need pos or another capital ship to refit at.so due to the heavy draw back of using docking computers i dont see this having super capitalsover powered due to the fact the can dock. we'll still need super cap arries to build them.having to have the module fitted will keep them from being built, and trade."

7/8/2010,"station containers have the option to lock and unlock them with or without password which is great, but i use eve on a laptop and my pc indoors. wwhenever i log into the laptop all the station containers become locked even if i have them set with no password and had it all unlocked on my pc. so i unlock them all, again then i get home log back in to my pc and its all locked up again. can it be fixed so that once you have chosen an option to lock or unlock and container with or without a password it is remembered by the game as it is really annoying having to continuly unlock containers. also why can't we drag and drop on a container in station you have to open the container and then drag to the tab (if stacked). is there any support to my request your thoughts please"
7/8/2010,not supported! :) it would make logistics and taking space hell.

7/8/2010,"""endeavours""."
7/8/2010,"your writing isn't bad. the concepts you've inplaced are fully noted. there's just a disagreement about risk here. both our stances would allow the player to partake in buffed varied playstyles, yes. but what your side does is tantamout to making extra module slots for your ship basically. you dock up, hotswap, and leave with better abilites for the intended situation. that's no different from the current ship fitting and does not bring anything new in terms of strategy.now if you have the set racks implanted in your pod forever than you can employ new tactics on the strong and weakpoints of your clones. this would add customization to the clones themselves on a more intuitive level. in your case, you could decide to have a scanner clone that has amazing scanning bonuses but generic sets for everything else. so, ultimately the risk applied is still up to you. to have an omni clone that has access to multiple high end implant sets without the trade off of either decreased profficiency or increased liability does not follow the intended mechanics of the implant, and subverts its purpose of being a static customization much like riggings are for ships. the system you've came up with just makes implants another interchangable mod which in this case is too powerful to be utilized on such a level. for instance in a game of cards you sometimes trade in your weak ones. thats not the way eve plays it. you have one hand dealt and when the flop comes you either sink or swim. that's the way it is. when you have cheaters that hide cards up their sleeves it ruins the unpredicatable essence of the game. now imagine if everyone did that. wheres does the actual skill come into play.i feel your idea would make the game overly rely on buffs instead of strategy. we already have enough buff options for pilots imo. that is why i cannot support your idea as it is now."
7/8/2010,"well, its good to hear that you have an idea but it would be nice if you wrote something about what you think would be the advantages with your system compared to what we got now.second, its not entirely clear if you want all attributes to generate sp simultaneously or if you have to choose some of the attributes. i can see some trouble with having all attributes generating sp.third, i don't see how this system of your is in any conflict with learning skills. you say sp generation will depend on the attributes and learning skills increases your attributes, so where is the conflict?"
7/8/2010,"the advantages is that you can go on vacation for 2 weeks and not have to log on a computer. you get skill points in each attributes automatically. you decide to ""purchase"" your skills when you want. so you're not tied to the computer like we are now.yes, i see you point, i've just realized it. that could simply be corrected by selecting your combo of learning. you'll get a choice the first time you log and you can change it at will. still you won't be tied to your computer.[] perception /willpower[x] intel / memory[] memory / intel[] charisma / willpower....it's in conflict because if you log the first time, decide to learn skillspoints in the intel/memory attributes for 4 weeks, then decide after 4 weeks you buy learning skills, it will affect your sp/hour only 4 weeks later, but it won't be retroactive with the current system, so you have a waste, unless you implement some math for those specific skills..."
7/8/2010,"supported in principle, but needs refinement. most especially, we definitely don't want any implementation to be unbalanced.it'd be neat if we could try out being concord lawmen."
7/8/2010,"1. improve the ui for the buy & sell orders in the wallet. just like the ""places"" in ""people & places"" we should be able to see how many jumps away we are from the orders, in which region and constellation is the order. all that with a ""order by asc/desc"" on each fields. the main advantage is that while you're traveling through many systems, you can see right away which orders you can update. right now, if you have 50 orders spread across many regions, you have to check the orders one by one to make sure it's within your grasp. you could also display the orders with a green highlight if it's in the same region that you are and within your influence (depends on the trading skills).2. display the tech lvl of all items when in list mode. per exemple, after i run a few lvl 4 i have hundreds of items, then i proceed to check all of them one by one to find the ones worth selling. i end up doing hundreds of query to the server only to find out the tech lvl of the item. once i found what i like, i still do many queries to find out the prices of those items. simply inefficient. adding the tech lvl in list mode would save server time and cut the trouble in half.3. in corporate information / agents, add ""the number of jumps away"" and ""quality of agents"" in seperate fields, then add the ""order by asc/desc"" on each field. it will be easier to find nearby quality agents. also apply the same principle in people & places / agents tab.you should add a new button in the taskbar, one that would show all available agents with their quality and lvl in the system with a ""dock"" link. it will be easier to get to the agent you want when there are many stations from the same corp in the system (going through the corp information is too slow).4. make the calculator bigger, or at least give us the option to make it bigger. (bigger numbers too)"
7/8/2010,"the whole ""csm is run by bloc-voted candidates"" thing is simply a myth, though i'd like to see how you propose to ""ban"" it.if you look at csm5 you'll see only 2 of the 9 main delegates who could even be classed as large alliance ""bloc voted"" candidates. there were a few more large alliance candidates who didn't even make it to alternate status. hardly a controlling interest."
7/8/2010,"a pity the next csm is so long away.....i think i may put myself forward as a candidate next timeto the trolls: if you have a comment, make it on-topic at the very leastyes, i will argue any point with anyone, i`m not biased..."
7/8/2010,"yes you are, and your dishonesty is beneath you. no matter what facts were brought up that showed ank's character, you handwaved them away. quotes that kept their meaning precisely didn't count because they were ""out of context"". except, all those that were checked meant the exact same thing in context as they appeared to from a quote and, coincidentally, that was the time that you kept claiming that everything was untrue and ""out of context"" but refused to cite a single other instance of such redeeming ""context."" just like you claimed that all the facts about here were ""debunked"" but have never provided a citation of that, either. just like all the facts about ank were ""smears"" but you never could show that they weren't factual. just like all the people who posted about ank were ""trolls"" even though they were posting their honest opinions about facts you dishonestly claimed were wrong.just like you spared a throaway sentence to talk about how ank should be kicked off the csm if it was true she threw something at another csm member at the summit (funny, you somehow didn't run with that demand...) but then, for post after post, tried to take sok to task for daring to report the facts (facts are smears, war is peace, ank is cool). just like now you're playing schoolmarm and trying to lecture csm members that they're not allowed to talk poorly about a disgraced and terminated ex-csm member who was removed for misconduct. you have relentlessly supported ank at every turn with dishonesty, reliably. of course you're one of her partisans.funny, that, being a partisan for someone who isn't a politician anymore."
7/8/2010,"it really doesn't matter two ****s about who you voted for. ccp can't just dump a player-elected csm member without giving a reason, when so many players vote for them. they could at least give a reason without going into details whatthechristplease do not evade the profanity filter. zymurgist"
7/8/2010,"i don't post rumors about features (that's what fallout's words pertain to, linking to a random post from a dev doesn't lend credence to your argument btw)and i'm sorry, but i'm entitled to an opinion about my fellow members, and how easy/hard they are to work with. my personal experience is what it has been, and i think people deserve to know it. i'm not a big fan of sugarcoating things for political correctness. sorry if you don't like what i said, you're entitled to an opinion too.i didn't like ankhe and i'm happy to see her go because she has historically been impossible to work with, though in all fairness it was better during this csm summit than i expected, but only because i interacted with her only when she said patently untrue things. i don't do ad hominem attacks when dealing with proposals, she does/did, and people deserve to know this too. mynxee is entitled to an opinion about things, that's her prerogative and i usually agree with her, however her ""scolding"" wasn't about what i said, but about the fact that i said it, giving free fodder to forum trolls. whatever, as can be clearly seen, i had redacted my post and decided to let the matter rest (obviously you don't, but i won't comment on it any further).i don't do speculation either, whatever you may think, and always preface opinions/thoughts clearly as such (hence the ""that's my opinion"" in the post you quoted).as far as this thing goes, any nda breach is really detrimental for the whole process and the trust ccp can expect to have in csm members. in that regard, i'm effing annoyed (to put in a way milder word that won't trigger the forum censor thing) about what her stupid behavior may do to our ability to get stuff done. in that regard, good riddance...the people currently sitting on the csm have varied background and opinions, but are able to work through their differences (or agree to disagree) to get stuff accomplished, things just got easier in that regard."
7/8/2010,"1. yes they can, they really, really can. the csm has exactly as much power and position as ccp says they do. if the csm wants to be 'stakeholders' in more than name, they need to push for it and the community needs to get behind them. hopefully now that ank is gone the csm can get down to business. 2. they did give a reason without going into details. ank violated the nda and was removed for misconduct. we may get some good popcorn out of this if she sues for ""libel"", but even she should realize that getting her name in the papers for accusations of violating an nda for a software company is career suicide. to be fair, she also was thinking of suing the eve tribune for ""libel"" too, so who knows."
7/8/2010,"tossing off commnents like the one about so-called ""bloc voting"" needing to be banned but then refusing to explain further when asked amounts to you being the troll, deary."
7/8/2010,"let us count the current controversial topics we have shall we:1. pl hacking the game so they don't appear in local and also using said hacking program to have the perfect counter in every match to win the at8.2. nc loses crap ton of super capitals. then they magically get ghost ships right after dt to replace them.3. ccp claims they do not interfere with with fleet fights, then later takes away a ghost titan that white noise probed out before nc could and gives it to nc.4. csm member breaks nda by ????? and no information is given out.5. gaming websites and magazines are starting to take notice again. not in a good way either.not sure about the rest of you guys but more bad press in the likes of the t20 thing is not going to help this game.every csm election i have genuine hopes that it will be the first csm to actually accomplish something only to have my hopes dashed sooner and sooner.it wont be long now and it will be the day after elections in which the csm proves the rest of the eve community that it is in fact a joke.eve-online corrupt???... nah... what would make you think that?!"
7/8/2010,iceland.nuff said.
7/8/2010,"wow. what an unfortunate position for ccp to find itself ...you might recall, the csm was created as a direct response to the discovery that one (or more?) ccp devs were directly interfering in the game and giving goodies, info, etc. to their favored alliance (bob). because the csm was supposed to represent the player's interest in the eternal and ever-present player/dev struggle, they were to be elected democratically by popular vote.ankh was duly elected, receiving the second most votes of all candidates.now, the second most popular (by definition) csm member has been removed by ccp, with nary a detail other than an indiscriminate statement about ""nda violations"". i'm willing to give ccp the benefit of the doubt on this, and i will assume (for now) that ankh did in fact somehow violate the nda. ccp deserves that much.but ccp has a real problem here, and shoudl strongly consider setting aside thier right to lay down the law (which is their right) and provie more details - perhaps even a joint statement that acknowledges that what ankh did was wrong. if she refuses, i'd like to see, at a minimum, details provided to the csm and some sort of position from them on whether they agree that she did in fact violate teh nda.if she did, she should be booted. but asking the community to just ""trust us"", when the action is to kick out a member of the organization that was esatblished in direct response to ccp's own devs cheating ... it just smells bad."
7/8/2010,"meiss, your last post admirably demonstrates speculation and ad hominien arguments. you are as ignorant as the rest of us as to ank's dismissal from the csm. you can't seem to stop publicly sharing your dislike of her. and considering this is a matter that will arguably have a negative impact on the eve community, i think it reasonable to call this trolling. you certainly do have a right to your views. yet a bit of judgment on when and how to express them is in order. mynxee and dierdra and others are working hard to make the csm work. if only out of professional respect for them, please stop. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/8/2010,"ouch, i see what you mean. it was only later that i learned what a massive blast pvp in eve is and today i'm simply impressed at the inventive **** that people come up with to stuff like the old ""fleet up a war target in warp"" and at the stupidly expensive stuff that people fly in pve.personally, i think ccp should really push things like rvb etc so as to get people used to the idea that it is after all just a pixel spaceship game and enjoy the pvp aspect more. i've never been in rvb but i suspect that they do more positive stuff for getting people into pvp than any of ccps nerfs/buffs and other weird decisions do.removed a trolling comment and profanity filter - adida"
7/8/2010,"the whole csm is a charade. ank getting thrown out because she released quotes from the game producers which confirm that they aren't taking the csm serious but just do their own agenda and then ""consulting"" the csm.sure, minor things which ccp anyway wanted to implement are credited to the csm. but the real deal? those things which the players now for years demand? not going to happen - not enough devs for that the producer say. at least according to ank. i have no doubt to not believe that because it also fits to the things we can see. and for writing that she got thrown out?poor."
7/8/2010,"when the last csm member was removed, ccp were a hell of a lot more specificif she's messed up - ccp need to tell people why so they can make more informed choices in the future... especially since ccp allows expelled csm members to run again"
7/8/2010,so the csm was setup to reduce complaints and take pressure off the support team.it has worked very well for that. especially during poor expansions when complaints spike.now that the csm has actually grown into the vehicle for the mounting complaints from the player-base they try to silence it?is today the day eve online died forever?
7/8/2010,"apparently ankh will be posting an update on her blog sometime tomorrow. now, whether or not the information provided will be 100% accurate and balanced remains to be seen. i'm not holding my breath though."

7/8/2010,"why would they do this? if ccp decides to prepare an official statement and divulge exactly what ankh did, wouldn't they in-turn release the information which caused ankh to get canned in the first place? as the news bit says, ""...this is a matter regarding confidential data.."" so i wouldn't hold your breath for an official release of what exactly occurred. the explanation they gave was enough."
7/8/2010,"lark also resigned and admitted what he did. ank is denying it and has threatened legal action before. when dealing with such people, it's not in ccp's best interest to share any more info than necessary. possible ank-alt, but there are much more likely contenders. of course, because it was an opinion on the forums and it results in... nothing more than any other opinion on the forum. but it happens to suggest that maybe ank shouldn't be removed from the csm. gee, i couldn't have predicted you'd try to support it with some dishonest nonsense about how this opinion is ""positive"" or ""constructive"" as opposed to all those other views you don't agree with. fancy that."

7/8/2010,"yeh i know, haha. don't get me wrong, being polite is nice. it's a good thing to be but thanking people so much when they aren't doing this specifically for you makes it seem like you're trying to gravitate yourself toward the center of attention. whether you mean it or not, it comes across as arogant to a lot of people.the eve community is already an easily riled bunch, so just be a little more mindful. they are here to discuss with each other, including you, not just to provide points for/against your own ideas and merits. :)"
7/8/2010,"aye, but if i were to pipe up and say that ankh seems to me to have been an epic rl troll, you would hardly thank me for a ""good faith contribution"".-liang"
7/8/2010,does this count as being fired on her resume?
7/8/2010,"yea, but it probably won't appear on the resume."
7/8/2010,"""threatened legal action"" - if she has in fact threatened - is a strawman. what are her damages? she has no lawsuit - .as for what is in ""ccp's best interest"" - i strongly disagree that it is in ccp's best interest to let this sit as is. just read this thread. ccp's best interest is to get 3rd party legitimization of their actions. if they can't publically disclose all the details (which is a reasonable hypothesis), then at a minimum they should disclose it all the the csm so that they can confirm the propriety of ccp's actions. after all, the csm already *knows* whatever super-secret info is at issue (since ankh learned it as a csm).nothing about my post ""suggests that maybe ank shouldn't be removed"". to the contrary - i specifically said, expressly, numerous times, if she broke the nda she should be canned. the problem here is one of trust and legitimacy. ccp wants us to just trust them - that she did in fact break the nda. i find that ironic, when the purpose of the csm was to police ccp for proven violations of game rules. if ankh broke the rules - and i specifically said i give ccp the benefit of the doubt that she did - ccp should still do more than just say ""its between us and her, and she's gone"". they should seek and obtain neutral confirmation. its kind of a basic tenet wrapped up in the concept of justice - the accuser should not also be the judge.removed a personal attack - adida"
7/8/2010,"no, it's not a strawman. she really has threatened legal action in the past, and whether or not a lawsuit has merit doesn't mean that it can't be a ***** and a half to deal with it in court. crazy people file stupid lawsuits each and every single day, all over the world. and no, this thread is not a valid sample from which to draw sound conclusions. in any case, ccp has removed a player-elected, virtually powerless spoekeswoman for their internet spaceship game. cries of ""grr, ccp must do thus and such!"" aren't going to have a lot of weight. especially since there's no upside for ccp to drag this headache out and then get the csm involved in determining whether or not it was a breach, or what have you. not only is that more drama than they'd want, but that isn't the csm's function. they do not set ccp corporate policy, enforce ccp corporate policy, determine ccp corporate policy, interpret ccp corporate policy, etc... so when the question is whether or not ank violated ccp's corporate policy, involving the csm doesn't make sense. you stated (and have repeated)that the csm should be allowed to view the evidence and judge whether or not it was an nda violation. obviously if they find it wasn't an nda violation, then it'd be a bit odd for ank to be dismissed due to an nda violation. this means that, maybe, ank shouldn't be removed. unless you're saying that the csm should be able to view the evidence and if they still say that it wasn't an nda violation then ank should still be removed for an nda violation, which is weird. if you're not saying that then, yah, you're saying that maybe ank shouldn't be removed. corporations do not require ""judges"" or ""neutral parties"". millions of people are hired and fired, each and every single year, without recourse to neutral parties or the legal system."
7/8/2010,"that doesn't seem terribly likely - there are many ways to get information without others in your group getting this information. and furthermore, its entirely possible that the others know the information (that is confidential) and don't actually know what she said that got her in trouble.what we actually know is that a subset of the potential information she could have obtained was seen by other members of the csm. we further can rule out any information that was posted in her blog and another blog. seeing as how most people are saying that it was all echoed pretty well, i think we can fairly safely say that it wasn't the blog that got her in trouble.but...... but..... the blog isn't the only way to communicate. ankh could have sent more and/or different information along to a third party like another game company or gaming magazine.i'm not sure that ccp can release the details of what she disclosed without opening themselves up to a lawsuit (from her). if i were in their legal situation, i'd talk to a lawyer before i started taking advice from ""the game community"" on what ""must be done"".sorry, but 500 people quitting over a terse message saying ankh broke nda and got the boot is much less than hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawsuit damages and legal costs.-liang"
7/8/2010,"in response to finnagain:reread my first post, and try to do so fairly.i expressly recognized, and stated, that ccp has the power to do as they please. this isn't about what ccp can or cannot do.this is about what ccp should do.if you are content having ccp accuse a csm of a breach of policy, and simply dismissing that csm rep, with no 3rd party review at all - then fine. that's your right.but don't come complaining and asking for verification when its someone you like or support who gets booted, with nothing more than ""the rules were broken, its between us, we aren't saying anything more about it"". if you fail to see the unfairness of this ... there's not much else i can say. i'd suggest however that you are being motivated by your dislike of ankh, and not by any sense of fairness/appropriateness.personally, i know very little about ankh - i voted for her only to lol at her critics, because i read a few attacks on her from eve tribune and on the forums, and lookeda t what ankh had actually said, and it was clear that her critics were misstating her positions and misquoting her in an attempt to drum up anti-support. i'm fine wiht disagreeing wiht her positions, but the attacks on her were not fair evaluations of her positions - they were ugly (and ineffective) rhetoric, as proven by her getting the 2d most votes notwithstanding."
7/8/2010,"the problem here is that you assume that this is some kind of political personal attack. i would argue that's pretty dangerous territory for ccp to go into considering that she's actually employed in the gaming industry. ccp accusing someone in this industry of an nda breach is serious business and can/will almost certainly be legally challenged. the lack of a legal/arbitrated challenge from ankh is an admission of guilt or no contest - which is career suicide.so, that said: if ccp dismissed sok or myxnee or teadaze as having breached the nda, i would not feel as if it were ""unfair"" to them. despite me liking them a lot.-liang"
7/8/2010,"1. i don't get your first point at all. are you suggesting ankh had some inside track of info that other csm candidates did not? i find that highly unlikely. i think its fair to assume that whatever she disclosed was known to all the csm. in any event, the csm could be provided details in any event, as they are routinely provided confidential data under the nda.2. once again, you raise the ""omg there could be a lawsuit"" specter. if i told you i worked at the most prestigious international law firm in the world and that ccp has no risk of a lawsuit from either disclosing to the csm or not, would it matter to you? lawsuits aren't really that complex ... you need liability, and you need damages, to bring one (typically). what liability can ccp have here? they have accused her of breaching her contractual commitment. that's not libel - its a simply accusation. if they tell eveyrone, or even just the csm, the details, they've done nothing more than ... explained the details. google ""truth is an absolute defense."" turn then to damages - how has she been damaged? she either broke the nda and got kicked off for it (no breach of daamges) or she's been falsely accused of breaking the nda and lost her position on a spaceship game committee. where's the harm?anyway, i don't want to debate this, b/c i'm really not an ankh supporter. i just also don't supprot what has become the cheerleading-sheeple like willingness of those who want to see her gone just accepting the decree from above. ccp is better than that - and the players deserve more."
7/8/2010,"[if ccp agreed with your logic, and was concerend with the ""seriousness"" of their action, then you might think they would have gotten csm support or legal counsel before posting it publically. by your logic, by merely posting the accusation they have guaranteed a lawsuit (since ankh cannot simply sit by).but this is all mental ************. there will be no lawsuit. the lawsuit card is a strawman."
7/8/2010,"actually, this got me thinking.isn't ankhesentapemkah also the same eva jobse of the piratenpartij nederland? or so i was told. my thought being that it doesn't look good for politicians to go around breaking confidences, loose lips can sink more than internet spaceships."
7/8/2010,yes. this is why i made it a point to submit a tip to geenstijl.nlthought they probably dont care enough to act on it.
7/8/2010,"i read it fairly, but you still haven't answered my point. if the csm can vote that whatever ank did was not an nda violation, then the logical conclusion is that she shouldn't be booted for an nda violation if they vote that it wasn't an nda violation. and that, therefore, maybe she shouldn't be booted. where's the logical error there? please respond this time. there's no question of verification. ccp removed a volunteer from their volunteer program. if the local animal shelter says ""little billy isn't good with dogs, so we're not going to invite him back for the dog-walking program"", we don't demand a neutral third party and a panel of judges. besides which, as i pointed out and you did not respond to, it is in ccp's best interest not to extend itself legally and make one single word more of a public statement than it absolutely has to. you can be certain that if ank brings this to trial, anything ccp says will be used (and anything ank says will be used in a countersuit). actual financial ramifications always trump forum justice for a corporation. and, see, saying things like this is also rather odd, considering it's flat out false and was a refrain of ank's partisans during the campaign but a fictional one. not one single quote was shown to be ""misquoted"". not one single view of ank's was shown to be ""misstated"". if there were fabricated quotes or the like, her partisans would have been all over them like fireants when you kick their hills. the lack of any such response, coupled with the repeated refrain, is all that needs to be shown. as for the argument that the facts were ""infective"", that says nothing bad about the facts but does about those who still voted for ank.p.s. you keep using the word ""strawman"" wrong. talk about a potential lawsuit is not a strawman, it's a prediction. if i say that you've argued that ank is made out of chocolate and is thus yummy, then that's a strawman because i've ascribed a position to you that you do not hold. saying ""ank might potentially sue"" is not, at all, a strawman."
7/8/2010,"hmm, see candidate #2:"
7/8/2010,"no, i'm saying that someone that someone that's alert or someone that works in an industry can go into a place and see/know more than other people who don't. she could have talked to different people for dinner, had a side conversation with one of the developers, or any number of a thousand things. it doesn't have to be an ""inside track"".and hell - it could be that the people on the csm do know the actual information that's been disclosed... but don't know which information it is. let me see if some set math will help:let s = all information about ccplet a = ankh's known infolet c = info presented to csmlet ai = ankh's nda breach infolet ba = ankh blogged infolet bc = csm blogged info (unioned)trivially:s  a  aia  c (she has all information presented to everyone, but potentially more)ai  c - bcadmission from other csm:ba = bcso what we actually know is: ai  c - bain words: the information ankh disclosed is potentially more than what the csm knew, but doesn't include the information that she (or they) blogged.the harm is in the public accusation of nda breach and the consequences for her career. if i were accused of something similar, it would become extremely hard for me to get a job and i would almost certainly be fired from my current one.-liang"
7/8/2010,"i bet you also don't care as to why joan of arc was burned, as long as she was cooked.a very sad and ignorant comment from a csm that does not care about honesty, facts, or any of the innocent/guilty ""stuff"" - too much brain effort? thank you for being so transparent. that way we all know who not to vote for in the future."
7/8/2010,hmm well as a certain ccp person once in a dev blog for apoc patch said everyone in npc factions is an rmter i am certainly going to take their word on everything
7/8/2010,"i take it all back. this is serious business. (for real this time.)it's going to affect her career ....and as i think about it, ccp has done exactly what any good lawyer would tell them to do. be terse and say nothing.i'm so used to looking at all this as a game, but that's her real name, and could have real repercussions .... hmm.sorry! /me deletes old posts"
7/8/2010,"@thrasymachusthe fact that sokrateez (s/p) immediately posted that the reason wasn't her blog comments implies he may know what the reason was. and i don't see any outrage from the other members of the csm here, or allegations of injustice. these same peo"
7/8/2010,"see, that's what a strawman looks like. you invent something, act as if someone else said it, refute that invention, and then claim that you've refuted their actual argument. i never said that the csm had the power to change ccp's decision. then what's the point? ""csm disagrees with ccp as to how ccp corporate should enforce ccp corporate rules... so go have a sandwich."" if it's got no power then what's the point of going through the motions? and, again, the csm is not ccp's hr department. that isn't their job, that isn't their role, and i'd be truly shocked if ccp used them in that capacity. corporations get to hire and fire people all the time. ank wasn't even an employee. you can dismiss volunteers a heck of a lot more easily than contracted employees. the argument is that ccp has no responsibility to release information, it is actually in their best interest to keep as quiet as possible, and despite all the white knighting, volunteers for corporations do not have rights to volunteer for that corporation, certainly not to the level where they need some sort of tribunal and that a corporation is no longer to make hiring and firing decisions regarding its personnel and volunteers(or in your terms ""be accuser and judge""). what ccp should do is whatever it does for any other employee or volunteer. i'm reasonably certain that you wouldn't be demanding that the csm step in if ccp terminated a programmer for an nda violation of used a new company to clean their bathrooms."
7/8/2010,marked for deletion - adida
7/8/2010,"today is a great day.i also fully support ccp's ability to wtfpwn anyone in the csm and boot them out on a whim. the csm is something entirely optional and extra work for ccp and if a player is going to break the rules and/or be a jackass then ccp should rightfully ban hammer them.i also love the ankh die-hard supporters. throngs of players dislike ankh, most of the csm members dislike ankh and ccp boot her out, what is the common thread here? the problem here is obviously ankh. ankh supporters are just trying to get more information so they can claim that her offense wasn't a big deal. it doesn't matter whatsoever. you cannot save ankh, she is gone. the bridge is over, the bridge is over."
7/8/2010,"pretty much this. ccp isn't considering banning the girl, they already did. what's done is done."
7/8/2010,"what, have you taken a level in idiot or something?an nda is a legal contract. that means if ank broke it, ccp has the right to pursue litigation for it. if they choose to do so at some point, anything they say about the matter before the fact can be used against them by ank's attorneys - or possibly even give her grounds to countersue. ccp doesn't need ""neutral confirmation""; but if they decide to get it, it's going to be from a lawyer, a judge, or someone else that isn't a clueless moron like yourself.all of you people - if you've got such a jonesing for more details, just wait a day or two, until ank herself makes a new blog post. i'm absolutely certain that she can't wait to tell us all about it."
7/8/2010,you mad?
7/8/2010,"she is, but calling her a ""politician"" seems generous. her day job is computer games, and the seat she ran for won zero seats in a proportional representation legislature. also, she has about the political savvy of a giraffe - that was, in fact, most of the problem with her as a csm rep. besides, if you move this out of the realm of internet spaceship politics, and into the realm of rl politics, this is barely a blip on the scandal-o-meter. if ccp fired her for racking up a $78,000 hotel bill, then maybe it might be back-page news by the standards of real politicians."
7/8/2010,"if some rumors that i've heard (from multiple sources) are true, and i have good reason to believe that they are, ankh will be very lucky if she isn't charged in a criminal court for what she has allegedly done. if the real truth comes out about what she's (allegedly) done, breaking an nda or mouthing off on some blog will seem like a drop in the bucket in comparison.of course, this post only means something if the truth comes out and we're not whitewashed by ccp and the other involved parties. at any rate, you heard it here first."
7/8/2010,"no, but the fact that ccp doesn't have to tell you **** if they don't want to seems to be driving you people all yosemite sam up in this thread.you are unimportant; you don't ""deserve"" to know anything about what happened. htfu and go play the game."
7/8/2010,i have no idea who ankh is and haven't bothered to pay any attention to the scam that is csm. but it does strike me as rather suspicious that a vocal member that was recently complaining about ccp's lack of commitment to the game suddenly finds themselves kicked off the csm with nothing more than a vague violation of nda for an explanation.then again this is ccp and i've grown to expect them to do whatever the hell they want with little to no explanation.
7/8/2010,"yeah, until you realize that at least three other vocal members that were recently complaining about ccp's lack of commitment to the game were not kicked off the csm."
7/8/2010,"no, he's entirely right. as a matter of forum justice, yes, ccp should submit this to the rest of the csm for review. sacking one of nine people who exist mostly to make your life difficult, without the other 8 even knowing why, looks very sketchy. but forum justice is not the only relevant issue here. if she does pursue a remedy though the real-world justice system - which is unlikely, but not impossible - then the csm's opinion is completely meaningless. i do not blame ccp in the slightest for worrying about that possibility, and covering their asses in case it comes to pass. remember, this only happened less than ten hours ago. according to the massively article, ankh is trying to appeal ccp's decision internally, and is in the process of arguing it over with them. knowing how fast ccp works, it could easily take up to a week for that to get sorted out to everyone's satisfaction(or who knows, maybe longer), and only then will we know if anything is happening. at that point i expect either a retraction on ccp's part(hilariously unlikely), a lawsuit on ankh's part(rather unlikely), acceptance and silence by all involved(plausible), or ankh to post her side of the story on one of her websites(likely). when that happens, then we can see just how mad the talk of lawyers is. until then, patience is probably in order, though i'll forgive some wild speculation for fun. this is what happens when you don't pay attention - you work off first impressions, and are completely unaware of the fact that you don't know bugger all about which you speak. at least four other csm members have said very similar things to what ankh said, in very similar places and in very similar ways. if they're sacking people for opposition, she would be rather unlikely to be at the top of the list."
7/8/2010,"weasel words make you look stupid, though your normal comments make you look stupid anyway so it's par for the course.so care to name some of these so called sources? and whilst we are on the subject, who are you and why should we believe your views, let alone care what you have to say?i guess it's easy to make up stuff when you have no idea what's going on (or the testes to actually make a definitive statement without hiding behind phrases like ""i heard"" and ""someone told me"". ). so go away useless weasel troll."
7/8/2010,"again, what is really at stake here is far worse than some simple nda breach or other trivial issue. you guys are thinking waaaayyyy too small and insignificant. i don't think ankh will be suing anyone. if she's very lucky ccp will sweep this under the rug and nobody will find out what really happened."
7/8/2010,"sorry, but i'm afraid i don't speak 'intrigue'."
7/8/2010,i would be surprised if anyone gave a damn about the csm after this incident.
7/8/2010,the csm just got a lot better lookin.
7/8/2010,"my god what a way to wake up.eve drama, best drama."
7/8/2010,"what? are you kidding? drama is eve's bread and butter. the weeks leading up to the csm were full of interesting scenarios and all kinds of rumors etc., and it drew a lot of attention from the playerbase as well as those outside of the game entirely. the infamous larkonisgate didn't kill interest in the csm - why would this?what does make people not care about the csm is the ultimate revelation that, despite the csm being a stakeholder in theory, they have zero practical weight and don't even have any dedicated developer or game designer resources. it's a paper tiger and the information brought back from the recent trip proved that beyond any doubt."
7/8/2010,she is space obama
7/8/2010,god i love this game
7/8/2010,less cloak and more dagger please.
7/8/2010,"he means civil strike! uprising! down with ccp. why do you people care so much if she got kicked or not, who honestly cares?"
7/8/2010,"look, no one, not even finn, opposed ankh's candidacy more than i did. that said i simply do not trust ccp here, especially not after t20. for ccp to sack a csm member not long after she made a very vocal blog post excoriating them simply does not seem kosher. yes, finn is correct that they have absolutely every right to do so, but then i have every right to give a .44 magnum a blowjob--it doesn't mean that i should. ccp should give the players at least some kind of further information if at all possible, for their own pr as much as anything else.frankly, at this point, i don't know which of them to trust less."
7/8/2010,"t20 was punished for his actions and dragging this dead horse into a discussion every single time ccp does something that players disagree with is getting really freaking old.ccp is well aware of the pr this causes, they can<U+FFFD>t possibly be unaware and they still came to the conclusion that they should.and while i would love to hear the details, i doubt ccp will deviate from the way they<U+FFFD>ve dealt with stuff like this in the past 7 years.but i trust ccp, it<U+FFFD>s a business, if a business makes a decision that appears to be bad for business there where reasons behind it that we don<U+FFFD>t know that are good for business."
7/8/2010,bellum posting random trolling on my eve forums :non-shocker:
7/8/2010,given that ccp have allowed (and by implication approved) of people conducting 'out of game' personal attacks via these forums and over at sc (run by a ccp employee) including some very juvenile but potentially serious 'real life' threats - dont be surprised if lawyers do get involved.
7/8/2010,"um, except that ccp and the csm and ankh herself have all said that this does not relate directly to csm 5.incidentally, where are all the ankhlings who were calling for larkonis trassler to be permabanned? one assumes that this news simply hasn't spread yet, and they will call for ankh to also be permabanned perhaps later today?"
7/8/2010,"anyway.....i do not know her, but given she run for dutch parliament for the pirate party makes a nda violation very plausible. we all know the pirate party gives a rats behind about intelectual and copyright laws, so i wouldn't be suprised if she has breached the nda because in her opinion it means nothing.also i have red her statements and her website, and based on that i conclude miss jobse likes herself very much, thinks she is extremely important while in reality she is not, and is not afraid to lie or twist the truth to get what she wants. based on this i conclude i don't like her. i also strongly suspect a case of narcissism here.i do not know what happened, but in am pretty sure ccp is in the right here.anyway, she lives in, which is a city i frequent regularly and know a lot of people. i will ask around for more juicy bits.removed personal data - adida"
7/8/2010,"again this whole mess proves that the csm as an idea works, but practically it's just a way for people to score a free trip to iceland, and to feel important ""representing the people'. well nuts to that. i wish ccp would take a page from cedega's book. subscribers can bring issues to ccp which get published on a website - and every subscriber has one vote per month they can give out. the highest votest entry gets worked on. the csm could still be there as a checks-and-balances body so we can be sure there's no ideas being floated and voted that implement flying pink *****es in eve.now *that* would be representing the people."
7/8/2010,"larkonisgate:detractors: you ****ing pirate! omg how dare you! ban his ass! forum ban should be game ban!supporters: way to get caught noob. you should've known better.alphabetsoup sacked:detractors: give us the goods. she probably deserved it.supporters: omg leave her alone! just leave her alone!one side seems to have been much more drama llama about this than the other; consistently through both sackings but on different sides of the candidate. then again, the other side knows how to troll the first from here to iceland and back.i for one welcome our [censored hacker name] supported, free-trip to iceland (too late!), vote for me i'm a chick, new csm member."
7/8/2010,"look it's been said already, but let's have ti again:ankh was not kicked because of her ccp-critical blogging. at least 3 others of the csm have been at least as critical of ccp.ccp, csm members and ankh herself have all confirmed that this is connected with something that happened in a previous csm, and is nothing to do with csm5 (at least not directly)"
7/8/2010,"""in my opinion, the current csm is the best and most productive so far, and i look forward to working with the other council members the coming year!"""
7/8/2010,i consider this and excellent change to the csm.
7/8/2010,"you said that earlier, quickly followed by a post saying you were just guessing and had no idea. so what is it this time, do you actually have information we dont have or are you guessing again?"
7/8/2010,"what's all this csm about?anyway... vote me for your next csm representative, i like beer, food and eve. i look awesome and that is about it!rar rar rar!"
7/8/2010,"no, it had nothing to do with her blog, i already posted that on like, the second page or something ><how thick are you? i already clarified this (several times in fact): multiple csm members including me voiced the same sentiments that she did, in fact i was the first to do so, and none of us have been reprimanded for it because it contained no nda sensitive material. that forces us to conclude that ankh wasn't kicked from the csm because of that."
7/8/2010,"tbh that was unexpected. i would say that a member that has been on the csm for a couple of times should know what or what not to say that falls under the nda.anyways, i want to see details as everybody else, but i suppose this is one of the ongoing investigations of ccp (just like 6nj) that goes on for 6 months & we get some jack **** post that isn't really informative at all. still, an unexpected turn of events, and i really want to see how this plays out. for the hordes out there trying to satisfy their needs for drama, this will help you while you wait for official news:push this button"
7/8/2010,"i think ccp owes the community a full disclosure on this topic. leaving it to rumors and speculation will cause more damage down the road than it will now. it'll come out sooner or later, not a matter of if, but a matter of when."
7/8/2010,"links or it didn't happen.all ankh has said is that it wasn't the blog and that she doesn't agree with them. all ccp has said can be summed up as ""she broke nda. we don't want to tell you why."" as for csm members, i only count sok as speaking for the legitimacy of the claim. the others have only commented on ankh, or confirmed that the blog wasn't involved.personally, i'd like to see mynxee comment on the matter. she's seemed to take a middle road on the ankh controversy in the past (both acknowledges that ankh has issues, yet fairminded enough to recognize and respect the anti-ankh campaign).certainly, ankh leaving the csm is not that a huge loss.but, the very fact that csm was created in response to internal corporate dishonesty and favoritism from ccp employees does affect this matter. especially because ccp has, so far, given csm the same treatment you give a group of touring kindergardners (oh that's a great idea sweety! now run along and play while the grown ups do real work. here's a crown to make you feel special- smile for the cameras!).while it is their official policy, and legal right, to stay quiet, it definitely does not do well for them pr wise.all it takes is a simple ""while serving under the term as csm member, ank divulged sensitive information to a third party."" nda agreements are quite purposefully left extremely broad, so it is very possible (especially considering ccp's track record) that they found a technicality to use to kick her out simply because they did not like her. if the ""reason"" is something she did x months/years ago, then that is just an asinine excuse to can her out of favoritism.keep the details - it's confidential, i totally understand the need to protect proprietary information. do, however, point to a specific form of breach.after all, this whole thing started when a certain unnamed spy uncovered questionable activity, and was banned for bringing it up to ccp in a petition as that was ""breaking the eula."""
7/8/2010,"i completely agree with that, and more openness has been requested. as it stands now the rampant speculation going on isn't doing anyone any good - people are even suggesting that 'we' are using a cheap excuse to 'get rid of her'."
7/8/2010,"oh.........my.........god........can space politics get any better?and to all those who are saying this is bad pr for the csm and ccp, think again. there is no such thing as bad pr. pr is pr. more people are talking about space politics now than ever before. the issues that are being discussed may not be the best thing for game development but i bet this is sending shock waves throughout the mmorpg industry and players of all games will eventually hear of this in some form or another. they may think negatively or positively towards the actions of ccp but they are thinking about ccp and eve.i would like at some point a statement from ccp detailing the actual breach of the nda, however this would remove a lot of the drama and rumours that are spreading through new eden and elsewhere out of game."
7/8/2010,"all seems very arbitrary to me, reminds me of certain despotic goverments trying to pretend they are diplomatic when in fact they are not.i would have expected at least a report and details of the breach before the member of the csm was removed from position,i suspect there is more here than what is being disclosed to us."
7/8/2010,"oh yes i quite agree that ccp could give us more information about the kind of thing that (they think) she did. i'm just saying that there's no evidence at all that this is anything to do with her criticizing them in that blog of hers.you might want to consider the legal implications though. if - as people are speculating - they did kick her because they suspect her of leaking nda info to a competitior, well then that's their right, and they're probably right to have a ""better safe than sorry"" policy. i'd do the same (although i'd probably use spoongate as a pretext or something, but hey, we all know ccp understands pr like a randy boar in a sow shed understands romance)but if they said that in public, without very hard evidence, then they'd be opening themselves up to a huge legal liability. ankh would have very good grounds for suing them for significant damages.tl;dr: ccp were probably right to do what they did, although as usual they handled it in :ccp: fashion. now that someone with a clue has pointed this out to them they're doing their usual clamshell routine, and they're right to do that too."
7/8/2010,linkage
7/8/2010,"what exactly gives ccp the right to remove her from the csm? the members are chosen by us, not by ccp. i see that they have the right to not listen to anyone and not provide any information or services, but is it for them to tell who are our voices?i'd need more information before i could honestly remove support for her. as it stands now, she's still my voice towards ccp, and ccp is willfully ignoring my indirect voice without giving me a substantiated reason."
7/8/2010,pretty sure i didn't say that.
7/8/2010,wow. just wow. ignoring everything else (like breaching a contract) are you seriously asking what gives a private company the right to remove a volunteer from one of it's programs?
7/8/2010,"correct, seems you quoted him & i quoted you quoting him & then it somewhere messed up. fixed now."
7/8/2010,"you have been paying too much attention to the politicians. the csm has no power except that which ccp temporarily gives it. it was created for pr purposes, and all the huffing about accountability is because ccp screwed up the expectations management and allowed players to think that csm would be allowed to do anything other than present player feedback in person. this removal has made it abundantly clear that ccp has the power to unilaterally remove delegates, and i see no visible objections from the same people who were huffing about accountability and transparency last week."
7/8/2010,"the loss of ankh may prove in the longer term to be a positive for the csm. i would hope it will encourage players to be more circumspect in their selection of a candidate and the 'drama bomb' bring the csm to the attention of more players (even bad news is good pr).my greatest concern for the csm is, and has always been, its focus as a personality contest. either players have been selected for the csm because they're minor eve celebs or they apply to the csm to become a minor eve celeb. what the csm hasn't done (as far as i can tell) is actually worked as a collective - its still a disparate group of individuals all clamouring for their place in the spot light. my preference (before the first csm) was that players ran and promoted themselves as players - not on the basis of their in game persona's. in the same vein rather than have player x or y post the outcomes of the csm perhaps there should be a csm avatar - an anonymous 'alt' who posts on behalf of the csm as a whole.the minutes and so forth rather reflect this ""ank said, sok said"" etc etc. we dont really need to know who in the csm said what - what matters is the end result, not the unsightly process that goes on in the background.c."
7/8/2010,you know what's silly? people demanding that ccp discloses the information that was leaked to justify their actions even though that information is sensitive enough to require a nda to assure confidentiality.
7/8/2010,"one of my votes went to ankh.i was stating to be a bit annoyed about some of her shenanigans like listing herself as a ccp employee in linkedin. still, to some forum warriors great dismay, she was doing her job.the ball is in ccp's side now, why was the second most voted csm booted?does this exoneration have something to do with her critical stance?csm's credibility is on the line here. i mean, if ankh. went batshift insane we, the players, deserve the true story and not some canned ""not in our logs"" text."
7/8/2010,because she breached the nda?(/flex thread title reading skills).
7/8/2010,because she broke an ndano.reading is difficult i take it!
7/8/2010,"this.then again, i've consistently been able to prove that harcore carebears are ""psychotic virigins"" as ankh likes to call the pirates more than any other player.afterall, i get actual death threats during hulkageddon.inappropriate content removed.applebabe"
7/8/2010,"hmm sadly i don't see much good come of this and the way it's being handled.. i don't really care about ankhesem-->ankh being kicked from the csm, especially if she did something wrong, but what now?without the csm members knowing what it's all about how can they know they're not crossing some line (as mentioned, some blog posts could be viewed as breaking nda, i highly doubt being negative about ccp counts, i think everyone who likes the game is or has been negative about ccp for extended amount of time, although, yeah, great timing there ccp )?and what about the replacement csm member? ankh had quite a lot of votes and not all of them would have voted for the replacement.. in politics you would either get someone from the same party to replace someone, or new elections.. in fact, looking at the results you can see the 'reserve members' had very little between them, 6 votes between 3 people.. in fact those three people had barely more votes combined than ankh to start with. i can imagine to some voters this would seem rather odd, especially knowing the difference between the politics of mazz and ankh.. obviously serious business and all, but if ccp really wants the csm to be the elected representation of the players (that vote), they might want to reconsider the replacement scheme../me wonders if this whole matter will lead to a better csm and eve"
7/8/2010,"while it is true that ""well known"" characters have an easier time getting elected, it is also by virtue of them having a deeper, or more thorough, understanding of the game, or at least one particular aspect thereof. also they tend to have a large follower base in cases of alliance leadership. however i disagree with the rest of your argument.most of the people elected to the csm are already well known, and those who weren't haven't become more famous in the process. i can assure you that the csm did and does work as a collective most of the time, that is clearly visible during the iceland meetings if nowhere else. there is however no denying that people have differing opinions, experiences and obectives, but this doesn't prevent things being accomplished, on the contrary. it is through the exchange of ideas that the csm works best.as far as the elections go, people frequently tout their qualities as a person before their in-game persona, the latter being used as credential to attest of their knowledge (while also serving as a role of vote grabbing through name recognition).an anonymous csm avatar could work for some things, not so for others.the minutes reflect each member's opinions and ideas, as they are held and presented during the debates that happen. you seem to think that people having different opinions and arguing about proposals is a bad thing, i believe it is its greatest strength for without a contrary opinion, nobody would try and assert the validity of the claims. the process is as important as the end result, and while the end result should (and do) come from ""the csm"", the process of arriving at that conclusion is a vital part and comes from the members. as a voter, you would want to know where the elected members stand, how they argue for/against things..."
7/8/2010,calling bs hel. im still waiting on some goons and triple aaas to fly to afie and hurt me hahahah plus seeing as how the few ccp devs and mods that play all seem to think npc corps are all rmters and do nothing about their buddys macro ratting in null and low sec. etc etc etc we should certainly believe ccp csm will not get better just look at the person who got the most votes. we should believe someone who won due to block voting by lemmings in alliances etc? is going to due anything other than whine about poor low sec cry babys or how zero zero ith the last amount of pop in game deserves etc etc. funny how all these people i mention above hated ank and love ccp always defend low sec null ratting macros while screaming abut mining macros. anyway csm was just away for some fanbois to get free trips anyway. as for them makeing remarks against ccp in blogs? hahhahaha if you guys call that critizing let me send yall a copy of barny the purple dino so yall can sing along.
7/8/2010,"and therein lies the fundamental problem with the csm.only the csm should remove members from the csm.ccp should not be able to mess with the csm.while the csm remains as it is, it will forever remain irrelevant to all. it's a pointless branch of ccp that was born of extremely dubious origins which not only is it unable to have any influence on, all it's siginificantly managed to do is introduce a new level of corruption to the game.ccp have managed to create the illusion of choice and power, and yesterday managed to demonstrate to all that all those votes count for nothing when ccp decide they count for nothing. i feel it remains only a matter of time until the proof of electoral fixing comes along, there is simply no reason for ccp to hold a fair election for an irrelevant body which they can simply choose to ignore or disassemble at their convenience.since there is no electoral monitoring, ccp can save themselves a lot of uncertainty and campaign fixing by simply counting only the votes they have predecided to count.ccp's marketing jerk will be counting the column inches this affair is generating and putting in for a pay rise, this has got to be worth a new volvo at the very least."
7/8/2010,"""during this time, the media company submarine took an interest in eve online for the documentary they were making, ""another perfect world"". they approached me, and accompanied me to iceland. later on, i assisted submarine with the development of their documentary, providing them with valuable footage""quoting from her portfolio website, during her time as previous csm candidate"
7/8/2010,"if some of the rumors that i've heard (from multiple sources) are true and i have good reason to believe that they are, ankh is a little pink and yellow-striped alien from a planet omicron persei 8. if the real truth comes out about what she (allegedly) is, breaking an nda or mouthing off on some blog will seem like a drop in comparison.can anyone be even more vague about anything then your post is? hollow accusations without any proof or backing are just part of an irresponsible witch-hunt.and no, i do not white-knight for her either, because some of the things she said and did were outright silly, if not to say idiotic. but some people here really need to take a step back and think about their own behaviour."
7/8/2010,finally one reason to extend game time.
7/8/2010,so i asume that now that ank is gone there will be no: arrest pirates for days in stations when they did crime! good riddance...
7/8/2010,"im not convinced that well known characters have a deeper understanding of the game - they may be more vocal but that's about it.in my view the csms role is to represent the player base and their views. not to debate those views and come up with their own ideas. too often the csm seems to be trying to act as defacto game designers .id agree with this.arguing about proposals is one thing, doing it publicly is another. again in my view the csm should be approaching ccp and saying 'x % of the player base thinks this idea is good. y % disagreed. we saw the following pros and cons of this idea. what's ccps view? > and then report back to the player base.personally i'm not too bothered about how an individual csm member argues for a given point as that information appears to just exacerbate the personality cult issue. if the minutes reported 5 voted for, 5 against that would be fine for me.continuing to report on every comment that comes from a csm member only serves to perpetuate the impression that its a continuing popularity contest for individuals.the recent ""no new content - fix the game!"" approach was so vague as to be nearly laughable. it was simply a popularist appeal to the masses: who wouldn't want the game to be 'fixed'? c."
7/8/2010,"agreed.even if they don't tell us the specifics of what she is alleged to have done, they really need to give more information in order to reassure the player base that there isn't any foul play going on here."
7/8/2010,bye bye.
7/8/2010,sok bandwagon? you mean the one you got on to even get on the csm for a free trip?typical fanboi response just what i expected from one. i notice most of the bandwagon is the ones attacking ank( cant spell and had no idea she was european which explains alot). seems most of you are just mad the person got more votes from individual players than your tight little groups of block voters. ah well got to love hypocrits especially ones posting about a single person thats no worse than they are them selves.
7/8/2010,"christ, 7 wasted votes. oh well.."
7/8/2010,just in time for hulkageddon!
7/8/2010,cccp stop being obtuse and release a statement on why exactly she was removed. the csm is public process voted in by eve neckbeards so those same neckbeards have a right to know why someone who voted in (lol) is no longer there. being all hush hush leads to wild speculation which does not help your case in anyway.as a denizin of the eve universe and csm voter i demand our right for information be upheld!also we are still missing those iceland minutes
7/8/2010,"""in the name of ankhesentapemkah, ships shall be built to carry our warriors out amongst the stars, and we will spread sense to all the carebears."" <U+FFFD>hallowed are the gangships"
7/8/2010,really good come back there bud. so your an idiot(ingame) makes a personal attack ok. haha and thank you for proving my point. but hey you should be proud as a fanboi you can type better than me! now back to the topic why all the hatred? granted some idiotic rants and posts but no worse than 2/3rds of the stuff you see on eve forums. so from where i sit(personal opinion unlike most posters here i dont claim to speak for all of eve)you guys just did not like the fact ank got so many votes is all i can figure out. if ank broke the rules fine but seems kind of fishie for ccp not to state the reason. but then again csm being what it is a neat little stunt for pr only i can see why they dont care.
7/8/2010,you really haven't a clue lol.
7/8/2010,you really think csm is anything more than (failed) pr stunt?
7/8/2010,"it's not, its a terrific troll devised to lure people like you and the dud above into poasting the samne things over and over and over again"
7/8/2010,"i'm a complete lurker on this forum, but anyhow; this whole incident has left a real nasty taste in the mouth.i don't really agree with much ankh said, i never voted for her, and maybe she wasn't the most harmonious member of the csm. however, the recent statement by ccp that they won't be commenting is, basically, a joke. of the stated reasons they've given/allowed to spread, most of them are bunk, especially this one:-""we can't disclose more info without making the nda breach worse."" that's rubbish, actually. even ""the nda breach concerned elements of our upcoming [x] feature or [y] expansion, in [z] year"" would be sufficient.fact is, this is just further evidence that ccp need to employ someone vaguely aware of what's going on right now, and just how bloody awful all of their pr/support people actually are.(remaining csm members, keep up the good work.)edit: exact wording from their announcment:""as this is a matter regarding confidential data we do consider this to be a private issue between eva and ccp, therefore we are unable to comment further.""the first half of this is garbage, really. legal challenges could actually prevent them disclosing information, but if so, this stated reason is merely a smokescreen to hide away future potential legal issues."
7/8/2010,"out of interest, what information would satisfy you given that they obviously can't repeat the nda breach?"
7/8/2010,this is better than real life politics.removed spam - adida
7/8/2010,"i feel compelled to comment here on a few things. the original post subject is: ""ankhesentapemkah removed from csm due to nda breach."" ccp are the owners of this game. they own the processes behind the game and any forums and communications to and from players, media, and other important stakeholders. if they see a clear breach of a mutually agreed contract, then they must act.now, did they act appropriately in this regard? this is the question. was it right? well we certainly don't know do we? nor do the csm!? comments were raised about poor communications from ccp and i'm compelled to agree 100%. private matters are always to be respected but their ""statement"" about this incident was not good communications at all and only led to further speculation and frustration. any he said, she said comments are not helpful at all. the tragedy here is that (as far as i understand) the rest of the csm don't know the grounds (or details) on which ank was expelled so it's next to impossible for them to make a unified statement on the issue. we're all left with a 'wtf' feeling at the moment. one thing is for sure, you can't sweep up problems under the rug either. i mean, how can we expect csm to respond to something that has been essentially done from an outside entity, with no details or reasoning beyond the exclusive statement of ""breach of nda?""all parties involved need to understand that all of this certainly does challenge the integrity of the whole csm concept and electoral processes. this is not to the fault of the current csm members but the idea that an ""democratic, player elected group of people representing the player base"" can be dismantled by ccp with no details, no statement of grounds, no details given to the csm, or even the chair person of the csm is plain unprofessional. the comment that all pr is good pr is (imo) partially true and a valid comment in many cases. however, due to the nature by which csm is assembled, utilized, and appreciated (or not...by some of the player base and perhaps ccp too??), i wonder if incidents like this really are 'good' for any party or whether the groups of haters and skeptics (of which i am not one btw ) only continue to increase in numbers as these parties keep on shooting themselves in the foot.there's so much that csm 'could be' and so much i believe this csm is 'trying to be' but does ccp really care what they say anymore? do they really care about what the players are thinking anymore? i mean, if the csm isn't working, fix it...but it's got to be together, right?this incident does show, however, one thing which i find tragic....they are not 'together' even in a situation that they really must be in order to maintain the integrity that has been built up around this concept from its inception. from what i see, though it's not due to csm not wanting the co-operation but the ball seems to be once again in ccp's court. the eve world watches in confusion...and we all still wait for the summit meeting minutes as well. meeting minutes....this long, guys??"
7/8/2010,so was she banned from playing eve as well?
7/8/2010,"actually u got it all wrong, a lot of the ppl i know including me dislikes ank but voted for her in hopes of some added drama, and she lived up to all our expectations"
7/8/2010,"so, what are we going to call this very very funny scandal?spoongate?"
7/8/2010,"nothing to do with any spoons, nothing to do with blogs...let's call it the ""unfortunate departure of a controversial person for reasons that can't be made public, that lots of people are happy about (and others not so much)"""
7/8/2010,since its pretty obvious you lack any sort of critical thinking skills do everyone else a favor and refrain from voting in anything ever again
7/8/2010,what makes you think there has not been one already.
7/8/2010,intriguing. i wonder if this was the cause. *shrugs*
7/8/2010,"well my opinion,the csm was a failed pr job right from the beginning, trying to give a company that is more about modelling the players to their game, than the game to it's players, a caring look.until i get proved wrong, i will stay with the conviction, that eva was just not eve enough to carry the fig leaf, pretending that ccp actually followed any advice coming from the csm. she devalued an expensive pr campaign, so they found a reason to get rid of her.well, after all, all that does not mater much. ccp will do, as ccp does. either you accept that or leave."
7/8/2010,"we all know this was merely a coverup to hide the fact that ccp and the other csm members found out ankh was an insectoid alien who had stolen the skin of some poor woman. after a heroic battle they managed to drive it over the edge of a volcano, resulting in an eruption that grounded flights for weeks all over europe."
7/8/2010,hopefully the csm will be disbanded soon.
7/8/2010,funny sok the great and allpowerful csm is a troll complaining about people voicing their opinion and since it doesnt agree with his they are trolls? and people call people voting for ank stupid. doesnt really matter just proves the fact csm is a joke for a free trip
7/8/2010,"as a member of the pirate party uk, i'd like to emphasise that this statement is factually incorrect -- we care an awful lot about copyright law, and think that copyright is a worthwhile concept, but we think that how it works needs to be modified a bit. i encourage people who want to find out more about the pirate movement to check out our manifesto. please sling your mud elsewhere. between reading csm5 logs, spoongate, and now this, it seems to me that ankh is a complete headcase. i'm slightly puzzled as to how ppnl ever thought she'd make a good politician."
7/8/2010,"you already have been proven wrong and are basing your conejctures on nothing, so please, change your conviction, tia.these attempts to make her look like some sort of hero really are pathetic.removed a personal attack - adida"
7/8/2010,"not catchy enough, i like spoongate better"
7/8/2010,i liked this suggestion:
7/8/2010,"how mature of you, sokratesz. how about getting yourself a shower and cooling your head down a bit? ankh isn't really a perfect csm (or was), but you certainly should do better then that."
7/8/2010,"if jacqui smith can be home secretary, i don't see why ankh cant be a politician. in fact the very aspects of ank's character that we dislike seems to be on ethat ideally qualify her for the job."
7/8/2010,"agreed, that kind of behavior should be beneath someone in your position"
7/8/2010,"pretty good summary. the chances of us getting an answer to those questions is near nil tho. ccp will either just leave this matter without comment, or they will pull another pr blog post (or make csm do it for them), where they divert the subject.it's quite ironic how the csm actually gives ccp more tools of hiding things from players, instead of actually giving the transparency it was supposed to. and what boggles me, is why players accept this blindly. ccp got all rights, yeah, but we gotta stop being idiots and make sure they close down that pr stunt to put those rl money to good use instead."
7/8/2010,"too late to derail attention from the fact you just made a complete fool of yourself on this thread while using the ""csm"" tag, so enjoy it while you can, because it -will- be brief.that is all. goodbye."
7/8/2010,"confirming that i will vote for sokratesz because they make people see things that aren't really there.also confirming bateh will form out mist next election and single-handedly sabotage your chances of victory, sok. seriously, people need to calm down. it isn't the end of the world.just ankhesencopypasta."
7/8/2010,"yes, please speak english...and use a french word."
7/8/2010,"as far as i'm aware it is the csm's rsponsibility to bring to the attention of ccp, the playerbase's likes and dislikes, fears and wants, etc.so, what absurd policy allows the csm to have information the rest of the playerbase doesn't?seems to me the csm are getting a little ****y and over stepping there mark.ankhesentapemkah should not have had access to anything the community does not have access to, its supposed to go one way csm to ccp, not ccp to csm.are the csm developers now? or just a conduit for the playerbase?i want this, i tell the csm, the csm tells ccp, ccp say ok or no.not:i want this, i tell the csm, the csm discusses over biscuits and tea the intricicies and possible flaws of implementing such and idea in which they are given excuses containing information they should not have, nothing gets done.or, maybe it's just me that sees the huge flaw in that practice."
7/8/2010,"cleared up spam, off topic, trolling, and personal attacks."
7/8/2010,"*le sigh* you have a very valid point there (particularly ironic as that is part of the reason she got so many votes in the first place). so i suppose we can just get our kicks from the drama, and find every opportunity to grief ccp for their tyrannical nature - might as well give em the pr they so desperately crave. i feel sorry for the ccp devs that are actually cool people. it can't be too fun to work in an environment where you have to walk on eggshells to avoid corporate retribution.last time i checked, meissa is not an alt for mynxee ;)"
7/8/2010,"not implying that this is tied to ankhe's issue in any way. it may or may not be the case, the nda covers many things...the relationship between ccp and the csm goes both way, we're not just there to ***** and moan on behalf of the players, we're there to engage in meaningful dialog with ccp, provides them with feedback on what they're working on, etc.to answer your question, the csm gets regularly presented with information the players don't have. that ""nda information"" usually falls into several categories:- features that are planned and being discussed. ccp uses the csm as a sounding board to see how these ideas are received, what improvements the player would want to them, etc. (cfr. fleet finder, for instance).- modifications to existing features. same as the above, see how well they are received. the nature of which might be changing a lot of things with regards to tactics, markets, etc. and as such aren't publicized ahead of time.- changes to the game that may or may not make it into the game. when developing a game, the evaluation of how much time something will take to implement is not easy to evaluate, in addition to which some problem may get in the way. ccp sometimes choses to disclose features to the csm while not talking about it to the playerbase at large to get better expectation management. ie, so half of the playerbase doesn't emorage ""but you promised this!"", as they usually do (most of the time for a reason, i might add :p). keeping some things under veil sometimes helps in that regard.- sensitive data with regards to defense against and extent of hacking attempts, rmt, macroing, etc. where the information being available to the bad guys would be detrimental in ccp's effort of fighting them.so, the csm is a conduit that goes both ways."
7/8/2010,"don't be silly and stop trying to act all high and mighty, that ccp is inappropriate content removed.applebabe!"
7/8/2010,why is this so necessary? the very nature of a nda breach implies sensitive information was divulged to a third party. releasing information beyond that (the acknowledgement of event) only serves to increase the risk of the sensitive information in question being further exposed.
7/8/2010,"you guys do realize pr is not short for ""publicity"" but for ""public relations."" what you just said does not make any sort of sense if you substitute pr with ""public relations"" rather than ""publicity."""
7/8/2010,"i don't see what's wrong with ankhgate. ankhbreaksthenda is pretty funny too, but the shady nature of the announcement makes me wonder if she actually did anything other than make a bad impression.you do make a very valid point. nonetheless, given ccp's history (t20, ""nozh smash abathur,"" ""ccp will not commit to any requests, but thanks for the visit"") it is very difficult (and i would even say imprudent) to give them the benefit of the doubt. when you abuse trust through consistent negligence, you can hardly get away with ""just trust us, we're the good guys - honest.""but, i am new to eve, so perhaps i've only been hearing about the scandals. can anyone point out more than one case where ccp has said ""don't worry, we got your back, we just can't tell you yet"" and actually delivered?"
7/8/2010,"personally, i think ankhesentapemkah was removed from the csm because no one could pronounce her name.ccp: back to ankh's comment, i would say...ankhesentapemkah: i would like to be referred to by my full name!ccp: that's it! you're out! xix, do you have a problem with that?xixpuaskidadajalalapajpa1oaub: no, i'm quite happy with xix, thanks.disclaimer: the above dialog is completely made up fiction, and any similarities with actual events is purely coincidental. please don't ban me!"
7/8/2010,"no, actually. the only person who has managed to make a fool out of themselves in this issue is ankh. and you, just now, with your impotent eye-daggers post. sok is going to serve a whole year. at least he can be trusted to honor the legal agreements he makes.i think ccp deserves a prize for extracting the most epic rl tears tbqh. i'll talk with the guys about it."
7/8/2010,"first of allthank you for your responsei do believe however that the csm would function better as a ""one way street"" if you will, theres no reason the issues brought up by the csm need to be discussed by anyone other than ccp, the csm should be a medium and nothing more.unfortunatly for ccp, they have created a game where, trolling, scamming and general grief are commonplace (and openly supported) it stands to reason that the playerbase would reflect this, and ccp appear rather blinkered in there expectations in that regard.i have always thought the csm as you described in the above quote is generally a good idea, unfortunately when it comes to eve it is proven to not be so, and so it is logical to find a common ground.it appears this is going to be a lesson hard learned by ccp, and it is unfortunate that people such as yourself are being dragged down by those with an innability to handle real-life responsibility (at least as far as the csm goes)in closing, the only way the csm will function in a meaningful way, as you described in the quote above is either without elections or extensive vetting of all candidates.again, thank you for your time."
7/8/2010,"edit: nevermind, i shouldn't be allowed to post so early in the morning, as i tend to misread easily to begin with."
7/8/2010,"there could be any number of reasons why ccp has chosen not to state exactly what eva did. hell, it may even be to protect her reputation from further damage. with larkonis it was an in-game thing that only had consequences with gameplay specifically. whatever eva did could be much broader and deal with much more sensitive things."
7/8/2010,ccp claims that the idea of the csm is a better communication between players and ccp. then it is kinda weird not communicate about the csm to the players if the entire idea was to communicate.
7/8/2010,"you forgo the entire idea, namely that there's things that ccp doesn't want to be public, and that's their bloody right."
7/8/2010,"discussion about forum moderation is not allowed.applebabeanyway,the problem with csm is that it's character linked!"
7/8/2010,"discussions on forum moderation are not allowed.applebabein any event, i had enough curiosity about the event to scan this thread. after reading some of the wild comments, i honestly couldn't care less about the story behind ankhgate. reality simply couldn't live up to this hype."
7/8/2010,"hello redlion, would you be kind enough to say more about what you mean by character-linked? for instance, would you have csm candidates run as rl persons and not be allowed to overtly or covertly link themselves to ingame characters? if i am understanding you correctly, it is an interesting idea, and i'd like to hear more. delilah"
7/8/2010,"yeah, but i heard this crazy rumor that, like, by ""better communication"", they were totally talking about regarding gameplay issues and concerns, yo."
7/8/2010,"in regards of this. my impression is that csm candidates get voters by having opinions similar to a certain type of players (be it hisec dwellers, lowsec etc).after they have been voted into ""office"", the candidates work purely on their own agenda (i'm not sure this is correct).what i would like to see is the voters actually forming the followers of their candidate, coming forth with ideas, improvements to their candidate. basicly a dialogue between voters of that specific cadidate and the candidate himself/herself. so it isn't just a personal agenda.the followers could collect data, do extensive research and what would work and why etc. and it all get's filtered, in a way, through the csm candidate and ccp gets more than just one opinion."
7/8/2010,"as a (mostly former) patent attorney i've had a lot of trade come my way because ndas are a somewhat precarious way to keep sensitive corporate data confidential. it is therefore something of a leap of faith for ccp to disclose information to the csm under nda, and i think that should be acknowledged.as for the present circumstances, well, i know jack like everyone else. if the breach was a serious one, i think it is understandable that ccp would want to close the whole issue down without any further comment; it is not beyond the realms of the imagination to assume that some people in ccp are quite anti-csm and would rather not disclose anything in the first place (probably the lawyers \m/ if not senior management) so the people running the csm in ccp are probably under a fair bit of pressure here. of course if there was more politicking involved and the breach was not significant, but more of a ruse to oust an unpopular member of the csm, then saying nothing more about it would be somewhat scandalous and a continuation of the issues that the csm was set up to address.which of these possibilities is it? i don't know and i wouldn't expect to know, but in my experience companies are not usually as evil as people would like to believe, and ccp in all fairness does put up with a lot of bs from the playerbase with relatively good grace, so i personally believe there is a significant issue and ccp have their hands tied in how to deal with it. it therefore falls to the csm to do their job and to keep prodding ccp about the issue and to communicate clearly to the playerbase what they find out. emotions are high right now but the csm really need to take a step back and start behaving as a more coherent, professional body (in my humble opinion).tl;dr: ccp can't really comment further regardless of the severity of the breach so we have to take it on faith (or not) that this is a serious issue."
7/8/2010,"my summary:-csm travel to iceland for a nice chat with ccp. csm ask ccp nicely, 'if you do really care about the players, please can you fix all the stuff that makes us unhappy?'ccp say, 'sorry we can't, half the company is working on a new game (dust) and the other half is working on what is sort of a new game (incarna) so none of that stuff is ever going to get fixed. we did have a quick look at it and realised that we can't fix it anyway because we don't know how, that's why we are working on new games, we're hoping people will forget about all that stuff that's wrong with eve when they can walk around stations and do fps type stuff.csm politely ask ccp, 'what's the point of the csm then as we can only raise current player concerns? these concerns revolve around the game that thousands of people are currently paying a monthly subscription to play; they would like it to work. they are not currently concerned about other games or future ccp projects.ccp reply 'the point of the csm is to persuade less intelligent eve players that ccp are doing something proactive about the on-going problems in eve. the csm is buying us time until we give the less intelligent eve players a new toy. our marketing gurus have told us that once they have a new toy theyll forget about lag etc and continue to happily subscribe without complaining. now csm, sign this and shut yer cakeholes if you want to keep getting your free trip to iceland.my conclusions:-most eve players dont know or care what the csm is. most eve players dont read this forum. ccp have no need to continue with their csm charade, no one cares. the majority will judge ccp products not by their promises of development, on-going support, de-bugging, streamlining or optimization they will simply ask the questions, is it fun, does it work, is it worth the money. whether or not ccp chose to listen to their players or not is up to them, but if their policy of releasing unfinished and untested products continues i suspect they will see the good sense of the public prevail. they will vote with their feet."
7/8/2010,"ccp call the creators of killzone 3, let them make your shiny fspget that team you have working on it back to solve the issues that are reported as that's exactly where your prioritys should be.sad she got asked friendly to shut the f... up! claim she did it not correctly, what a shame...."
7/8/2010,"i don't think it's a terribly big proposal to ask for some further information than what we've been given. we can't expect to learn it all, but something a little more concrete than we've received so far would a nice, and it wouldn't have to be written in an nda-breaching manner."
7/8/2010,"by way of response:and,- just so you're aware i acknowledge your comment even if your argument was shot down by guns trained on it more quickly than mine could be."
7/8/2010,"your summary is inaccurate.first of all, dust is not being worked on by ccp reykavik, but by ccp shanghai. a significant part of ccp resources are allocated to incarna + some new stuff. what we said are we do not know yet how much resources are going to be available for the things we deem important, they may be small or large, we just don't know. we think they are going to be small and are going to be unhappy if that's the case, but that's impossible to say before the expansion planning is finished, and that's not happened yet. so rushing and saying we won't get our requests heard is premature at this stage.also, your paraphrased ccp reply is incorrect. while there is no doubt that there is a gap between player's perception and that of some of the decision makers within ccp, ccp is giving us the tools to make our voice heard by, among others, appointing someone to attend the regular planning meetings that are held. if it was only paying lip service, they wouldn't do that.every csm that happens, we get more and more influence and tools to make our voice heard. it's a slow process to be sure, but ccp has the balls to try player representatives, so cut them some slack, we'll see how it goes before saying it fails.all the devs we meet seem genuinely interested in the feedback we give them and responsive to our requests. the big barrier we were yet to go through is getting our stuff into the release planning, and we got it this time. time will tell, i for one intend to make full use of the opportunity we're given..."
7/8/2010,i don't think you understand the situation. breaching an nda involves disclosing sensitive information to a 3rd party without authorization to do so.it is possible that by disclosing more specific details of the event that ccp could risk increased exposure of the sensitive information involved. you (all) also have to carefully consider that this most probably isn't something that occurred in-game but in fact quite out of it - a world not administered by ccp but by far greater powers with their own terms and conditions to be followed.
7/8/2010,"personal attack removed.applebabeccp are no saints, let's all get this into our heads pls.personal attack removed.applebabe but she did something that ****ed ccp off enough to do stupid things.this is interesting. it's interesting to see how ccp will handle this.if they are unable to cope with this in a way that will satisfy the very people thatpay them, they will prove to be more rotten than we all feared they are."
7/8/2010,"never said they're saints, far from it, however as much fun as bashing ccp is, it's unjustified in this instance. i resent you calling me inappropriate content removed.applebabebtw. i've never been a puppet, i'm here to break the dychotomy. what do you prefer? that i get in with the crowd and say ""yeah, ccp are idiots, they ignore us, this is just pr"" or provide a point of view that's actually thought out and representative of my experience in dealing with ccp for the past 2 years?also, i've been labelled a few things, but never ignorant... whatever...my opinion about ankhe has been clear for a long while and is visible in many places on this forum and elsewhere, i don't think i need to repeat that (it's in line with yours, only a bit moreso :p)i agree ccp could handle this ""eva being kicked"" a bit better, but their maneuvering margin is narrow, and i don't think they could disclose exactly what she did, how they figured it out, etc. not just yet anyway..."
7/8/2010,"i understand that part. i'm just saying, there are ways to talk about the incident without revealing the information that was under the nda. they can give us more info while protecting their assets, can they not?"
7/8/2010,"dear fellow eve players and ccp.i'm aeliusbeen with eve since beta 4 back in december 2002.this is something i wanted to do for a long time for several reasons, the main reason being that i keep asking myself the same question:""how can i help eve become a better space mmo?""so it's my plan to run for the next csm.during this winter (northern hemisphere) i hope to have enough rl time to come up with a strong candidacy to do just that. run for elections and win a seat in csm. i realise that the actual csm was just formed, and some of you might think this is, perhaps, premature. but i want to have time to grow up support, to ear the players and ccp, to have a better understanding what needs to be done and what people want, so i am fully ready as a candidate when the time comes.in this 1st post i want to ear, from you (players and ccp) what are the qualities required to a csm candidate to run for elections and win.ie: is he required to know code or to be a computer freak?are the ideas that he carries more important that the his technical capability?in case of winning a sit in csm, what is to be expected from such a person?please don't troll or flame, try to be constructive when replying.tks"
7/8/2010,"i wanna csm who just wants to watch new eden burn!no need for fancy excuses ""dont fly what you cant afford to lose"" or ""your fault for not x,y,z"" or ""i should be allowed play the way i want to play"".just let it burrnnnnnn"
7/8/2010,"to be perfectly honest, ccp's response to the current csm pretty much places the csm in line with such things as window dressing and fluff that has no meaning, or ability to do anything of value or worth. my personal opinion is that ccp just needs to finally admit the csm was nothing more than wool, to pull over the players eyes to shut them up while ccp continued to do the very things the csm was supposedly created to address in the first place.so.. what i am looking for in a csm candidate? nothing, because they do nothing, effect nothing, and mean exactly... nothing."
7/8/2010,"yeah i too get the feeling that the power of a csm stops at rearranging office furniture, or re filling the water cooler.latly semes like a bit of a school prom style popularity contest with the general eve player base as loosers.if you want to improve eve, improve csm itself and make sure they are listened to and things actually happen because of it."
7/8/2010,moved from general discussion to jita park speakers corner.
7/8/2010,"ccp wants you to be nice and just accept everything ccp says, without any kind of critical thought.players just want amusement out of csm since they dont have any influence anyway."
7/8/2010,"noted. my candidacy is not ""let's go to iceland meet the devs and have a beer with oveur"" kind of idea.i too have grasped during my eve years what you stated above. this candidacy was something i have put a lot of thought into along the years, theres a time when something must change, and my candidacy after more than 7 years in eve illustrates just that. i'm not the owner of the ultimate truth nor my plan is to go to iceland to tell them ccp how to run their own game, i have a very distinct and well visioned idea how things could be a lot better in eve.but... i also have very strong ideas on how a csm with ""true power"" could enhance the eve experience for all of us and for other players out there that never tried it before."
7/8/2010,"short version: ccp wants obedience and feedback that does not go against their perception of the state of the product, for succesfull pr. players want results, which requires long lasting and carefully executed professional approach.not a troll btw. just look at ccp's marketing efforts, compare to original statements on csm mission, scroll forward through time from there and keep watching the various dev interviews on gaming sites."
7/8/2010,"personally i'm looking forward to the minutes ccp release before passing judgement on this csmif it's anything similar to the qen ie a marketting stunt with very little real info then the csm is worthlessif it has some meat and potatoes discussions with more than simple ""ye ofc we'll fix that soon"" then maybe there is still hope.personnaly i want a candidate who understands that pve is part of this game as well as pvp and that while not everyone pvp's almost everyone pve's for isk and making pve more fun only adds to the game not detract, but i also pvp so i want someone who will help improve that side of things just as muchi don't want someone overzealous and bat**** crazy like ankh or someone who's only response to detractors is ""your stupid"" or ""good troll"" like sok.i like teadaze level headed responses to things, he seems good at standing back and looking at things objectively which is quite difficult with something you enjoy, but you also have to be able to stand up to ccp and say your ****ing wrong and not back down when they ""go defensive and bring out charts and tables"" after all thats what the csm is for imo"
7/8/2010,"from the latest scandel i would say someone who can keep there word and not break the non-disclosure agreement and knowing personaly that you are a stand up guy,honourable and trust worthy you get my vote.we need more people who would go out of there way to make eden a better place for all involved, be it carebearing, or those of the more violent persuasion. not just those who would use the position to line their or there friends pockets with isk."
7/8/2010,i dont need a csm member to 'have ideas'. i've got lots. so have others. you take our (the players) ideas and represent them. that's it. its not difficult but successive csms seem to have made it the most convoluted process imaginable.c.
7/8/2010,the potential to generate drama in large quantities is a desired quality.
7/8/2010,"they should bring the issues of the players to the csm, not have their own agenda and ignore everything else.they should be trustworthy (see larkonis and ankhesetapemkah for bad examples).they should be able to talk about any topic in a civilized manner. (see sokratesz for bad example).i think apart from the two mentioned above, the csm has a very good setup this year. especially mynxee and teadaze are doing their job very well."
7/8/2010,"that's my favorite complaint against elections. ""it's nothing but a popularity contest."" think about that for a few minutes and let me know when the ""well duh"" moment hits.(hint, a democratic election is, by very definition, a _______ ______)"
7/8/2010,"thats because csm is often used as a vanity fair for either players and/or alliances.good ideas and goals are related to second plan. fortunately i am not in a big alliance nor i have a big ego to defend. that is going to add an extra level of challenge to my candidacy since i am not ""notorious"" or ""famous"", but will give me the necessary focus to the task at hand."
7/8/2010,unfortunately it also means you will have to work absurdly hard to win sufficient votes - although its by no means impossible.c.
7/8/2010,"i don't agree that ccp want a sycophantic council, far from it. the direct and often critical feedback is well received and has resulted in some productive discussions the results of which will not be seen for many months. adding the csm's approval to something can support the devs within ccp who want to work on those specific features.i agree totally. i ran on that platform which is partly why i've been elected twice. over and above that i think player ideas should be presented to csm as raised by the players before any discussions start so that any changes made by csm are clearly documented. i believe in accountability and transparency of the csm process. sadly as seen recently we are sometimes restricted when ccp are involved in discussions due to nda etc...the issue raising process is pretty much unchanged since csm1 (though iirc entering items on the wiki was added later). csm5 have been discussing ways to improve the raising and supporting of issues by the players but i don't know when this will result in any improvement. as a stop gap we are working on tools to make tracking raised proposals easier and to add searching of existing issues.what people don't realise is that the csm process has been evolving all the time. the biggest change was with csm4 when the summit format changed and stakeholder status was granted. it would of course be nice to be able to point to a list of issues raised by players via csm which are now in game. whilst the csm does have some influence in setting priorities it doesn't have the absolute power to force ccp to develop anything. this is not a failing in the csm as such (other stakeholders within the eve project have exactly the same restriction) but players are a demanding bunch and without quick and tangible results they are quick to write-off the csm as a publicity stunt."
7/8/2010,"you just don't want to rock the boat because you want to work there? at least i am really starting to get that impression. either that, or you are very, very naive. let's be straight for a sec. while devs may love, and they probably do love, direct and critical feedback, the people who make the decisions don't. if they did, then a lot of things we've seen over the years would have been signalled by devs to their bosses and acted upon. look at how things were in the running up to dominion, great work, great support, everybody was happy. then what happened? yeah, half was torn out and they unleashed nozh, a very typical action to do."
7/8/2010,"i'm not naive, i am simply working with more information, such as items under nda and even the attitude and body language when talking to devs at the summit. trust me the boat was well and truly rocked during many discussions and ccp were actually surprised at the reaction to certain things devs working daily on a feature are not always able to see the shortcomings and escalate those to their bosses. there is a technique in programming called ""buddy checking"" to avoid this which is where you bring in a fresh pair of eyes who can frequently spot issues in the code which somebody who has spent weeks working on it has missed. a similar rule applies with testing, you need fresh eyes from somebody to see the problems you've missed.i've not worked under the scrum system, but by having a self contained team of game designers, programmers, qa and so on i wonder if they are too close to give objective feedback amongst themselves until it is too far advanced to make widescale changes. somebody with more experience of scrum should chime in though.the decision makers at ccp have made mistakes, sure. we called them out on on some. but to think that they stick their heads in the sand and ignore negative criticism is ridiculous. another problem is the long planning stages of a project like eve, the short term planning covers 6-12 months of development which doesn't leave much spare for working on additional issues. this isn't an excuse for inaction but it does add context.apocrypha was certainly a good expansion and it raised the expectations for dominion which in the end were not met (at least the players don't think they were and fleet fights etc certainly took a hammering).we spent a great deal of time criticizing various aspects of dominion at the csm4 summit. sadly it wasn't early enough in the dev cycle to discourage them from then rushing the release of tyrannis and so we spent a great deal of time criticizing that. i dislike forcing teams to hit arbitrary release dates and releasing whatever results (or dumping partly developed features, never to be completed). it would be better (imo) to have more flexible release schedules based on the progress of features.i'm hopeful that they won't make the same mistake again but if they do then i'll give up on the csm process too..."
7/8/2010,"reading through this forum, and seeing the endless rubbish that is coming out over incidences of the past couple of days/weeks/months/years - i think it's time for ccp to just ditch the whole idea of the csm.from this players pov it's a waste of time and effort. less than 10% of the player base votes in the farce that is portrayed as an election. the so called ""representatives"" garner votes mainly from game alliances and alt-trolling campaigns, and every csm results in more of the same - nda breaches, meta spying, allegations of gm corruption, etc, etc, etc.to date nothing that has been discussed at any of the csm's over the past couple of years has resulted in any ingame changes. lots of hot air and forum poasts get generated, but unfortunately this is not a balloon based mmo so all that effort goes to waste.so it's time to disband this farcical concept. it's time that ccp used the money that goes into the csm to hire some more qa or devs.now that would be a worthwhile way for ccp to spend the money we give it each month."
7/8/2010,"one member of the csm was acting out, and she's the one that's been removed. the rest of them are doing an excellent job."
7/8/2010,time to disband the forums
7/8/2010,how effective has the csm been in getting player driven initiatives acted upon by ccp?is the csm anything more than a sop to the player community in order to keep us quiet and out of ccp's collective hair?have the csm delivered value for the time and resources spent by both the player base and ccp on maintaining them?when you can deliver concrete negative answers for these questions backed by solid evidence then you have a case until then even though i tend to agree with many of your statements there is no point in putting forward a proposal.
7/8/2010,supported. i don't care for the csm at all.
7/8/2010,"we don't know. possibly yes, possibly no. there's no way of truly telling. personally i think yes - in the past ccp have reacted to things based on suggestions on forums, and having a group of people sat in a room telling them what the people that voted them is more compelling than that. ccp changing the csm to a department within the company itself shows they do have some faith in them.hardly keeps us quiet. up until csm came around it was the forums as a player-outlet and nothing but. have the forums quietened down because of the csm? no. infact, people are more willing to come forward with suggestions given the new forum outlets. at the very least the csm forums are an expansion of the features and ideas forums and a concentrated place for other gripes from other forums.we don't know. and what resources spent by the player base? i take 5minutes yearly to vote. i base my votes on forum reading - that i do regardless of if there was a csm around. even if this is nothing but a pr boondoggle, ccp may of got their moneys worth in the advertising generated from the csm. even the bbc had a csm story.what people want is seemingly a statement from ccp - ""feature a was suggested by the csm and then implemented."" thats kinda redundant tbh. any idea may well of been floating around inside ccp before the csm - csm may give them a list of an order of priorities. basically - as a playerbase we really haven't lost anything with the csm. your view changes on how much we've gained. like i said before - at the very least the playerbase has gained advertising for eve. at its most, a voice of the people. still am very much in favor of the csm.before: if you had a gripe, you talk about it on the forums.after: if you have a gripe, you talk about it on the forums. csm candidates take note about what to talk about in iceland, and talk to ccp about it.i don't see whats wrong with that."
7/8/2010,"oh no, please. how would i spend my time at work ?"
7/8/2010,"@ persepolii call your bull**** & say you're an angry troll that decided to spam since the latest csm development with ahnk being booted.csm changes have been implemented throughout the years, and the csm on itself is an unique dev-player approach that ma"
7/8/2010,"i think the csm are doing a good job. having read the chat logs for their meetings so far, i was struck by how well nearly everybody other than ankh were pulling together. i've also been encouraged by how strong a chairman mynxee is, and how determined she is to ensure that the csm makes a real difference for the playerbase. check out this blog post.it's not time to disband the csm. on the contrary, i support them, and hope that they can carry on with their good work even better now that ankh's disruptive influence has been removed."
7/8/2010,"csm is garbage, always will be garbage. it's a pointless schmoozefest that takes up too much of ccp's time."
7/8/2010,"there was the free 100,000 sp.. whether you like it or not it is a change that the csm suggested, wasn't it?"
7/8/2010,"please, don't be dumb. i really wanted to ask you this, because your post reeks of dumb."
7/8/2010,"demanding csm to be disbanded kinda makes it directly opposite, don't you think make your mind, or smth."
7/8/2010,"lol - another inane comment from the rent-a-crowd ok mr brown-nose, i'll call your bs - name me one - just one - csm requested change that has been implemented by ccp (that they were not already considering implementing as part of their dev cycle).now off you go little pet, go spout somewhere else and leave the big people to talk.----oh and as a postscript. i actually voted for sok as we (members of atlas) were asked to do as a favour to an alliance blue. no idea who ank was until she her csm career blazed into nothingness but it did get this thread started"
7/8/2010,"skill queue was one feature that ccp was very set against, but the csm championed."

7/8/2010,"personally, i would prefer if they dropped the csm and brought eve tv back.having a tv 'show' about the game you play is kind of cool whereas a free trip given to a bunch of people elected by socially ******ed players isn't cool. from a business perspective, ccp gains much better marketing value from the tv show than they ever would from csm.plus stevie is looking pretty good these days and appears to have much more confident public presence so give her old job back."
7/8/2010,why stop there? time to disband the internet.
7/8/2010,"sign here if you think overall the csm (especially the current sitting) is doing an ok job. if you dont support the csm, theres another thread around here you can sign there. yes it was a slow start. yes theres been some scandals (i personally want to see the outcome of the current one), but its starting to make progress. look at the recent downtime with skillpoints. several other major points like a lot more transparency with the devs on a technical level has happened. and there are plenty of other things that they have gotten done recently."
7/8/2010,i support the csm.just kidding. i support mynxee but the rest of 'em can get hit over the head with a spoon for all i care.moar info
7/8/2010,"it's always been a slow start that doesn't start till after a year..oh wait. csm is a waste of time, tbh."
7/8/2010,great work!
7/8/2010,"i get the feeling changing the font or the size of said font isn't a simple job due to how complex the ui windows are. words would get chopped off, the font labels of ui windows wouldn't be aligned properly, would just be a nightmare.so... complete ui overhaul please!:p"
7/8/2010,"with the sudden depature of the second most voted for member(no comment on that issue)and the 3k who voted for her added to the 750 votes that were spoiled, this now leaves you with a mandate set by less the 10%.does this % still make u feel u should speak for the wider eve playerbase or does it make you feel more like sticking to your own mandate?im am just curious to know, the question itself should not be taken as direct or indirect notion of how i feel about csm."
7/8/2010,"psh. this is democrazy. even if only three humpties go voting, the election is still valid. just because no one else gives a **** doesn't mean people won't be doing it. by not voting, those 90% agree with whatever result the election turns out.you could always vote to disband the csm and if you get those 90% to vote for it, i am sure no one would argue against it. good luck."
7/8/2010,"any voting system is always run by the people that actually take the effort to vote. considering that it took a few seconds effort to log in and cast a vote, this was not a hard system to participate in.if you feel the csm isn't based off a large enough % of eve's population voting, then run publicity to get people to vote next time. disbanding any system because people can't be bothered to vote is ridiculous. the united states routinely has national elections where only slightly more than a third of the populace votes (mid-term elections), and larger presidential elections where slightly more than half vote. no one is calling for it to become a dictatorship because of that fact.decisions are made by those who show up, or in this case, vote."
7/8/2010,"i make a policy of not giving a damn about the opinions of people who don't even bother to show up to vote. so, 100% of the eve players who matter had a voice in the csm election. that sounds like a pretty good number to me."
7/8/2010,"troll me for being lazy or being frustrated by trying to dig up and use a decoder ring to find out the correct mintues for the csm meeting but what should happen is this:whenever you make a post that list all the things that will be talked about in the meeting, the moment the minutes are available, you then edit the op and put a direct link in there.also, wtb summit meeting minutes even though i know everything is being done to delay them until they are mutilated enough to edit out anything of value."
7/8/2010,best place for csm created minutes at the moment is the csm database which has the minutes linked as they become available along with simple voting results for the tl:dr generation the missing csm5 meeting 2 and 3 summaries will be up soon(tm) but the raw logs and voting results have been up since the day after the meetings.we're still waiting for the second revision of the summit minutes to appear after mynxee added 8 pages to their original version.
7/8/2010,more clicking and searching... wouldn't it be simpler to just have it linked already in the thread? anyone new to the csm stuff will come in here and not know about your personal website.
7/8/2010,"i've always preferred to post a new thread to separate the pre and post meeting discussions. however, to make things easier we plan to put a sticky at the top of this forum with links to the meeting thread and minutes etc. this master thread can then be linked from the meeting threads and the circle will be complete."
7/8/2010,"lol, you still think i was the problem here? funny."
7/8/2010,myz!!!!
7/8/2010,"between pettiness and childish behaviour and ccp's unwillingness to allow the csm to influence their resource allocation in bringing about what the csm calls for - the whole experiment is a joke.enjoy the trips to iceland. enjoy the forum and site updating. enjoy the fact that you belong to an elite membership of eve players.until ccp promises, and carries out those promises, to ear-mark resources to fulfil the requests the csm lobbies for, isn't it a waste of time and energy better spent elsewhere.the producers of eve has their own agenda, which of course if fair enough, but to be so intractable is counter-productive to the entire reason the csm programme was established for."
7/8/2010,"all this proves how much of a joke csm is.it's of no benefit to the eve community, is a waste of everyone's time and effort and is quite frankly, unrepresentative swill served up to the player base as some sort of salve.and i dare anyone to name one productive game change that resulted from any of the csm's?free trips, booze and quietly replaced titans notwithstanding"
7/8/2010,the csm is a joke.
7/8/2010,"yes, one of them anyway. it's not an ""either or"" type situation, i.e. whatever ankh did doesn't affect judgment on your actions. the rage post would perhaps have helped you understand, while the edited post would probably not cause people like you to reflect on their conduct."
7/8/2010,"maybe there wasn't much wrong with my conduct after all, and maybe therefore it doesn't need awhole lot of reflecting on?"
7/8/2010,"thank you for proving my point, that you're too simple to learn from mynxee's corrected post, and that indeed you could only, possibly, if you're not too thick even for that, have learned something from the ragepost."
7/8/2010,spreading out mission runners should link to
7/8/2010,"link fixed, thanks.also, the request for contact folders was requested at the summit (which the minutes should show, whenever they get released). i am also going to raise the issue at saturday's csm meeting (as previously promised)."
7/8/2010,"incidentally although the first four proposals are by a member who is no longer with you, i believe that they are still very relevant and very good proposals. i trust you still intend to give them your full attention?"
7/8/2010,not to worry :) ankh's proposals will be treated just like any others in accordance with whether they were passed or failed by the csm in that meeting.
7/8/2010,"tldr: the csm is a pointless distraction to both ccp and eve players that imbalances the game. longform - voting, drama, pointlessness. that is the csm. it does not represent the playerbase, less than 10% of players actually even bother to vote. the same people run and get elected each csm cycle. do they suddenly have new ideas they did not have before? no. it's just a lame popularity contest with electioneering that is mostly decided by 0.0 superblocs voting for their candidates. with the same people being elected each cycle, the entire csm concept is stale. with ccp being busy with their own view on how the development of eve should go, the csm really has no point. you could hire one person to read through submitted forum proposals for presentation to devs every six months and you'd have something more valuable than the csm. we've already had csm delegates abuse their position to try to unbalance the game. it gives alliances who have enough members to be on the csm a nice long-view of what is coming up, what to expect... an unfair advantage over alliances that don't bother with the csm process. if you think these people aren't coming back to plot and plan to take advantage of insider information, you're delusional. it's why you see the same people, again and again, on the csm. they don't have new ideas, they just want an inside track.the csm shames and embarrasses this great game when idiotic csm pointlessness becomes drama and gets splayed across the internet. a csm throwing a spoon at another? use of this to cheat at the game with insider information? it makes eve seem like a joke, with a class of players artificially given an unfair advantage and at no benefit to the general eve playerbase. ccp, stop wasting your time and our time with these clowns. get rid of them and the process, it benefits nobody and imbalances the game. the csm is crap, burn it down."
7/8/2010,this definitely needed another thread.
7/8/2010,"could use fifty more threads saying the same thing, there's nothing else of worth in this forum."
7/8/2010,"this topic already exists, feel free to add to that thread."
7/8/2010,"can we vote in another that isn't usless?someone that when ccp says ""no we are a dust company""they say ""**** you ccp! wake the **** up! we are customers!!!"""
7/8/2010,"well, what do you expect in the absence of information? a suddenly introduced vacuum tends to suck in everything around it, rumours, innuendo's, double entendres about peoples real motivations, etc. and tbqh, you would think that the csm and ccp would of realised this by now .... oh wait, we are talking about the csm here ...."
7/8/2010,you mean the one who implied she worked for ccp on her cv/resume? oh im sure there were no selfish motives there at all...c.

7/8/2010,yeah but his fanfest presentation was top notch.
7/8/2010,"i lol'd at the end of your blog where you say, ""those goon bastards have griefed me."""
7/9/2010,fix them pls
7/9/2010,based on some of the reading on this topic i have added changes 3 and 4 to this proposal. i the reasoning behind these changes remains the same. adding more plexes throughout the fw regions would prevent blobs from winning. i see no reason why you shoudl need a probe launcher to fight in plexes.
7/9/2010,"the most eagerly anticipated patchnotes are always the fixes, tweaks and ui improvements that are hidden behind the art team's headline act.something has gone wrong when a hypothetical ""people's patch"" based mainly on community interest is far more likely to contain technical improvements and mechanics adjustments than the developers' offering, and far less likely to contain half-baked excuses to make shiny new models."
7/9/2010,"i see this coming a distant last place, behind walking in stations (attracting rpers and more social types) and fps console play (attracting... well, console players) which are aimed squarely at expanding ccp's customer base and thus generating more subscriptions.without customer action that actually affects their revenue stream (like, oh, delaying account renewal for a day each month or something - and emailing customer services with your reasoning) there is no driver for ccp to amend their vision and development strategy."
7/9/2010,very much supported.
7/9/2010,1
7/9/2010,"definately supported. constantly adding new areas to the game is good, but not when they aren't improved upon or fixed when broken.please fix things, and stop adding new broken things."
7/9/2010,absolutely. this is the single most important frustrating issue with eve game play.
7/9/2010,"the previous csm did mention it. hopefully, progress is being made.ui fonts. ccp pleased everyone by announcing they hired a font guy which means that improvements on that front are to be expected"
7/9/2010,supported. why remove it in the first place??
7/9/2010,supported
7/9/2010,"quite reasonable.regarding:i think there are many aggregations of items - e.g. hangars, jetcans, bays, assets - where volume is sometimes of interest to the player. a general widget capability throughout the eve ui that provided a sortable volume column with total would be even better. i.e., address the general need not just this specific instance."
7/9/2010,"that is a very good suggestion, chrisisherwood"
7/9/2010,another thing that should already be in the game. ccp stop inventing new things to put into the game and **** up. fix the stuff we have

7/9/2010,"i'm struggling to understand your logic.i mean, you say it yourself... people who choose to do combat skills first will get the full benefit of the training bonus, so... yeah..."
7/9/2010,"why is this thread languishing so badly? as bad as low-sec is currently, i would expect more enthusiasm from the low-sec population. if you don't agree with all of the ideas here, at least agree that something needs to be done and hash it out!personally (a note here - this isn't my outlaw account although this character does have some shady tendencies ), i like most of the ideas but would add a few more...i know this may not be real popular with the outlaws of eve, but if bounty hunting actually got some love from the devs in the form of skills, missions, career path, etc., that alone would draw more people into low-sec hunting the pirates and smugglers (and possible overlords), thus giving the pirates some much needed tougher fights with the possibility of better loot/salvage instead of the random noob ganks or simply fighting each other for lack of prey.along with the black market, make the items that are commodities actually useful within the eve universe. as an example, slaves should be usable in pi to increase production but with deterrents to their use.those are the two that popped into my head atm but i'm sure there is more. c'mon folks. let's keep this thread alive!"

7/9/2010,thank you^^
7/9/2010,"i don't know about you guys, but i really enjoy having a socket close while on a cap op, then log back in with almost no cap. everyone else in the fleet loves it too. cap should change to random levels while you are logged in for additional fun.no, this stuff is really annoying. reminds me of the ""you ejected? now everything is offline"" bug/mechanic. strong support for this."
7/9/2010,"i hope you're not talking about torps. and giving blasters double optimal, which transfers to 22km is not ""medium"" by any standards, barrage l has 36km falloff, scorch l gets 45km optimal. blasters should be something inbetween.and no, they don't need anymore dps, the problem is the inability to deliver said dps. battleships don't go 1.2km/sec anymore and webs aren't 90%. more dps on blasters will mean what? 2k dps blasterships. this ain't gonna fly. blasters just have too many downsides to just be fixed with more dps. because now they work only on paper."
7/9/2010,"supported, except the proposed change of the deimos' falloff bonus.also, if active armor tanks were on par with active shield tanks, one wouldn't need 2 reppers on the brutix (for example) and there wouldn't be such a need for more powergrid. --erik"
7/9/2010,"i think if i could only get behind a single issue for the rest of all my possible csm terms, i think that this would be the one. we need devs to get back to playing eve. it is pretty clear that sometimes in statements made by devs about game mechanics, you can get the sense that they don't really play the game, or at least they don't play with the same part of the game they work with.i don't want to mention names because it would be unproductive and i would not be able to back up accusations with their actual activity level in eve, but i think that there is a problem of devs not playing the game- especially after the t20 scandals and devs getting outed. i'm sorry that some of you devs got traumatized over eve and don't think you'll enjoy coming back, but that was three years ago, and eve needs you now. it won't be hard to get back into whatever part of the game is relevant to any dev's job. even 0.0 sov warfare- if i can get in bull**** alts to major alliances, dev characters can get in too. microsoft excel is not eve pvp, and the test server is not eve sovereignty.we don't need them to play eve at the expense of their work time or family time. we don't need to name and shame any devs who don't play eve. all we need is for the creators of the game to experience the unpredictable end results of their creations, so that when they get back to the drawing board they will be more passionate and articulate about what exactly needs to be done to make the game more fun. this is part of their job. devs balancing pvp should get into pvp alliances. devs balancing sov should get into powerbloc alliances. devs balancing missions should join a missionrunner corp. if they get outed as a dev, well it's unfortunate but at least they know what the dangers are and they can take precautions.and for all the devs that still play eve: thanks, you guys are awesome. you are doing your job."
7/9/2010,supportin dis.
7/9/2010,"yes, and mask your ip's properly this time!*edit* dammit forgot the checkbox"
7/9/2010,yeah they should play - just don't cheat. it shouldn't be hard.
7/9/2010,ccp talks about players having stakeholders. the devs need to be stakeholders as well. they need to have something invested in this game. a reason for excellence beyond a paycheck.support.
7/9/2010,"ip masking aside, dont put a normal char on the same acc as your ccp dev char or gm char. the api sees everything!but yes, devs and in my opinion gm's should spend more time playing the areas they are working on/could be assigned to work on/need to function in cooperation with other areas. so it would be easyer to figure out how to change stuff in a more usefull manner, instead of a completely useless way where the servers etc allow.for example, there was a lot of back and forth on the info about fighter bombers during dominion. and even though currently they are probably in for a nerf, they are pleasing the players without being totaly op.would have been alot easyer to get to if you would have been able to keep up with discussions inside any alliance that has a bunch of them. even most alliances that did not own many were discussing it, as it would endable them to do stuff that was before not possible (which many of them thank you for, and many jf pilots would rather hate you for :p)so yea, im all for it to have devs play the game. hell, i wouldnt care if 20 of you guys working on 0.0 sov joined a major powerblock and go fiddle with stuff from there. just leave your devpowah somewhere else and go grind a few sanctums, go on a roam. experience a nodecrash because we're trying to replicate your trailers.oh, join fw, i beg you!"
7/9/2010,"single best idea ever put forward by a csm, and i'm not even joking.you can't balance what you don't understand, and no amount guess work will ever help you get it right.seriously, one hundred million hit points?!?!? you need to come shoot one of these, so you know what it feels like."
7/9/2010,"i'm worried that a lot of players will probably freak out a bit at this, but at the end of the day, this is necessary. given what happened during the t20 scandal, i can understand why ccp treads lightly on this issue, but it's gone too far the other way."
7/9/2010,support. i think that there should be mandatory time at work to play eve for ccp developers. -liang
7/9/2010,"in these days of metagaming, ip tracking and general all around skullduggery it's no wonder a lot of ccp staff stay away from major entities due to the :drama: it could cause. when i spoke to some fellows they were pretty wary about joining eve voice in fw fleets because their voices might be recognized.the potential fallout from someone finding out and it being publicly revealed that such'n'such corp/alliance has a dev or gm in it's ranks, even if they were a lowly tower jockey or miner would be a massive source of drama.saying that, given the woeful lack of knowledge in some areas displayed by some gms/devs and the general disconnect that staff have with the actual population of the game i think it's necessary for ccp to encourage more staff to get involved in actually playing the game, especially in areas in which they are involved in developing. you can't hope to sort out problems unless you have experienced them yourself in some degree."
7/9/2010,i know the devs have made some unpopular changes but this really is a cruel punishment to inflict on them!
7/9/2010,supported
7/9/2010,"there are so many ways a dev can insulate themselves from the risk of getting busted that there is just no excuse. and add to that the fact that they can get their characters renamed and get a clean slate anyways. sure, they can't lose anything if they don't play, but then they don't have anything in the first place.unless you have a totally outrageous accent or are a girl, chances are nobody will recognize your voice. i go on people's comms with my spy alt and talk like normal and nobody recognizes my voice."
7/9/2010,"agreed. as a matter of fact, if voice recognition is a worry, simply use one of the many voice-masking programs available. i used one in another mmo for an alt to sort out the root of a bad situation (my main was the founder/leader of the guild). it worked beautifully and i played that alt with voice for a long time and no one ever suspected.i also agree that playing eve should be a mandatory part of the work day for every dev and gm, and even some of ccp staff who aren't devs. all of them should have an account not associated with their actual jobs and all of those accounts should be logged daily into a seperate database where a small staff of maybe two or three people would periodically examine these logs. this should be enough to deter or nip-in-the-bud any scandal-causing activities.this idea is right up there with the excellence idea and both have my full, 110% support!"
7/9/2010,"it can couse a lot of problems f.e if some dev will get involved in 0.0 warfare and will do everything in his power so his big alliance stay in power ( aka promoting nap fest and blob warfare , titans spam ) so no other entities can have any chance whatsoever.although its just an example , its not like devs are looking to solve those problems anyway. ( they love current , boring , static 0.0 affairs , and big alliances that cant be defited unless disbanded by spy ) why ?this problem is more complicated then what op suggest."

7/9/2010,"it is no secret that armor remote repair systems are much more popular then shield repair ones, so let us find out why is that the case. generally, shield tanks have higher resistances, because invulnerability fields are more effective then energized adaptive membranes, so theoretically shield tanks should be more effective in a remote rep chain. the reason they are not used, is the fitting cost fo a shield transporter. let us assume that personal reps and boosters are in a good state of balance at the moment. large armor repairer: 2,300 mw , 55 tfremote armor repairer: 660 mw 48 tfas we can see, the remote repair uses both less cpu, and vaslty lower amounts of powergrid, macking it easier to fit. large shield booster: 165 mw 115 tfshield transporter: 192 mw 154 tfhere, for an unknown reason, the fitting requrements of the module increase. this is unfair towards shield tancking races, and forces everyone into a homogenious setup, where every rr bs fleet is armor, which in my opinion is not good.proposal body: i propose that the fitting requirements fo modules are brought more in-line, either by making shield transporters easier to fit, or by macking armor repairers more difficult to fit. either way, they have to be brought in line, so fitting requirements are simular on both modules. at the same time, modules of all sises have to be looked at, because this situation is observed with medium and small units as well. for an unknown to me reason, there has been large amphasis on the logi ships, and i considered this obvious. when the cpu reqirements on the large shield transfers arrays are cut, the cpu capacity of the scimatar and basilist will be cut accordingly, or their bonuces changed, to keep all their fitting and power absolutely the same.accordingly, if armor rr reqirements are increased, the bonus of onieros and guardian will be increased, so fitting these modules still costs exactly the same. theirfore, this proposal carrier absolutely no change to the logistics ships."
7/9/2010,"what problem would this solve? logistics are fine to fit as-is. you are also comparing large armor repairers (bs mods) with large shield boosters (cruiser mods), so your proposal is flawed to begin with."
7/9/2010,"apple, meet orange. i suggesty ou just ignore maxsim, sok, he's been posting nothing but trolls."
7/9/2010,"we will have bs rr gangs as well as shield ones, which makes it more interesting. remote shield reppers are not fitted on anything except logistics ships, how is that fine? and i am sorry, from when on is a large shield booster a cruiser class module?quote from evelopedia. i can fit a 1600mm plate on a vexor, that does not make it a cruiser class module. and i am comparing large shield transfer arrays to large remote armor repair units, and their fitting costs if anything. you can say it's bad, but it is not a troll. please give a me single reason why shield transfer arrays should be more difficult to fit then remote armor repair units?"
7/9/2010,"i'm sorry you are absolutely right, this also explains the x-large shieldbooster fitted wyvern we killed like two years ago."
7/9/2010,"larges are more battlecruiser modules than cruiser modules.but i would have imagined by now everyone agreed that fitting requirements of shield transporters (cpu to be precise) need to be lowered. i must say i am genuinely surprised anyone, even a csm member, is against it. also nice useful posts considering you were complaining about other posts not being useful enough. is it really too much to ask that a csm member displays some profesionality in assembly hall topics instead of such posts?remote armor repair is something you can fit relative easy compared to other high slot modules, shield transporters cost half your cpu. shield transporters need normal cpu reqs to make rr shield bs gangs viable."
7/9/2010,"even if the general direction of the proposal would be correct, the propsal should be based on reasonable arguments. and comparing the large shield booster to a large armor rep is a badly flawed argument. large shield booster on a bs, except for pve fits maybe, is just a fail setup."
7/9/2010,"1. comparison of effects of lst ii and lrar iilrar iicpu: 48pg: 660optimal: 8400 mcycle time: 4.5 srep amount: 384cap cost: 189rep/s: 42rep/cap: 2.0rep applied after 4.5 s cyclelst iicpu: 154pg: 192optimal: 8400 mcycle time: 4.5 srep amount: 384cap cost: 210rep/s: 42rep/cap: 1.8rep applied at the start of 4.5 s cyclethe lst ii applies its rep at the start of the cycle of 4.5 s. in exchange, the lrar ii is 10% more cap efficient than the lst ii. this would be reasonably balanced, if each module had comparable fitting requirements.2. ease of fitting of ""appropriate"" rr on a bs.lrar ii fitting requirements as % of a megathron's cpu and pg: lrar ii: cpu 48, pg 660.cpu is 7.0%, pg is 3.4%.lst fitting requirements as % of a raven's cpu and pg: lst ii: cpu 154, pg 192.cpu is 17.6%, pg is 1.6%.17.6% of the cpu simply to fit a lst is insane.3. ease of fitting of opposite rr on a bslrar ii fitting requirements as % of a raven's cpu and pg. lrar ii: cpu 48, pg 660.cpu is 5.5%, pg is 5.6%.lst fitting requirements as % of a megathron's cpu and pg: lst ii: cpu 154, pg 192.cpu is 22.4%, pg is 1.0%.22.4% of the cpu simply to fit a lst is insane.it is far, far harder to fit lsts on a bs than lrars. this difficulty is not justified by their effectiveness as modules - the lrar is more cap-efficient and the only benefit is the the first cycle of shield transport is applied 4.5 seconds before rar. this 4.5 s advantage is largely inconsequential - in small gangs, targets aren't dying quickly enough for it to be a big deal, and in large gangs lag and general co-ordination issues prevent it from being particularly important either. if it was 15 or 20 seconds, it would be different. but it isn't.4. solutionslsts and lrars should have similar ease/difficulty of fittings. possible solutions:1. cut lst cpu use by 67%. this reduces cpu costs to about 6% of a raven's cpu, and ~7% of a megathron's cpu. lsts are still harder to fit than lrars, but the sheer insanity has gone. 2. increase lrar ii pg use by 400%. lrar ii pg use is now balanced with lst ii cpu use. lrar ii now requires 3300 mw, taking up 17.0% of a megathron's pg (making it still easier to fit on, compared to the current 17.6% cpu use required to fit a lst ii to a raven).both changes would require a fiddle with logistics cruisers bonuses to maintain their balanced status quo. alternatively, make the astronomical cpu requirements of lst give a meaningful benefit, relative to lrars:3. increase cycle time of lrar to 30 seconds or so. the instant application of lst shield is now meaningful.4. since a lst ii takes three times the cpu of a lrar ii, make deliver three times as much hp. triple lst shield transport amount."
7/9/2010,thumbs down. this proposal makes no sense from beginning to end. starting with the presumption that for some reason shields and armour should be treated the same.
7/9/2010,"same can be said for large armor rep on bs. the (incorrect) assertion that large shield booster is cruiser mod is not a valid reason for rejecting the proposal in itself. what does that make of mid and small boosters? xl booster is just a counterbalance to 1600mm plate, it's just an oversized version of non-cap mod.in any case, it's about shield transporter, not local rep. those are just trolls' attempts to sidestep the issue entirely when they can't find fault. it's a common, if juvenile behavior.blob commanders have real reasons to dislike ungimping the shield transporter. it can be summed up as laziness. they're used to armor, and are repulsed by changes outside of their comfort zone, which can be a scary thing. ungimped shield transporters may make some people demand shield rr fleet, which is an inconvenience. it would also result in lighter, faster ships with more transversal than stacked plate fits. it would shift blob dynamics away from static turret match. the fear is enemy would be well organized and skilled enough to control such a fleet and taking advantage of it, and they won't.well, assuming lag get fixed eventually..."
7/9/2010,lack of shield spider tanking gangs is evidence enough that rr shield tanking is broken.as gypsio points out the correct way to assess the module is to look at the percentage of resources (cpu/pg) the module requires to fit.cpu usage on lst's effectivelly force you to gimp your setup in order to fit them. lrar do not.also given the impractibility of fitting cap injectors to shield tanked setups lst's should be the more cap efficient modules.
7/9/2010,you obviously haven't looked very hard.
7/9/2010,"and there was me thinking it was the job of csm candidates to evaluate the merits of ah posts !.just sit back , relax, enjoy your free trips to iceland and continue offering value for money to ccp and the players you represent by firing off glib comments and failing at basic maths and resoning , not to mention game experiance."

7/9/2010,"erm..we run rr shield gangs *all the time* and i know of several other alliances that do, so i have no idea wtf you two are talking about, a quick look at any major alliance's killboard should reveal the same. hint: you should be looking for 'scimitars', not 'basilisks'."
7/9/2010,very professional...glad your bias has not gotten the best of you...
7/9/2010,"when i see ravens and tempests fitting shield rr, the way that megathrons and armageddons fit armor rr, then i'll think that shield rr is at the right level. yes, the scimitar is a lovely ship. but shield rr shouldn't just go on scimitars."
7/9/2010,"this is why i love these boards. so many stuck-up, super serious weird people. i love being a space councilor! that has nothing to do with the fitting requirements of the modules but rather is because rr ships needs their mids for injectors, tackle mods and e-war, and with a shield buffer this does not work. if there were more bs with 7 or 8 mids, it would be very different. shield logistics and the relevant mods are fine, buff shield battleships!"
7/9/2010,show us on the doll where sok touched you
7/9/2010,"sorkatez, you are continuing to give argumnts abosolutely irrelevant to the topick of this proposal. this proposal is not about carriers, x-large shield boosters, or any personal tanks at all. so how is this relevant? yes, x-large shield boosters are equivalent of two larges, so they are better to fit on a bs, we got that. either way, that does not matter. what matters is that for unknown reason life is made harder for those that try to setup rr shield gangs, and i cannot see any reason why such unfairness should take place. again, this is not the problem raised in this proposal, if you would like us to make low-slot cap injects (is that the problem you are pointing out?), make a separate thread about it. i've seen plenty of shieldtancked ships on the field lately, so aparently people have way less issues shieldtancking their ships then you are describing. gypsio iii has just demonstrated they are not fine. are you simply ignoring everybody else? if you want to make an argument sorkatez, give me a single valid reason why shield rr should be 3-4 times more difficult to setup then armor rr."
7/9/2010,its quite clear you have no idea what were talking about.try reading the op before you comment.were talking here about spider tanked fleet configurations.you know bs that have damage and 1 or 2 large rr.no one except you is talking about logistic ships.

7/9/2010,"i like it, as long as my learning skill training gets refunded in some way."
7/9/2010,"they aren't doing anything different though, you already trained ""everything"" by training your learning skills. they are still raising their attributes but they are doing it by training skills that depend on them.this is actually less helpful to older players. a player who has already maxed their attributes by training the learning skills will have no need for this system. they've already got the attribute bonuses that they would have gotten by training regular skills (which depend on attributes).just like apocrypha changed the attribute selection system. when you create a character now you no longer pick what skills or attributes you start with. to a veteran player this is pointless as we've already gone through that stage. but for new players it made things a little more interesting without taking too much, if anything, away from the game."
7/9/2010,"i find other alternatives to removing learning skills to be more suitable.this system would result in vets getting much better training times than new players, as vets often can afford to devote long stretches of time to skills with a single attribute (or 2, as now). new players need a wide variety of skills across the full spectrum of attributes, so could not easily benefit from this. instead, they would be encouraged to only train certain skills to 5 to maximize learning time before training others, which would decrease their enjoyment of the game. that is the same argument used against the current learning skills system; that it encourages new players to maximize skill training by training skills that are best for them in the long run, but make eve a less fun experience in the beginning."
7/9/2010,"just thinking out-loud here, don't several skills take several weeks even close to a month or sometimes longer to finish with maxed out attributes in the absence of really nice implant buffs as well? i mean some skills in eve just take time-dedication regardless of what system you have in place for learning skills. that said, training learning skills is a major buzzkill for everyone, and i think it's a huge drag on new players. i know it was for me. i also know i'd like to get those sp points back and spend them in something else if that system was replaced. (i've heard specualtions that ccp is going to take out learning skills at some point.)i also know i'd like not having to tell new players who vital it is to get their learning skills up to at least lvl4 as soon as possible because the difference is millions of skill points after a long enough period of time, and get them to focus on what they really want to do as soon as possible. so, i support just getting rid of learning skills. but, i'm not sure the focused training curve would be helpful/beneficial than the current system, or fun, and with the training-que in place it doesn't really encourage time spent in game either. i'd support replacing it though with a different system than this entirely. one that rewarded time spent actually playing eve, but preserved much of the passive system so as not to grant instant gratification in advanced skills. what i'd like to see is a series of mini-games developed for each attribute that one could do inside the stations. giving ccp a reason to actually get incarna finished. in my reckoning, time in a pod is really taxing on our toons attributes especially when you loose a ship and get podded. my thinking is it should be so violent and stressful that when you die your mental preparedness is harmednot just because you lost your shiny implants, but also because the process of emergancy cloning (and not clone jumping) is very violent. the effect is, when you get podded, you go back to a base level of attributes across the board. so, to combat that, and to even give us a major buff in our attributes (temporally) pod pilots could go do mental exercises/challenges in stations before boarding their ships again. (i mean they wake up in a station when they are recloned anyway.) they would then need to go and do the challenges to raise their attributes to the desired levels (and they could focus on just the few they are training at the time.) additionally, one could see nerfing living in your ship practices by having smaller negative effects on your attributes each time you log-out of eve for longer than a hour (so as to target only intentional log-outs in space). such as negative -2 point to one attribute at random, instead of rebooting them all to the base level. this would make real outposts more common and essential to 00 and require pos-manager-alts to do more than just sit there if they want there skill-training to move forward at an accelerated pace.. this effect would also be a huge drawback into the practice of death-podding. jump-cloning on the cheap. i know i've done it, and i think i would do it a lot less often if there was more than just an isk consequence. it would also put real value into every pod, and not just the pods that have or may not have implants. it would also give the upcoming incarna a unique vital purpose in game play, and not just be a graphical walk-through of the current side-bar menu or platform for role-play. overall, i like my idea not because it would make the game easier for anyone, but because it would make it harder for older players like me, and it would have consequences on actual game-play."
7/9/2010,"a ""veteran"" is someone who has already trained learning skills. so someone with learning skills at level 5 already has that advantage. just like they do ingame currently. just like you'll train your learning skills to level 3-4 before moving onto the next tier simply because the next tier takes 14 days at level 5. it's no different.that's power gaming and is something this system is trying to avoid. instead of spending time focusing on learning skills that maximise your training times but prevents you from using new ships and equipment, now you'll just focus on training for the things you want to do. eventually the most used attributes will hit their cap.you don't have to raise all your attributes. why bother raising charisma if you're not trading or using planetary industry? if you are, training the skills you need will raise charisma enough to meet the cap. the implants will give the biggest bonus. that's a nice idea but it does deviate heaps from mine. mine is more of a simplification of the current system where a lot of the attribute raising happens behind the scenes. just short of giving us sp back from learning skills but still enough to keep the learning skills in-game but out of site.the only problem i see with this idea is the lore would need to be changed. a clone is a clone. as long as it's updated it contains all the neural pathways (given by skill training) and all the attributes of the previous clone. there'd need to be a fictional explanation before they could impliment this. why are our clones lacking attributes? it'd certainly add a new dynamic to being pod killed. i suppose a simple explanation is that the clone hasn't had a chance to live yet. so you're not ""gaining"" attributes. you're in a sort of rehab to realise those attributes."
7/9/2010,"this is an interesting proposal, but i am concerned it has huge balancing issues. basically, it changes skill-training rates from linear to accelerating.on the plus side, ccp can just reuse the code for ship acceleration, with different constants (grin).on the minus side, it will tend to force people to train intensively in particular skill categories, to maximize their training time bonuses. also, it will cause the authors of evemon to have cerebral hemorrhages when they try to rewrite the skill plan optimizer.on balance, at present i don't think it has a high enough cost-benefit ratio.that said, tavin, i really like the way you were thinking in the op, and i look forward to seeing other interesting proposals from you."
7/9/2010,i'm not sure if this is a good idea. this would require that you have pirate stations in lowsec with pirate fw agents and lp stores. lowsec is far safer than npc 0.0 when it comes to pvp and doing regular missions for pirate factions in npc 0.0 would become not rewarding (and unique) enough and thus obsolete.it would be interesting from an rp point of view.
7/9/2010,it would be pretty pointless to do this if they dont fix fw first. add to that they told csm they wont fix fw...
7/9/2010,"yes i'd like something like this a lot.if as some of the replies are correct and ccp won't work on fw, i think an alternative would be to simply make standings mean something beyond access to pve agents. (ok main faction (amar, caldari etc negative standing has some impact) -5.0 or worse standing you can't dock at that faction/corps station and their stations defences will shoot at you.+5.0 or better standings ships of that faction will not attack unless you attack first (at least belt and event rats, other types would be open to exploits without further changes)these changes would make it so your forced to choose between allying with the pirate faction and using their stations or exploiting the regions resources. making it easier for pvp pirate players to operate in npc nullsec vs most big player alliances that currently lay claim to these areas. which is really what these factions are about anyway, it doesn't make a lot of sense for them to be competing for control of empire space, as they're outlaws there and lore wise too small to really compete with the big empires directly. just need to make npc pirate space good bases of operation for pirate players, irrespective of ties to existing player alliances."
7/9/2010,this was actually wehn fw went in something ccp promised but has failed to deliver i say yes expand 00 npc space and encourage it it would fill those markets and so forth. but ccp arent focused
7/9/2010,"!) what furb wrote;2)if you align to one of the pirate factions you will be kos to npc in all of empire and in the npc regions unaligned with your chosen faction.sure, low sec and 0.0 aren't patrolled by npc, so the effect there will be 0, but it will ban you from all of high sec. how many players that aren't currently at -5 or less are willing to accept that?"
7/9/2010,"quoting from an email of ned coker, received 8th of july (after contacting ccp via email/phonecall):== snip ==we're done with the initiative. while we didn't ""wrapup"" things perhaps as nicely as we should have(i'm having a hard time finding a wrapup!), our ceo presented a check to the red cross.."
7/9/2010,there was a news item on it... just cause you suck at searching doesn't mean they didn't inform us.
7/9/2010,the news item also said that they were holding the event open for an indefinite period to raise more money. did they ever actually close it?
7/9/2010,"they hsould have posted pictures and the sum, and proudly announced it. instead, tehy forgot about it all together. common. that's just silly."
7/9/2010,"some people in haiti got free gametime, presumably."
7/9/2010,i find the massive sokratesz posting around this issue quite stupid
7/9/2010,most of sok's recent posts have been relevant to the discussion. its a shame that he has to keep making the same points repeatedly because people can't seem to understand them or find it more convenient to disbelieve them in order to support their conspiracy theories.
7/9/2010,i find the massive amount of blind conjecture and illogical conclusions drawn from it quite stupid. to each there own i guess.
7/9/2010,"nope, because of the lack of an alternate explanation.this is 2010 and we have the internet. there are no secrets. if it wasn't related to the csm but the csm knew what it was, then one of you would have leaked it anonymously."
7/9/2010,"you keep giving up more information on her expulsion. i think we might be dealing with two nda breaches in one week.if you're expelled, there's many who wont miss you."
7/9/2010,"meh. so no one knows what exactly is it that she disclosed?i mean, it has to be something big, or else ccp won't immediately boot her.it also has to be something public, because if she just told a few friends, ccp won't know about it."
7/9/2010,":facepalm:i'm just doing some damage control for ccp within the limits set out for me, given that they failed to properly do it themselves and that loads of weird people keep getting these ******ed ideas."
7/9/2010,"i did now :)but, if the information is not related to the csm, how does an ordinary player get access to nda breaching stuff? do ccp mail stuff around at random?and regardless, she was in the csm, she got kicked from the csm, therefore it is related to the csm.it's a sad situation though, for both parties. the reason i have a problem with it is that if feels unfair."
7/9/2010,it's not like a novelty or anything.
7/9/2010,you are right there but i wouldn't agree with the wording of your first bit. i agree though that as long as ccp doesn't reveal any other information it feels unfair that i have to fight this fight for them
7/9/2010,thank you for your contributions!
7/9/2010,"maybe in your haste to do ""damage control"" you have forgot that this is a thread in assembly hall and posting simply to support the proposal/request is allowed and a normal procedure. btw: at least half of your attempt to do ""damage control"" had the opposite effect."
7/9/2010,"i'm just posting information, if people interpret said information incorrectly that's not my problem. some people just *want* to see things that aren't there, but it will be a lot easier to convince them or if not that, ridicule them, with ccp backup."
7/9/2010,"you can't talk about privacy, when using someone's handle and real-life name in the same paragraph. in my very humble opinion.ccp, the csm is about transparency and this was the most attended ballot thus far - if you don't want this to become such a pipe dream, and you don't want to dissuade people from voting again, please be more transparent.at the moment, your voters and subscribers don't know what to think, certainly many think that the way this has been handled, smacks of something untowards going on.similarly, a lot of people are rubbing their hands together and crowing that ankh has been removed from the csm. to you, i say shame on you; ankh was the csm, her passion, vibrancy and personal sacrifice to the csm should be an example and inspiration to everyone.to those who say that it's ok for ccp to be private, let me remind you that they've (afaik) unanimously removed an elected official. what kind of confidence does this give you for anything the csm can or can't do after this ?anyway, she could throw spoons at me, any day of the week, as long as it got black ops sorted out, and meta level in item detail views finally - ccp, i'm not against you; if your decision was fair, then absolutely fine - i'm just begging you to show the transparency that you promised and save the csm before this goes too far."
7/9/2010,"big thumbs down to this ""proposal.""ankh is such an idiot that i'm not even remotely surprised that she went and blabbed about something she'd signed an nda about.why exactly should we expect ccp to tell us info about something they'd had a nda about in the first place? to satisfy all you people's personal curiousity?i agree that the csm must be transparent, but by all indications this was not something directly related to csm workings.most notably, ccp doesn't owe you. they have every right to keep secret inner workings secret.the csm is better off without ankh, nuff said."
7/9/2010,"hi, lark here, you may remember me from such internet political scandals as larkonisgate and... well, that's it. i shall offer some insight having been the only other person thus far to have been removed from the csm (although in my case i 'resigned').now chaps, you're all rushing ahead here. i think a lot of you were slightly spoiled by the way ccp dealt with my misdemeanor. for all the hurf blurf it was a 'relatively' minor in game infraction where i was the only beneficiary of said actions and ccp had the advantage of being able to deal with me in person, me being cooperative and having the rest of the csm on site to help clean up my mess. as none of these conditions appear to have been met (going by ankh's quote on massively) that's probably the reason you're not getting as much information.i've no idea what ankh did and i'd like to know as much as everyone else. transparency is great most of the time but the nda is a srs bsns document and covers a lot of bases. if the breach was particularly serious then there are potential rl legal ramifications as such it is going to be in neither party's best interests to go mouthing off about what happened.ccp gave a reason. that reason was breach of the nda. you don't have to like it. i, for one don't either, but like it or not it is more than they are required to tell you. this isn't big brother, you can't put someone up for a public vote if they foul up.ps page 3 snipah.pps not supported."
7/9/2010,"yet another passive income? also, eve is primarily a spaceship pvp game and ships are supposed to fly and blow other ships up, not stay docked while gathering free isk and manipulating stocks. don't turn eve into stock market simulator, please.not supported."
7/9/2010,why would ccp ever implement this? this is clearly in the realm of stuff players should make.
7/9/2010,"transactions which require trust / collateral in a game (of eve players at least) require some help from the designers. e.g., banks or image if the players had to rely on their ingame trust for courier contracts; it just works so much better with ccp-enforced collateral.at the very least, if there were fw stocks, all the authors of ""the goods i own are in short supply you should buy them asap"" posts would put their manipulation talents towards ""joining and dying for my militia is fun and cool."" what if they even started paying personal bounties to recruit for their corp/faction?besides, it does not seem too extensive to implement, does not effect lag, adds to the diversity of things to do and things to keep you occupied before you unsub."
7/9/2010,"that is inaccurate. stock exchanges function because there is oversight. they are forced to disclose their financials to have publicly available stock. there is no way for players to ""make this"" in the game. no player organization has the ability to provide that kind of oversight, nor the ability to penalize or place functional liens on a company that grabs the money and runs. additionally, the barrier to exit is nonexistent in eve, so most players can within 23 hours close shop and make expensive assets disappear (something that is near impossible to do in rl). besides, unlike rl, characters are disposable.of course, it would be nice to have actual financial reporting tools in-game for ceos/directors to begin with.something like the dow could be player created. to have that, you need an exchange. an exchange cannot be player created."
7/9/2010,"first, the income won't be a garantee, like any stock on the dow jones, it remains a gamble.what's so great about this game is that it provides us with different kind of gameplay. if you want eve to grow you need to continue to develop the different aspects of this game to provide more choices to the players. eve will never turn into a market simulator, only a new button in your taskbar might pop up. that being said, eve has one unique economy going on and it's probably making history in the mmo world, the dow jones idea will only reinforce that position."
7/9/2010,"yes, make ecm less funwrecking please."
7/9/2010,"1 module? you mean caldari don't have to fit minmatar, gallente, caldari, amarr mid slot modules? you don't have to fill your low slots with boosters so those mid slot modules have a real chance of actually working? just stick one module on and everyone magically loses their locks? all this time and we could actually fit a tank and guns on ecm ships? curse can stick one heavy neut, some guns, and some tank and turn frigates into dust. arazu can point things from the other side of lala land and sensor damp them at the same time so they can't shoot back. the huginn... oh wait, painters and webs lol. i'll give you the huginn."

7/9/2010,after a de-sync of the server i lost my loki due to ccp not taking evidence of players i need to suck it up and start all over again grinding isk for the lokiso being shot @ the gate 11.5 au out of the mission room as shown on the screenshot isnt sufficiend evidence to prove they ****ed it up once againscreenshot
7/9/2010,yea - it would seem that ccp sees only what it wants to see - the screenshot is absolute evidence - hell you were on a gate 11 au from rats and they still hitting you? omg ccp why dont you ever take care of older players? you do fine for all the nubs ffs!!!
7/9/2010,it might jsut be the server rejecting your fitpassive tanked loki for missions
7/9/2010,you can run lvl4 serpentis missions even in a buffer tanked cynabal. it just requires basic piloting.
7/9/2010,"that is bizarre. did you fill out the customer service survey? i'm reminded of this dev blog.also, posting in the thread before it gets locked/kicked from assembly hall."
7/9/2010,"aww, thats terrible...can i have your stuff when you rage-quit?"
7/9/2010,"i don't care about the fit, i care about devs not tacking stuff into consideration, i have encountered the same bug, where ai was shooting me from 25 au away, that did not end in anything horrible for me however, i just relogged."
7/9/2010,"ccp reimburses ships when the servers/code breaks.if servers/code is breaking you cant believe the logs are correct at all.furthermore, if the logs show nothing. they must by default saying that pic is fake and fraudulent. at the same time.. its a common bug."
7/9/2010,please
7/9/2010,so i'm flying my ship which has this slot assimilator module. this module will remotely take control of a random module of the victims.i tackle a guy but his friend shows up. it's a close battle but i assimilate one of his modules every so often; randomly.he's flying a raven. the first module i take control of is his shield booster. i turn it off completely. next cycle i take control of his bcs.. not very useful.. next cycle i take control of one of his weapon systems. i start shooting his friend.
7/9/2010,"bump, why are we banning use of mwd in missions, therifore limiting the fitting options of mission runners? i see no reason for this."
7/9/2010,it makes it faster for pirates to burn over to you. then there's direct warp. gated deadspace sites.
7/9/2010,1
7/9/2010,"if a dramiel drops into a deadspace pocket, mwd or ab, it is going to catch most things before they can get out."
7/9/2010,mwd is extremely overly nerfed. introduce rats with 2pt scrams and allow mwds to be used in deadspace.
7/9/2010,i agree... i would love to have a grouping object or maybe a module that consumes extra cpu and powergrid so it costs something to be lazy
7/9/2010,"i definately support this as it will save rl time, and not be such a headache. this is a game and should be fun, not irritating."
7/9/2010,"after going through the pain and wasted hours of rl time picking up items in 100's of stations from region-wide buy orders, i've decided to propose a solution that should benefit all.i do not want to interfere with the courier contracts, and in fact hope this helps couriers, haulers, and traders.i propose that there be a intra-system (read: within a single system) npc courier service introduced that will allow players to consolidate items into 1 station in a system, once per day.this would allow for players/traders to consolidate items and therefore create larger packages for couriers (hence larger rewards). and would still take quite a bit of work to pick up everything if they did not use couriers, as travelling to all systems in a region can take several hours.docking at every station in the region is mindnumbing, time consuming, and takes alot away from game-play.i believe this would benefit all."
7/9/2010,"and make things easier for the jita station-warmers?no thanks, you guys can play the game like the rest of us do."
7/9/2010,"at the moment, bookmark management is severely lacking, which leads to 3 big issues.bringing up the bookmark window can/does lag out the client, even if its minimized, every time you open it, and for every new system you load. i argue this is due to the fact that the client re-requests the whole listing, including names, system locations, details and notes of each bookmark every system/session change.bookmarks are difficult and extremely time consuming to manage, and the management we do have available (using folders) is client-based, so it gets lost if you switch clients (home vs work computer for instance) and in the case of a re-install.lastly, and its not a new suggestion, you are unable to search for bookmarks by name, only sort by name, region, number of jumps, date created, etc.my suggestions:allow a filter to only load current system, constellation, region, or all (like assets, but it can be a drop down, not tabs)allow tagging/labeling like the new, revamped mail system does, so something can be multiple 'things'make the tagging/labeling server side, so it doesn't get lost.expand the bookmark 'typing' to be more than just planets, moons, stations, and everything else is a coordinate. if i bookmark a control tower, it should be typed as a control tower right? allow searching by name (in bookmark lingo, the 'label')a lot of bookmarks are one off, ""just need it to warp back then i don't need it anymore"" kinda bookmarks. add a checkbox on the creation window to mark a bookmark as temporary and have it auto-delete after, lets say one week. this will help clean out the clutter of the thousands of bookmarks i'm sure the server holds on to and serves up on every client request for all though mission loot bookmarks, and bookmarked complexes and anomalies, etc."
7/9/2010,"au contraire, lowsec is indeed broken - its risk is way too low for its reward.hisec pvp (i.e. war) is against forewarned targets who have time to prep for a fight, who will choose appropriate hulls and fits, and seek allies.lowsec piracy is against targets with utter fail fits, who are already engaged with rats which don't retarget, and who do not gang in numbers of more than pairs. even a moderately incompetent pirate should never lose a ship to a mission runner in lowsec. ever. that unbalanced reward (snacky pimp-mod loot, and killmails as well!) for no risk is unsupportable.the lowsec environment needs to be changed to mandate against fits which are inappropriate for pvp. broadly speaking, making missions which are issued for lowsec destination systems similar to fw (very short duration, and not designed for bss), and changing rat behaviour (additional spawns upon warp-in of new ships, and retargeting on the fly) will bring the risk that pirates face back into the same ballpark as that of nullsec lagfests and hisec wardecs."
7/9/2010,"your basic assumption is wrong. i mean, yeah... ""lowsec has almost the same risk as 0.0"" with multiple unconquerable npc real stations per system (not those tiny instant kick-out player built outposts limited on one per system) and occasional small roaming gangs instead of regular 0.0 50+ hac fleets. also, in lowsec there are no: anchorable bubbles, dictor bubbles, heavy interdictor bubbles or bombs.wh don't have less risk than nullspace - no local and no regional intel channels for example. sure, it's less populated, but that doesn't mean it's less dangerous.missions in nullspacealso, you forgot about factional warfare missions and complexes in lowsec - loads of lps, unique faction items and ships in lp stores, more than decent faction standing boost.the rest of your suggestions are the same as nerfing nullspace. since you've obviously never been in 0.0 let me be the first to inform you that bs spawns are not regular in most of the nullsec, especially in higher truesec systems. the belts in lowsec should not contain the rarest ores that are reserved for 0.0 belts. you are suggesting that even lowsec must have abc ores, while 90% of nullspace don't have it. again, check ore distribution based on truesec. besides, if you want rare ores in lowsec, scan for gravimetric sites - they are safer than belts anyway.standing loss is there to passively protect non-pirates and punish pirates and it works as intended.not supported."
7/9/2010,"i am not talking about fw lowsec, but the rest of lowsec. indeed, fw places are ok, i guess, but i've never done fw, so whatever.i am currently in nullsec, this is an obvious alt. i have seen mostly western nullsec, npc as well as sov space. i have had good spawns everywhere (ok, ok, i was in good constellations), and i do know truesec matters a lot. i know abcs are not everywhere in 0.0, but yes, making them available in lowsec makes lowsec more attractive to miners than 0.0, unless they're in an alliance or some alliance's pets.ahh, whatever, i just thought the ore thing was a nice solution to tears :p"
7/9/2010,"i don't see why you're opposed to making probing ships more difficult. i do a lot of probing, have a near max skilled alt for it and guess what, i think it's way too easy. i can probe out anything but a frigate in seconds. i'm experienced and know what i'm doing, most are not as fast. but it's still overpowered and makes ninja missioning basically impossible.an alternative is to give missions a masking effect. they actually had this prior to the current probing system. it was more or less impossible to probe someone with the combat probe equivalents, instead you had to use sensor type specific ones that only had a 2au range. even then it was hit and miss. if this masking effect were re-introduced, it may very well make ninja missioning a viable option again. the only problem with it is it would also make it very easy to make an unprobable ship so long as it's in a mission.in any case, low sec missioning will not expand unless the ability to probe out missioners is nerfed in some way. i've given two ways to do this without breaking anything. both are very reasonable and i make these suggestions as the hunter, not the prey."
7/9/2010,so why hasnt it been done yet...!?
7/9/2010,'its on the backlog'you can be sure that i will continue pushing for it as soon as csm-5 has proper access to said backlog.

7/9/2010,"your summary is inaccurate.i'd love to be wrong, i genuinely hope i am wrong as i'm not one of the 'eve is dying' brigade but there's been a lot of bad ju ju around recently and this csm stuff smells real fishy too. the question remains, will ccp fix the under lying problems or won't they? i can't really see how the csm saying to the player base:-'we know but we can't tell you. is any better than ccp saying to the player base:-'we know but we won't tell you.' my gut feeling is that this amounts to the suppression of bad news for long term players rather than ccp being keen not to spoil a wonderful surprise. whatever your colleague revealed (if this has been documented on another website, can someone provide a link?) is probably not related (and ccp have every right to protect their business of course) but why involve player representatives in the development secrets of the company if these very representatives have no real ability to influence the product development policy? its like a man who makes fireworks telling his children where he keeps the matches.if the player representatives do have the ability to influence product development policy then why are ccp not getting the message? fix what we have already (a brilliant but flawed game) before you make anything new. well maybe this. ccp has to chase the dollar because thousand of people within the game are not paying to play it as they cheat the system to generate isk.how many 0.0 alliances now systematically use python injection to modify the client to keep pace with all the others who are at it? they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely un- policed. how many people use bots? they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely un-stoppable.if you were ccp, would you want to fix lag for these people? they cheat the game so they dont have to pay for it.the massive greed of players who have sought to exploit the game for their own ends has meant that their opinions now count for nothing. on the other hand, a day old noob is the guy that all the content is being developed for because his monthly subscription pays the wages.new players bring in dollars without any pre-conceptions about the current state of the game. new players are attracted by marketing, marketing in turn must have a shiney to market so ccp are forced to regularly build said shiney to attract new players. maintaining/optimizing/upgrading a former shiney is not marketing news. in 6 months time ccp wont be launching a huge campaign for new players on the basis of:-look we cured the lag beast in a game youve never played before! you know that sim city thing on planets? weve made it work better! hey, we know you dont know what rockets are, but we fixed em! hence dust, hence incarna."
7/9/2010,"so you understand that she was kicked for breaking the nda, and you want ccp to disclose what exactly in the nda sh broke thereby disclosing to you the information they did not want disclosed. anything she said or did that was not a violation of the nda is not relevant due to the obvious. well not obvious to everyone i guess."
7/9/2010,"1) further revelations regarding the nda breach may increase the risk that the information that was exposed could be exposed to a wider audience. we do not know the circumstances of the breach - this is true. however, as we do not know those circumstances, we can hardly judge what is and isn't appropriate for ccp to disclose to us about the breach. i think this may be called a ""catch 22"" situation.2) as i suggested earlier, the situation may have moved beyond the scope of the nda - there may now be other external factors being considered by ccp and eva jobse - significant ones."
7/9/2010,"thanks for explaining that, cobalt. it makes more sense. i still don't like being left in the dark, but if it isn't possible, i'm not going to pursue it. i'm just too used to rl authorities keeping things secret that have no business being kept from the public."
7/9/2010,"not necessarily. there are plenty of reasons why companies will not, and absolutely must not divulge information. for example, there are rules around how companies recognize revenues after disclosing information related to future projects (i'm not an accountant, so i don't know the exact rules).remember, ccp is a company, and it also has rules it has to follow. the nda isn't just about keeping information secret for pr or marketing purposes, it's also about following corporate law."
7/9/2010,"your summary is inaccurate.*snipped a few lines*ccp has to chase the dollar because thousand of people within the game are not paying to play it as they cheat the system to generate isk.how many 0.0 alliances now systematically use python injection to modify the client to keep pace with all the others who are at it? they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely un- policed. how many people use bots? they dont pay to play eve and appear to be largely un-stoppable.if you were ccp, would you want to fix lag for these people? they cheat the game so they dont have to pay for it.the massive greed of players who have sought to exploit the game for their own ends has meant that their opinions now count for nothing. on the other hand, a day old noob is the guy that all the content is being developed for because his monthly subscription pays the wages.new players bring in dollars without any pre-conceptions about the current state of the game. new players are attracted by marketing, marketing in turn must have a shiney to market so ccp are forced to regularly build said shiney to attract new players. maintaining/optimizing/upgrading a former shiney is not marketing news. in 6 months time ccp wont be launching a huge campaign for new players on the basis of:-look we cured the lag beast in a game youve never played before! you know that sim city thing on planets? weve made it work better! hey, we know you dont know what rockets are, but we fixed em! hence dust, hence incarna.playing the game by purchasing plex does bring ccp the cash, regardless. every penny of it. if you pay with creditcard or plex, it doesn't matter to ccp. but i have to agree with you on the last part, the new stuff. new players don't care for old bugs, simply because they don't know about them unless...they are gamebreaking, say makes the game crash, constantly.which, it seems, fleet fights seem to do. but new players aren't involved in those right off the bat.i don't know about you but i research my mmos before buying the game. tech support forum and general forum is the first place i go to in any mmo before purchase. after that gameplay."
7/9/2010,"this is a common miss-conception.yes all plex comes from real world spent money so ccp is not ""losing isk"" to plex.what people fail to appreciate is that as older players switch to plex and newer players are the major buyers of plex this creates a situation where ccp has to chase new subscribers for cash-flow.at the expense of having a game worth playing.....this is likely the reason all the expansions are pure hype for wow kids and we have gone so long without fixes."
7/9/2010,"which leads into the question, would ccp be more willing to put money into fixing long term bugs, and less into flashy but largely unwanted expansions, if the long term customers were willing to either go back to paying subscriptions, or at least have the price point of plexs artificailly shifted, so that ccp weren't so reliant on new customers buying them?if you're not actually paying towards the running of a game, then why should you have any say in how it should be run?this of course this makes the csm even more laughable, and most likely irrelevant in the eyes of ccp, as they represent mainly these non-paying users instead of the new players who do pay."
7/9/2010,"at some point, based on the actual incident as well as the drama it's created, ccp has to decide whether the csm brings more benefit vs liability.looking more and more like it's just too much hassle with so little return.kb"
7/9/2010,"the only misconception is your own.plex are the product of gtc's or brought from ccp, these costs real life money. iraspective if you pay for the game via subscription or plex; ccp still gets payed in real money. now the more newer players the odds are they will by extra gtc's to sell and that makes plex's cheaper, plex's can only get into the game one way, and thats from real money.i hope that explains it, if not have a good think about it, do some research and get back to us on the forums here. remember, if nobody sold plex's then there would be none available to buy ingame and the only way to get them ingame is to pay ccp either directly or via one of there agents to obtain a gtc. ccp get payed no matter what, dont you worry about that."
7/9/2010,"yes plex is a supply and demand market, amazing observation.supply comes mostly from new subscribers.demand comes mostly from old subscribers.see?ccp has control over supply also with the plex monthly limited quota.without the internal numbers it's impossible to say, my speculation is that most plex purchasers are new subscribers and thus ccp is aware that these new subscribers are key to their cash-flow.if new users dried up, then plex may dry up, then you'd see exactly what you're talking about.this would force the old users to buy their subscriptions or pay an ever increasing price from traders.until this point the cash-flow comes from new users regardless of who is spending the plex.however with ccp chasing new subscribers exclusively with each expansion you won't see this, as you've observed."
7/9/2010,"fyi i doubt ccp deliberatly control the price of plex as an intention, its mearly a side effect of them selling there product to new customers.i think we shall leave it there as were tangenting way to much for me to carry on this discussion and its late. but ask yourself, what point your tring to make and does it realy matter and if so, perhaps start a thread related to that issue were it would be more appropriatly discussed by the mass's.now sing after me ""ding dong the witch is dead""."
7/9/2010,this is my favorite thread ever! personal attack removed.
7/9/2010,"okay first off from a legal standpoint they probably can't discuss the matter further or exactly mention what event broke the nda. european laws in general are much more strict than american law on matters of privacy. why they don't just come out and say that and stop the speculation i don't know. the initial statement probably should have included a statement about due to counsel from our legal department we can make no other comment.on the matter of the csm, basically waste of time. just like swg senate was pre nge and pre cu. in truth development companies do whatever they want regardless of input from players. it is just a touchy feely process meant to make you feel good. such a representation is not sufficiently large enough to base any major game decisions on. lets just hope that ccp is not being like soe and going to focus groups that never played the game so that they wreck it down the line.the ones that really want to go and do it are probably not the best representatives, much like politicians typically don't represent their constituents adequately. it takes a certain amount of narcissism to desire such positions, which often is at odds with the common man."
7/9/2010,"okay, now go back and read the first line in your own (and same) post:you have essentially answered your own question. also, it is a little bit over a day now since the news broke. perhaps the people directly involved are still discussing things at the glacial pace that is real life."
7/9/2010,"yes, the question is how and when. it's a matter of prioritization, we're competing for scarce resources. what i described is that we've made progress in getting an equal/better footing in competing for them. the difference is that nobody currently sitting on the csm have been fanbois.we all love the game, but most of us have been vocal critics of ccp, both on the forums and during face to face meetings.as such, if you don't trust ccp, you have however every reason to believe us.so there's things we can't say. but we can say what we think about it, to ccp and to you.exemple 1: vuk lau and i bashed the gms during csm 3 pretty hard about competence, consistency, fight against macroers, etc. (check the minutes) if these same people tell you now that the data we have shows conclusively that there has been a huge improvement and we're happy with what we see on all those fronts, you have every reason to believe us.exemple 2: we can't tell you what the next expansion is going to be about. we can tell you we think it has the potential of being awesome, we can also tell you we don't think that is where resources should have been focused. we have the ability to influence the development policy, to an extent.it's always a balancing act, i can understand that ccp's objective may lean more towards getting new players than the existing players care about.ccp understands that if we're unhappy about the game, we don't stay to play it.we're there to talk about where the middle ground should be and what those things are that we care about when talking of improving the game as it is.they are, report them, gms ban them regularly, whether they are connected to rmt or not. we've advised the gms to make their efforts known, and they're doing so regularly (to quote a big report:"
7/9/2010,"count to ten and calm down.no need to attack every posting you don't understand immediately.the requested behavior was to say ""for legal reasons we cannot discuss exactly which event caused a breach of the agreed nda"" not to deliver a detailed report on what happened.it's about saying that something will not happen instead of just not letting it happen.people have it easier when they know ""why"" something is the way it is."
7/9/2010,"i think that's a bit short-sighted.what reason is there to trust you?just because you did not agree with everything ccp did/does?we know csm members were selling their influence for plex, using insider knowledge to profit personally, violate ndas.is that the basis on which we should unconditionally trust the csm?but how is that different from the messages we get from ccp directly?they always say the next expansion is going to be awesome.they always say things are improving in the long run.and the idea that resources should be put somewhere else is the whole point of the whole ""commit to excellence"" thread in the assembly hall. the number of supporters speaks volumes.so really: which additional information does this provide?*edit* fixed some failed quoting"
7/9/2010,"good riddance, ankahasapeemapetilon. i hope ccp chooses to pursue legal action against you as fervently as you wanted to punish people in internet spaceships."
7/9/2010,"violation of the nda can be anything from a small indiscretion to a fellow eve player about some coming feature to full blown industrial espionage. the farther it goes to the latter, the less likely we are going to get any more accurate information on it, at least until it got wrapped up and dealt with, if ever. we may read about it in the news, if it's big enough, albeit that is unlikely."
7/9/2010,"i wonder if the trouble she has gotten into might have something to do with the content of her portfolio?if you recall, there was an advert during the pvp tournament calling for more women to apply for a job at ccp. perhaps she overshared information (thats never happened before) from her current employer to her prospective new employer.it would certainly explain why she was dropped so quickly, and why it would be in ccp's best interests to avoid looking connected to her, and to avoid public knowledge of what she has done.really, it would mean that anything that comes out in the future that hints at possible plagiarism would be grounds for a court case.i could be wrong though.then again, she went so far as to consider a position on the csm as defacto working for ccp.is if so hard to imagine that she wanted to bring her a game to a job interview?"
7/9/2010,ang kah sen tah pem kaheasy :)
7/9/2010,"nobody can ""cheat the system"" and ""play for free"". each and any plex-license was paid with real and existing money at some point. it doesn't matter the slightest, if people ""generate isk from nothing"", because they can only use these isks to buy plex-licenses which were bought from ccp at some point.also conversely, like several other posters hinted at it, it's also a misconcept, that the influx of new players is the only thing, that keeps the cash-cow running and hence fancy new stuff is the thing to do. older players buy these plexes. if older players leave the game, due to annoyingly never fixed bugs and general problems, the demand for plexes will decline drastically, which then again creates a situation at which injecting new plexes into the market is a mute point, because you get next to no isks for them, due to too many plexes on the market.and even if there's a lack of massive numbers of new subscribers, that also means, that there will be less plexes on the market, forcing some of the odler players, who can not or do not want to win in the plex-price-race, have to actually pay the monthly fee and it's usually those older players, that will not leave the game easily, because they're simply very attached or even addicted to it, contrary to newcomers."
7/9/2010,thats funny csm has no fanbois err you do know ank was the only one not elected by block voters right? trusting people put in buy macro ratting 0.0 alliances which always claim theres no macro ratting in 0.0 is probably the best joke i have heard this year.
7/9/2010,has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
7/9/2010,"funny that people claim only candidates with block vote support will get into csm but decline to provide any evidence. every round of elections people claim the large 0.0 alliances will take over the csm and it still hasn't happened.within csm5, vuk and sok are the only two full delegates who represent large alliance blocks. additionally look at the large alliances who failed to get any candidates into even the alternates.many of us come from smaller corps or alliances and picked up votes based on our reputation and policies not some 0.0 block voter conspiracy. sure people like mynxee (strong supporter of lowsec and piracy), korvin (russian speaking) and deirdra (eve-uni are well respected plus he was chair of csm3) have large numbers of supporters, but they are certainly not put there by 0.0 macro ratting alliances."
7/9/2010,actually all you had to do was read csm results and the posts leading up to it to see that tea. as i have 2 alts in null alliances even the ones that try and stop macro ratting its still happening. sorry your not from a small corp or alliance a small corp is 10 people and under. but i will admit this so far your the only one i have seen posting common sense. to bad rest of the csm except korvin (who i dont know and have seen little of so have no clue) do not share your ability. sad part is first couple i voted got friends out to vote then we realized it was all a joke and it got worse instead of better. most are like max or sok. they post so much bs its like watching jerry springer
7/9/2010,"you still have not provided any evidence, and in fact i have debunked your claims to block voting several times already, but don't let that stop you."
7/9/2010,"my only comment would be this. as the csm are representatives of the eve player base, and a significant portion of (at least those who are posting here) are interested in getting more information, it's quite baffling to me that i can't really see any effort from any of you to reflect that desire, and at least enquire about whether more information can be released.yeah, i know most of us didn't really like ankh, and there's more people happy with the outcome than aren't. but, the whole ""csm being nothing but a ccp mouthpiece/distraction/pr stunt"" issue would be quite easily put to bed by something as simple as publicly calling for more info. so far, the response seems to be ""good thing, done by slightly obfuscated method...ah, we'll live with it however it was done."" i sort of think that's you guys failing at your 'duty'."
7/9/2010,"report them, we have evidence that the gms do take actions against those. it may take some time to investigate where their money goes so ccp can kill the money distributors instead of playing whack-a-mole with money generators, but they get dealt with.also, the argument that the csm is controlled by large 0.0 entities is demonstrably false.a number of candidates from smaller corps/alliances have made it through and a number of people running under the banner of large alliances have failed to get in.among the alliances who failed to get in, i'll name:systematic chaos, goonswarm (under its new name), bob (well, it), xdeathx, legiunea romana, razor, cult of war, intrepid crossing, voltron, etc.who got in in their place?trebor from initiative mercenaries, dierdra vaal from eve-uni, ubercarebear ankhe, teadaze from agony, me from rnk, mynxee from noir.. that's just for this election... same thing happened during the previous ones.either way, it's up to people who vote to elect who gets in. if people can't be bothered to vote, it stands to reason that the people who do vote get elected.well, if he's not, i am... i got elected in csm 2 (alt) and 3 (main) while being in a 4 member carebear corp. i joined rnk which is not in 0.0 and cannot be considered a big alliance and got in csm 4 (alt) and 5 (main) as well. that enough of an exemple to you?what you mean is that we don't share your point of view and have the balls to sometimes have a critical opinion about things?it's getting a bit tiresome the general bashing attitude on the forums. i understand that the humain brain is limited to easily being able to pick between 2 choices, but life is not as black and white, and there's arguments for and against everything, even when you generally think it's more white than black or the other way around."
7/9/2010,"should we know anything, we wouldn't be able to say, being bound by the same nda ankhe broke.also, this is a breach of contract between ccp and eva, we have little say in the matter.if you think none of us reflect the general desire to know more, you haven't read all we said, because we would like ccp to be able to say more, however they can't or won't.contract breaches are sensitive matters. should it be information related, ccp may not want to reveal the information that was hidden and should remain hidden in the first place. in addition to which, it may lead to lawsuits from one side or the other, therefore ccp is most likely not at liberty to say more.whatever it actually was, you can guess the severity of the offense by comparing the statements issued for larkonis and this one. and therefore the difference in information disclosed. there's definitely improvements that are possible in the amount/quality of information released and we've asked for those clarifications, but that's up to ccp."
7/9/2010,"there is a simple answer, we can't discuss csm <-> ccp communications publicly. unless ccp release the information it is nda, end of .the best i can do is assure you the csm are very unhappy with the situation and with being left without any public clarification from ccp as to the nature of the breach."
7/9/2010,"first, thanks for the reasoned reply. i'm genuinely not trying to stir anything up, so i appreciate not getting assaulted with fire!i'm well aware of what goes on around nda's, i used to create about 20 of them a week for a publishing company i worked with a while back. quite accurately, they do prevent you from disclosing some things - and i wouldn't want you to. i'm not calling for you to reveal things, i'm calling for someone to ask ccp to give at least some kind of information, rather than accepting their blanket statement that they will say nothing of any sort to anyone, ever. (that shouldn't/can't be an nda violation, you're only asking a question )put it this way - ccp have been terrible at fulfilling their word in the past, with regards certain things like server logs, lag, etc. i have a lot more reason to trust the word of the csm than i do ccp, and at the moment all we have is ""ccp removed ankh from the csm for something or other that happened a while ago"", with nothing to support this at all.my main concern through this is not ankh's reputation, position, or in fact anything to do with what happened. it's that i see this rendering the csm non-viable, in that it tarnishes the reputation too much. the bold bit in the quote is where i think the problem is, to be honest; ""we would like"" =! ""we have asked"", and i see no evidence of the latter.edit: thanks teadaze, also. they'd moderate it to death quick-sharpish, probably, but wouldn't simply creating a thread indicating what you've said above, and observing the ccp non-response, shield the csm-as-organisation (not the people) from potentially detrimental reputation effects?second edit: ok, i just spotted your last line where you said you'd asked for clarification. i'm somewhat happier."
7/9/2010,"your point is well taken teadaze. even so, this is perhaps the first indication that the csm has been in dialogue about this issue, may be developing a position on the matter, or has expressed its concerns to ccp. none of us would require you to violate your nda. that does not mean you should avoid proactive communication with the players about your efforts on this front. many of us would appreciate that. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/9/2010,"let me just clarify then.we have asked ccp to provide more information. before the announcement was made, and have requested it again a few times, together or separately, the latest request having been made as recently as 4 hours ago.i'm not too worried about the impact on the csm as a whole for this instance, should it be cause for issues wrt csm as a whole, it would already have happened, and as far as i know it hasn't. so it's clearly a ccp vs eva thing, not ccp vs csm."
7/9/2010,"thank you, meissa; your reassurance that this issue has been raised is, pretty much, what i was looking for. as such, i rescind any comments about you not doing your duty as csm.(i wasn't actually referring to ccp vs csm, i was referring to csm's reputation with the player base, or at least the part that pays attention )"
7/9/2010,"have you thought about players vs csm?it appears some of the communication patterns of ccp are slowly growing into the csm as well.it takes a couple of postings and questions until someone will say ""well we already did that a couple of times, we just didn't say it - oh btw, results will come soon""."
7/9/2010,"thank you, meissa. that is the kind of action, communication and information the player-base needs and expects from the csm. i hope you guys keep us up to date."
7/9/2010,"ah right.so basically blogged what we already know..that ccp dont give a toss about the csm, doesnt listen and is just a joke...one thing about ccp i have seen over the years is that it does not care about its community at all...eva is rightly pointing out the problems with ccp and the csm but as usual ccp are as corrupt as hell and try sweep stuff under the carpet..get rid of csm cos in ccp eyes it means nothing...enough said really...complete waste of time, and my personal trust in ccp as nose dived alot in the past few years...the game is ok, sadly the company isnt"
7/9/2010,"i have no problem myself with not getting all the information i would like to have on this. frankly because we all know a large majority of that is just pure nosiness.however, it seriously disturbs me that ccp just suddenly kicks a member of the player elected csm, the representitives of the player base interests, without any further insight other than claiming she broke the nda. i'm not looking for them to tell the entire player community what she did to break the nda. i'm looking for them to tell the csm, who is all under that same nda and thus there shouldn't be a problem as i see it sharing that information with, who can then relate to us the simple words of, ""yes, it was a perfectly legitamite reason.""we voted you in. we trusted you to fully represent our interests. if ccp can show you it was legite and you can assure us it was, then okay! i'm happy as i'm sure most others would be! as it stands now though, this event has caused a major shakeup in the players opinions and confidence in the csm, which i would say is really the more important issue here!"
7/9/2010,"originally by: teadazewell, just as a question. why you dont go then to ccp and simply tell them ""okay ccp, thats the facts, it was a democrativ election, and you booted a person without to state a reason. but because this is a democratic elected council, tell the ppl please the reasons so they can decide for themself if you are act in the spirit of the players or just because of the base of rumors, and let them decide, or we simply step all back from csm""hey really, you are elected from players to stand for the player issues, come on, show some democrativ spirit, the fundamentel idear behind a democrativ system. a democratic system that boots simply a elecated person , no matter the reason, and dont wanna say the public why, is not better as a fascism regime or a dictatorship. so come on csm<U+FFFD>s, stand for a democratic way. that would be my suggestion. what you do, or not do, is your choice. if you want to simply accept the kind of ccp is handling this situation, well, then it<U+FFFD>s the question if there was a real break or somethin else. free informations, thats the fundament of democracy, even in this case. anything else, isnt democractic. and pls dont say this cant be compared. because it is not a democratic way how ccp it handles and it isnt the way that the csm was supposed to be.and we all should never forget, that it was in the first place ccp devoloper personal who cheated in the game and openly told it the people when they was caught and that this was the reason in the first place to initiate the csm programm, so somethin like that couldnt happen anymore and the trust would come back. now ccp is doing the exact opposite.a csm member, that was know for her kind not to agree in all things how ccp handles it and to open resiste agains some of ccp<U+FFFD>s decisions was booted without givin the people who voted her to give reasons. if she have really break the nda, people deserve to know it how she did it, otherwise i for my part would simply belive that ccp wanted to get rid of a csm member and booted her for any reason that nobody knows. like a dictator would shoot the people who try to tell the rest of them that there goverment is a cruel one. in that spirit, the spirit of free information, the foundation of the democracy and the main idear behind the csm program that works like a democracy, you csm<U+FFFD>s should resist. tell ccp you will step back if they dont tell the ppl who elected you what excatly happend. ccp dont even need to say that she told somebody a special secret or else or to name it, they just need to say whats the situation like ""we have evidence that person xy has broke the nda and give informations to a other software company"" or somethin like that. if she really have broke the nda, it<U+FFFD>s ccp<U+FFFD>s good right to boot her. if not...and ccp cant prove it....and booted her only because of a rumor without hard evidance....the rest you can think yourself if you read the poste...i just say dictatorship.chereyo!quen"
7/9/2010,"1. they did state a reason- breach of nda.2. ccp is a private company and they have the right to run their company however they jolly well please. maybe sometimes that sucks for us players, and maybe things would be better if they would fix the things that the csm says they should fix, but that doesn't change the fact that they own eve, they run eve, and at the end of the day, all decision making will fall to them- including firing a volunteer who breached a contract.3. they certainly do not need to tell us the circumstances of the nda breach. first, that would defeat the purpose of the nda in the first place, that is, keeping upcoming stuff a secret. second, you have no real reason to know, despite spouting off about democracy and dictatorships like you've just gotten out of political science i. ccp doesn't have to indulge your desire for gossip and nosiness."
7/9/2010,"people seem to forget, the csm only has real power in the same sense that we have real intrenet spaceships.it's a hobby for ccp, when they have the time to dedicate to it, they'll be happy to play along and actually listen to the csm, they'll even bring it up as part of eve's fiction from time to time.but when stuff like this happens, the breaching of an nda contract by a member of a group such as csm who has close connection to ccp themselves, suddenly eve has to take it's place for what it really is, a videogame, because for ccp this is (as far as we know) a very serious, real world matter that they need to attend to.to all the people hounding the csm to ''be our voice ,get information from ccp!'' just quit it, ccp is having to deal with a very real world problem right now and as such the csm has taken their place alongside you as just other game players until ccp is confident and happy that they can talk about it.from the get go the csm is only your voice when ccp has the time to listen. they are not a second entity themselves that can bash heads with ccp when you feel you need something addressed so for the love of god, sit back, relax and just wait. it's been what, 2 days? are you guys really that impatient?c'mon, hulkageddon has just started, go enjoy yourselves for the week! forget your troubles and blow ships up, have some fun and this will be dealt with before you know it.*wonders how good of an idea it is to bring up hulkageddon in a topic about ankh*"
7/9/2010,csm isnt reall that useful anymore next time all my votes are going to cat'o ninetails
7/9/2010,"i don't agree that they're not useful, i just think everyone thinks they can do more than they can.people want the csm to march up to ccp and do what they consider to be 'fixing things'. ccp is not going to do as the csm say, not even close but it does give ccp something to think about if something interest is brought up to them.for some reason people seemed to think that after this csm was formed that ccp would honestly scrap their current plans as a business just to fix things for people is a bit short sighted on the part of csm voters."
7/9/2010,"sorry to say, but i hate your frog. i simply do not feel as if i'm fitting in until i declare my hatred for _something_. sadly, i am more familiar with frogs than i am with any of the current csm and i find it hard to hate somebody i know little about.now on to the topic of empire dwellers such as myself....don't assume we are all of the same mindset or motivation simply because we choose to remain in high security space. we all pay to play this game and we all care enough to deserve equal respect when it comes to our views on the future of eve. in 06 i lived in 0.0 as part of the ascn with the merchant marines. after that period we went to kos and not long after i became ceo of the corp. i handed the reigns off to another player due to time constraints on my end. eventually i ended up back in the npc corp dcmi and this is where i have remained for just over a year now.surprisingly enough i've been having a blast. i enjoyed 0.0 quite a bit but have enjoyed helping new players in dcmi even more. i often run into other former ascn members that are in the same boat as myself and have also decided to remain in empire for the time being.ankhesentapemkah secured so many votes because she concentrated on garnering the respect of hi-sec players who normally are all but ignored during csm campaigns. in doing so she ended up being favored by a large number of players who likely wouldn't have voted at all under normal circumstances. i however did not vote for the queen of spoons due to some of her off kilter remarks about player pirates and her volatile nature when dealing with those who did not share her views. i've never had anything against players who choose to plunder and pillage. they pay to play the game just as i do and have every right to do so in whatever way they enjoy most. in all honesty i doubt the game would be nearly as fun without having to look over my shoulder and be paranoid. but that's neither here nor there. despite not voting for her myself, i can see why others did. it's just a shame that she had to be such an unstable individual. its worth pointing out that with the numbers she brought in, you can be sure that other empire dwellers will be encouraged to step forth as potential csm's in the next election. with that in mind, it would be foolish for any future candidate to ignore the high security voters."
7/9/2010,"what!how can you in one single discarded sentence manage to say the csm is useless and next csm your going to vote for so in so. the king is dead, long live the king - logic does not apply here.indeed if ccp were to stop the csm, i highly suspect you would be one of the first to complain about that.ask yourself this - if there was no csm, would we the players be better of than we are now; then when you have worked out that the answear is ""no"", then my son you will be a man.but all this lambasting of the csm based upon a tabloid headline fact filter is utterly insulting to not only the current csm members, but also those who stood before them. do some research, see how much effort they put into it, its not just a holiday, far from it.if you care about the csm, you will apprecieate what they do achieve, and not judge them about a persons shortcommings. if you wish to do that, go watch big brother, be right up your street that would. otherwise accept the facts and move on, if the person involved posts elsewere about what happened in more detail then i'm sure ccp will enlighten us to more of the real facts, either way it don't change a thing.but all these pages discussing what, somebody broke a rule that shouldn't of been broken. realy is that simple after all. no need to taint the other csm's in the same brush out of ignorance now is there."
7/9/2010,now that's the type of post i like to see.
7/9/2010,"1, ""breaching a nda"" is not a good enough reason to remove someone from a position of representation. if she did it while performing a function as csm-member, it's acceptable that she stays. if she did it for personal gains then she should be send away. ccp is smart enough to make a news-item giving enough information that we can be satisfied that the latter happened. but they didn't.2. the do not have the right to manage the company how they want. they are bound by consumer-laws, for example. a part of the service they are offering is democratic player-representation, and they have removed this service for a part of the players without decent explanation. according to most (eu) consumer-laws they must reinstate this service, or provide partial refund. since a democratically chosen player-representation is a discriminating feature of eve with respect to other mmo, the applicability of the small print (eula) is limited."
7/9/2010,has ahnk been reinstated yet?
7/9/2010,"i guess this is what people mean when they speak of 'a quality reply', thanks :p"
7/9/2010,agh!
7/9/2010,"god i hate you people.since ccp says ankh did something bad and ankh says she didn't, isn't it possible that ccp has a general 'say nothing' order on this until they've sorted out the details?"
7/9/2010,"what the **** are you talking about? breach of nda is a ****ing perfect reason to dismiss a volunteer from a volunteer position at a privately held company. and to top it all off, we're talking about eva jobse, not ankhsemimpossibletotypebull****name. when people google ""eva jobse"", who works in game development at another game studio, they see ""broke nda"".and in case the ramifications of that don't slap you across the face with a 10 ton hammer: ccp just ruined her career. she currently works at another game development company, and in all likelihood will lose that job over this nda breach. furthermore, she now has 'two' employers that just dropped her for nda breach, and googling her even a little will reveal this enormous scandal of nda breach. and that's neglecting the fact that game development's a pretty small world and the name ""eva jobse"" just became mud.so now we've established that eva jobse has legal damages that ccp is liable for if this is something as petty as player politics. so, what in the hell would make ccp take that kind of legal risk - worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and at least as much in damages if they lost? almost certainly they wouldn't single out one of the many csm candidates that blogged equivalently. well maybe they'd do this over a real mother ****ing nda breach. oh, and what would any lawyer say? ""dismiss, and shut the **** up"".-liang"
7/9/2010,"i also support keeping missions in highsec and i live in empire.thanks and take care,t'amber"
7/9/2010,"if i apply for a job, can i put internet spaceship warrior in my previous employment record?"
7/9/2010,"can and should are totally different things. i wouldn't, and i assure you that i'm a much larger forum warrior than you are. ;-) your comment also seems to neglect that this is a real problem for her real life. ccp would be terminally brain dead to do this without proof of an actual nda breach.-liang"
7/9/2010,"long time lurker new poster but i have to echo liang's sentiments. are you people really that obtuse? ccp said she broke the nda, she said she didn't and would post an update on her website. guess what she hasn't and she also hasn't responded here, except through alts, which leads me to believe that her main account or accounts ccp know about have also been banned. things aren't looking so good for old ank from the rational thinking person's standpoint. and by rational thinking person i mean anyone with an iq of at least 50. so everybody defending her and calling for ccp to explain please shut the hell up. or at least try to make arguments that make sense and are logically consistent."
7/9/2010,"and, t'amber is very involved in the eve community through her lotteries and other special events. i had a blast during the full metal jacket competition. t'amber is also very friendly and not anywhere near the polarizing figure that ankh is. if people want high sec representation, t'amber is the way to go."
7/9/2010,"i don't know what kind of police state you live in, but you should seriously look at applying for political assylum somewhere else. even england would be an improvement on your current situation. criminal charges for an nda breach? that's a matter of civil law in any half-decent country. were ccp to take this to court, they'd be looking at monetary damages."
7/9/2010,"hopefully it does end up in court, though. if for no other reason than the substance of the breach would most likely become a matter of public record through discovery"
7/9/2010,"i concede the point that the matter going to court would fuel countless more weeks of trolling, drivel and stupidity on the forum. further, i suspect it would grafity a number of forum users who spend far too much time worrying about this crap, and not enough time worrying about what's really important: blowing up internet spaceships and eating pie. especially the pie, because that's available even when you get ganked.please get your priorities right, people.removed an unnecessary comment. zymurgist"

7/9/2010,added you.
7/9/2010,"ccp is either brain dead, arrogant, or they have the proof. we can all speculate but i don't think we will hear much on this for the reasons you outline above. the way this is panning out, it will effect her *real* job so she can likely prove *real* economic loss and therefore she would have a *real* libel claim. all this means everyone involved will likely shut up. eva jobse or no jobse, that is the question. but really based on what ccp has already posted its likely her game design career is up even if she can prove libel. so i guess its ""eva no jobse.""trolling removed. zymurgist"
7/9/2010,"well, ankh didn't update her blog about it as was announced. so there seems to be a good reason to keep quiet about details not only on ccp's side."
7/9/2010,"if it's relevant to the job description i would say yes.when asked about mentoring or leadership experience i happily list out not only voluntarily teaching people math, programming, and writing; managing small, tactical groups of programmers and support staff; but also my experiences with scheduling, maintaining order, training, leadership responsibilities, and arbitrating arguments in uo, eq, wow, eve, warhammer, planetside, quake clans, mechwarrior clans, daoc, cod clans, etc. (i just realized this list is way longer than is reasonable).one interesting thing is to point out how it is a lot easier to get people to do what you want them to do irl because you have the conventional carrots and sticks. i would love to see your average mid-level cubicle commander exert the force of personality and organization required to get 10, 25, 40, 100, or 500 people online at the same time across different timezones with varying skill levels, ages, and availabilities then have them be committed to a goal and achieve it. they should give out honorary phd's in organizational management to those that take up the position of leading mmo guilds/clans/corporations/armies to success. herding adhd cats on amphetamines to swim the english channel while solving differential equations in your head and reciting joyce's ulysses from memory is trivial in comparison."
7/9/2010,"i hate to say it, and i don't support lian'g's tone, but this is dead-on right.what surprises me is that it got to this .... why ccp would publically announce that she's being kicked for nda breach, even if true, is a big, big question. its gonna mess with this woman's real life. ... true or not, what a can of worms. my advice would have simply been: speak with her privately about it, and then disqualify her from re-running. the fight doesn't seem worth the payoff."
7/9/2010,"are you serious about what you just wrote? if i were you, i'd think about and hastely edit my post away."
7/9/2010,"hey - i'm kinda slow, so maybe you can help me out and elucidate on why you think this is such a stupid post? the only reason i can imagine ccp would publically accuse her of breaching an nda (which i am now convinced will likely have real world consequences on this woman's real life) is that the disclosure had commercial ramifications and the proof is rock solid. i'm not saying that's not the case, i'm just saying its an aggressive and risky route to take by ccp. this really will likely mess with her real life ... its not just internet spaceships at this point.ps if you have access to my email, feel free to use it"
7/9/2010,"it's a simple concept: eva made a commitment to keep certain things to herself (or only discuss amongst ccp employees or csm folks), and made a personal choice to disregard that committment. for whatever reason, she violated the trust ccp placed in her. just saying ""this is a computer game"" is irrelevent; she made a personal, real life committment and chose to break it. tough beans. i say we all move on."
7/9/2010,"not announcing her dismissal would (i think) most probably result in eva jobse as ankhesencopypasta disappearing from eve, and all it'd take is one post of ""where in the world is ankhesencopypasta?"" to trigger a tsunami of speculation even more vapid than the current demands for more information by the nosey parker brigade. i don't mean to be rude but unless you're legal counsel to ccp your advice in this matter is irrelevant. as i've tried to hint at before this point in time, people need to stop and consider that the primary issue here may not be that there was an nda breach, but rather how it happened. this may be entirely why we haven't heard anything more from official channels.the reason we don't know is because the situation could be extremely serious.realistically, ccp is obligated to preserving itself and its precious bodily fluids first. where eva works next is her concern. anything else is absurd."
7/9/2010,"well, i hope it does end there. hopefully she will acknowledge her guilt, accept the ramifications and fallout, and everyone will move on."
7/9/2010,can't really argue with that.i retract my previous opinion.

7/9/2010,"how is it risky for ccp, its very simple, she sign a contract stating that she would not disclose cretin information. she disclosed that information to whom ever, where ever, when ever, and what ever it was. at the end of the day, she broke a contract, and she is very lucking ccp hasn't filed civil charges, and if they do its will within their rights.ccp didn't make eva look bad, eva did, and if she can't live with that, then that's her problem. ccp is in no way responsible for the choice she made in breaking the nda, and has every right to explain to the player base why she was removed from the csm. to say ccp caused personal damages is foolish, and stupid, they didn't force her to break the nda, and regardless of how it might damage her job and profession, she did it to herself. she left the world of internet spaceships and entered the real world when she was voted in and signed that contract."
7/9/2010,"it could be that ank made a serious breach of the non-disclosure agreement, and ccp with all due legal diligence announced her departure from the csm in a well coordinated and strategized manner. or it could be that someone in ccp made a mistake, jumped the gun, and ccp is now trying to quietly clean up the mess. we don't know, and without an evidentiary finding from some credible source, the allegation that she violated a dnr remains just that, an allegation. i'm not trying to say that transparency and accountability on the part of ccp is unimportant, or that representative bodies like the csm do not raise issues that transcend narrow legal interpretations of what a corporation can, should or ought to do. but we are all in the dark here. until that changes, one can only speculate. i doubt that is a good use of our time. delilah"
7/9/2010,"fixed that for you.the point i'm trying to get across is that ccp is handling this in a manner which is consistent with a real and serious nda breach. if any of the tinfoil hat reasons for them removing her were true (such as her being as critical on her blog as all the other csm delegates, ""spoongate"", being controversial, a carebear, not a member of an alliance power bloc, etc) then ccp would be liable for destroying her reputation and terminating her career.but... they're handling this just like a real nda breach, and so far so is ankh. talk to a lawyer, sit tight, and shut the **** up about it. honestly, it's good advice for all of us.-liang"
7/9/2010,"can we get some candidates that aren't dikridding ccp for that 10%bonues to (shiptype) for thier alliance. these guys are all talk and no voting record, and consistently bring us useless features and are often made using if statements in the games code."
7/9/2010,"""i've not worked under the scrum system, but by having a self contained team of game designers, programmers, qa and so on i wonder if they are too close to give objective feedback amongst themselves until it is too far advanced to make widescale changes. somebody with more experience of scrum should chime in though.""this is pretty much accurate. i've worked using this system twice; once it worked, because there were people outside, watching closely. once it failed, because the team was so convinced our idea was brilliant, we never really stopped to think."
7/9/2010,sense. you are not making very much.
7/9/2010,"the first question that must be asked and answered is this: what is ccp willing to do on the scale of the eve online product to address player concerns & desires, what resources are they willing to dedicate to those concerns, and what amount of time in the development cycle to address/examine those concerns? without an answer to that single question any others are irrelevent.ps: and there's the friggin' 5 minute delay. pps: from mynxee's latest blog ("
7/9/2010,"imo that's not inherent to scrum itself but more to the people in the team(s).if the team members are capable of questioning and adjusting ideas, plans and features then they don't need an ""external advisor"".otoh scrum is centered on the management of a project.it focuses on efficiency (the ""burn down"") and getting done all the things that are mentioned in the release plan.imo it's rather easy to forget about solid quality and basic common-sense for creating software because you can convice yourself everything is running fine as long as the process is still running fine - even if the result is not really under control.extreme programming as another agile method is clearly centered on the software (""code matters"") but might not be so popular with the management (""you mean 2 people are working on 1 problem at the same time?"", ""we have to write code that tests our code before we are allowed to change it? you're kidding, right?!"")"
7/9/2010,"just a quick status update about the meeting minutes:2 july: ccp sent initial draft of the minutes to csm4 july: csm sent a substantially revised and expanded draft to ccp9 july: ccp returned the draft with mostly minor edits11 july: ""approved for publication"" final draft sent to ccp12 july: publishedi believe that ccp intends to publish the minutes as early as possible next week. with any luck, that will be on monday.some people question why this process takes so much time. i will point out that it is a 28 page document, that 9 csms plus ccp are contributing feedback to make sure it is right, and we all have jobs and other rl obligations that prevent us from spending every waking moment on this particular task."
7/9/2010,excellent service.
7/9/2010,"we understand that, but updates like this are realy useful. ppl don't mind waiting that much if they have an indication of when they are going to get what they want.but ofcourse, you as csm members know that already and will do your best to keep your public informed as much as possible"
7/9/2010,"many thanks for the feedback. few things irritate me as much as the impression of being ignored, and thus updates like this are much appreciated. now if only we could dispel that impression with regards to ankh..."
7/9/2010,"thanks for keeping the communication alive, mynxee. :)"
7/9/2010,"what benefits have we, the players, seen from the csm so far?maybe i haven't been paying close enough attention, but i've yet to see anything that ccp has done differently based on input from the csm that couldn't have been gathered much more cheaply via the suggestions in these forums.surely we don't need an entire council of players being sent to iceland in order to summarize forum feedback, do we?"
7/9/2010,"let's take at look at the previous minutes which contain this:out of four, point 2 was actually completed but was merely a fluff piece where the only concrete improvement notedis no longer the case as we are still waiting for the minutes.any comment from the csm why you let ccp igonore you while continuing to play your part in the pr show ?"
7/9/2010,so we get rid of the system instead of encouraging lazy/ignorant people to actually interact and do something positive to improve everyone's experience?excuse me while i got bash my head into a desk.
7/9/2010,its not that its because even though its all with the best intentions from both ccp & the voted csm there's abosultely nothing ever done to fix the issue brought up over and over and over do i need to go on.
7/9/2010,omg thats so true. csm is a joke.
7/9/2010,we're still waiting for the minutes because the csm asked to review and edit them before they got passed on to us.
7/9/2010,"what do you propose we do, fly to iceland and storm ccp headquarters demanding action? communications with ccp is routinely slow--it can take days to get an answer to a simple question. email is the only mechanism we have for communicating and because of the common delay in replies, nothing that resembles dialog is possible.the csm edits to the minutes have been in ccp's hands since sunday. my last communication from them about the status of the minutes was tuesday. at that time, i expressed the opinion that contextual details of discussions are important to leave in to demonstrate the ways in which the csm is representing players' views. now we're waiting for ccp to finish their edits. if they actually do what was promised (give csm the chance to review their edits before the minutes are published) and we discover that we don't agree with their revisions, then what? csm has the choice of just letting them get published that way in the interest of time/player interest or risking further delay by insisting on changes that make sense to us. as with most choices csm must make, we are damned if we do and damned if we don't."
7/9/2010,"time to disband csm - totally...ccp dont even listen to it, its been proved time and time again...ccp clearly do not listen or want to listen to the player base....and havent for years, its a pr ploy thats badly implemented.when are you going to wake up and small the coffee"
7/9/2010,"i had hopes that csm5 would be different because of ""stakeholder""...but so far, not. so...yeah."
7/9/2010,"you can resign. it's the only weapon in your arsenal unfortunately and it can only be used once. ccp can and will ignore you if it suits their interests. if ccp keeps sending you draft minutes you don't agree with, will you keep sending them back until your csm period is over ? there is obviously something massively wrong if the minutes are so different from what you remember being discussed and decided. if it's incompetence or malign intent that has caused this will have to be seen but you should at least make some sort of deadline by which either minutes are published or you take a stand.edit: your acceptance of ccp taking days to communicate is worrying. it's the 21st century, messages do not travel to iceland by ship anymore. was this slow communication not one of the things that was supposed to improve since the csm was implemented ?"
7/9/2010,"resigning would be the easy way out...but (imho) would have zero impact on ccp or the csm process. plus it would remove the the ability to report on matters from an inside perspective--which is vital to keeping players informed about realities of the csm process. besides...i am still hopeful that csm5 can accomplish something useful (even if that something turns out to be very different from our ""party line"" charter).my ""acceptance""? if you have some ideas for forcing a more timely response to emails (with the exception of more emails, a technique we're already familiar with), i'd love to hear them."
7/9/2010,talk to your ccp champions via skype or some other method ? emails can and will be ignored if the recipient thinks they are not relevant or important.
7/9/2010,"apparently being in the csm has zero impact on ccp or the csm process too. ha! too funny. the only thing the csm tells the player base is one of three things:1. useless filler information that is of no importance or stuff we already know.2. some information about improvements that never happen.3. teases of knowing some inside information just to throw out the nda in our face like some elitist pig.the entire gaming community is waiting for the day the csm accomplishes something useful. that day, from the looks of the way things are going will never come."
7/9/2010,mynxee you should only have to send your revisions 1 time. if they post without the revisions you can create a thread about what they left out or mistated. just because you let them publish the minutes without undue delay does not mean you agree they are complete or accurate. don't let them drag this out because no one will care about what happened 6 months ago.
7/9/2010,"things that the money used on the csm could be better used for:- bringing back eve tv- redesigning and upgrading the forums- putting together more random polls and surveys of the actual eve playerbase- improving the eve store or adding more items to it- adding more to live events- improving the awful eve correspondents reports- basically, anything else that would actually benefit far more players. you could take the budget for the csm and buy each dev at ccp a bunch of cheetos bags and you'd be using the money in a better way for the people who pay for this game.the csm is a total social butterfly idiot-fest. look at this thread, people don't vote because they give a damn or think the csm actually does anything... but because of alliance favors and requests so they can get inside information. it's why you see the same old people being elected each cycle from the big alliances, so that they can get insider information about upcoming changes to the game and prepare for them early and so a few of them can get free trips to iceland. they don't do any work, they don't have new ideas, it's the same old people getting the same old advantages. the csm is imbalancing, impotent and idiotic. get rid of it! put the resources to something else that actually benefits the playerbase."
7/9/2010,if you were to work out the total cost for the csm on yearly basis you would probably find it to be laughably low compared the costs associated with assigning a scrum team to any of your suggested activities.
7/9/2010,"community=csm=ccp?the topic on the banned csm member at another place is sadening to read. trolling, hate-messages, pettiness and all. but heh, capsuleers are what they are in rl. thats the beauty of this game. it mirrors rl to the bone.most saddening is csm itself. many members dive into the trolling themselves, some of them get censored by ccp moderators. well, ccp good luck with this csm! finally we can conclude csm is a real off-spring of the capsuleers. democracy does work! they focus on details, more details and more replies, are driven by emotional discontent, and focuse on petty-self interest. the larger picture that should be the mindset of any democratically elected representative is gone for-ever.question to ccp top brass: did'nt you as ccp ask for this yourself? answer: big yes. sure you have the 'right' not to disclose reasons. but with this kind of community you brought it all in the forums yourself."
7/9/2010,"the cost in time and effort on ccp's part in maintaining this pointlessness that you so stridently defend is equal to, or more than, most of the things mentioned on that list.it is no surprise that you defend the csm so much, considering that you and your alliance use it to prepare for future changes to the game. hell, it's the only reason you run for it. you have about as much credibility defending the csm as the fox does in guarding the henhouse."
7/9/2010,"[citation needed]*edit* i'll add an estimate of my own. cost of the csm: plane tickets, hotels, salary for the hours that p<U+FFFD>tur and eyj<U+FFFD> spend on it: 50k  a year? cost of running a scrum team for a year: well over a million.hahahahahahahahahahahahahahah"
7/9/2010,"when i read the op i spent five minutes trying to find the thumbs up icon to show i supported his post. then i realised i was in the wrong sub-forum for that. :)i'd love to reply to that, but, quite properly, discussion of forum moderation isn't permitted.i don't really know what i think of the csm. i know it exists, but it doesn't affect my gaming in any way. as things stand, were i to give it any real thought i'd likely conclude that it's primarily a free trip to iceland for a small group of people.that said, the onus is firmly on ccp. if they want the csm to be a pr exercise, then of course they're going to continue to ignore anything that's said. analogies are always iffy, but the best one i can think of for the current situation is when the monarch was the real power in england, and parliment was only called to nod their heads when the monarch wanted to raise taxes.while ccp aren't using the csm to the full potential can you really blame people for taking the free holiday? we all love free stuff."
7/9/2010,fixing rockets could be done for 50k. probably a lot less.
7/9/2010,"well ok but you get the idea. many of the larger features cost millions in development, running the csm is a relatively minor expense."
7/9/2010,im not saying that the pr from csm is not worth it for ccp. it might be it might not  i mind my business they can mind theirs. but as far as cost any of the ideas above could be outsourced and cost less than this csm stuff. dont forget that ccp employees do take time to deal with csm so its not just the cost of plane tickets and hotels. they need to practice the sincere looks they give you when they do their best billy clinton imitation and say i feel your pain. it seems you guys are still going for that line. this is kind of sad. after 4 years of that same routine i would think you would have the devs resorting to saying things like it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. csm has a long way to go. but good luck to you.
7/9/2010,"sez who? seriously, what exactly has been accomplished, and what new inroads into ccp company/playerbase relations have been created? the job of csm is to bring playerbase concerns to ccp; once that's done, then what? it's up to ccp to decide what's best for their business plan, and not a bunch of players incapable of either a) cooperating in an adult manner or b) sticking to participation agreements they agreed to (ie, the nda issue). csm can't and won't change ccp development direction, and as i've read from the minutes the ""player representatives"" (ie, ankh) have their own agendas. so now what?"
7/9/2010,"a 28 page document sometimes requires some back and forth collaboration. it's necessary that the official record of the meeting be accurate because threads are lost in the mists of time. documents like meeting minutes, not so much. in any event, i received ccp edits a couple of hours ago. surprisingly few changes were made, so once i correlate csm feedback this weekend, i can send a ""csm approved for publication"" version (nlt sunday). i believe ccp's goal is to get the minutes out as early as possible next week...hopefully monday.someone mentioned collaborating via skype earlier in this thread. i had already suggested this to ccp but no traction on that front yet."
7/9/2010,"agendaa. introduction-- roll call-- break to allow remaining csm to stop laughing at the roll call-- remindersb. issues-- (sokratesz) discuss how awesome i am and how pve based players should be hunted down and killed ingame more easily-- (trebor) discussion on how funny it is to see yet another class of ship appear on peoples killmails-- (mynxee) implement mini-games like farmville in facebook...i mean eve-gate-- (mynxee) show drone damage in logs wiki, dealing with the resultant megs of txt files that no one will look at-- (mynxee) how to fix lag in game from fleet battles...nah j/k, maybe something lame like make cyno effect awe-inspiring againc. other businessthere we go, fixed it for you"
7/9/2010,"that might actually be the first funny thing you posted, props to you"
7/9/2010,"actually, that one's a great example of how closely integrated eve gate is with eve itself. we have facebook, and we have a farmville app, but the farmville app isn't actually in the facebook. in order to get the full farmville experience, you need both eve gate and planetary interaction. it's synergies like this that have made eve online the game it is today."
7/9/2010,why bother sokratesz they've already said there not going to do anything about anything. i feel sorry for you guys because itll turn out a direct reflection on the csm and turn more people off voting or participating.
7/9/2010,that was the intention so it's nice that it's recognised as such.the other postings though weren't made in jest but in all seriousness. glad to see that they also are being recognised as such

7/9/2010,"i agree that it's not needed to listen to those who didn't vote, when assembling a csm. in this case 3k votes represent such a large block that automatically choosing #11 would be unfair. someone with similar views as ankh should be selected, but maybe with a different modus operandi. so far ccp has not appointed a new member, so there's hope that they won't go for #11 automatically."
7/9/2010,"i was also thinking as the mechanice are in place for mass voting,if any major issue comes up would csm recomend a referendum ofc organised by csm."
7/9/2010,"meh, do whatever you want. at this point i have lost 100% faith in the csm. time and time again i get my hopes up only to have the dashed by some ******edness from a csm member or ccp that just reinforces everyones feelings that the csm is a joke.funny how the last csm waved around some victory flag in getting the csm as a supposed stakeholder only to see that it actually means jack ****.nothing against any specific csm members. i applaud the time and effort you guys and gals do put into it, but alas it is all in vein.not going to waste any more of my time in jita speaker corner or assembly hall."
7/9/2010,thank god for that.

7/9/2010,"actually, posting that you're going away and then waiting for someone to comment on it so that you can post ""gotcha! i didn't really go away!"" is trolling. mere negative remarks about you are not, in fact, trolling. also, you seem to have not gone away."

7/9/2010,"except, of course, if the csm had stood behind sok (who was only speaking the truth anyways) and simply said that they'd gotten a lot done but that throwing things in a fit of pique was beyond the pale, there would have been less csm infighting and tehy'd have stood together against the bad behavior of a member who was removed from the csm anyways. ah well."

7/10/2010,1
7/10/2010,"i've already added my support for this as well as the devs should play the game idea. if csm took only these two items to the table with ccp, there could be a big turnaround in the quality of eve because these two items would affect every other proposal made in this forum. imagine what the ripple effect would be like in the mmo community (and the entire gaming industry for that matter) to learn that ccp, in an effort to follow their motto of excellence and by listening to their playerbase, has decided to slow the developement of both incarna and dust514 temporarily in order to put forth an 'expansion' of nothing but fixes and polish to already existing content, mechanics, and ui, including or followed by the completion of some of the promised and/or half-finished features that have piled up over the years (like unpublished skill sets and the much maligned learning skills as an example). once this was done, the releases of both incarna and dust514 would be followed by planned stages of the same fixes and polish.ccp would immediately jump to the top of the class. players would try the game just to see what a truly polished mmo looked like (since such a beast is nonexistant in today's mmo world) and where the devs actually listen to the players as well as playing the game themselves so as to continually improve both it's performance and quality. not only would subscriptions rise but with the reputation of putting out a top-notch quality game that is constantly fixed and polished, ccp's future releases such as dust514 would undoubtably draw a larger response from both the media and the players looking for a new game. and if the need arose, i doubt that a company with a reputation for both inovation and excellence would find it very hard to acquire investment funds.these two ideas, and especially this one, simply makes both marketing and business sense. it may cost a bit on the front end by delaying the two aforementioned expansions (if dust can be considered an expansion) and investing the manpower to accomplish the fixes-&-polish expansion(s), but the rewards down the road would undoubtably offset that investment many times over."

7/10/2010,this is a fail idea. eve needs the learning skills...they add depth
7/10/2010,"reading a lot of the comments and assertions by those opposed to removing learning skills makes me feel like i'm witnessing the thoughts of people from another dimension where up is down, black is white, and wrong is right. seriously, can just one of you come up with logical argument supporting learning skill in eve that makes sense this side of reality, and is not a poorly masked attempt to keep a perceived personal advantage?how about the comment above mine... ""learning skills add depth"" really?? depth in what way? because a lot of the rest of us aren't seeing it."
7/10/2010,"does the question of when to put money into savings versus when to spend money on stuff add depth to life?does the question of when to keep going to school versus when to enter the job market add depth to life?if the answer to either or both of these questions is ""yes"" - learning skills add depth to eve."
7/10/2010,"not supported. as many have said new players are not forced to train them instead of 'fun skills'.i've been playing since that fateful may 2003, i didn't train all the learning skills all at once, i'm now proabably behind a lot if not all 2k3 vets in sp total, but do i care, no really, i trained them as i went along when i felt i could, and they benefit me now, but overall i had more fun in those first 3-6 months than most as i avoided the brainwashing of 'learning skills must be trained'"
7/10/2010,2003 =/= 2010
7/10/2010,"not really. also eve already has a dynamic economy and economic choices that a player has to make that actually involves... well money (isk). so, learning skills are not required to create this, it already exists without them.slightly. but this isn't even relevant to learning skills in eve, the direct comparison is training skills that actually do something. so, do i train a 2 day skill that gets me x, or do i put that 30 day investment to get y. don't know about you but of all my years at university and college i can only recall spending maybe 2 hours taking an optional workshop that was about learning to learn.no, even if both were true it doesn't lead to your conclusion. lets be frank here learning skills are no more than an arbitrary time sink. no amount of spin can change that."
7/10/2010,"i haven't heard one serious reason why learnings should not be removed. looks like they will, very soon. :)"
7/10/2010,"and i hope that happens asap, they are utteraly useless. i hurts me when a new player spends weeks of his time in a frig, wituot anything to do, doing learning skills. while i try to prevent such stupidity where i can, some silly people somewhere suffer."

7/10/2010,i think you can rule that out because warping a supercap costs only a very tiny fraction of its total cap.
7/10/2010,"supported, make my hybrid weapons worth the training time >_<"
7/10/2010,"reduce cap use of blasters and change dmg bonus on thorax, brutix, incursus, and hyperion to a rof bonus. t2 hulls such as enyo, deimos, and astarte would swap 1 of their 5% dmg bonuses(enyo only has 1) for the 5% rof, not both. little more dps and ideally a similar cap use to what we have now.another solution could be to increase cap use, cut rof in half and increase dmg mod to keep the same dps. this will give blasters a close range alpha niche, something that may end up being usefull.overall i think that the fitting reqs for blasters needs to be looked at as well. in comparison to acs they have much higher fitting reqs, fixed dmg, uber close range and they use cap. ontop of that fact minnie ships often have more grid allowing for much easier fits with better performance. could always just increase grid and cpu on some of the gallente lineup by a small amount to make the balancing process easier w/o having to re-balance all ships that potentially will fit the reduced fitting req blasters."
7/10/2010,supported.
7/10/2010,another way of fixing rails is giving rail boats a new bonus. how about they can lock outside that 249 km lock limit and make them true snipers. modern rail guns can shoot around 200km and there close to the small rail guns. so allow larges to shoot at 350km + with a average dps low alpha.mediums should be 150km+ with average dps for that weapon size.small rails can already get to 90kms on a cormie so i think there ok.blasters are harder but it all comes from there low range. a micro warp or afterburner bonus to blaster boats would help fix those problems by allowing them to get in range.anyway that's my .02 isk
7/10/2010,"no such thing as a modern rail gun that has placed a 200km shot. navy is still testing thier 16mj testbed with computer models including a 64mj gun netting the 200+ mile range they are looking for. a production level rail gun is not even close to being completed in the near future due to the restrictions the immense power needs create. naval rail guns will need to be powered by nuclear reactor(s), something not ideal on a smaller more vulnerable surface craft such as a ""destroyer(cruiser hull)"" or true cruiser."
7/10/2010,yes but they are railguns close to the size of smalls. so i think a large could hit 350km. thats 208 miles. and the ships can go faster than the speed of light\. i think there fusion power cores could handle a rail gun.
7/10/2010,"lets not even start comparing prototype rl rail guns to what we have in eve... for example, rl cruise missiles have ranges beyond 1500 miles, why don't the ones in eve go 5000 miles? reason? balance. 249km cap is there for a reason and is not going byby anytime soon."

7/10/2010,been reading the e-on dev interviews.kinda shocked at how few actually play.
7/10/2010,"what if the guy selling you a new car (ford) drove something different (toyota), or didn't even believe in cars anymore and rode a bike...this should be no different. if the developers dont even play or love the games they make then whats the point."
7/10/2010,"sure seems reasonable and sounds great.but let me give you the counter-arguments:1) are you saying this is important enough that you would have the devs play at work? so instead of spending 40 or 60 or whatever hours/week developing eve and fixing lag, they would spend fewer hours working on developing eve? or is the proposal just to extract unpaid effort from the devs? and if you can extract the extra hours from them, wouldn't those hours be better spent on, for example, fixing lag? regardless, considering the crunch ccp is now in (quality + dust + incarna + lag ) i suspect proposals that would divert resources have an uphill climb. while i certainly would appreciate the irony, do you really want a dev taking 40 hours of their life that could be spent developing eve in clicking on pi things and grinding missions to replace their ship? taking 20 minutes to fly someone by mindlessly clicking wt0 is a mindless time sink. once you get your pi network designed and laid out, then logging into each character and doing several dozen double clicks per planet per character is a mindless time sink. by design. i think the employees time clearly would be better spent developing software.2) also, ""playing eve"" may not be enough. would 20 hours of station trading and mining a week give a dev much insight into 1500 vs 1500 fleet battles? or vice versa for that matter? 3) there are already a number of t20/ccp gave nc super cap/... comments. is everyone going to believe everything is a completely level playing field? (i would but there are a number of tinfoil hats about) if as am employee i a, required to play eve, and the ship i spent 2x$35 on get destroyed by some lolsuicideganker, then is that a reimbursable business expense?4) remember that skill system? should ccp the developers who are working on moms and titans the skills and isk to fly one asap? solving #2 but exacerbating #3 above? or should they be required to play eve, yet it might be many many months before they can fly what is related to their development effort? n.b. the following is mostly humor with a touch of troll but a sprinkling of truth: a lot of the interaction in eve is about hurting other people. when a dev is under the time-crunch i hope they are under now, then how uplifting would it be to come home after 12+ hours at the office and get conned/ganked/suicided? maybe the pi clicking was designed by a developer who got his tengu ganked at a gatecamp and thought ""i'll show those a**hats: lets see how they like a few thousand clicks a day to fuel their pos"" i just think an eve developer would treat eve customers better if (s)he never met them. just saying."

7/10/2010,"1 - when i was in iceland for the csm there were devs playing counterstrike(or whatever fps game) as well as shooting each other with nerf guns and stuff. they have recreational time at work. how much time is required or encouraged is just a smaller detail and not a dealbreaker and something for their management to work out. 2 - not my call, eve is a sandbox for devs too. i'm not really one to micromanage.3- not strictly relevant in my opinion. 4- devs already have characters(at least, usually. they get to keep their player characters from before ccp). when we were given the updated ""new player experience"" presentation, for example in csm3, the people that worked on that all seemed to have a thorough knowledge of the tutorial both from experiencing it(presumably, with new characters) and through diagnostic tools used to monitor new players' behaviors while using the tutorial. so now at least eve's new player experience might not rank as most difficult ever, but maybe third or fourth most difficult ever.on the other hand the new sov system was created by somebody who clearly did not ever spend eight hours shooting a station. as a punishment for doing something like that to us, they should be forced to participate in capturing a region. my happiness rests on the misfortune of others"
7/10/2010,"i know - that's why you are so deliciously perfect for the csm, and why i and others are so happy to see you join it nothing makes the dysfunctional complete like a misogynist"
7/10/2010,i love you too
7/10/2010,"personnally, i've never played any mmo that was worth playing in which many of the devs did not play the game they were working on. take lotro as an example. one forum thread asked the devs who played to acknowledge the fact (without giving their character names although a few went so far as revealing the server/s they played on) and the response was phenomenal. along with the responses, many noted that through their gameplay, they had improved the game by experiencing the problem areas and bugs firsthand. it was also noted that even though they were encouraged to spend some time during the work day in-game, many also played from home after hours, often with spouses, friends, and even fellow devs. this just seems to be a natural part of developing a game. how in h can you keep an interest in and a deep understanding of the game you work on if you never play it and experience the game as a whole instead of just the small part you are assigned to in code? so yes, i do consider this just as important as time spent actually coding and fixing the bugs and lag issues."
7/10/2010,would be good
7/10/2010,way to go mazz.
7/10/2010,ok
7/10/2010,"well, i sort-of agree, while developers should not be forced to play the game, they definitely need to at-least try out the area of the game they are working on, and see what it is like. first-hand experience can be more valuable then spreadsheets sometimes.and it;s not called waisting time at work, it's called testing."
7/10/2010,devs do play the game as npc toons and even as some player corps they might even come pirate u but they fly with standard stuff on those toosn to get an idea of things
7/10/2010,supported; game devs that don't play their own games make terrible games.
7/10/2010,"i can get behind this 100%.devs can also join random alliance chats, either openly to initiate diologue, or invisibly to just listen in (tho this will give them a bunch of random points hardly important to their job) and, for those who do play, spy!."

7/10/2010,"i already elaborated on that, good sir."
7/10/2010,do you play this game?
7/10/2010,"if people are talking about spider tanking gangs (not spider tanking logistics), they are in general talking about spider tanking gangs, and not gangs with spider tanking logistics. just a fyi since you seem to be missing the point.slots are not the main problem for shield spider tanking gangs. tackling and stuff can be done by dedicated tacklers (broad/onyx especially), and not that many ships fit (offensive) ewar on spider bs anyway. what hurts a bit is the lack of sensor boosters and eccm, which can be partially compensated for by their low slot items. not as effective as the mid slot ones, but luckily your entire gang got bloated sig radius so that compensates for sebo, and low slot eccm gives more locked target which is handy. sure you rather got more mids, but that would be a reason why there would be more rr armor bs than rr shield bs, not why there are pretty much only rr armor bs.if you want a shield tanking bs gang you can in principle take about any ship with 5 mids, which exlcuding amarr all races can do easily. (mwd+lse+2x invuln+cap booster). but while rr armor is very easy to fit compared to other high slot modules, shield transporters take up half your cpu.now if you actually surprise us and read this for a moment instead of trolling that scimitars can fit transporters, we know they can. rr shield and rr armor do not need to be the same. but that also doesnt mean shield transporters need ridiculous fitting requirements compared to remote armor reppers."
7/10/2010,"how could i miss this gem earlier? i indeed represent awhole lot of people, as you easily confirm by looking at the proposals i have supported and by asking one of the many people that i have discussed items related to the csm with in the past 8 months.5 mids is insufficient. rrbs need a point, and/or sensorbooster, and/or eccm, and or web/scram. that puts us at 7-8 mids. i will just repeat here that the problem is not the fitting requirements of the modules, but the ships."
7/10/2010,"you are just not reading. they don't need webbers and scrams because : and they don't need eccm and sensor boosters because : yes, problem is the fitting."
7/10/2010,no just no this has been gone over 100 times in 100 differnt post. just say no.shields work differntly then armor end of story.
7/10/2010,why fit a module that sucks up 50% of your cpu in one go?
7/10/2010,"more constructive criticism please, or did you mean ""shield rr does not work in the difference or armor""?proving my point"
7/10/2010,"sokratez, please stop trolling. this isn't about logistics cruisers, which are well balanced. this is about the relative ease of fitting of rr on non-specialised ships."
7/10/2010,"then why not increase pg cost of rr armor with 200% or something, then it is relative equal to the cpu cost of shield transporters, and they are still different. or lets increase cap use of rr armor by factor 5, then they are different than shield transporters, and apparently that is what you want.there is a difference between different and clearly inferior. they are different, shield transporters do shield, armor do armor. shield transporters rep at beginning of cycle (also another reason why sebos are less important than on rr armor ships), rr armor is significantly more cap efficient, but cant be overloaded as long. all balanced so far. but being different does not mean one needs to be impossible to fit."
7/10/2010,"i am very much not trolling, but maybe, before one tries to 'fix' something that in one limited perception appears broken, one should find out from the people who designed the system whether it is performing as expected at all?"
7/10/2010,"well, i am sorry for having to use only my own limited perception, but that is the only perception i have available. and about finding out, should we wait for ccp dev that was coming up with stats for these modules to respond in this thread? that might take quite a while... in that case we should not move the ""trash it"" button either. maybe they put it there intentionally, and every day somebody trashes their carrier as intended by ccp. no problem there, working as intended. regardless of ccp's thought, or more likely it's absence, that went into putting trash it button next to activate ship, we want it moved. same thing here. what ccp though back in 2003 does not matter. what matters is there is a problem to be solved. if you don't like the solution, propose a better one, or give constructive criticism. if you don't like my ""limited perception""- please be my eye opener. i would expect better then ""i have no idea wtf you two are talking about"" from you."
7/10/2010,"translation.""people who designed the system"" = ccp. you expect ccp to tell us whether rr bs gangs are ""performing as expected""? and whatever this ""expectation"" is? this isn't the forum for ""ccp telling us stuff"". there's no forum for that. this forum is for the proposal of changes to the game. i've supported this proposal with a wealth of evidence. you've blathered about irrelevancies."
7/10/2010,"you can of course just petition it and ask them, but that would be way too easy."
7/10/2010,"shield tankers already have the drake to work with, now they complain about armour tanks being oped. you pretty much answered your own proposal in the first paragraph, shield tankers have access to insane resistances; why should they get equal remote repairs?"
7/10/2010,"first of all, i am not a shield tanker.second, the large shield extenders are crapthird, shieldtank takes away valuable mid-slotsright, so a typhoon pilot is not allowed to fit a shield transfer because drake is too good? that's a solid argument!"
7/10/2010,"shield tanks get,passive tanking abilitiesactive omni resistance boostersan active tanking implant setdecent remote repping skillsbut you don't use them apparently, but are still whining for a boost. you think maybe you have too much time on your hands?"
7/10/2010,armor tank gets:better buffer tankspassive omni resistance boostersa buffer tanking implant setdecent remote repping skillsremote repping righow is all this relevant that shield transporters take ridiculous amount of cpu?
7/10/2010,"because nothing deemed ""balanced"" at one time has ever been changed...stop falling back on the ""ccp made it this way"" cop out and start actually taking part in the discussion beyond bad trolling..."
7/10/2010,"way to post something totally irrelevant. i am not copping out in any way, i am simply saying that before you can start proposing solutions you should ask ccp how they think the system is functioning.1) shield transfers on logistics are totally fine2) i agree that shield bs gangs aren't exactly overwhelming - but is a simple reduction of module stats the solution or is there a larger, underlying problem (hint: yes, there are several)"
7/10/2010,"wtf is the csm for if not for raising issues and ideas?if ccp would think it is not working as they want it, then it wouldnt need to be raised since they would be aware of it. the entire idea of the csm is to raise problems and ideas to ccp. did you first ask ccp how shield gang bonuses are supposed to work before you made that topic? did you ask them how capacitor recharge when logging off is supposed to work? it is as simple as fixing one number (look, even easier than fixing rockets). yes there will be other problems that wont result in very high popularity of shield bs rr gangs, but then at least they can be done as effective as armor rr. of course it wont be as popular, there are just more armor tanking bs than shield tankers, amarr players whine when excluded, etc, but then it would be a viable option at least.but there are no underlying problems as you claim that would really make it a problem. no tackle? we got dedicated tackle for a reason, especially hics. no offensive ewar? i pretty much never see them on rr bs. no sebos/eccm? well you got higher sig radius already so sebos not that much needed, but that is a weakness. and with not everyone and their mother having falcon alt anymore low slot eccm modules will do fine, especially since the extra locked targets are nice for rr bs. of course i rather have the extra available mids a rr armor gang has. but at the same time a rr shield gang can fit their lows with damage mods and tracking enhancers, so just more effective damage.however right now you dont have that advantage of more low slots, since you got to fill them with co-procs to get enough cpu."
7/10/2010,"ok, the issue is that passive shield tanks do not benefit from the implants, or booster bonuses, but a passive ship with a shield transfer would be nearly unstoppable.making shield transfer as efficient as armor repair would make shield tank gangs tought to damage. way more than a coorsponding boost to remote armor repping would cause.lastly, would it really be a different race's defensive system if they were all equal? the balance is not in detailed system by system equalivalense, it is in the overall balance, ship class to ship class. a drake and a myrmidion are vastly different, but in a hundred head to head bsattles there would likely be parity in outcomes."
7/10/2010,"omg... flip flopping already? dude... please stop assuming that this community is filled with idiots, because unfortunately for you, it's not... i did not have much respect for your points prior to this post but now you've shown you're not even willing to stick with your original ""argument""... yuckyou are using a cop out. your solution to petition ccp on their opinion is not only a run around but also annoying to gms answering those pointless petitions you suggest... what are they gana do, call iceland from germany to ask a game developer's opinion on a single petition? wow bro... people have been asking for ccp's point of view on ""issues"" for a long time. guess what almost never happens? an actual response... honestly i hope i'm wrong and i hope that ccp will become more transparent with their opinions... but regardless if ccp deems something as ""working as intended"" it does not mean that it is balanced, hence the debates taking place on this board for over 7 years that have directly impacted the future of the game..."
7/10/2010,actually i have done this several times in the past and have (eventually) gotten a satisfying reply in every case. don't diss it because it sounds too easy.
7/10/2010,"well, you aren't getting a satisfying reply from me. on that note, why?"
7/10/2010,"i've been watching the threads and such for a long time on what to do with low sec and its always a dead lock between people wanting it to be safer and pirates wanting it to be more deadly. in the end its a stale mate, if the pirates get what they want no high sec people will come. if the high sec people get what they want pirates will be irate. then there is the case well we need to make low sec more rewarding. if that happens all the market people will cry like the did about level 4 loot which is just lol if you ask me. all the problems in eve and we have to cry about mission loot.""my crazy out of the box idea""lets make low sec a place that player corps and alliances are able to take a certain level of control sanctioned by concord.what do i mean ""sanctioned by concord"" well allow for player corps and alliance to pay a fee to setup shop in low sec where which you can chose 2 paths.(1) for pirates - allow pirate corps/alliances to pay off concord in those systems they occupy to remove all gate and station guns in their low sec systems for a monthly rent. now i know what your thinking no one will go in then. well that's why you are going to have to fight for prime locations, such as choke points, besides your a pirate you wanted to fight so go fight for some space to hunt in. on the plus side players flying into your space would ""not"" have any idea that you paid off concord to remove gate guns and such thus giving you a better chance at prey. in these system exploration and missions should also get a boost in drops and such to make taking a risk in such a system worth it and allow the pirates an alternate source of income/sec status repair if need be.(2) for anti pirates - allow player corps/alliances to pay concord for protection. this would work differently though. corps/alliances would be allowed to set a toll on the gate based on the mass and type of their ship which the player had a choice to pay. this toll would be paid to the occupying corp/alliance. if the player payed the toll they would be able to enter with blue standing to all in local for just that system and would be protected by concord vs the owners and other players. if they chose not to pay, all normal low sec rules apply and would be neutral. missions rewards would be much like high sec, exploration would only be slightly better and low sec ores would still be present to mine. these systems would bring in good money as it would attract miners.also as a way to control the traffic in your systems you have the right to control how the toll will work. you can chose either only to allow people that have standing with your corp/alliance to be able to pay the toll for protection and refusing neutrals the right to protection, or you can chose to only refuse people who have neg status with the corp/alliance.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------all in all i think this would really add some great conflict to low sec and kinda making it like the first step to null sec by being able to occupy a system but without the null sec rewards. i also think it would bring people together even more. although i do realize this is a massive massive change and i bet many will hate it, but still it was just a idea i had and i thought i would throw it out there.any and all feedback welcome."
7/10/2010,"it's an interesting question, if they could do this for low sec, why not 0.0 as well?in practice however i just don't think it's going to be workable, who wants to be looking at a modal window when you're travelling from one low sec system to another?i wonder what cat thinks of this idea?"
7/10/2010,"not supported at all.pirates already fight just fine with sentry guns (as they have chosen to live with them), so no big change there. however carebears are gonna be useless to suicide gank or kill in anything bigger than a destroyer. this will only mean less targets. yes, low sec might be more populated, but the number of kills you can actually get would go down by far."
7/10/2010,"i cannot support the idea in it's current shape, but this is definately interesting and ith osme work can be a very good proposal, just needs to be balanced and details worked out. try posting in idea first, and get it polished. i definitely like the idea that the corporation dominating the sayd system would get payed. i am not sure about buying-off concord, although we should definately have some benefits for a ""dominating"" corporation. i am not sure if concord should get involved, but for example introducing a delay before sentry guns start reacting, or something of that nature."
7/10/2010,"what made me think of it is partly due to living in the united states, every state has tolls just to use highways or bridges, and so on. this generates income for the state. so its a real world application, i then broke it down looking at the states as separate entities like corps is eve. that how got this idea, like i said nothing amazing but something to throw out there.yeah ill change it to idea rather than proposal."
7/10/2010,"this was an original idea, but i think there is nothing wrong with the learning skills as isonly the way people choose to front load them into their play style. use them sparingly and over time. balance the long term plan with the fun today.this is a video game. if it's not fun you're doing it wrong."
7/10/2010,/chestbumpsi think it's more likely that some people in iceland got free isk (the icelandic version).
7/10/2010,"wrong. let me refresh your memory.so yeah, perhaps you should read the news or spend 30 seconds on eve-search.com like i did in order to find the information the op wanted. you can also spend an additional 30 seconds in order to open the calculator and find out how much $$$ 2400 plexs equate to.this whole thing is months old, you have got to be kidding me you are worried about this now. have you heard the recent news? we landed a man on the moon!"
7/10/2010,"your opinion is dead wrong then. there's literally no other way to handle it if it is in fact a breach of nda. i hate repeating myself but ccp has made an announcement that eva jobse has breached her nda and removed her from the csm. this means that eva jobse has a very real possibility of being terminated from her current position (apparently at another game development company) where she is undoubtedly also bound by an nda. this will almost certainly terminate her career in her current industry, as well as any other industry which routinely requires a nda.just in case the obvious implication doesn't hit you with a 10 ton hammer across the side of the head: ccp either has some pretty solid proof of a real and serious nda breach or they're about to be in a civil suit worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and much more in damages. seeing as how their lawyers (who were almost certain to be involved) would **** themselves over the second option, it's almost got to be the first.so what got her in trouble? logically, we can assume that she knows at least as much as the other csm delegates - and potentially more (via a side conversation, etc). we can exclude information and attitudes that were posted in blogs other than hers.. and thus can exclude her blog. we can exclude ""spoongate"" because there are much more direct, and legally safe, ways of handling that. really, we can exclude pretty much all the tinfoil hat bull**** people are coming up with because of the seriousness of the manner in which this was done. ccp and eva jobse are both handling this like it is a real and serious legal issue (and it is!), and they both are doing what i'd think any competent legal counsel would advise - sit tight and stfu.a bit better, actually. it's a sign that they're taking this position seriously and giving them enough power and information to warrant an nda and significant legal risks.-liang"
7/10/2010,"this whole thing is only a touchy issue because its ankh. if it was anyone else it would be ""oh wow what a tard"" and blow over. this despite the fact that based on her general behavior, she was also the csm member most likely to ignore an nda.drama and ankh, hmm, what a surprise..."
7/10/2010,^ thiswithout some information from ccp this appears to be what happened.
7/10/2010,"i'm pretty sure that the minutes won't agree with you. and without information from ccp, i'd argue that it appears there's a serious legal problem - such as perhaps a breach of nda. stop with the tinfoil hattery... at this point it looks stupid.-liang"
7/10/2010,a simple observation.until ccp clarifies to players satisfaction it *appears* political.just the reality of the situation.
7/10/2010,"i've outlined an enormous number of reasons that make the ""political"" tinfoil hattery answer about as reasonable as walking stark naked to work tomorrow morning through downtown chicago. when you have $0, no means of communication, and are currently in antarctica a thousand miles from the nearest human.please stop with the tinfoil hattery. ccp has just committed themselves to an enormous legal liability and both they and eva are handling this exactly as though it's a real honest to god nda breach. -liang"
7/10/2010,nvm - link is screwed
7/10/2010,yes..... you are correct.... i agree...however none of that changes the fact that eve players are expecting more information.
7/10/2010,"that is true, and that is what we are pushing for at this very moment. although, as liang has elaborated on at length, ccp is not obligated to inform us in any way, and if it was a different council member, the sentiment echoed on these forums by a fanatic few would be wholly absent, or even worse, inversed."
7/10/2010,"i hate to be disappointing you here but ankh took up the least speaking time *by far*, in fact she didn't say anything at all during about half the meetings."
7/10/2010,i know was she meta gaming in the real world?like a company spy trying to steal some valuble trade secert from ccp? lmao i just had to put it out there becouse i thought it was funny :)
7/10/2010,"as we will never hear the outcome of it what has happened, du too sentisive of the information.as a voter who had 3 times voted on her you feel a certain point of disappointed.and now my feeling is in what sense can we trust that members we choose for csm have the right intension? as read further i read that the meeting only takes place in hq. in other words they trust no one anymore.although a see ten times we had nothing too do with it, what must we believe as voters over it. does csm still act as pact for eve-voters and for what they stand for?also i see non disclore agreement, i think most of members even do not even know what it is. only people who work in the security branches. so where does stand for what involves it?ak"
7/10/2010,"i quite liked her blog.this is a quote from ankh from the massively website - eva had the following to say: ""all i can say at the moment is that out of respect for the csm, the players of eve, as well as the good people at ccp, i cannot give any details besides my personal conviction that ccp's statement is not in relation to any of my recent publications, and that i do not share ccp's conclusion that there has in fact been an nda breach. i am currently engaged in following up this situation with ccp.""source is here"
7/10/2010,"if there wasn't, then why is she still dead-silent? haven't seen her in forums or anywhere since 3 days and counting...she got way too much to loose and her behaviour hints at something really really serious. ccp wouldn't risk getting sued into oblivion with false accusations, given her life is basically depending on if that was true or not.the best guess in her favour is, that she told someone something, that was under the nda, but she didn't think it was. beyond that, it can only become worse."
7/10/2010,"completely agree with this.you have to remember that this has a massive impact on eva's real life. if she has in fact deliberately broke the terms and conditions of a nda then this could have a massive impact on her professional life.ccp knows this as well. i don't believe they would for one minute accuse somebody who real life work revolves around game design of something as serious of breaching a nda because she said a few things that they didn't like. this would leave ccp open to being sued for liable. i suspect like madner, that eva has unwittingly and accidentally revealed some information that was covered by a nda hence forcing ccp to remove her from the csm.also i suspect that due to eva's silence that she has become aware of this breach.lets be honest here, if you were in eva's position, where your professional livelihood was under threat because somebody made a serious accusation about you and you knew 100% you were innocent, you would be screaming for all to hear protesting your innocent.as for ccp releasing more information, well you can forget it. it was a breach of nda. you expect ccp to state how eva broke the nda, in the process of doing this, ccp themselves breaching the nda.i only hope for eva that it was just a simple mistake and will not be taken any further."
7/10/2010,"well, actually yes, that's completely your problem and it always is when you are a public speaker / delegate. that's part of what is called ""politics""."
7/10/2010,maybe that's also the reason that internet politics != rl politics.
7/10/2010,"supposedly its nothing to do with the csm, you don't need the csm to tell you that little is being done about much except incarna and dust514... pm is a huge disappointment... like fw was previously...ank is disputing that she has in fact breached the nda.eva is a game developer by profession, maybe the issues lies there.all in all no one knows squat so sokratesz should put a sock in it...deck"
7/10/2010,"i have come to believe this as well. simply put, given her personality, if ccp had removed her without justification, she'd be shouting from the rooftops about now. or blustering about filing a lawsuit.however, the topic under discussion isn't directly whether or not she did something wrong, or even exactly what she did. the topic under discussion is whether ccp should provide more details (particularly to the csm) such as, for example, officially saying ""no, it wasn't her blog."" right now, the impression that ccp is conveying is:nda breach = seriouscsm = joke.as in, they are ignoring the csm children to deal with a serious matter. just remember that the next time you see some of the rhertoric of ""i will hold ccp accountable for <insert issue here>""."
7/10/2010,a what? oo
7/10/2010,"i wish the line was so easy to cut. sadly for you, it isn't."
7/10/2010,"as far as i've seen internet politics is a good deal more complicated, stupid, and filled with assumptions than rl politics.point aside, if she broke her nda then there's no frakkin reason for ccp to tell us all exactly what she saw that broke her nda, as that's the whole point of a goddamn non-disclosure agreement. to make sure the general population (aka eve's players) don't know whats happening in iceland."
7/10/2010,"yes, yes it is."
7/10/2010,"i am against this proposal because there is no forethought that goes into protecting yourself against ecm. all you've gotta do is stick the proverbial condom in your wallet and forget about it until the ""the right time comes.""if you see a blackbird on the field? pop the pill. if you don't? you pay no cost to protect yourself. you don't suffer the potential drawbacks of the pill, you don't consume the expensive item......every other ecm requires some forethought to protect yourself from it, and suffers correspondingly if you use it needlessly (whether this is as simple as losing a midslot for eccm, or a damage mod to fit a sensor booster).""i lose this semi-expensive pill if i get blown up""? isn't forethought or compromise. petition not supported."
7/10/2010,"i support this tri-vetra... i've always been a fan, they need fof ammo/crystals for turrets or some other way to combat ecm, i thought maybe some kind of manual targeting system, i had thought of a way that was camera based, but since eve doesnt have have bullet trajectory physics it's impossible..."
7/10/2010,that is insane and this guy ought to have his loki replaced if records support it. it takes some people a lot of time to get those t3 ships. i don't mind if i lose a tengu for legit reasons but that is just stupid.
7/10/2010,"you're playing eve wrong. it's a primarily pvp game, whether that be piracy, fighting over nullsec turf or lowsec mission hubs, or marketing.quit doing anything that has to do with ""gridning"" and ""isk/hour"" (i.e., missioning).unlike wow, eve isn't linear so you never have to ""start over"" when you lose your ship."
7/10/2010,"well you may not ""have"" to do it but wait until you start seeing the cost of t2 materials going through the roof as pos fuel hoards dry up...give it a few months and see if the price of t2 hasn't gone up at least 30%."
7/10/2010,"there's almost no risk, thus, there should be very little reward.games like wow reward hard work; games like eve (should) reward cleverness and risk-taking."
7/10/2010,"i've already posted this in the ""features and ideas discussion"". so now i submit him to you.the problem:currently ships in corp hangers have no accounting or auditing. station warehouses *might* have audit log capabilities, however as the poster does not have corp roles this can not be confirmed. it is also unknown to the poster whether audit logs are accessible via eveapi. providing corp / alliance ships on loan represents a substantial risk and cost, with little accountability for the corporations to react to thefts or losses.the goal:to encourage expansion of corp/alliance loaner fleets, for the purpose of assisting members with corp/alliance recommended fleet constitutions.the value:corps can 'invest' ships in to their combat and revenue fleets, to assist newer members with developing their revenue streams, and to provide additional reship 'depth' for expensive combat campaign endurance for experienced pilots.the mechanisms:* introduce ship 'ownership'; can be delegated to any entity such as a corp or character. (npc's included?)* insurance is paid by and to the owner (standings related fractional coverage?)* pilots may not leave the ship in space; in lend ship eject option is removed, also pilot cannot switch ship in space* corp fitting roles would be expanded to include ship assets in addition to anchored assets. in lend ship the fitting cannot be modifyed without correct right.* creation of a dedicated corp hanger (requires office?) separate from 'cargo' warehouses.* module fitting sources out of the owner hanger, not pilot hanger. ships not currently boarded are immediately returned to the corp hanger, if the station does not have a corp office/hanger then the ship is impounded in deliveries.* all transactions involving ship hanger actions are api accessible with proper corp roles in addition to in-game journals.* ship cargoholds are controlled by the owner, and may be restricted from pilot access. (wreck jet cans retain ship owner access restrictions for n% of jet can life time, remaining life time the locking computer 'fails' granting all access.)* if a pilot has a lend ship and quit the owner ship corp, ship is automatically removed in corp hanger / deliveries.corp hanger 'managers' will be able to provision and repair ships that they have hanger access for. this is separate from any corp 'procurement' roles. access rights to corp members should be configured by designated corp 'security' officers. (groups for efficient acl's would be nice).the process:* a corp procurement officer ships and fittings, and transfers them to the corp hanger manager (procurement corp hanger division?).* the corp hanger manager arranges and locks fittings, and manages fittings.* insurance is handled by the corp procurement officer or corp accountant.* corp security officer configures access permissions per ship, using available acl templates.* corp member with borrowing privileges boards ship from corp hanger.* corp member operates ship, and does not have ship management rights included in borrowing rights.* corp member returns to station to leave the borrowed ship, which is immediately returned to the corp hanger.* all activities generate an auditable log entry.fly free, panto."

7/10/2010,"errrr, no?"
7/10/2010,"hacs and recon ships receive a small but convenient benefit in that they have a 3.75 au/s warp speed. many ships that fly with them, notably logistics cruisers and sometimes t3s, lack this benefit.as a result, the hac gang is not able to benefit from this increased warp speed, as their gang warp is restricted by the slower ships in their squad.i suggest increasing the warp speed on logistics and t3 cruisers to match the 3.75 au/s warp speed of hacs and recon ships.it's a small quality of life change, but i don't see any serious balance concerns, and it'd make the t2/t3 cruiser gangs a lot easier to coordinate when jumping to locations."
7/10/2010,"logis: yes, no reason they shouldn't have this.t3s: maybe, but perhaps a subsystem that increases warp speed.general idea supported."
7/10/2010,"supporting own topic.edit: and a whole subsystem just for warp speed? are you joking? who would ever use that crap? seriously. it's a t3. it should be at least on par, even if only in something as trivial as warp speed."
7/10/2010,"doesn't the tengu already have such a subsystem?ah, jep ""tengu propulsion ""gravitational capacitor"" 15% warp speed, 15% reduction in warp cap use/level -- 1 low ""the other races t3 ships are provided with different types of speed boni through their propulsion subsystems. i don't see why this should be changed.logistics, well... maybe. lower warpspeed might be an intended drawback for having remotereps in your fleet.regards, lax"
7/10/2010,"xd that made me laugh so hard because there is a subsystem that exactly does that and exactly, no one uses itand i do very much agree that they should also get their base warp speed to 3.75"
7/10/2010,"just a quick note that this proposal was just passed by the csm on a 9-0 vote, with only minor changes to the preamble."
7/10/2010,"sure, sounds reasonable."
7/10/2010,"i don't know what game you've been playing, but if you use a little brainpower you can easily run missions in short-ranged weapon setups. albeit, it takes a bit longer and you have to think a lot more about what you're doing, but it's far from impossible if you have the skills.and no, mwd's in missions are baaaad. as you said, they do basically let people kite and ignore a lot of damage. (hell, i have an armor tanked mach that can kite bs's with one t2 ab.) and the fact is, many people have adapted just fine with afterburners, as in most cases the fact is an mwd simply ruins your cap, and cap stability is essential to missioners.edit: however, since this does seem like a silly restriction, supported."
7/10/2010,"nope, original reason was that back then you could fit multiple mwds and people would literally fly the 5000km between rooms and they would finish missions super fast.since then they've made the distance larger and change it to clearing rooms; not to mention you cant fit multiple mwds.tbh it doesnt matter. missions are easy enough as it is.null needs to be boosted to be like scorch. long range,"
7/10/2010,"as a software developer i would like to see the following additions to the igb:onjump functionthe most common useage of this would be to reload the page when the user jumps systems (gate, jb or cyno).this would be a very useful function in the creation of intel pages for 0.0 alliences.example: on jump the page reloads and asks the pilot if the system is clear or not.drag and dropallowing drag and drop would help website creators a huge amount and many ways.it would be useful for item calculations like refining/reprocessing calculators, it would also be useful to drag and drop characters for use, again, in intel systems.example: the pilot drags and drops his loot inventory into a page and the page then works out the mineral value of all the items.auth key headerthis would be used to authenticate a pilot.at the moment the igb headers are much to easy to fake.example: everytime the user load a page (or if thats a bit much, everytime they load the browser) the header is assigned a random value that when queried in the api would provide confirmation the pilot is who he says he is.enhansed trust stuffin addition to the standard trust items, there could also be enhanced trust item which a pilot can allow a website to see if they fully trust the creator/hoster and would prompt the user every time they are requested unlike standard trust which last forever.these could be things like:provideing the current ship fitting string, which would be useful for fcs to find out what they really have in the fleet.provideing the pilots limited api key, which would save the pilot alot of copy and paisting.well that is all i can think of right now.let me know your opinions.(and yes i know a couple of these are on evelopedia... but still, i like to remind ppl what's needed)"

7/10/2010,"changed it back, i ment to type it like that, they have every right to report she broke the nda... it is a real and serious nda breach!in case you missed it, ccp didn't make them sign a contract for the hell of it, ccp is a real company, and the csm is told what is considered by ccp trade secrets, and information on how eve is ran. things most of us guess about. what all of a sudden because she signed an nda about a game, as a volunteer staff member, it isn't real or serious? stop being so dense, ccp isn't a game, they make games, and she went and disclosed information she shouldn't have. her actions should have real world consequences, as they have real world consequences for ccp.. as they should, it is a real nda breach, it was said quite a few times, even by ankh herself that it wasn't related to her recent publications on her blog. it also has nothing to do with her being a carebear, being controversial, or not being a member of a power block alliance, why in the wolrd would you think that? because a bunch of dumb form trolls said so, stop already with the baseless and stupid reasons for her being kicked."
7/10/2010,same.
7/10/2010,"ah yes, i see what you meant. i didn't read it that way. i think we actually agree 100%.-liang"
7/10/2010,"oh, well in that case, sorry for the rant.. lol"
7/10/2010,"keep it civil please.breach of nda can be a good reason to dismiss someone, but it certainly isn't in all cases. we could already have determined this if ccp had given a little extra information.that someone is a volunteer doesn't matter. that a company can be restricted in her doings i've explained in my second point, so i won't repeat it.she works in the netherlands, and with the job-protection workers have around here, i don't see her fired over this easily, unless this breach involved both ccp and her employer. her boss already already knows she has a controversial background, because she was #2 on the pirat party list at the national elections a month ago. the legal risk is thus low. (legal fees/damages seldom get above 100ke in the netherlands, btw).having countered all your arguments, and having motivated that there is an legal obligation on the side of ccp towards the players, i think ccp must release a decent motivation on why they dismissed her.if they cannot motivate it, then logically there is no valid reason, and they should let her back in and search for a way to deal with the obviously damaged mutual trust."
7/10/2010,"no, it's not. you breach the nda and get caught, you're out and maybe you get sued. you don't get to breach the nda and then just go on and be on the council for another 10 months. yes, it is. it shows that a volunteer made an agreement with ccp and broke it one way or another. 1. ""motivate"" does not mean what you think it means. 2. ccp gave us a decent reason why they canned her: she broke the nda. 3. the nda? it was broken by her. 4. by her, the nda was broken. 5. nda dun broke, ank be breakin' it, man."
7/10/2010,"what he said ^^^ what do you mean can be a good reason? it is a good reason, no questions asked. if you sign a contract agreeing not to disclose information, and you disclose said information, in any way shape or form, be it harmless or not, you broke the contract and are liable for it and all the consequences for doing so. by this i take it you mean that a company can be restricted from what rules they are allowed to enforce on someone?i'm sorry but as long as the contract between eva and ccp doesn't break any laws of the country she is in, then its legal and binding, ccp's lawyers would have known that, and had the case been that it was not a legal contract in the netherlands, then ccp would not have allowed her to take part in the csm to begin with.if i was her boss, and another, fairly major company such as ccp cited her for breaking an nda, her job would at very least be on the line, and she would most likely be fired. if you can't trust your employees with your company secrets, they don't need to be your employees, that's just common sense.despite my personal feelings regarding the matter, she made her bed, let her sleep in it.they did release a decent motivation on why they dismissed her, in case you missed it.. she broke the nda.now do they have to prove it to you, or these forums? no. if she takes it to court then they will have to prove that to a court of law, all of which will most likely be behind closed doors to protect ccp's interests. at most you would get an guilty or not guilty and the rest of the information would be locked away."

7/10/2010,"well, sokratesz, the answer is simple. like others on this thread, i care about fairness both in-game and out. a rush to judgment aptly demonstrate why we do not leave important ethical, legal and policy decisions up to crowds. i'm not sure you appreciate how much your continued trolling undercuts your own credibility. this is so whether ank is guilty or innocent. it also makes it difficult for other members of the csm to maintain credibility in the face of widespread skepticism about the csm process itself. this has already been called to your attention by the chair of the csm. please consider that before posting next time. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/10/2010,because delilah is ankhes alt. its not the first time she has used alts to defend herself.
7/10/2010,"if that's true she has been doing so very neatly, mad props. lol. get off your ****ing high horse. ccp ruled that she violated their trust enough so as to kick her off the csm, and considering that we haven't been told more and that she herself stays quiet about it, we can assume that it was done so rightfully. as liang nuren has already explained elsewhere, ccp also has no obligation to tell us anything about the circumstances, precisely because of the legal implications of an nda violation. that's ok with me, i don't need any credibility with people like you. i did, and i lol'd, and then posted anyway."
7/10/2010,"i see that people are still laboring under the delusion that ccp is accountable to the player base for it's actions in this case.the csm exists solely because ccp wants it to. csm members serve at the pleasure of ccp; the fact that they have to sign an nda at all supports this. the fact that players vote for individual members means nothing more than that the most popular (for whatever reason) players are the ones who are permitted to serve on the csm. your vote is a privilege of your having an eve account and is a stand-alone benefit that implies nothing, not even the assurance that next year you'll have anything to vote for. ccp's allowing you to vote does not place you on the board of directors, nor give you any right or say in how ccp conducts it's business, including how it administrates the csm, anymore than voting for the name of nasa's newest iss module gives you a say in what color they decide to paint it. even announcing that it was an nda violation is frankly more than the company was ethically required to announce.i also love how people trying to make themselves sound important are demanding that ccp disclose the nature of the nda violation while insisting that they 'don't need to give details' as if that makes any sense whatsoever. what a bunch of morons. there's only one 'kind' of nda violation: disclosing protected information. that's literally it, the only possible way to break an nda. anything more specific than that is a detail.but do not interrupt your tirades on my account. there've been more tears in this single thread than i've seen in almost an entire year of ninja'ing."
7/10/2010,it's awesome

7/10/2010,"you are, again, wholly mistaken. what they mean is the details of the nda breach, which, quite unironically, are under nda for now."
7/10/2010,"dude, she's not mistaken, she knows she's wrong and she's just trolling (yet again). it's hardly surprising. she's gone back into school marm mode and is trying to find something, anything to scold people with. what, mynxee said something? scold scold scold scold! what, some csm members said/did different things? scold scold scold! that all the scolding is for people who are critical of ank is just a coincidence. naturally. mynxee says that ccp asked the csm not to discuss specifics of the nda breach? okay... well, then surely sok can be scold scold scolded for something or other that has nothing to do with the nda breach because, well, mynxee said something and ccp and, well, scold scold scold! beware the school marm and her ruler of doom! just like the troll claimed that while you were probably lying, if ank really did throw a spoon at anybody else then, why, she'd support ank being removed from the csm! except not only did she not do that, she immediately began requesting that instead you be removed from the csm. dnftt."
7/10/2010,"so, csm obviously has more info. every indication points to pretty clear/obvious nda breach (which is to be expected given ccp's official post). i remain impressed with ccp's hardball approach, although admittedly we dont' know if some kind of hush-hush resolution was first attempted. crappy situation all around. shame on eva, pity for ccp, and lulz at the csm for not only having to suffer through impotence, but now gag orders and bilateral attacks as well.this game's pretty damn cool."
7/10/2010,"yes, yes indeed it is."
7/10/2010,this concerns me. despite the fact that she was completely unlikeable ankh seemed to be the only person who gave a toss about fixing fw.
7/10/2010,"perhaps if she'd been more likable she'd have actually gotten it done instead of offending the ccp director (per her own blog post). also, we don't have the minutes yet and there's more than one fw supporter in the csm.-liang"

7/10/2010,"dear delilah,you're beyond starting to annoy me with your idioicity and pompous naivete.you're now on my **** list.leil"
7/10/2010,my requirements are rather strict. the csm candidate must amuse me in some way. dance for me my puppets dance!!!which oddly enough the now-ex csm member who amused me greatly i did not vote for. so that just goes to show you...
7/10/2010,"the csm i would vote for would be one that has experience with a wide span of gameplay styles.i'm interesting in a living world where different players and playstyles can coexist in a balanced way, because thats what makes eve unique and interesting. my kind of candidate would work for the good of eve, and not for a specific gamestyle or player faction.i was pleasantly surprised that trebor daehdoow got elected. since he seems to be a candidate that is at least for now beyond personal agendas. i disagree with some of his visions and ideas, but i like the well-rounded approach he has.although most of the current csm seems to have left the limited agendas behind, and have started having a broader view, thats a very positive development."
7/10/2010,"i agree that trebor is a very good candidate, but i don't believe that there are any members with a 'personal agenda' at the moment."
7/10/2010,"that's actually amazingly fast. not so much because its 28 pages, but because you have to circulate it to so many people. nice job csm."
7/10/2010,just give it up. the csm is a massive waste of time - demonstrabley so (300 issues outstanding and confirmation ccp are allocating no time to deal with them) - all your doing is adding to a big list of items ccp wont bother implementing for at least two - three years (if ever) whilst provind ccp some pr cover to wave at traditional media occasionaly.whilst your zealousness is to be applauded - the white elephant has bolted (to mix metaphores) - loooooong time ago. no mater how much effort you put in - the door aint worth shutting.no one appreciates the work your doing - voters or ccp.
7/10/2010,"and this 28 page document gets the player base what exactly? it'll get exactly the same as the other 28 page documents created in the past - a few folks will get all warm and fuzzy, the gm's will sit around and collectively go ""well done, some good and valid points there"", and then it gets filed away in a rubbish bin for the cleaners to take care of in the morning.you may get lucky and hit on something that ccp was planning to release anyway, and bingo you get a credit against your names as having done something. but it's pretty much going to luck and not good work tbqh.so kudos to you all for the hard work that has gone into this (and all the other) docs, i'm sure someone, somewhere may care."
7/10/2010,itt: people thinking they know how to spend ccp's money better than ccp itself.
7/10/2010,"yes, yes they are. like i could spend it on ice-cream instead of eve.another failed expansion or 2 and we might all decide ice-cream is more valuable then eve online."
7/10/2010,what id like to see for the next csm is for those elected to csm6 take the free trip and upon return all promtly quit. all you'd have to say to the eve community we decided to take this action because eve players know nothing will be done nothing will be fixed or implemented by ccp. the eve community will aplaud you on this bold move. hey i might run on this platform for csm6 hahaha.
7/10/2010,can i have your stuff when you (finally) leave?
7/10/2010,"the people that want the csm disbanded are just trolls. first, ccp does not owe you anything. you pay for the game as it is, ccp does not owes you any change or fix.second, ccp decides to use the csm as a mean to have structured feedback from the playerbase. structuring feedback and prioritizing requests is the only thing that would give a somewhat accurate vision of the desires of the playerbase. then, you can decide to thank ccp for this, or stfu. this is, after all, their game. all the forum whine cannot be seen as a coherent playerbase will, while the csm goal is just to tell ccp what the playerbase wants in a coherent, structured, prioritized way. and i think they succeeded in this. and last, to resume, the csm is the only way players have to interact with ccp in a trustable way. look at it as the least bad. if you don't want the csm, keep on complaining on the forums between troll threads, speculations, noobish or carebear cries and so on."
7/10/2010,your perception of what these forums are for is clearly off. please take your sense and reason elsewhere sir.
7/10/2010,"what a bold statement, from someone who said ""cause does not matter, only consequence"".stop waving that useless csm badge and go harvest your plantation."
7/10/2010,"now selling sarcasm detectors, starting at 29,99!"
7/10/2010,"the nda hinders the operation of the csm. for all the claims of transparency this is a major issue. edited minutes only breed suspicion and distrust in the electorate.the csm cannot operate properly with an nda.ccp cannot operate properly without an nda.there is a huge conflict of interest here. it needs resolving sharpish. i've never voted in the elections, i cannot see the point. ccp would be better off selecting 15 players at random to be the csm.perhaps another level needs to be introduced here. 200 players in an assembly to help funnel ideas to the csm, the csm will then negotiate with ccp on those issues.anyway my point is i don't see my tax isk working here so time to shut down or refocus the project."
7/10/2010,if the csm want to do something constructive to really grab ccps and the players attention you should all resign preferably the same day. what do you think would happen if you did that?
7/10/2010,"well after you made this statement, it is pretty obvious you are only interested in protecting your free trip to iceland....maybe there is progress being made with some of the csm members in actually acknowledging that it is only a free trip to iceland and that they have no influence over ccp whatsoever.well they might provide some entertainment for ccp staff (akin to being a group of 'court jesters') in behaving like someone cares about what they say. however once the csm figures that out it will most likely be the end of it as ccp will have lost the entertainment value of the csm.and seriously, if you thought ccp actually listened to this group of clowns you are sadly mistaken. no respectable software production house in the world takes its player base seriously for any suggestions - that in itself would be game breaking."
7/10/2010,"well, if ccp would be a country and they would have cut a person with a majority of the vote out of the goverment for some reasons that they dont wanna explain, it would be also no more a democracy. more like a military dictatorship of the goverment with a puppet democracy goverment ;)i give rothrin right, in this case, ccp should think about a new election if they make a thing like that or give the people a real reaspn why they push out the second most wanted csm ;) so ppl can decide if the csm decision was a good one or a bad one and decide if new votes are neccesarily or not ;)anything else is just a bad joke ;)"

7/10/2010,"came to thread expecting mynx caught mining.left not entirely diapointed.(mynxee is the chairwoman btw, ahnk only got second place)"
7/10/2010,"lol, ""only speaking the truth"". is that like ""tellin it like i sees it""? or ""just sayin""?sok dealt with the issue like a kid (read:teen) would, csm ""standing behind"" that would make them all look immature."
7/10/2010,"actually no, if you're talking about spoongate, i told it exactly as it happened, totally objectively."
7/10/2010,"the question here might be why was it mentioned at all?oh sure it was the truth, that's what happened.but i'm sure a lot of other things happened as well (eg someone barfed, farted, sneezed, coughed, dropped a fork during dinner, made an inappropriate comment/joke, etc) so why tell about spoongate and not about some of the other things that had no impact on the results as well."
7/10/2010,some people can't handle the truth - but that's not my problem. this was one of the remarkable things she did while in iceland and only one of two that i found worth mentioning because i didn't want to hurt her reputation too much.
7/10/2010,you only wanted to hurt her reputation a little?
7/10/2010,"given her attitude and behaviour in the past i felt like it was appropriate to report on this matter which involved another long-time csm member (meissa). but you dont have to agree with it, that's ok with me, i appreciate your rage. but please tell me, why should incidents like this be swept under the rug? it's not like she had a lot of credit to begin with."
7/10/2010,"there is no rage, only curiosity.reasons to ignore such incidents could be to avoid giving the impression to be a group that cannot work together without petty drama (""ankh did that...""). one might even argue that this information is only suitable to create conflict but nothing more. it's not like this would have removed her from the csm or made ccp ignore her or void her vote.no, this would only have negative effects on how the csm is perceived by others, namely players.i find it rather amazing that such trivia are given attention.this is something that can be dealt with within the csm.so this has only increased the impression of the csm being a group of people that kill time together, unable to overcome normal differences/difficulties to work towards a goal.that's not saying throwing objects is okay.but throwing mud is not okay either."
7/10/2010,"think about that for a bit. seriously, see if what you said makes sense. if we should ignore facts that show that someone in a group cannot work with the other members without causing petty drama, are we really ""avoiding giving [a mistaken] impression"", or are we actually covering up the facts because of how we fear they'll be received? 1. one might argue that, but it'd be a silly argument. showing how a (ex)csm member behaved is part of transparency and keeping the players updated on how their elected representatives are working. if every attempt at transparency is met with claims that it's ""only going to create conflict"", obviously the answer then is to cover everything up for pr reasons so as to keep control of information of public perception. this is a rather bad thing to do. 2. your argument that only things which should be reported are those that would ""remove someone from csm or get ccp to ignore them or void their votes"" is an absurdity. part of accountability and transparency is keeping tabs on how elected reps are behaving and what's going on, and keeping that on the record. imagine if, instead of being removed for violating the nda, ank has stuck around through this entire term. what would the difference be if at the very end of the csm some people said ""oh yeah, and she was difficult to work with through the process!"" versus having a paper trail of documentation through the months showing what actually happened? by your argument, we shouldn't even be shown the minutes and raw text of a meeting. 3. anybody who judges an entire group by the behavior of one of their members is operating on a cognitive level so low as to discredit themselves immediately. such sloppy thinking is the basis of every bit of prejudice, bigotry and racism through history. it's just dumb. anybody who looks at a group of several people and sees one behaving badly, and then says ""that entire group is bad!"" is the kind of a person whose time can most profitably be spent counting grains of sand on a beach and leaving the grownups alone. again, this makes no sense. if we have, say, 100 people who form the galactic senate (or whatever). 99 of them routinely work together and get stuff done, and one throws temper tantrums whenever they don't have a vote go their way... and they also throw things at other people they don't like. does his mean that the entire galactic senate cannot function, or that they're actually doing pretty well and one rogue loon can't get with the program? this is not rocket science. google ""fallacy of composition"" and ""fallacy of division"". they're not called fallacies because they're awesome arguments. honestly, this ank-whiteknight meme has to die already. ""you can't criticize ank or show how she's behaving, or the entire csm is all for naught!"" is just silly. she's gone already, people can stop wk'ing for her."
7/10/2010,"so a grand total of 40k of players actually voted, of which probably half to two thirds are player 2nd and 3rd accounts (supposition i know but hard to prove either way but a fairly good estimate from my experience). so if you take the total number of active subs currently in eve as say around the 350k mark, that leaves you with a figure of under 10% actually participated as a high figure (assuming that a larger amount of single players without 2nd and 3rd accounts voted than those with 2nd/3rd accounts). of that then, just over 10% went to the top vote getter, so essentially you get to be chairman of the csm with under 0.1% support of the player base .guess it pays to be a cool kid to get into these things"

7/11/2010,"trolls, angry vets who are protecting learning skills sound like this to me so far:""oh god, please. don't let eve evolve. even if learning skills were a mistake and are just broken mechanics, don't let them remove it. please let me play a broken game. also i strongly disagree with the removal of learnings, since they will lower the steep learn curve a bit for the newbies. hell no, don't let newbies ever have a chance to start playing. i want the game all for myself"""
7/11/2010,"would make eve a better game, and provide a fair solution to everyone."
7/11/2010,"seems to my simple mind that the basic issue (getting more people into low-sec) can only be solved when the 'hard core' pirate crowd put asside the testosterone for a second and discuss how low sec can be made at least partially safer for those there who don't want to fight (while not being too safe).even the discussions that focus on increasing the rewards available in low-sec (as some isk based way of tempting people into it) doesn't work since all that means is the hard core pvp element living there get access to more isk to buy badder ships to **** those who would only go there occasionaly.from all i've seen though any attempted discussion about even slightly making low-sec safer for those wanting to avoid a fight is howled down by screams of ""stop crying and sfu"".personnaly i don't hate it as is (despite only seemingly going there to die) but either stop looking for ways to 'improve' low-sec or turn down the testosterone enough to have the conversation. can't have both."
7/11/2010,"this in no way endorses lowsec getting 'safer'. it should be dangerous, thats the whole point of it.however, it shouldnt be danger just from pirates, it should be danger for th epirates as well with anti pirate cartels running areas, even industrialists manning up and actually arranging security and building a lowsec industrial fortress. im sure anti pirates, and other more lawful people would either help or hire out to a strong industrial force.lowsec should be about everyone who wants to live there, i myself am a pirate and always have been. but i would love to see better anti piracy, a mining fleet that is defended by a real fleet who are actually expecting a fight.it isnt about piracy, its about total lowsec, put the rewards there for strong industrials, put the bounty hunter and smuggler careers to use.give lowsec the blast of life it so much deserves and lacks.it needs to be dangerous, because hisec is so safe. it should also reward those brave enough or big enough to face that danger.contrary to popular belief, there are already people like this, multi faceted allaicnes (and not pirates) who are strong enough to live there, but it needs more reward, more reason and more uniqueness as a place."
7/11/2010,"supported~ccp like any other game company is in it for the money. i don't see them not liking this idea with the only difficulty of coding it fairly into any already complex database. this is a good alternative to sticking around to watch paint dry, skill training, which is one of the largest turn offs of eve online to mainstream mmo players. naturally it be only one character per account as you could only train one character at a time and coding to divide bought time between alts would be extra man hours. also adding this feature then brings into question about other features like buying of sp in advance... god only knows how the veterans of this game would cry bloody tears and emoragequit if that happened, but i don't think it's out of the question either. the only reason they'd be *****ing is the loss of advantage and closing the gap to a more balanced playing field, which was one of the main ideas behind t3 ships in their reduced training time over tech 2 ships. the mmo world is heading to micro transactions with free game play and this could/would be one of the features to add to ccp's micro transaction store.anything that closes the gap between those that started at retail release and those that came later, i am in full support... as long as i can use plex to pay for the feature =p."

7/11/2010,"blasters need tracking or dps boost, not range, they are supposed to kill everything stupid enough to be in their optimal, currently they dont...blasters do pwn in eft wars tho... like the 1000dps brutix mentioned many times... defence against that is shooting at it, it has absolutley no tank and dies instantly... you just need to shoot it"
7/11/2010,supported.
7/11/2010,"i was mostly referring to hms. torps got a niche, if anything i would like a cm remap to make them more useful in pvp.why blasters should be in between? assuming you sitting on some very focused skill points and you have blaster ships fully maxed for the useful hulls. for me the question is: ""when i can use this sp exactly for the reason i invested it in this niche again."" instead of having it for a more random role where i can do with other stuff just fine atm. i don't see the problem in the niche, don't like it, don't skill it. however i see a problem about how blaster ships this days perform in her niche. well my pest still does 1.2km/s.as for general blaster ships yes you are right, you are also spot on in the point that the bigger problem is delivering the dps. mostly the medium sized blaster ships, rax, diemost, brutix, astarte. all of them lack a solid dps advantage outside of neutron shield gank fits.however as a former 1.6k dps mega pilot the number is far less impressive outside of eft this days for solo work and even for small gangs other ships are pretty close if you go for a similar gank fit.aiming for 2k would require 30%+ dps increase. i don't think this much is really needed if ccp looks into the other problems, but 10-15% are pretty much required to give a useful level of dps advantage. i do however completely agree here. that is why i did mentioned the stopping power at point blank with the web, what is the main reason they are not as good in her niche as they where pre qr days(yeah not stellar but useful)."
7/11/2010,"supported. hybrids just aren't worth the training time at the moment, far too narrow a niche."
7/11/2010,"supporting this is worth as much as supporting other hybrid threads imho. however a ferox is a good ship. you fit ions on it and you're going to pimp in scram range, that ship has sick shield tank and dps compareable to a 1600mm cane etc. while being tier 1.but yeah, matari ships get same dps numbers as i.e. galls while using projectiles, being more cap stable, faster and easier to fit.balance? my ass.imho gall would hit fotm if they could separate ships, get in, ****, get out, thorax's mwd bonus would be usefull then. right now it's separate, get in and do same dps as ships with bigger range so you're just embarasing yourself. a hybrid boost would help caldari, i enjoy my moa and ferox, but they need love.edit:yeah the boost range topic is complete bull****, add damage, tracking and it'll be the way hybrids should be.also remove **** bonuses like mwd bonus on thorax, tracking bonus on tristan and change to a falloff bonus cause you've changed ev'ry ****ing thing around these bonuses and they render completely useless right now. tracking on mega is fine, it fights in scram and large turrest have range, repair bonuses are working fine too. just boost damage on hybrids so you can make up for the time it takes to bring your slow gallente and caldari ass to the target."

7/11/2010,"the problem with the remote shield transfer gangs (excluding logistics) is not the module, it's the ships. most bs gangs use sniper ships which are mostly armor tanked (the only exception being the rokh which basically must be shield tanked). if anything at all, something should be made to make shield tanking more widespread in the bs bracket, because it sure is no problem in the bc/cruiser bracket (nano gangs and drake gangs are both shield tanked...)"

7/11/2010,"oh god im agreeing with -a- now what has the world come toyour numbers are interesting butyou say shield logistic ships are fine (and are of course using the modules in question)but shield rrbs gangs are not,if the module itself is truly the issue surely it would affect logistics ships and we would not see them?if you do not see a specific group of modules being used in a certain situation (ie rrshield bs) then perhaps either the modules are not meant for that (but they are) or the ships onto which they are meant to go arnt fit right?beyond the fact that shields regenerate naturally, etc etc etc, shield logis work, therefore perchance the problem is in the ships (shield bs) beinga little light in the mid slot department and cpu,"

7/11/2010,"i had an idea of accepting missios in space like epic arch missions are done. a skill simular to the remote sensing skill for planet management. it would alow a person to accept, decline, and delay missions while they are in space. so, a person can stay out for a lenght of time to do missions."
7/11/2010,"2nd response to tavin-part 1! well--if you get rid of skills relating to attributes (aka: learning skills) than there is no attachment to what is cloned to preserve your attributes when you get podded. therefore, no contradiction to the lore would exist. in deed, the eve-lore has quite well established the disorientation and other traumas related to emergency cloning that can and sometimes quite-drastically alter a clones personality and attributesbut not his skills as a capsuleer which through the technology he is more attached to and aware of than his own soul. indeed, some very powerful subplots in the empyean age book were rooted in this whole experience of cloning/rebirth. and in that lore, they don't just hop back into a ship 22 seconds after dying, they live as people, not as internet-spaceships. (presenting perfect opportunities to work on your charisma, or logic, or willpoweretc.) :-) basically, if i thought my idea broke eve-cannon completelyi wouldn't have proposed it in the first place. i could be wrong, but i personally believe my idea is more in sync with lore than the current learning skill mechanic is. also, podding wouldn't reset you to 0 in every category, as that would mean you're a human vegetablebut just whatever the base is for a new clones. ultimately, my idea is rooted in the physical nature of the mind, and its attachment to the bodya mind in sync with its body performs better. (translated to game play--attributes buffs). a mind out of sync with its body does not perform at its peakbecause the body is the power-plant for the mind! (translated to game play--attribute-nerfs.) being ripped from one body, and put into another would take some time adjusting toeven if you retained your memories and skill-sets from your previous life. and going further a person to long connected to a ship, can possibly loose himself in that shipand become not at all aware of his own physical existenceand could possibly lead to insanity. (leading to the possibility in game-play of random attribute take-aways from intentional log-offs in space. making a logoffski something of consequence.)that said, none of the consequences i propose prevent someone from attempting logoffskis or logging off in space, or risking a glorious podding. it's just something to weigh as you make choices in eve. and everything i'm proposing is rooted to actually having incarna in the framework, so i admit my idea really has no merit till then. but, i think it's very relevant to the lore, and the potential game-play opportunities."
7/11/2010,"2nd response to taven-part 2plus, it presents endless social possibilities. one example, you get podded, you wake up in station. you look at your skill in training and say, i need to improve my logic. you go to the plaza, and play some kind of logic game with some new player who has just started eve for the first time. he's working on his logic skills too, but for the first time. you actually pvp the kid using real logic, and you can have real dialog with him. if you think he has real potential based on his skill-based performance against you, and on your conversations, you invite him to join your corp, and he does. it all becomes an awesome platform for player interaction in which no one is trying to kill each other, because they are busy buffing their attributes before they go out in space again, but everyone still has there own agendas. and that scenario repeats itself with others all around as they are gaining charisma, or memory, or willpower, etc. of course, people with multiple accounts, and programmers who are thinking about the prospect of creating games for each attribute probably will hate this idea entirely. players with multiple accounts probably want to train up those attributes one time and keep them high for infinity. programmers probably want to focus more on eve than a series of mini-games to buff attributes. so, i actually expect a lot resistance to this idea. but still, i think it's pretty good-angle, the kind of angle, incarna needs to actually be worth doing in the first place because it's something that no one would be able to meta-game, or be able to accomplish from inside the pod. of course, for the sake of balance, there would need to be a cap on what you can achieve through those mini-games for each attribute, and people who are better at them, (say they beat their opponent, or opponent) should claim the attribute chain faster than those who perform poorly. once a person is maxed out on that chain, they should still be allowed to play those games for social interaction purposes, or practice, or recreation, maybe even for sporty-wagers, but they won't get a buff from continued exercise because they've reached their peak, and only implants can assist them further.all in all, it'd be like adding a whole new game to evewhich is so much better than learning skills, and even a little bit better, in my opinion, than focused training."
7/11/2010,"you mean like they have to do already with learning skills?or do you mean stat focused training -which is already a reality with stat respecing. i dont see how this would change anything.as for herschel's malcanis' law objection, vets are already training at the maximum possible rate because of the aforementioned respeccing and because we've already done our learning skills. we're not going to train any faster because of this idea (or if we do, trivially so). the law would only apply if this change made new players train non-learning skills significantly more slowly.you can also balance it toward new players with a simple diminishing returns feature: eg: it takes 5000 sp in an int primary skill to raise int by +1, but another 10000 sp to raise it by +2, then another 15000 to raise it by +3 etc etc. (doesn't have to be linear progression, could be algebraic, asymptotic, whatever seems to work best. details.).as for people who have already trained learning skills, we could start them at the point of the progression ladder that their current skills imply (so in the example above, if someone has learnings at 4+4, then they need 5000 + (8 x 5000) = 45,000 sp in a stat primary skill to raise that stat.)as for the new system cunfuzzling the eve-mon guys, well i dont think eve's design should be limited by the requirements of 3rd party apps. plus i'm pretty sure that they could cope with it. the maths needn't be that hard."
7/11/2010,"i like the way this discussion is nicely distanced from the never ending learning skills drama.however, i don't see big sense in the idea, if any. the reason is it gives us perfect tautology - in order to train some skils... you need to train said skills, and that is all.more detailed.first, i don't think bonusing of this kind should last forever. the more sp you get, the faster you train, without any efforts or choices to be made. this goes opposite to the diminishing returns principle.if that bonus has a cap, then essentially it is the same as applying additional attribute points, just stretched in time. if we have a skill set a, say int/mem based, and we need it, we will not train not needed skill set b, just because it is also int/mem based and will give us bonus.we will just train the same set a - because it gives exactly the same bonus plus the skills itself .there is no choices to be made.so the proposal in an essence has the same effect as giving attributes for free (like it is proposed for learning skills replacement), but apparently requires more sophisticated coding.on a different point of view, proposed system may have some merit. it would provide a reward (assuming bonus is capped) for a players who play longer than some fixed term, thus encouraging to become a long-term players.if the game needs encouraging of this kind, is an another discussion. personally i am not exactly sure."
7/11/2010,"just a quick post to let you all know i have not abandoned this topic! i appreciate all the support and criticism this topic idea has received, both have been extremely constructive. i expect to reply to the latest posts within the next 24 hours."
7/11/2010,no. this is a terrible idea.
7/11/2010,"this is a tough one to avoid, people will always min/max and powergame. this is probably one factor i had to ignore. reason being i'm not a programmer or educated/trained game designer so i have no idea how hard a feature like this would be to impliment. for all i know it's going to require months of work or possibly a few hours. definitely agree. one aim was to deter people from just powergaming and spending the first few months training these learning skills. it is very efficient but it limits your actions while other necessary skills are on hold. the advantage is the extreme amount of time that'll be saved.another option, as you suggest, is to mix and match between learning skills and practical skills. the idea tries to really enhance that. to give you that attribute bonus in what feels like a more active approach."
7/11/2010,"it's a good idea. i found while training learning skills made sense lore/context wise... actively training yourself like you suggest would be fun and more involving. some of those attributes would be a little academic, training intelligence might just be from reading, but something like memory/logic, well we've all seen things like nintendo's 'brain trainer'.have you proposed this idea in the main hall?this post really helps specify what i'm trying to convey and how the idea can be altered accordingly. the idea itself was pretty general as i was just trying to express an approach rather than state a specific solution.capped was something i mentioned initially. the reason i suggested that was to mirror the current system. you can only train your attributes so high with skills and implants. since this idea is meant to modify the current system slightly rather than completely change it.could you be more constructive please? others have rejected the idea and posted very credible and constructive reasons why. someone even posted the idea's prime weakness: just credit everyone the bonus attributes since that's basically what will happen to vets with my idea anyway and new players wouldn't even know it any other way."
7/11/2010,"i like this idea. the way i see it, you could have the stat bonuses at (bonus) squared times one million.thus, you'd only need 1m sp in a skill with intelligence primary to get +1 intelligence, and secondary attributes would increase at half that rate.however, for level 4, it would take 16m sp (or 32m secondary). for level 7, it would take 49m. at level 10, it would take 100m sp.overall, this seems to be an elequent way to represent focused skill training without having the learning skills present. the only issue is what to do with the sps currently spent in the learning skills that people have already trained, especially the newer players.my solution to this would be to give characters under 6 months old their full sp back in those skills. for characters 6 months to a year, they get 75% back. for characters beyond that, they get half back, as they've already earned a significant value for the sps spent.supported, and it seems to be the best answer for the learning skills problem which even ccp admits needs to be changed.update: corrected the multiplier on the calculations."
7/11/2010,"./rant on:i'm all for hulkageddon. i want that to be known straight off the bat! the problem comes when it turns into a: ""kill any ships remotely associated with mining""~ageddoni've been in the hulkageddon 3 channel the past few days, and have seen them attacking and destroying any ship mounting a mining laser/strip miner!!! ships from as small as a bantam, to as large as an orca; an orca!!!! where did orcas come into play in hulkageddon?!? i've asked them in that channel, that if i were to put mining lasers on a ferox, and went out to go mine, would they attack me. i was told: ""you're fried!""...wrong answer!...i just personally think this has gotten out of hand, and needs to be reined in significantly!./rant off"
7/11/2010,"you sir, did not realise this is the wrong forum section to post a rant."
7/11/2010,"i'm also all for hulkageddon.but the recycled destroyer alts need to be banned along with their mains. if you want to gank hulks (or any mining ship, for that matter) it should be done with a character that's more than just a lol investment.ccp has already said that recycled alts strictly for the purpose of suicide attacks is an exploit and subject to banning. it should be enforced."
7/11/2010,and your suggestion that should get csm's attention is exactly what???
7/11/2010,"first, did you lose a ferox/orca?second, how?"
7/11/2010,"yah, this would be the ""suggestion"" and ""purpose"" of this thread; the enforcement of the rules & regulations that ccp has set forth for hulkageddon! absolutely anything less, becomes griefing...which is against the terms & conditions of eve online"
7/11/2010,"i'm no fan of hulkageddon either, but where do you draw the line of when biomassing an alt is a bannable offense? i think it's not able to be enforcable in any real way.my personal feeling is that indys need less vulnerability so they cant be suicide ganked by cheap ships. if they gank your bantam they lose money: indies in general shouldn't be as fragile as they are."

7/11/2010,"out of personal curiosity of course i would support this, but then this is one of those things which i doubt ccp would ever be willing to negotiate on. so it doesn't really matter what any of us think, tbh./ben"
7/11/2010,"""ccp gave a reason. that reason was breach of the nda.""well, no. breach of nda was the instrument under which ccp removed the individual they accuse of doing something which was the reason for acting. and no, i know thats not the legal attitude but ccp have an ethical responsibility to their employees (who are also covered by nda's and have a right to know the way in which ccp wield them) and the paying player community also.the reason for the dismissal could be any of a million reasons and disclosing actual details is not necessary to give some openness to the process, and could include for example:- having deliberately/accidently disclosed future product information,- same for technical technicques (programming etc),- ccp financial information (undisclosed losses etc),- undisclosed information about ccp employees/directors,ccp could easily just say 'dissemination of information about as yet unanounced product development' and everyone would back off (or anyone reasonable would) untill a later time when the information is no longer secret.to say 'it can't be discussed' and leave it at that is absurd.nda's are usually such broadly worded documents that they can be used to cover just about anything if you want to twist them far enough, so saying whatever it is was covered by the nda means zero."
7/11/2010,"the exact contents of an nda are usually covered by it. liang nuren took the time and effort to explain all this quite nicely in one of the related threads, you should really look it up if you are interested."
7/11/2010,"so you have this ship whose main weapon is a cloud generator. the ""ammo"" for this weapon can come from wormspace or pi.basically there are different types of cloud.1. cloud which damages everything with in; recon 3/3 sort of deal.2. cloud which infuses the ship's shield with increased shield res; while decreasing armor res.3. electronic warfare immunity for all ships; but slows ship and blocks warping.4. effectively cloaks all ships within; but people can see you.5. ???6. profit"

7/11/2010,this is about the afterburner skill giving you a bonus that potentially harms you. it mainly affects dual propulsion pvp ships but does have some effect on ships using afterburner/cloak to hit warp (not as common as mwd/cloak)original thread at
7/11/2010,"even when untrained an ab uses hardly any capacitor unless oversized. you are exchanging a useless effect for an equally useless effect.how about something useful:- increasing acceleration, if formula permits which i am not sure it does (why isn't thrust factored into acceleration anyway? .. silly devs).- overheat resistance similar to t3. would create some nice synergy with t3 and certain subsystems as well (near perma-overheated ab \o/).first would make ships nimble little buggers compared to now, especially frigate vessels, with fast direction changes possible.second would allow for pretty high speeds (~50% mwd speed) with no sig bloom for usable periods."
7/11/2010,"i know it doesn't have a lot of effect but this just means it's easy to make this change. if you actually implement something different as the current bonus, it could make afterburners overpowered or at the very least lead to a testing/balancing cycle that i don't know ccp will want to spend time on.i do like your ideas, it's just more game-changing than simply changing an outdated bonus."
7/11/2010,"i like the afterburner skill effect, because their cap consumption is actually significant on the large models. however, as long as it decreases the cap consumption by the same amount per level, i have no problems with this proposal."
7/11/2010,"against the op, cap reduction is practically worthless, speed increase instead of longer cycle time would make me happy. the longer cycle time helps you when neuted, you'll still burn out of range untouchable by scams."
7/11/2010,"while we can increase speed, that is a blanace move that needs to be considered on different grounds. if you get neuted.. depends if it happens at the end or beginging fo the cycle."
7/11/2010,"short version:""thrust"", as it appears in the attributes of a speed module, directly influences the maximum speed of the ship while the speed module is active. it penalizes large ships that try to fit small speed modules, and rewards small ships that fit large speed modules....long version:thrust is taken into account in the following manner:afterburning/microwarping speed = base speed * ( 1 + max velocity bonus * thrust in meganewtons / ship mass in kilotons )for example, suppose a perfect capsuleer hops into a dramiel and throws on a 1mn microwarpdrive ii. the dramiel's stock speed is 473 m/s, which is increased to 591.25 m/s because of navigation 5. so, the ""base speed"" in the above equation is 591.25 m/s.""max velocity bonus"" for a 1mn microwarpdrive ii is 500% (which i will just call 5.0 here). acceleration control 5 brings this up to 625% (or 6.25). the thrust in the attributes is 1.5 mn; that never changes for frigate-size speed modules. the mass of a dramiel is 740,700 kg (which i'll call 0.7407 kilotons), but the speed module adds 0.5 kilotons to the ship's mass whenever active, so a microwarping dramiel actually has a mass of 1.2407 kilotons.what we have then is:microwarping speed = base speed * ( 1 + max velocity bonus * thrust in meganewtons / ship mass in kilotons )microwarping speed = 591.25 m/s * ( 1 + 6.25 * 1.5 / 1.2407 )microwarping speed = 5058.86 m/sif a tempest battleship tried the same thing with a tech 2 frigate microwarpdrive, also with a perfect capsuleer, then we would have:microwarping speed = base speed * ( 1 + max velocity bonus * thrust in meganewtons / ship mass in kilotons )microwarping speed = 150 m/s m/s * ( 1 + 6.25 * 1.5 / 103.8 )microwarping speed = 160.83 m/ssuch are the effects of thrust and mass with speed modules in eve online."
7/11/2010,"you are 100% missing the point of this proposal. this isn't about boosting abs, and personally i think their speed is fine.it's about the fact that the current skill for a longer cycle time can potentially cause you problems.specifically for me i'm sure it's gotten me killed several times when trying to turn off my ab to warp away after/during a fight when more enemies show up. the longer cycle means it doesn't shut off as fast, meaning that the worse agility that comes with an active prop mod sticks around longer.suggest cap use bonus sounds fine to me, and doesn't change the overall balance of abs (which is currently fine) at all."
7/11/2010,i'm making enough pos fuel to meet the requirements of five large towers. i spend about a half hour a day on it. an hour to two on the day of the week i am actually shipping materials between planets.i think you're doing it wrong.

7/11/2010,"while i wouldn't be opposed to making a scheme for better tracking of corp-owned ships, the idea of disabling functionality and forcing players to give the ship back is just not eve. if you want to enforce your property rights, go enforce them, and if you don't, then don't let other people get their hands on your ships."
7/11/2010,"the goal is not to enforce property, this point is only a means. the goal is to allow real team work by securing the result of this work.by this corps can really use tax and corp farming operations in advantage of their mates with less risk. by this a corp can lend a ship (mining barge or bs or rorqual or jumpfreigter or everything else) to a new mate she not necessary fully trust (cause he is new :p). the mate can make money faster and corps have new argument to recruit, better team spirit/team work, better dividends, biggest fleets,... not all people may use this for sure, cause eve is full of people thinking they play an individual game in facebook, but a part of players are searching for more team work. that what i think"
7/11/2010,"i acknowledge that people would find it very useful, but what you basically propose is to make people's ships be someone else's property, with restrictions to fit. like i said, that's not eve. possession is 9/10ths of the law, and the other tenth is lag. tracking schemes are fine by me, but i should be able to use the ship i'm flying to its fullest extent."

7/11/2010,"i just don't get why this is so hard for ccp claw to do. i understand the alliance tournaments are a lot of work, okay so you maybe take a few days off after the at ends to rest and stuff. but weeks or months after the tournament is over and you don't spend 5-10 minutes to hand out prizes? this makes you look incompetent ccp, maybe you should look into some better personnel. a professional tournament director would have the prizes out within the hour a team wins. even a really bad tournament director will have the prizes handed out in a couple of days.full support for this."

7/11/2010,"that's because it is a holiday. a paid one from the company who makes a game that you play.and if you really think we are going to believe that sitting around in a room 'chatting' about the game with a few ccp representatives can be considered 'a lot of <expletive> work' you are going way too far in your estimation of the intelligence in the player base. yes, the player base is generally stupid, but not that dumb.that is of course unless you are stupid enough to actually put work like 'effort' into such an activity that has no meaning other than for a 'meet and greet'."
7/11/2010,"well you see, that's the nub of it. you all go to iceland, get wined and dined, you sit around and yak about crap and go home. you accomplish nothing more than an inflated sense of self-importance - and call it f**king work *lol*.you obviously should look up the word ""work"" one day"
7/11/2010,"talking about video games is a whole lot of ****ing work, that's for sure. notice how desperately sokratez defends the csm process, despite it not really having a point and despite how those on the csm that actually care about changing the game for the better were bitterly disappointed by the process? that's because he's less about ""representing the playerbase and making eve better"" and more about getting an inside track on future changes to the game so he and his alliance can prosper. all the csm does is help the large powerblocs become more powerful."

7/11/2010,"well i do think public perception is one of the tasks and responsibilities of the csm.i don't know what's good about being so keen to discredit a member of the csm at the first opportunity.the ""i tell the full unadorned truth and what will be will be"" is really only stubborn and simple minded.and that's not me saying they should lie.actually that's not what i said.i never said only things that will give someone the boot should be reported.i merely said ""spoongate"" was only throwing mud. not that mud-throwing is all i want.this is called ""denying the antecedent"", i think.the point i was trying to make is: there's no need to blame someone at the first opportunity.if this is a constant behaviour there will be enough occasions to make it public, to back it up with evidence, to make it sound justified.i have no idea why you bring racism and bigotry into that.are you trying to imply that ""people who do b use a for that, so someone using a must be doing b""?because that is called ""affirming the consequent""and i never said the ""entire group is bad"". read carefully!i said this will increase the impression of the csm being a waste of time.you seriously think ""spoongate"" will not affect how people think about the csm as a whole?""larkonisgate"" is still one of the things mentioned in articles about the nda breach and he's not in csm any more. but they aren't 100 people.how would you like your argument if we change that number to 2, because that's just as wrong."
7/11/2010,and i'm repeating this because you appear to have missed it:i'm not trying to say ankh was right in throwing stuff around.i'm trying to say sokratesz wasn't right by using this for his personal agenda against another csm member.
7/11/2010,"yes, it is. your argument is that people shouldn't tell the truth and/or should cover it up if the truth reflect poorly on one csm member. yes, you did indeed say that; anything that's true but that you don't like (for whatever reason) but that isn't earth-shattering is just 'throwing mud' and shouldn't be reported. at least maybe until it's been repeated a few times. why that, then, is no longer 'throwing mud' is anybody's guess. so you didn't google the fallacies, eh?i've mentioned the fallacies of composition and division (although you refuse to google them), they don't suddenly become non-******ed in this context. ah, i see you've trained point evasion v. whether they're 2 people or 2000 people, judging other people by one person's actions is, yep, tarded again."
7/11/2010,"hey, that's fine.i have no intentions of continuing this if you just keep riding your ""i know what you think and do and whatever you write i still know you meant something else"""
7/11/2010,"actually, as i've quoted and directly responded to your arguments which you then try to alter, it's much more a case that you're trying to change what you've said after the fact. that's okay, i suppose, but it's better to just retract your errors and move on. ah well."
7/12/2010,would it be more visible if i added [proposal] in the thread title?
7/12/2010,"the absolutely best fights you can have are the ones where you survive with a fraction of structure. that's the ones where you have sweaty hands, heart racing, adrenaline all over.and exactly those are the fights that are made impossible by the presence of the npcs. even if the damage is only minuscle (and it isn't unless you are really moving a lot, which you won't be when webbed, etc.), it's what breaks the fight. no npcs, please.(though it's already now annoying how many people plex, both offensively and defensively, primarily with rokies alts... might want a minimum ship restriction for plexes, too :-))"

7/12/2010,"don't forget all the problems with dropdown menus-normally ""approach"" is at the top of a drop down menu for an object in space. when right clicking one of your drones (most commonly done with sentry drones), ""engage target"" is the last option. not a problem if you have nothing targeted, but if you have a corpmate targeted, you are now shooting that corpmate. the dropdown menus should be made consistent so that ""approach"" and ""warp to 0"" are always at the top-similarly, when right clicking stations and stargates, ""warp to 0"" is replaced by ""remove stargate/station from overview"" if you are currently aligning/in warp. meaning that if your autopilot begins a warp, you cancel it and try to warp to the stargate at 0, but click too fast, you end up removing stargates from your overview instead of warping. perhaps the warp/align options could remain, but be grayed out.-everyone complains about cancel order and modify order being too close, same with ""sell this item"" and ""trash it"", come on ccp you couldn't see that being a problem?"

7/12/2010,good ideas
7/12/2010,"counter proposal:1. new characters are created with all the skills in the learning subgroup trained to level iii, including the advanced skills.2. increase the 100% training bonus cut off to account for the sp added by these gifted skills to level iii.3. change the prerequisite for advanced learning skills to level iii of the primary skill instead of iv.4. existing characters are given sp pool equal to all the learning skills trained to level 3. (no matter if they have the skills trained or not)5. reimbursement of isk? do not care one way or the other about this.rationale:if the new character experience is the actual catalyst behind this proposal, it seems the op is excessive. why not a solution that eliminates the obsession with training the skills without unjustly rewarding or punishing existing players for the choices they have made thus far? new players would now have less obsession to station spin while skills are trained, yet they still have an option which has not diluted the depth of the game.existing players still benefit from the choices they have made thus far without penalty or undue reward.this is a solution i could support.i can not support the op. it devalues the benefit that players expected and relied upon when they made their original choices.this taken from my reponse in the other thread on this topic."
7/12/2010,"patri, this is an interesting compromise suggestion.i would like to see more discussion of this idea in this thread, as it may be useful as an alternative to present to ccp. it does have the advantage of being easier to implement (well, probably).can someone please run the numbers on how much training time this would save noobs? further, how can noobs be encouraged to not continue training the learning skills during the double-rate period?"
7/12/2010,"over my dead and stinking carcass. i started playing eve 4.5 years ago and unlike most newcomers to the game i had spent some time researching eve's ""proffessions"", skills and game mechanics. way back then i knew i would like eve, and so to get the most benefit out of my $20 a month subscription, i trained basic learning to v (the prerequisite for adv learning at the time) followed by adv learning 4. see these are rl reasons, they have nothing to do with eve and everything to do with value for money. the higher my stats, the quicker i train and improve my return rate. so i had to run around in a frig for a while longer than i would have, by the time i was ready for a cruiser/bc/bs i had the peripheral skills required to fly them properly, (be honest how many of you charged through the ships only to get them torn apart by a hisec belt spawn).now lets move on to the real issue. of those opposed to learning how many have been outstripped by younger players who were more diligent in their training. by the time i was 3 yrs i had the same sps of people playing since 04. now probably 03. i notice with interest that most want the 50 points in their stats (10 points per att) and the 10% but don't want the hassle of traing the skills.the only way this could be fairly introduced is if they worked out who got what sps from what learning skills and correlate against which version eve the char was born in as the character generation has changed radically since the days we got the average 30 points in atts. now i believe it is 43.counter proposal, remove the learning skills, the additional attribute points and the 10% bonus. give every char with learning skills the equivelent sps to allocate as they see fit, and give the oldest players as many attribute points as it takes to give them parity with newer chars.okay then i was being sarcastic, now bury this motion before i puke, or worse ask for the removal of missile skill and science skill trees."
7/12/2010,"no....learning skills are fine as is.why is everyone so bent on fixing something that isn't broken?but.....patri, you bring up the best counter proposal i've seen so far. well thought out."
7/12/2010,"new player experience is one of the primary problems with learning skills, but it isn't the sole reason to remove them. learning skills are in of themselves just bad game design. they do not add ""depth"" to the game, they don't make sense in terms of realism, and they aren't fun for anyone but the most deranged min/maxers. the only thing learning skills add is a meaningless time sink.no one is punished or rewarded by removing learning skills. no one's getting the benefits they gained in the past from learning skills taken away, nor is anyone being given the benefits of learning skills previously lost over the years/months by those who didn't train them. what's past is past and won't be changed.there's no compromise on the learning skills themselves, they're bad game play and need to removed entirely.something i think that can be compromised on is what learning skills are replaced with. rather than giving everyone the equivalent of maxed learning skills to their attributes, i think it would be reasonable to only give players a portion of that (say 4/4/5 for example) and make the difference with new attribute enhancing items such as enhanced implants or learning boosters as i suggested in another thread."
7/12/2010,"ladies and gents, i propose to ballance inability of the faction militia corps to create alliances, which makes response of virtual alliances (mdp, cdi) to wardecks quite complicated and also increase number of communication channels and organization structures.how it will work:1) corporation can create normal alliances while in the militia 2) alliances can join militias3) alliances cannot have sov once in militiawhat it will bring:1) simplification of the corporation and wardec mechanics in the militias2) militias will be diferent flag - not the ""hack style"" like it is now3) militias will not be overrun by null entities/powerblocks, because they will not sacrifice their precious sov.4) reduction of the comm channels5) militia corps/alliances can participate on alliance tournaments without stupid need to create some aritfitial alliances.6) more organized fights in fw and more fun in pvpccp please stop treating us as a unwanted child you have with postman. we are pretty pvp strong community and have serious impact on lowsec and economy as fw is the biggest shipgrinder in the eve universe.i would like to ask other militias leaders to drive this topic as a solid discussion and avoid usual ""warfare and tactics"" animosities.thnxhidden snakeblog link to this topic"

7/12/2010,"back in the days before yulai, there was widespread clamor for highways to connect the capitals of each empire. the argument was, it takes too long to get anywhere. there aren't enough players to justify the space. ""approaching stargate."" etc.so ccp added superhighways that connected all four empires with concord space. yulai supermarket hub was created. market prices across the empires were homogenized. the inter-regional / inter-empire trader was dead. concurrent players peaked around 7,000 at this point in time.fastforward. at some point (i do not know when, as i was on official leave of absence from the game), ccp removed the superhighways and yulai died. enter the age of jita, amarr, rens, and dodixie.fastforward to present. eve reaches 60k concurrent players. space is crowded. jita is today's yulai. prices are once again mostly homogenized (not completely).in my opinion, it is time to take the final step and remove the highsec highways that connect empires to empires. each empire should be bordered with only lowsec systems, so that in order to travel between empires, you have to travel through borderzones rife with piracy and warfare.[proposal related to additional currencies removed due to lack of support]the benefit? for one, it would allow the possibility of lucrative and specialized trade routes. tweak drop rates in different areas and you will have vast price differences, with people unable to connect them with autopilot in a freighter. think of the trade possibilities that would erupt by simply altering the spawn rate of certain asteroids in the four empires.two, it will spread the population out from the central network that connects the major hubs.finally, doing this would at last create the unique 'flavor' of each empire/race. it would also create far more opportunity for lowsec gameplay, and by that i don't just mean ganking and pirating although certainly there would be that as well.aub"

7/12/2010,"itt: everyone jumps on a bandwagon, but are unaware that bandwagon might not even exist.i'm talking, of course, about the core assumption that the op makes -- that no ccp devs play eve, and that's why there have been the issues that exist.short of providing evidence, you have no reason to be making such a demand, as for all you know, they rigorously play it.besides, have you ever heard of singularity? you know, where a ccp team hosts stress tests and actually implements features to let the playerbase itself test them before they come to tq? that doesn't strike me as something a company that never bothers testing their own product would do. ever watched any of the conferences, of fanfest videos, or any of that? where they exhibit new gameplay through playing the game?sorry, but to me, that implies that they don't just give it to the code monkeys, let said monkeys code it, and then bring it to public viewing/exhibition/testing without themselves giving it a shot.i actually recall the incarna (then ambulation) videos, where ccp whoever was ****ing around with wis, making jokes about elements of the game (that he wouldn't otherwise know of if he didn't play himself), and seeming to know what he was doing.edit: i despise csm members/wannabes who care more about their position in their little treehouse of ascended fandom than anything else. wow, so what, you get to fly to iceland to talk to game devs, tell them things that they can find by browsing the forums on their own, and have a net effect of absolutely nothing on the final product. makes me want to vote for you. any of you."
7/12/2010,"this is you, not knowing what is going on in the game.there has been ample evidence around over the past months that shows that devs, in fact, have no idea about whats currently going on in 0.0, from weapon cycling issues, to the effects of a target painter on a structure, to well, sov sucking so bad right now nobody wants to do it at all.seriously, 100 million hit points is dumb, nothing in game should require a group of supercaps and 3 hours of time to take down reliably (three times), and to assume that any portion of your player base would want to do that is beyond basic ignorance, it shows a serious disconnect with a group of players you just put out a massive expansion for 6 months ago.how about the station services that were added, and the things placed outside of towers, to promote ""small gang warfare""? small gangs of titans? have you ever shot some of those things? they were moved to give small gangs targets worth hitting in enemy space, and yet, they gave them 10s of millions of hit points. unfortunately, they are only hittable by small gangs of carriers, dreads, motherships, and possibly 40-50 torp ravens.0.0 is stale right now, simply due to 2 factors, lag the gm's can't recreate on the test server reliably (*thus having issues they aren't even aware are around), and a broken sov system that is somehow less fun than pos spam sov warfare.i'm sure that they play, or hold accounts and don't play, but they obviously aren't playing in the areas they had in mind with dominion, or they'd know how terrible it is, and how terrible just about every change they've made to 0.0 over the last 2 years was."

7/12/2010,supported. the only way to understand the sandbox is to jump in.
7/12/2010,"lag is the enemy of us all.in a fight there will be about 5 times as many drones as ships, the server has to track all of their positions, and damage and send their positions to every ship in the fight. this has to cause lag.what i propose is that drones should be stacked, and appear as a single drone firing as one but still being popped one at a time by targeted weapons and all taking damage from area weapons.so the experience of using drones remains the same - they are almost always used as flights and applied to a single target - the stacking can be done automatically. the damage and hitpoints remain the same - shouldn't cause any change in balance or tactics - much like stacking weapons.the only downside is that drone swarms will be less impressive on screen, and easier to target though that is a rarely used tactic.the gain is that by reducing the amount of work the server has to do and the amount of information being reported to every client, the lag is significantly reduced.al irksome"
7/12/2010,"this is something i have wondered about too, but i didn't get a chance to ask about it in iceland (and if i had, then it would have been a case of ""i could tell you, but then i'd have to shoot myself"").this particular suggestion is one of a larger class of potential lag-mitigation game-design changes that really need close consultation between ccp and player experts (not just people on the csm; as everyone knows, we're all clueless desperate attention w****s) in order to determine if the benefits are worth the costs. the larger issue of such consultations was raised during the summit, check out the minutes (due out rsn!) for the reply.btw, with clever programming, this stacking could be hidden from the player by the client, so that the stack would appear (in space and overview) to be individual drones. it is only when a drone is targeted that it needs to be split from the stack, and most of the time, that does not happen.this would mean that different players would see the drones in slightly different positions, but these discrepancies would be lost in the fog of war."
7/12/2010,seems like an interesting idea. perhaps it could work through the current folder-based grouping method for simplicity?
7/12/2010,this would be interesting to get a response from ccp about.
7/12/2010,"as long as it's optional like weapon grouping, it's ok."
7/12/2010,"agreed. there are times i don't want my drones stacking. aside from that, if it really will reduce lag in a statistically significant fashion, then i see no reason not to."
7/12/2010,"i wouldn't mind even if they were obligatorily linked, but i already see a problem here...while with missiles there is no problem because even if they do take damage they are not, ever repaired, you can (and in some situations you want) to repair your drones while in space... you can't just sum all the shields into a one ubershield, armor into uber armor and so on... it'd become basically a fighter! which could be remotely repped (in particular think about sentries... 5* sentries in a single uber sentry + remote repper from the ship... win?). on the other hand, if you do group 5 drones but keep the life separated (and just kill the drones 1 at a time), you are effectively reducing their survivability since all incoming fire will be focused on just one drone and also you can't recall them one at a time but have to do that all at once.some of the problems may be seen as downsides of the grouping, but, beside lag reduction, this is tarting to become more a nuisance than a feature..."
7/12/2010,"yes i have been thinking about fleet battles where either the intensity of the fight or more likely the drag of the lag rule out micro managing drones.there would be no advantage to stacking in smaller fights or in pve.so it should be optional or at least an option to break the stack.its also obvious that lag reduction is a massive technical problem. ccp have i'm sure been actively optimising code and installing faster servers. but some computer problems are not easily shared out between parallel processors. it is obvious to me that if there are n ships in a fight and each ship has to know the position etc of every other ship then that is n squared notifications that have to go out, and notifying drone positions goes up by 5n^2. so while ccp can reduce lag in a linear fashion, players by piling into battles in bigger and bigger numbers can increase lag in an exponential fashion.al irksome"
7/12/2010,"ive also thought about that especially making them shoot all at the same time and not just all drones from the same player no, all on the whole server should shoot at the same time that would only cause a negligible delay and would help a lot i thinki'm not that happy with stacking their positions at least not in a way visible for the player as that would make it harder to click on a particular drone"

7/12/2010,"disclaimer: i don't know the in-game history or forum history of anyone participating in this thread and i am explicitly refraining from praising or criticizing players.it seems that the key point from the detractors that's being missed in this discussion is the following: it's undesirable to make one thing overpowered as a side-effect of making something else properly balanced. those who are basing their arguments on this point are claiming the following: right now, shield logistics ships are properly balanced but shield-based spider-tanking battleship gangs are underpowered. if the shield transfer modules are buffed without any other changes, then shield logistics ships would become overpowered while shield-based spider-tanking battleship gangs would become properly balanced, which is a situation to be avoided. however, if ccps buff the shield-based battleships, themselves, rather than buff the shield transporter modules, then we will have a situation where both the shield logistics and the shield-based spider-tanking battleships are properly balanced, and this is a much more desirable situation than having either being underpowered or overpowered.the above is the argument i think the detractors of the original poster are trying to make. for the above to make sense, you must hold the following premises to be true:1) shield logistics ships are properly balanced, at present.2) if the shield logistics ships are buffed in any way, whether by buffs to the ships themselves or by buffs to the modules they use, then shield logistics ships will become overpowered.3) shield-based spider-tanking battleship gangs are underpowered, at present.4) buffing the shield transporter modules will buff both the shield logistics ships and the shield-based spider-tanking battleship gangs.5) buffing the shield-based battleships, themselves, will buff their spider-tanking gangs but will not buff the shield logistics ships.i don't know if such arguments are right or wrong. i don't know if those premises are true or false. maybe the best approach is to just buff the shield transfer modules, as the original poster suggests. maybe the best approach is to buff the shield-based battleships, as the detractors suggest. maybe the best approach is a combined tweaking of the modules, logistics ships, and battleships. i don't know enough of the issues, myself, to advocate one approach over another. i post only for the sake of clear and constructive discussion."
7/12/2010,"the proposed buff would not in any way affect shield logistics ships, try again.if for some reason you really would want to 'fix' the not in any way boosted logistics ships you could nerf their cpu with the same amount that would be freed by the lower cpu cost of shield transporters.right now on a scimi i can fit if i want 4 large shield transporters + xl shield booster if for some weird reason i want that. now what happens if you lower cpu cost of shield transporters? nothing obviously, it can still fit everything but now with some spare cpu. but since it didnt lack cpu in the first place it wouldnt be boosted in any way.buffing shield based battleships is a terrible idea. then we just get a bunch of overpowered battleships running around. the problem are shield transporters, not shield based battleships. (not to mention all the traditionally armor tanked bs would then be fail in shield based gangs)."
7/12/2010,"lrarpros: 10% more cap efficientcons: delivers reps at the end of the cyclelstpros: reps at the start of the cyclecons: has an insane cpu cost that makes fitting them impossible without gimped fittings with the exclusion of dedicated logistics ships, shield tanks also use mid slots which prevents usage of ewar/sebos/eccm...wut?decrease lst cpu, bump up cap use slightly."
7/12/2010,"you've stated logistics cruisers and slot layouts. the logistics cruisers argument is irrelevant because, amazingly, we're not talking about logistics cruisers, and i don't understand why you can't grasp this. the only relevance of the slot layout issue is that it makes a rr shield gang weaker than a rr armour gang. hey, actually this is an argument for making lsts much easier to fit lrars."
7/12/2010,"makes perfect sense, let's make it fair."
7/12/2010,"well no, it's an argument for the fact that the slot layout is the problem, not the fitting stats. if the mods cost 1 cpu and 1 grid you would still not see rrbs shield gangs because they do not have the slot layout for it."
7/12/2010,"are you seriously trying to tell us that a lst taking 22% of a ship's cpu, while a lrar can take less than 6% of pg or cpu, is a greater problem than the fewer medslots available for shield-tanking bs?the raven, rokh, scorpion, tempest, maelstrom, domi and hyperion could all pull off satisfactory rr shield tanks if lst cpu use was sensible. this is more than half the t1 bs in the game! the medslots argument is... nonsense, and i'm having difficulty taking you seriously. sure, the bs with 4 or fewer medslots do have medslot issues - armageddon, abaddon, apocalypse, megathron, typhoon. and in return, many bs can't get a decent armour tank with damage mods on. as ever with shield vs. armour, you trade dps for ehp.in any case, even if the medslot argument was convincing, it wouldn't be an argument for not balancing the fitting requirements of lrars and lsts. it would have no bearing, for example, on a proposal to balance the fitting requirements of lrars and lsts by increasing lrar pg use by 400%."
7/12/2010,"it might be satisfactorily but it would still not be good enough to compete with rr armour fittings which usually have 2-3 slots available next to the mandatory mwd and injector. as i said waay back in this threads, 7 or 8 mids are really what's needed to compete:+mwd+injector+lse+lse+invul+invul+ point, web, scram, eccm, sensorbooster, second injector..take your pick. in terms of lowslots, all that an rr shield bs really needs is a damage control and damage mods so 4 lowslots should really be enough.and i am being very serious actually. i do not believe that the fitting requirements are a major cause for the lack of rr shield gangs. thinking of it, one of the additional reasons in the past might have been the fact that it was easier to tank a dd with an armour fit, but that has been invalid for awhile now. as usual, it does take some time for the public perception to adjust though, but the potential of rr shield would still be held back by a lack of suitable ships."
7/12/2010,"thank you sorkatez, you have just proved my point. you listed six(!) modules there, and guess what? most shield tanking battleships do have 6-7 mid slots. in addition to that, on some minnie and caldary ships cap injector is not even necessary, because nothing consumes cap- neither the weapons nor the tank. as for utility slots, these ships have up to four low-slots free for damage mods, sensor amplifiers and some other modules that make them excellent fleet ship. if you are trying to tell my that you cannot create a decent shield-buffertancking battleship, you are horribly wrong, i personally know about ten people that fly those ships regularly, and they do so fairly well. i do not see any problem that would make shield-tancking ships inferior, apart from stupid cpu requirement on the remote-repp module. if you do, make a proposal to boost the low-slot utility modules such as sensor backup array slightly, if you really feel sorry for these guys. either way, i still don't see how is inferiority of shield tanking battleships, which is what you are showing here i believe, a reason to making them suffer yet more by making this module unfittable. either there is a logic breakdown, or you are trolling, in which case i would like you to stop."
7/12/2010,"sok,if the armageddon is a satisfactory rr bs, which it is, then three medslots are sufficient - mwd, injector and something else, being a point or eccm, sensor booster, whatever. a fourth and certainly a fifth can be regarded as ""nice but not essential"".after the mandatory mwd and injector, a five-medslot bs has room for dual inv and a lse. an example is tempest, giving, with dc and triple cdfe, 87k ehp (104k ehp overheated in squad) and a 291 dps tank from a lst ii (excluding peak passive recharge). sure, this isn't great - a comparable armour tempest having dc, trimarks, triple eanm, single 1600 and a single gyro would have 106k ehp (115k ehp in gang) and a 296 dps tank from a single lrar ii.however, the shield tempest's lowslots are freed up for triple gyro and dual te - you appear to have forgotten about tes in your last post - and, even when only considering falloff and not tracking, this makes a hell of a difference at a typical combat range of 20 km:armour tempest: 1x gyro, barrage. dps 488. optimal/falloff 6/36 km. dps at 20 km = 90% of max = 439 dps (it's 428 dps with rf fusion)shield tempest: 3x gyro, barrage. dps 656. optimal/falloff 7.8/59 km. dps at 20 km = ~97% of max = 636 dps (45% more dps than the armour tempest!).shield tempest: 3x gyro, rf fusion. dps 823. optimal/falloff 3.9/39 km. dps at 20 km = ~89% of max = 732 dps (67% more dps than the armour tempest!!).so a shield tempest would lose 18% ehp, have about the same rr efficiency but deal 67% more dps, with better tracking! if the fight is at 1 km, then the triple-gyro shield fit still deals 34% more damage. on a strict consideration of ehp*dps the shield fit is greatly superior, demonstrating that the tempest has enough medslots to cope. we can do the same for the hyperion, in either 350 mm rail or blaster fit. an armour hype with triple eanm, 1600, dc and trimarks has 122k ehp, and with 7x 350mm rails (one free for rr), does 428 dps at 20 km, ignoring tracking. a shield 7x 350mm hype, with lse, dual inv, dc, triple cdfe, has 103k ehp (113k overloaded), 16% less than the armour hype, and with the same efficiency of received rr. but with the triple magstab of the shield fit, it does 34% more dps! switching to neutrons and null gives 554 dps at 11/16 km, meaning 80% damage at 20 km, 443 dps. but with the triple magstab and dual te that a shield fit allows, neutron null gives 15/26 km optimal/falloff and 745 raw dps, dealing 97% damage at 20 km, 723 dps - 31% more than the armour null fit! and again, for the loss of only 16% of the armour hype's ehp!yes, these five-medslot fits don't have room for tackle. the six-medslot ships would have to do this. and eccm etc would be a problem. and those nasty lasers will hurt the shields. but on a straight ehp*dps product comparison, these numbers demonstrate that the five-medslot gunships are considerably more effective when shield-rr-tanked. the slot layout is not a significant issue."
7/12/2010,"ok, let's try to bring the points together and *think* about this people:1. armor remote reps are fine as is (done)2. shield remote reps are too fitting intensive for bs gangs (ok, let's see)3. shield remote reps are balanced on logistic cruisers (ah...)so, the point that is trying to be made with all of the ""logistics cruisers are balanced"" posts is not really about logistics cruisers. it is about the following:changing the module itself will then make these balanced ships imbalanced.as such, it has been suggested that the battleships themselves need to be reworked. perhaps a bit more cpu? perhaps more mids to allow for more modules related to prop/ewar?or, we could always reduce the amount of cpu required to fit the module, and reduce the total cpu of the logistics cruisers, thereby making it impossible to fit more remote shield reps than intended on these ships.either way would work, however, i fail to see why you should ""fix"" the balanced part while leaving the ""broken"" part unchanged. changing the stats on the battleships themselves does seem to be working more towards the actual problem.now everyone take a deep breath.flame on."
7/12/2010,why don't you just change the module fitting requirements and then adjust the fitting bonus on the logi ships to reflect that change. then you only have to change 3 items instead of 7 and it doesn't unbalance the logistics ships.
7/12/2010,"i am very sorry for overestimating the average iq of a forum reader, i thought that it would have been obvious that we would decreace cpu of the logis ships to keep them exactly as they are, without any changes to htme, and only improve the battlehips. i will add this to the original post.thank you alot, that is exactly what i meant to do. somebody is intelligent around here."

7/12/2010,"well if you think about it....its not really a passive income because the game is constantly changing and influenced by its players as we see in csm. also by introducing a stock exchange to the economy it gives the whole ""stock"" part of every corporation some meaning rather then just the ability to create votes, submit votes, or recieve dividends. if you look at it from a business point of view every corporation in the game is a privately held company or closed corporation being that there is no stock market of any kind to sell or trade stock. its a good idea and i don't think it would have much of a simulator feel to it. if the actions of players doing missions, destroying npc corp convoys or npc corp ships of any kind. also if you add in npc stock value increaseing and decreasing based on npc sales to players.on another note eve is ""not"" primarily a spaceship based pvp game. if it was there would be alot less npc interaction. meaning you wouldn't have concord, or ""any"" story arc style missions. there wouldn't be much in the aspec of npcs except for the market place to sell items and it wouldn't have such an indepth manufacturing or mining tree. a good example of a game that is primarly pvp is counter-strike. you can add bots which would be your pve but its mainly a pvp game. there is forced pvp in eve but you don't have to pvp to play eve. lol this would give the carebears something to do when they are getting station camped."

7/12/2010,"tbh, i think theres got to be a better way to (re)balance ecm than this."
7/12/2010,"do you honestly think that people would give up the 50%+ ehp that trimarks give when taking their bs blobs out for a spin? as for it being unbalanced, why then do we have ewar boosting rigs? shouldn't a counter exist in the same form?problem with ecm vs. solo/small gang is mainly the severe lack of slots. there are simply not enough to prevent being jammed. boosters would solve it but are illegal in high-sec empire and are a lot harder to come by compared to rigs .. so you end up with a solution for the ""elite"" - not a route i want to go/support.lets see, we have recharge cap/shield implants, tracking implants, lock speed implants, lock range implants etc. etc. etc., pretty much all of them.benefit of those are that they give an edge without costing you a fortune and blocking all your slots. sets may give bigger bonus, but are cost prohibitive in the extreme as soon as engagement leaves empire or exceeds 70+ when bubbles and lag reduce pod survival rates to silly low levels.low-grade? wouldn't be caught dead with the useless things .. vast majority of ships (even frigates!) are better off using high-grades as their base sensors are 10+ and you wont have to swap clone when choosing larger hulls. so you are correct, i never used them just as i generally steer clear of other useless ""features"" in this game .. hg however is a different story.do you really think that there are a lot of slave (or any set for that matter) users in bs blobs? considering that those blobs are most common in bubble land i question that assumption .. super-/capital blobs on the other hand."
7/12/2010,"it would require a huge overhaul. ecm behaves in a manner completely different to all other forms of ewar. if it was brought more in line with them then it would be alot more fun.as for everyone saying you've got to counter it just like any other ewar, all the other counter modules are useful beyond merely countering their ewar. for example sensor boosters give target range and target speed, cap boosters have their obvious benefit as well. eccm does absolutely nothing on the field except help you avoid getting ecm'd."
7/12/2010,good idea. it'd generally be nice to see a boost to boosters.
7/12/2010,"you might wanna recheck before making phantastic claims, hgs are worse than lgs in pretty much all frigate hulls, and hgs only really start making sense in bs hulls.while hg indeed gives you some extra strength against lg on bc hulls and hacs, the extra cost is in absolutely no relation to the pretty much nonexistant extra benefit.whats more, given they are so dirt cheap you can have them in your nullsec clone if you arent a total cheapskate.do you really think bubbles are working everywhere? last time i checked, the majority of pvp happens outside of bubble land.as far as blobs go, the bigger your blob, the less trouble hostile ecm is, its not rocket science."
7/12/2010,"taking into account both sides of the argument, both sides have very valid points of view. on the whole though, i support this action. obviously there would be kinks to work out, but the op's suggestion holds merit and should be looked at.supported."

7/12/2010,"i have 17 mil, can i help?"
7/12/2010,the general language of the forum here is english. funny how many other people look like they can't get some sleep.
7/12/2010,"you seem to be acting under the assumption that eve is designed to ensure the safety of your ship. this is not true. if you can't afford to lose it, you shouldn't be undocking in it, because random people killing you is an intentional game mechanic. it is, quite literally, why eve was created. if you don't like it, stop undocking in valuable ships."
7/12/2010,"itt: non-english player believes that by posting his complaints about a game mechanic working exactly as designed in his native language on the expressly english eve online forum, he will garner sympathy and have his ship(t) magically returned to him.by the way, what was it, exactly? i kind of hope it was a faction ship, for no particular reason whatsoever.edit: hey, read the translated jibber-jabber, turns out it was hulks.oh well, someone missed the note about hulkageddon, i suppose..."
7/12/2010,possibly undocking hulks like a lemming? one can always hope.
7/12/2010,"he apparently lost his hulk in highsec, then proceeded to put all his belongings into a t1 hauler to get suicided again. so he's quitting, apparently.hence why i'm still very interested in his stuff - should there be any stuff left, that is.i won't go through the hassle of translating that garbage though.."
7/12/2010,"translated and fixed a bit, since batolemaeus is a lazybutt. :pi decided to translate in the hopes it'll amuse those who saw this thread and raised their eyebrows at that illegible blurt of german gibberish."
7/12/2010,ur stuffz. can i has?
7/12/2010,"just like with any other mmo. nothing is irreplaceable in eve, i lost my proteus recently because i was on the phone, i'm not crying about it. although, this again raises the concern that suicide ganking in high-sec is too easy. isn't there suppose to be a massive sec status hit for pod-killing?"
7/12/2010,who cares? it's lots of fun. i can imagine it's even more fun in high sec where the pod is likely to contain expensive implants.
7/12/2010,"ding ding ding! we have a winner! and as long as i'm using destroyers/cruisers, then my -10 sec status doesn't mean jack when i'm just warping in to lose my ship anyway. the only fear we have (because we use empty clones; you should try it when everyone is gunning for you) is that our pods will be flooded with your tears - luckily, we've built machines that allow us to turn those same tears into pure sustenance. cry more, i'm hungry."
7/12/2010,this reminds me of
7/12/2010,"um..ccp/players..i have been wondering for a long time on whats the point of scope news articles? i mean u don't interact with most of these characters in game and the issues they have with one another affect nothing in game and don't affect player/corporations. so whats the point? where does the ammar queen live? i want to tickle her.example.this recent article.amarr prime  the first of yonis ardishapur's speaking engagements was held today in dam-torsad on amarr prime. speaking before a crowd of just under a thousand for little over an hour, the heir has focused mainly on his views on religion, the empire, and the roles of all peoples in its future.ardishapur called on all those attending the event to remember where you came from. be you a freed slave, a descendant of slaves, a merchant, a navy officer, a holder, or even royalty, it is paramount to remember the roots of the faith. all men are created to serve god and do his will. it is not merely time served that shall be rewarded, but the conviction and faith with which you serve.additionally, ardishapur made clear his views on the other races of the cluster. all people must one day be brought into god's embrace, through their own choice or through our guiding hand. embrace those who would learn, defeat those who would make mockery of god's way. through the penance of deeds, the sins of forefathers may eventually be washed away. this is the amarr way and it is the future, if the empire is to thrive.the heir closed his speech thanking those for attending and promising that he would never forget the sacrifices made by the true faithful in times of falsehood.there is not even an author..."
7/12/2010,"wrong forum section.but to answer your question anyway. there is a strong rp community in this game and an unfolding storyline connected with the real live events in the game. like introduction of factional warfare or wormholes or, more recently, sansha invasion. those events are relevant to all empires and the storyline. that's why scope news articles are published. if they are not relating directly to something that is happening, then they are just adding depth to the story."
7/12/2010,moved from assembly hall to general discussion.
7/12/2010,"it's just backstory. you are free to ignore this stuff but it is intended to add to the feeling and depth of the eve universe, as well as add colour and flavour. i personally like reading them, just like i enjoy reading the chronicles, etc, and like it when they report on player events that i haven't heard about."
7/12/2010,"try this one:news article have been talking about sanshas attacks.capsuleers have been able to participate in this attacks (both for and against sansha) because they've been 'live events'.one recent news article talked about a scheduled concert to take place in sarum prime.eve players conclude that this event would be a perfect target for some future attack.do the news articles have any effect? yes, not only do they contribute to eve lore but they also provide framework for in game events. they also provide fuel to the rping community."
7/12/2010,"try checking not scope but interstellar correspondents, those guys give real news. and quite nice read usually."
7/12/2010,rp also provides nice opportunites for massive tears when suicide ganked :d
7/12/2010,"i would like to know the official ccp position on this. is there an actual reason for it ?it is nearly a month since the tournament finished, yet no prizes have been handed out. i have received 2 mails from ccp claw, around a week apart, each asking essentially the same thing: where to put the medals and who to send the isk to. i have replied to each very promptly.i would like to know if the more high-up staff in ccp know how incompetently the handing out of the prizes are being handled, or if they even care.is the tournament just a pr stunt that they no longer care about when it's finished ? or do they genuinely care, and this is just the result of one terribly inefficient and incapable employee.seldarine."
7/12/2010,"i had heard it took a few months for everything to be sorted out last year as well,"
7/12/2010,"all joking aside, i agree with this 100%. i'm sure all the other prize winners feel the same way."
7/12/2010,i think claw is enjoying that he can troll you without even writing something.
7/12/2010,"then submit a petition, contact customer support and act according to your corp name."
7/12/2010,"hi all.ever since ccp set up singularity last year and gave all players at the time level v in every skill, i've been thinking it would be nice if it was a regular thing.the whole idea of the weekend back then was for players to help ccp test out supercapitals. not sure about what the rest of you did if you went on there, but i bought viators, cranes, a sin, and just generally had a bit of a play around with some t2 ships i was nowhere near being able to fly at the time on tranquility, and pretty much goofed around. looking back on it, i should have used some of the carriers, dreads, and titans ccp gave everyone, and got a feel for the ships and their various roles.i thought that perhaps ccp could organise more all-skills-at-level-v weekends on singularity for newer players to do the same sort of thing.say a new player joins eve, and hears all about tech 2/tech 3 ships, dreadnoughts, carriers, titans amd think to themselves, ""damn, i'd love to be able to fly one of those one day...but which one?""the 6 months plus it takes to be able to fly a ship, let alone fly it well, and have support skills to be able to use it effectively, is a major put-off for some, and it is a lot of time to devote to whatever it is they decide to train for.an all-skills-at-level-v weekend would let the player get into these ships, see what they are capable of, what the limitations etc are, and let them decide if it's something they really want to go for in the end. spending all that time training for a t2 ship or carrier or the like, the player would want to be sure it's something worth spending all the time training for.having other pilots tell them, ""yeah man, that carrier/assault cruiser/interdictor/interceptor/titan is awesome"" sometimes just might not be good enough. what's awesome and cool for another player, might not be for another.letting a player go onto the test server once in a while (say, once every 6 months perhaps?) would give the player the chance to get into that nice flashy oh-so-long-to-train-for ship class, and see for themselves which race suits them.just a thought."
7/12/2010,"sisi has been running for years and no people shouldn't be given all level 5'swhy?do you know how to fly a capital ship?what makes the average ""jo 3 month old"" the right person to test capitals?it's like getting a 10 year old to test a harrier jump jet, it's stupid, pointless and dangerous.what they need to do is have mail shot groups that go out to specific pilots for when they want to test specific things.exampleblack ops testingall black op pilots (players with the relivant skill) get a message asking if they'd like to help with testing in exchange for free stuff.same goes for any other item that needs testing.that way you get pilots that at least know how to fit\fly a capital ship on the most part."
7/12/2010,this forum needs a thumbs down option.i'd like to use sisi for testing. having any chance of reproducing something ruined by a bunch of adhd kids with all lvl5 skills would be detrimental to sisi as a test server.
7/12/2010,"agreed. not to mention i like to test with skill approximating what i actually have, not some pointless fantasy.it's all moot in any case. it's a test server, not a fluffy bunny happy heaven server. ccp is always going to set it up so that it suits their needs, not the wants some delusional player."
7/12/2010,"hi everyone, i was wondering how others feel about the ""in space"" interface? for me it feels a bit flat and boring and not at all worthy of the otherwise awesome atmosphere the game has. i would love to see something a bit more immersive and dimensional. i saw this @ da a few days ago and i thought how great it would be if we saw something similar in eve. i'm not saying that we should get rid of the current controls but instead build up on them - have something as a second option that would bring the game one step closer to the ""real deal"". nothing grand and spectacular like an individual interior for each ship or race, just a standard model that would add that special feel to the game that i currently think it lacks. let's try to make eve a bit more personal and move it away from the cold and lifeless rts view that it is currently stuck in and bring it to a whole new level. sorry if this topic has already been discussed, feel free to delete this post if it has.jmedit: in regards of the controls, i say keep the current point-and-click system for fine tuning and add something like a 3d compass wheel that can do 90deg left/right/up/down turns with a single click for the more complex adjustments in your course."
7/12/2010,"i think some of the frustrations at and in the csm is because there are many good issues raised, without sufficient focus on costs. so while there is short-term and long-term value in the csm passing a couple of hundred good ideas, i think it would also be useful to have some way to rank value. people are used to the 100-point ship budget for the alliance tournament. what if your ccp contact came back with a point value for the cost of each proposals and asked the csm what 100-points would they want? one problem now is that the more efficient and motivated the csm (or player base), the more they propose. but what ccp can do each 6-months is finite (and currently below average with incarna/dust integration/lag) so it looks like ccp is less responsive, when in fact a csm is just more creative. i am worried when i read in past minutes phrases from ccp about a feature ""not worth doing."" very successful software companies may always know what the costs are, but sometimes get a bit out of touch with what the customer, especially less experienced customer, really wants. is there a mechanism to allow the csm to provide insight to ccp in making cost/benefit decisions?"
7/12/2010,"this is one thing that stakeholder status is about, and we intend to provide prioritization feedback as part of our role. the problem is that csm has no guarantee of developer time, so we don't know how many ""points"" are available to allocate. further, whereas other competitors for developer time are interacting in real-time and real-space, csm has significant ""ping time"" and bandwidth disadvantages. we are effectively playing the game of ""fix eve"" over a 110-baud modem, relayed through a proxy server hosted on the cassini space probe.i think you will find the upcoming summit minutes will shed some more light on this issue."
7/12/2010,currently:a click on a column's header sorts the table by the column and highlights the column.another click on the header reverses sorting order.there is no way to remove highlighting and reset sorting order to the default. i propose this trivial change:third click on the same header removes highlighting and resets sorting order to the default.what do you think?
7/12/2010,this
7/12/2010,"as the title says, titans can only lock capital ships."
7/12/2010,"well thought out proposal. i especially like the detailed pro/con analysis and arguments as to how this proposal will improve the game.wait. wrong topic.not supported. no reasoning given for the change, no explanations, no nothing. this isn't a proposal, it's barely even a statement."
7/12/2010,"they can? that sounds like a pretty nasty bug. you should report it here. after all, how ridiculous would it be if a titan couldn't attack the ships tackling them in order to make good their escape?"
7/12/2010,"the one thing that really bothers me about eve is the cap/supercap proliferation. the closer i am to buying and sitting in a supercap, the more i think that they are just outright bad for the game. i realize that i am having trouble seeing through the lens of ""small gang pvp"" - but i think its a much more viable lens considering that ""large"" gang pvp literally breaks the server.-lianged: and as much as i dislike supercaps, i don't support this. :p"
7/12/2010,"i have some concerns about how supercapital warfare is affecting eve, but that is completely unrelated to this proposal. i mean, seriously, what is a titan ever targeting, other than a capital or the odd hictor? you could give hictors doomsday immunity and have exactly the same effect on serious gameplay. it'd just deprive us of comedy doomsdays."
7/12/2010,"not supported.pi has a plenty high isk/hour return, even in high-sec. the problem is that pi is incredibly click-intensive, and requires no higher thought processes after your facility is configured.that is what needs to change. make pi less click-intensive and somehow require tactical decisions to be made during the reset process."
7/12/2010,ccp is still conducting their investigation if pl cheated using that sphere program to hack the client.not supported.
7/12/2010,"you would think someone who actually works for a gaming company would have a bit more understanding of nda'ssure there are allot of issues to fix with eve, but i think we should be thankful we have any say at all. i've been playing eve for several years now, and following it from the beginning. ccp has made mistakes, but no more than any other gaming company. i for one would much rather give my money to a company that actually cares about their game, as opposed to a company say, like blizzard, who just fires their devs when they disagree with their ideas. a company produces fast food games for the masses without ever stopping to think about what their players want. to be honest she should be booted, simply for her opinions of other players play styles. none of the other csm delegates seem to be insulting other players play styles, and calling for their removal from the game, or worse calling them outright psychopaths. finally and most important, this person is supposed to be representing ""us"" in a professional and courteous manner. not throwing objects at other players, and yelling at developers. this kinds of childish behavior has no place in the csm, and clearly demonstrates her lack of qualifications.breaching the nda is really just the straw that broke the camels back, i say good riddance !!"
7/12/2010,"i cannot understand how people think breaching a nda isn't a good reason to kick someone off. if they can't trust her to keep things secret, how can they tell her more about the future of the game? will she be excluded from the conference room while everyone else gets to listen in?"
7/12/2010,"most people, like myself, are just curious why a democraticly elected member of the csm was removed so completely out of the blue, since the electors (at least parts thereoff) wanted her to be in that position. an nda-violation on the other hand, is a rather vague concept, that basically covers everything between stealing and selling data from a ccp-dev-puter, over making screenshots of the newest remodelled ships, down to accidently stepping on a post-it, that lay on the floor and ended up sticking on her shoe, with the note: ""must get new coffee-mug!!!11eleven - ccp hilmar"".end of the line is people want to get some more specific info on the breach, rather then a ""because we say so"", be it out of curiousity, actually valid interest or finding another reason to gloat about the hated enemy."
7/12/2010,"i agree that its not very satisfying, but it's everything they technically *have* to tell us. everything beyond that is goodwill from their side, and ccp doesn't exactly have a good rep on that account"
7/12/2010,"i'm not going to dispute the validality of ccp's decision, because, quite honestly, the current situation hints at an actual and severe breach and as such, i accept the decision. however it doesn't mean i and everyone else needs to be satisfied with the ""as is"", especially since reality tought us all one thing: never trust any authority further then you can throw them ;)"
7/12/2010,"hmmm.maybe it wasn't colonel mustard in the study with the revolver (replace colonel mustard with eva jobse, study with studio and revolver with a hilariously large & stuffed sack with proprietary secrets stenciled on it) but ccp is actually trolling us (with help from ankhesencopypasta) while ccp busily reduce the overabundance of clicking necessary in planetary interaction - without having to feel obligated to answer any questions meanwhile!...well, at least i can hope"
7/12/2010,"a breach of a nda can get you 3 months to 5 years jail time in germany if the breach is severe enough. this does not include the damages caused by the breach for the nda issuer.a indiscretion is one thing, industrial espionage something of an entirely different magnitude, all covered by a nda. as long as we don't know how big the breach was, we can't really argue if the removal was appropriate or not."
7/12/2010,"maybe they'll have the icelandic mafia work her over.maybe they already have, but it went too far.maybe any day now someone will open a can of fermented shark and find ... biomass they weren't expecting to find.maybe this will serve as a warning to others."
7/12/2010,"how does it hint a a serious breach if we know jack **** about what happened, or did i miss something?"
7/12/2010,"the fact we know jack **** is because nobody has told us, nobody has told us because the breach is serious."
7/12/2010,"by counting one and one together:do you really think, out of all the people in the game, that exactly ankh would stay as quite as she does, if she didn't do something that is obviously wrong, regardless if she realized the breach at first or not? not even her blog yields any news at all and that's quite telling, unless she got abducted, tied up, gagged and sits in ccp hilmar's cellar.beyond that, her occupational survival basically depends on if she did break the nda or not and while i think a lot of nasty things about ccp in general, i do not count legal-suicide to their feat-list."
7/12/2010,"the threat of legal action would cause anyone to be careful on what they say. let's say i broke a nda by accidently posting a screenshot of some new thingy in a game on my blog. stuff like that happens all the time but can hardly be called 'serious' or damaging. and let's asume i get sacked for it. ppl often get sacked for minor stuff just because it's company policy or cuz management are arses. so, you got sacked for a minor incident, would you then go shouting what happened to you knowing that the company could still start a law suit against you or would you be smart and just let it go, since you know you will never beat the company in court?i would do the latter and i think 99% of all ppl would.eva herself stated she did not agree with the fact that there even was a breaching of nda. that is not the kind of statement you would make if you stole the complete list of features in the next expansion and sold it to a competitor.so i would say that when you put one and one together, it actually points to a minor breach rather than anything serious."
7/12/2010,"sounds reasonable....it could of course be linked to some of the old fw issues: ankh learnt about some of the exploits (not classed by ccp as exploits) and screamed from the roof tops about them, ccp did nothing..so she made the (non)exploits widely known and encouraged everyone to abuse them to hell and back in the hope ccp would do something...so this could all be down to petty vengeance for making them do some work speculation speculation"
7/12/2010,"could be, but like you said, it's all speculation. and i doubt we'll ever hear more about it. :p"
7/12/2010,"well, first there's a bit of a difference between someone in a beta posting a screen shot of a game before it releases and real and serious breaches of nda. what game development company is going to hire a game designer that broke an nda for another game company? what company *as a rule* will someone that's well known for breaking an nda? right now, ccp is all but terminated her career in the game industry - and if they did this maliciously or for teh lulz or for player politics or because she blogged things that everyone else blogged or whatever the hell tinfoil hat reason you're coming up with... they're going on the hook for some pretty tremendous legal fees and damages.no, what we can say is that eva jobse (a very noisy individual!) and ccp are both sitting tight and shutting the **** up. this is a strong hint that they both have legal advice (and reason) to do so. she may have posted ""i don't agree"" but i think that hardly matters considering her resounding silence since.-liang"
7/12/2010,"fwiw, i agree with liang's analysis, but not the strength of his convictions.put a gun to my head and say: who's right, ccp or eva? i choose ccp.but i'm not totally sold, since she has denied it and we know little other than accusation vs. denial. only time will tell. hopefully if there is a defense, people won't be so jaded based on prejudices, speculation and internet-hype-mongering that they will be able to consider the facts with an open mind."
7/12/2010,"things wouldn't be so speculatory if eva had not fallen off the face of the universe.is anyone willing to place a bet that ankh got hit by a bus or something after the nda breach?just kidding, i doubt that happened. but what's actually happened to her since her removal is of much interest and mystery..."
7/12/2010,"most likely answer... -like lark, her main and her alts were all banned (this is why we haven't seen some of the obvious alts who were posting constantly during ank's campaign) -also, ank realizes that right now that ""eva jobse"" may soon be a google search that yields up the massively article (or similar ones about the alleged nda violation) as one of the very first answers, and she's determined to save her career prospects by suing ccp. if that's the case she'd have to be crazy(er) to blab on the 'net rather than keeping it quiet and forcing ccp to gather information via discovery."
7/12/2010,the meeting minutes for the first csm 5 summit at the ccp headquarters in reykjavik are now available. click here to take a look!
7/12/2010,"thanks for the sticky, navigator!"
7/12/2010,oo
7/12/2010,"good and timely communication, but y'all (ccp) could have condensed it a bit. something like......would have conveyed exactly the same message, and you wouldn't have needed to put in anything like as much effort to produce it. ho hum."
7/12/2010,good job mynxee ;)
7/12/2010,"so .. eh ... the gist of everything is that:1. ccp is not going to care for eve until after dust 514, so around end of 2011.2. because of a few years of, what, hard work? incarna and dust are going to take all their attention, leaving just room for a little distractions to integrate incarna and dust with.3. ccp thinks the state of the cluster is just peachy.4. the very instrument they advertised to be awesome feedback and work as instrument for gamedesign and customer represenation has been prenerfed by ccp because all the planning and scheduling has already been done by ccp. in other words, the csm can now feedback until it sees blue in the face, but ccp is already under way and ain't stopping.what am i missing?"
7/12/2010,thanks to mynxee and the csm5 team.-t'amber
7/12/2010,this would be comedy gold if it weren't for the fact that it's quite serious.really goes to show just how out of touch the senior staff are with the players and how unwilling they are to enter into any sort of real compromise or debate.csm was all about putting power into the hands of the players and making ccp more accountable to them. this appears to have failed.i'm quite glad the format of the summit was changed and this term's chair has a good set of balls and is willing to tackle the challenges. i think this just about sums up the complete disconnect that the management have.
7/12/2010,"""csm asked about in-station fighting or aggressive behaviors. ccp would not promise either in the near term. it has to be kept in mind that the basic idea regarding incarna is to socialize, not to have an arena. an analogy with airports has been used in the past and that vision was further reinforced in hjaltis book, eve: the burning life.""if that is any indication for how ccp do their research, then sit on it for years and then get to work with it, i get scared.. sure nice book, but it is quite old by now. i do hope they actually did some serious and current market studies on mmo's that have failed because of airport analogy development >.<"
7/12/2010,"it's all a bit depressing. how can we fault ccp for reinvesting so much of their income into the game? yet how can we praise them when the expenditure is producing so little benefit to it's customers?well on the bright side: at least we know where we stand now. all i can say is, incarna had better be ****ing awesome, ccp, because if we've put up with your terrible game quality since december 09 and all we get to make up for it is talk in some stupid e-bar, then there will be hell to pay.start fixing **** now. start telling us what you've fixed. start telling us what you're going to fix next. star wars: the old republic launches soon, and those guys are gonna eat your lunch unless you shape the **** up."
7/12/2010,when you see it...
7/12/2010,"i am here, on page 1."
7/12/2010,"yeah we never said ccp didnt allocate enough resources to eve. we tried to explain that we feel resources are not allocated to the right areas (fixing stuff, making sure existing content is good, etc). however, unfortunately it didnt seem like ccp understood that at all.this actually needs some refining:ccp explorer did come to us with code metrics - and it is clear that from a software engineering point of view, the eve code base is better than ever. however, as we all know, this is not reflected in the game experience. vuk lau showed them a video of how to deal with module lag (which actually seemed to surprise some of the devs at ccp), and we talked to the developers who actually work on the cluster code. they do accept that there is more lag than before - both in big fleets and small gangs - and the core cluster team is working on finding out why (and then fixing it).it does seem somewhat telling that ccp comes up with code metrics when we come with complaints about the user experience. the two are not related, and to me it hints at either a disconnect between the devs and the game they make, or an effort to fool the csm into thinking things are ok. however, the team that is actually responsible for 'fixing the lag' is aware that it exists and that it is worse than before. whether or not they can fix it any time soon is a totally different question however."
7/12/2010,"i guess that by now, you and all the other csms have realised that fixing this is your primary mission. all the other stuff - fixing this, buffing that, tweaking the other - are secondary sub-aspects of your main job."
7/12/2010,these minutes are a joke. a joke that is not funny.
7/12/2010,i agree. there's no doubt that plenty of resources are being thrown at eve to improve it 'upwards' just not enough (or none at all) to improve it 'sideways' (hence the other quote in my poast).
7/12/2010,"we were aware of that before the summit, and in many issues that were discussed (low sec, 0.0, factional warfare, the winter expansion, etc) we brought up the need to focus on existing issues and working with what is already in eve. it wasn't just during the 'excellence' discussion that we talked about this, it was a red thread throughout the 3 days of meetings.unfortunately ccp still seems to focus heavily on attracting new customers (or getting former players to resub) with new content rather than improved existing content - and their increasing subscriber numbers support that belief. it is my belief that properly marketted 'old content' could achieve the exact same thing but with a multi million dollar budget at stake, ccp doesnt seem to be convinced of that. the only way to convince them would be a drop in subscriber numbers, but most of us are still too invested in this game to unsubscribe en-masse."
7/12/2010,"you know, all good intentions from csm and staff aside, that just means ****, when they people making the decisions at ccp on commercial objectives, acquisition targets over retention, and resource allocations have zero clue on the state of the product, or even of its reception by customers in these days of social networking. there's an interesting thread on shc, yeah i know, shocking in its own right .. bitter vets constructively analysing meeting minutes, eve, dust, incarna, and ccp, with surprisingly more politesse and aptitude then here. but even there, the same fundamental conclusions are being drawn. it has no importance whatsoever whether devs want to do the right thing, when the people making the decisions actively or passively wreck the processes involved.look, no disrespect to what is visibly a lot of hard work of the csm as a real team, in spite of the **** we saw here t times, nor to the hardworking staff who try to build this universe. but it is as if at some point there just is a lot of misinformation, or even emo on the state of the product and those annoying customers who dare to want to enjoy a game respectively. but i guess, that is what you get for staying clear from proper communication and immersion, and yes, maybe as players we ourselves a even guilty of some of the roots of that, after all, for several years people chased after devs playing the game as if it were a jihad. sure, sometimes for good reasons in the days of corruption, but at some point that just turned into a spanish inquisition.maybe it's an idea to start a little reconciliation on several levels, cause with what eve is, you can't manage development of the product or the business without living and breathing what you build.it is amazing, that it seems necessary for players to educate the people behind the brand, on the nature and state of their product, even to educate them on the risk this places on the value of both brand and ip - regardless of hard work of actual developers. these minutes really show where the structural problems are."
7/12/2010,"can't they see what an incredible commercial risk they are taking with this? i'm not referring to the mythical risk of mass unsubscribing - people love eve, they want to believe, so those who are invested in it stick around, and do come back. but getting caught in an ever accelerating rat race of increasing resource capacity while the ratio of resource allocations required for acquisitions is not in proportion to that increase in resource capacity, that's just nuts. besides, there are structural business development limitations to that which traditionally force enterprise forces to turn their products to legacy mode, and seek other products, typically within the same ip. but those who engage in such rat races, they nor their products survive in the end, because it creates a momentum which is always counterproductive to the original core principles and strengths of the original foundation they established for the ip."
7/12/2010,"the question that you need to ask nathan is why are you measuring your development budget against other game companies? do they have the same business eve business model, game archictecture and vision that would make such comparisons valid? yes or no?at the end of the day, it's a pointless number statistic that serves little purpose.ergo: he needs to come up with a better justification.i think by now, he should have realized that the player/community climate is unhappy and that is being reflected by the pushing that csm5 is giving. it also doesn't take a genius to gauge the general mood of the forum postings. let's see how things develop from here - continual denial or some course-corrections."
7/12/2010,"aye, you're right. maybe it might be worth pointing out to ccp that the ""used to play eve but left because finally lost patience with gamebreaking bug #153"" demographic is worth chasing, especially since fixing every such gamebreaking bug adds value to each new subscription."
7/12/2010,"i'm confused, first ccp says that they are committed to excellence and then they say no to every request for fixes or polish...i knew things were bad but the minutes show even greater problems, well i hear that perpetuum is shaping up real nice..."
7/12/2010,"good stuff.reading through it is amasing how determined ccp staff are to ignore the advice the csm gives, their defensiveness comes across as downright unprofessional and discourteous as well. getting the idea that they no longer respect their players.at least this time around the csm are forcing ccp to admit that they're letting the game rot in favour of their pet projects which allows us as consumers to decide how much effort we want to dedicate to the future of a game which the management is too tight to alot resources to fix.edit:apologies to developers, not your decision as to what you are allowed to do."
7/12/2010,"i just don't understand, because at one point in time, you had fixed lag to a degree that made everyone jump up and down and praise you, ccp. we were all saying ""finally, this game is going somewhere now."" and then you introduced a new patch, with new features, and we went back to worse than ever amounts of lag. maybe the people you're putting on this issue aren't competent, or maybe you really just don't care, but that's all we really want. you don't have to give us tons of new game content every 6 months, we make the game content ourselves, that's the whole point of eve. just give us a lag free experience."
7/12/2010,"the devs need to realize that there is no for/against, no right/wrong, and no enemies here. there is only the possibility of working together with what is possibly their most effective market research team for current subscribers(the csm), or not working together with. if there is no recognition that the aims and goals of both ccp and the ccp customers are nearly identical, then there can be no progress."
7/12/2010,"considering the minutes, the primae makes perfect sense as a gift, reflecting the stance of ccp (management): here, have something for free from us, it looks totally cool and is unique and especially made for this new feature and you better be happy about it because it took us much work to do and despite that, we're not going to charge you for it extra. yet, it is pretty much useless."
7/12/2010,well said.
7/12/2010,"i kinda think the devs do realize that...it's management that seems to need to ""corify"" this message. but well said, mazz."
7/12/2010,very well put.
7/12/2010,"well put, just...what if that target group and their ""market research team"" is seen by ccp - probably at high management level - as not so important after all ? as it seems it is the only explanation to me...all i can say, these minutes have really shaken my trust in ccp (already dented, but just a bit before).after all, who and how can assure that fate of foty incarna will be better than rest of eve. once we are clearly told to stfu, all what's left is forum graphomania... i have a topic for speculation then, what new shiny will doom incarna to be left in half-finished state forever."
7/12/2010,"it already is clear from these minutes, that there are severe and structural bottlenecks in communication inside ccp. what surprised me, even shocked me, is that while players often think that there is a big gap between players and devs, the gap between execs and devs is much, much bigger. a second observation, is that these minutes make shockingly clear that on the executive level, and probably also on a business/product owner decision point, there is something really, really wrong. they either do not get the correct information on state of affairs, events and products, or they discard it (maybe indeed based on old trauma, too much work taken over the fun or growing into their version of bitter vet facing screaming hordes), or the people who control the information flow have either such issues, or suffer from cubicle / little kingdom syndromes. a third observation, is that ultimately, where they could with less work but more vision establish ccp as something truly awesome, and the sci fi mmo as their default ip and market, without competing with anyone else anywhere, they insist on basing commercial decisions on incorrect definitions, engaging in ventures while step by step they take away parts of the core company and product values that made this epic ride possible. and as a fourth observation, as much as i hate to make the analogy, there is something very unsettling about their approach on customer acquisition over customer retention. we've seen this before, in damage control efforts in swg. as long as the product is not legacy, build upon customers wanting to make it work, and recycle subscriber groups as you proceed to legacy status."
7/12/2010,"heh, if this is the attitude that ccp is taking towards their product for the next 18 months minimum then i think it may just be time to unsub.at least sc 2 will be out soon to occupy some of my time."
7/12/2010,"what we have here... is a failure to communicate. some men you just can't reach. so you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it... well, he gets it. i don't like it any more than you men."
7/12/2010,looks like i now have some light after-dinner reading.
7/12/2010,"so they are adding a brand-new feature that you guys aren't fond of and is going to impact the game in a new way as opposed to the goal stated, which is refining pi, polishing, and prepping for future expansions? without going into details on what it is...should we worry?oh, and good job guys. thanks especially for mentioning new players barrier to getting into 0.0. did ccp respond with anything to that?"
7/12/2010,"this is pretty sad. when we are told that devs play the game, well, then probably it means that they don't play in nullsec, and that explains all. as trebor stated, and as anyone know, with the current gameplay mechanics lag will never be defeated. that means the sov warfare will always have problems, and personally i think that this is one of the main reason why comquerable 0.0 is empty: you have to fight for your territory, but the fight is the most frustrating thing to do in eve, and many people would give away their sov for fun. after all, this is a game.in the end, lag in sov warfare will never be solved, and non masochist pilots in the long run will avoid fleet battles like hell (like i do). and assigning a permanent scrum team to monitor, balance and work out a new life for nullsec would be the solution..the fact is that nullsec is the most important part of eve. it's the only source of many materials, the main drain of ships and capitals, it's the highest and biggest of aims, and it's the place where the stories, the politics, the power dynamics, the player organization the biggest of every time and virtual world ever existed.eve's nullsec is the biggest monument of mmo gaming. but with this policy, it will never reach its full potential, and decline."
7/12/2010,"good to see what lots of us have been saying - the csm is a complete waste of time and effort and the summit meeting minutes proves it categorically. it is there only for the small ""uber-l33t"" player base who seem to think they control the game . ""whaaa"" we here you all cry ""1% of the player base has a problem with lag - fix it now!!"". ""whaaa"" you cry again ""our life in low-sec is pointless - fix it now!!"". seriously, it must of been like kindergarten for the ccp attendees listening to you all whine away (tear-streaked powerpoint presentations and all) .seriously, there are issues here that were raised in csm1 (in fact most of the points covered in this document are just rehashes of issues that have been there since inception). each year you guys seem to find more issues to have a sook over but it still seems to escape your attention - you are all irrelevant to the game and to the majority of the player base.and it's funny to see that instead of 3 days in iceland, you now want more!! as ccp rightly point out, even a month of yakking amongst yourselves would still no accomplish anything (at least someone has their feet firmly planted on the ground)!! just reiterates the fact that this is nothing more than a pointless waste of time and effort - a sop to the ""cool kids"" to make them feel good about themselves .the funniest thing though about this whole exercise is that the csm now has yet another pointless document to wave around to prove their relevancy.give yourselves a golf clap for a job well done."
7/12/2010,"ccp: we don't care what players think, as long as the money keeps rolling in everything is peachy. we prefer to work on incarna and dust.that's what i get from reading them minutes.when in reality they should be fixing bugs that been around for years, broken sov mechanics and releasing expansions (if you can call them that) that are full of bugs and released in beta state. also your customer service is pure ****, cccp get your act together."
7/12/2010,"so the csm isn't very good at getting under management's skin, and making them work at fixing all the old holes in eve. that sucks, we can agree on that. but if we do as you say and disband the csm, what exactly do you propose as a solution? let ccp management live in the land of deceptive stats and ""ooh, shiny!"" until someone makes a space mmo competently and eve collapses? let them get their inspiration for what eve should become from forum trolls? or are you just going to poke at them with pins in a voodoo doll until they get a clue? seriously, the csm is not perfect, but what you propose is stupid."
7/12/2010,"i had a theory that a legal background would be a useful attribute for a csm member, especially with issues relating to negotiations, ndas and the like, but approximately 98% of voters disagreed with me :)"
7/12/2010,fait accompli's usually are handled quickly
7/12/2010,minutes are now available
7/12/2010,tl;dr = we are going to keep shoving our half finished and unneeded features down your throat for at least a year and a half longer before we even consider fixing all our broken poo poo and non-functional core gameplay.hope that helps.edit: my hat is off to the csm team for their hard hard work against these odds though. for this i salute you. o7
7/12/2010,nice work team.
7/12/2010,"""lag will always be an issue however eve, but eve is now, from a technical standpoint, in a better state than it has ever been."" if it weren't so sad, i'd laugh."
7/12/2010,"-it was mentioned by ccp that the data does not seem to support that polished quality sells better than new features.-ccp stated that once incarna and planetary interaction/dust 514 are fully implemented, focus will probably shift far more towards improve"
7/12/2010,"first time reading the csm minutes, lost all faith in the entire process, ccp get the csm to do more than the csm get ccp to do, didn't realise it worked the wrong way round.the next 18 months of ccp's schedule are already accounted for before the csm even gets to iceland, and all of this time is ccp doing what ""they"" want to do... what's the point of the csm except to give inside information to ccp?by existing features they mean dust 514 and incarna (once implemented)"
7/12/2010,"yeah. there were some positives in there, i mean some stuff that was good and encouraging, but what the ****, oveur, this is supposed to be the game that you love. eve is supposed to be the game that you guys created because it's what you wanted to play? what the **** are you thinking?"
7/12/2010,"as usual, the minutes show that the csm did not present one issue to improve the game and rather presented a series of whines about the state of content. i feel bad for ccp having to listen to these people complain, complain and complain without presenting anything constructive. glad to see the minutes show that ccp is giving the due attention to the csm that it deserves: zero."

7/12/2010,that<U+FFFD>s basicly what i got out of it yeah.
7/12/2010,"as i read through these minutes, i see alot of hard work and good ideas. lets give this csm the time it needs to start pushing change forward. rome wasn't built in a day. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/12/2010,"if these minutes did not make it abundantly clear that there is no ""pushing"" to be had, you are seriously delusional."
7/12/2010,"and here is what is wrong with the csm:when it happens to fit nicely in to whatever you're currently doing.. as opposed to realising that these are the biggest issues that the players of eve have managed to get the csm to bring up, and put dedicated resources on the job.this is also why the csm will continue to fail to gain the full support/trust of the playerbase. they were hobbled from the outset."
7/12/2010,"this is a disaster, i wouldn't expect actiblizz to act that foolish. we need a mother of all thrednaughts in gd.ccp said that they won't fix/improve anything relating to lowsec, faction warfare and 0.0 for next year and a half at least. nor will there be time to fix many minor bugs and issues nor for any improvements to ui.only thing to expect in next 18 months is minor tweaks to pi, and maybe something called ""combat expansion"" that if i understood correctly, isn't a major ui change but just improvements to combat notifications and stuff.everything that csm pointed out is a critical issue has been completely ignored by ccp or brushed off with ""not in next 18 months"".we need a mother of all trednaughts in gd and entire csm resigning unanimously. ok, dust is separate game (even though it has taken critical amount of resources form eve) and ccp invested a lot and will be ****ed if they don't get it out and recover at least some of money invested in it. they won't make money on it, console shooter market is oversaturated by aaa titles of big publishers that have marketing budgets higher then ccps yearly totals. but still, maybe ccp will sell enough boxes to recover some of money spent on it.but incarna is for us, the eve players, and no one really cared about it ever. it was a nice gimmick promised for distant future. does anyone understand how insane does ""nothing will be fixed or improved for at least next 18 months"" sond?csm was supposed to be voice of players to ccp, ccp completely ignored it, what are we left with? :("
7/12/2010,"dust, a game pc owners wont even be able to play - and walking in stations, something players stopped giving a **** about years ago - are both taking all the dev time away from the real game.thus leaving ccp with no dev time to put into real issues affecting here and now.unfortunately ccp have their heads up their asses on this one and i don't see this changing. they've effectively commited to abandoning eve for the next 1 1/2 to 2 years because they've got so much tied up with dust/incarna - that much was made clear in the minutes..they seem to think we can be won over with shinys - and to a degree, it is unfortunately true. dust is just a shiny we're not going to have access to, so they seem to have forgotten that we're not going to be too happy that all the devs are ****ing around with that instead.do ccp really think we want wis over fixing any one of the major issues they made vauge promises over in the csm? try fixing what the players raise as issues instead of giving us half assed mini games (which is all incarna will be for a long time)."
7/12/2010,"just for the sake of irony, i have lifted the following from the company page:(emphasis mine)"
7/12/2010,at least the development time spent on incarna didn't interfere with the normal development resources allocated to internet spaceships.
7/12/2010,2 things come to mind reading that. sounds like a jita scammer! or a used car salesman on the interweb selling a clunker!
7/12/2010,"yeah i'm really pleased that ccp flat-out lied to us about that.incarna as a low-resource bonus from wod development? sweet, nice thinking. good synergy there.incarna as a giant dev-guzzling resource hog that leaves the game mired in rotting pig-**** for 18 months? not so nice, you ****ing morons. what the **** were you thinking? you took a giant **** all over your core game, then lied to your customers about how much it cost. who's short-bus genius strategy was that?(1) **** over the veteran playerbase who run multiple accounts for a long time(2) in favour of new players who run one account for a few months(3) ...?(4) profit?"
7/12/2010,"this.... is really ****ing depressing.""speaking on behalf of ccp, nathan disagreed strongly with the claim that ccp isnt committed to excellence. he pointed out that ccp probably spends a bigger part of its income on development than most other large, established game companies. he stated that this is a clear sign of this commitment.""no... it really isn't. it's a sign that you do more development, not put more polish on that development.""it was mentioned by ccp that the data does not seem to support that polished quality sells better than new features.""indeed. unfortunately word of mouth sells even better - and they're running grave risks with that.""a specific low sec expansion is not on the 18 month plan""#fail. it doesn't even have to be ""focused on low sec""... there's a lot that can be done without making a whole goddamn expansion.""the csm suggested a dedicated polish team to be established, with players being informed as to what they intend to work on during each expansion. ccp <U+FFFD>s answer to that is that there will be no polish patrol team for the next 2-3 expansions even though players feel there should be.""#fail. this is what you need most, honestly.""ccp stated that fw is not a priority and no fw-related changes will be considered until after incarna and dust.""#fail. so many things that can be fixed, so little incentive to do it. just another ccp #failure.i am *so tempted* to offer to work on eve *for free* in my spare time. but i don't know that i want to work on a mmo that seems determined to wallow in pig **** until it dies a diseased husk. why is ccp so determined to fail?-lianged: formatting."
7/12/2010,"seconded. what's the ****ing point of the csm if ccp are just going to ignore everything thrown at them, deny anything's wrong, and bulldoze ahead with a gamebreaking (or in this case not even game-related) schedule anyway?"
7/12/2010,"the content of the meetings minutes is disappointing. ccp gave csm4 the same ""18 month"" time frame which means they added stuff in that ignored csm's stakeholder input or it was just a smoke screen in the first place. incarna taking dev resources is a new line, a definite departure from their earlier statements that no eve development resources were being diverted to it. there's a possible upside in that the incarna release will be that much better for it, but given post-apocrypha history and ccp's tone i'm not hopeful that's the case.on the minutes format: action points are an awesome addition to these things on a lot of levels (csm transparency, ccp accountability, adding content to the document itself)on the process: csm's stakeholder status is clearly in name only and least until dust and incarna are released. the next test of it will be if ccp actually includes them, their at that time 3+ year backlog, and their feedback on those releases properly once those major products have cleared the pipe. never the less, csm does provide some valuble services to the community, not in the least getting more dev blogs out about things important to us and being able to provide quality feedback of opportunity like pointing the devs to the fleet interface for lag reduction (csm4) and the 100k skillpoint reimbursement (csm5) among many other instances. and finally, i find it to continue to be funny that ccp knows it has a forum problem (in that it feels like it was made in the 1990's) but refuses to fix it. this is, of course, despite their quantity-of-excellence-dev-budget and the fact that there are several free forums that are unbelievably better than the current one."
7/12/2010,"hrm. the csm was made up of members who were, with one exception, quality representatives dedicated to their constituents and improving the game. hopefully recent events will allow the csm to refocus on getting **** done without impact from one member's personality disorder. because, honestly, we really, really need something like that now. ccp has steadily been harming the game over the last short while, from breaking fleet combat with dominion to churning out a slew of half-baked releases that are never touched again. they seem to, well, simply not get it.rational folks don't expect miracles from the csm, and we understand that you'll be shut down and handwaved away as long as ccp is determined to behave in such a manner. we accept that and won't fault you for it. but we do expect that you'll take the opportunity that ccp has given you and keep hammering into the breach until the csm really has enough heft to make sure that ccp understands that a ""commitment to excellence"" doesn't mean ""commitment to releasing lots of broken crap"". eve is currently running on the chinese industry model, and someone has to be there to point out that maybe cutting corners isn't worth it in the long run. the csm has their work cut out for 'em, and it may take this entire term plus several others, but something has to be done. best of luck to the csm, because they'll need it."
7/12/2010,"hooray! i am reading them right now. here are some things of interest (to me):this is disappointing because this is very little benefit over people putting together proposals and posting them into the ideas and features forum, other than forcing a response from ccp. of course i don't expect ccp to hand csm the ability to change anything at a whim - it's ccp's product - but at the same time it's very disappointing.this, however, would be really nice if the items in the backlog actually get development time. how often are items in the backlog worked on? if the backlog was made available, would it be possible to see which items are being actively developed? that would be really great.while i can see nathan's point here, i disagree. it isn't excellence when features are released buggy and fell unfinished, and then left to linger. i would rather have fewer features added each expansion and have the time spent on polish and maintenance. eve is a great game, but when you hear about features that have been broken and unfinished for years it's disheartening.this is great news to me, as i do low sec exploration quite a bit. even if there isn't a definite schedule for this kind of thing, knowing that they're already aware of the issue and intend on fixing it is a good thing.also excellent. to be honest, pi doesn't thrill me at all, but i do dabble and i'm hoping that it is improved upon. the dedicated resources are good as well, though i do wonder about priorities - why isn't there a dedicated fw resource or backlog resource, for example? i know pi will be linked to dust, but...yes, yes, yes. the eve dev blogs are one of my favorite things because it gives us a lot of great information about what is going on behind the scenes and they're almost always interesting.woohoo! go get 'em!and this helps low-sec become unique, interesting, and desirable how? knowing that there's no plans at all for low sec for over a year and a half is extremely disappointing to me. there is so much potential here, so many great ideas, low sec is a large part of eve territory-wise, and there's no interest?well, let's get crankin'. any information on how you guys would like to go about doing this, and how the community will be involved?"
7/12/2010,"did you miss the part where they said ""we're not fixing anything for the next 18 months minimum, and lowsec not for the nexrt 2-3 expansions"" ?"
7/12/2010,"this really irks me. there's a lot of problems with fw. fixing even some of the minor issues would be a huge boon. fw is a fantastic feature for all the reasons mentioned and i know that i had a heavy interest in fw (amarr victor, minmatards! ) - until i experienced how broken it was. this is the kind of thing that makes the player base question ccp's commitment to excellence.hell yes! i'm really looking forward to this one! the tech dev blogs are the best of them all - i always learn something.and i agree with them on this. i don't see why it would be worth their time to work on something that a very small minority of the player base would be using.yay! cheer! victory! looking forward to this!this is great, but i wasn't sure if this meant that roles were going to be revamped any time soon or what it may look like. can you provide more details? a new role system is something i have wanted for a long, long, long time and it would benefit every corporation in eve equally.eve is more than space ships though. it is the market, it is production, it is social networking, it is crime and punishment. space ships are a big part of eve, yes, but not the only part. it seems that ccp's big vision is a universe simulation game. someone has a bigger vision here and i think it's cool and has a lot of potential - if it is released and polished and not neglected.but i like tanking multiple torpedo batteries in my stealth bomber...also great.overall, i hope that ccp and nathan in particular don't feel like we're attacking them and trying to put them down. as players, we put a lot of time and effort into eve and we care about it. we just want it to be as best as it can be.thanks for the minutes!"
7/12/2010,"no, i didn't. i also didn't miss the part where ccp asked the csm to start putting something together now, implying that the proposal will get some attention once they have their current priorities finished. ccp wouldn't have asked the csm to do something if they weren't even mildly interested in the results:just because they don't have time now doesn't mean that we should just throw up our arms and give up - but perhaps i'm just not quite so focused on defeat and cynicism."
7/12/2010,"what an interesting response seeing as he had a very valid point....would you happen to be protecting something? like say a free trip to iceland? where you talk about a video game? maybe get access to some upcoming changes? pass along acquired information to your alliance mates? seems to me that he is isn't the one who is terrible; you would be the recipient of that designation in this discussion. or are you saying that you don't have access to information being a csm member that wouldn't benefit your alliance mates? after all, why would you have to sign an nda if you weren't exposed to sensitive information? it isn't like the csm members have a great track record for keeping their yaps shut and not abusing their position in some way shape or form.....in fact wasn't there a csm who just recently got kicked off for violating the nda?it will be nice once ccp gets rid of the csm garbage and brings something more interesting to the player base in its place."
7/12/2010,"it's funny that you are surprised that a csm member would respond in this fashion. if you care to browse the forums you'll see that this sort of response is pretty typical.it's a shame really but understandable - when you are in a position of trying to defend the indefensible, you resort to puerile insults and name calling. and as history in these forums shows, we are yet to see any members of the csm refrain from it as a last (though quite often first) resort.the sooner this farce is ended, the better for the player base."

7/12/2010,qed.you think that shouting 'conspiracy' and placing question marks next to my loyalty and motives based on that is a valid point?
7/12/2010,who knew it was a yes/no question.
7/12/2010,after reading the minutes it's clear the csm should resign in the most public way possible. ccp is quite honest in stating they do not care about anything but getting more shiny new content out the door which will be abandoned later in favour of more shine new content.
7/12/2010,"it is evident that sokratesz acts in an unprofessional manner, and thereby undermines the csm. this is widely recognized, as is demonstrated from his public scolding by the chair of the csm. so too, i suspect someone talked with him again. he has been conspicuously absent from certain forums after his willful ignoring of ccp's request for circumspection was pointed out. so i can well understand your suspicion that he is on the csm simply to collect insider information. yet perhaps we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater? other members of the csm are trying their best. only an adequate amount of time will tell whether ccp will ultimately take them seriously or not. this csm has just begun its work. let us give them a chance.we may be better served by demanding bad apples like sokratesz resign, and letting others with a more professional attitude continue to do their best by us all. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/12/2010,broken record.we get the message: you have major personal issues with soks. now can you stop spamming your hatemail across the whole of this forum? it's well past boring and repetitive now.
7/12/2010,sad to say that i got the same impression.
7/12/2010,you really are the gift that keeps on giving.
7/12/2010,"yes reliable, honest, law abiding people like your darling ankh... oh wait!"
7/12/2010,or python injecting gankers .... oh wait! btw - nice synergy with the corp name too helicity
7/12/2010,"hmm - lets see if an exercise in basic comprehension will make a difference to a certain csm member and his alt.if something is indefensible - there is no defence that can be offered. so of course by definition, any defence offered will by rights, fall on deaf ears as at the end of the day, it's all just nothing but smoke and mirrors. just offering a ""qed"" makes it painfully obvious that even the smoke and mirrors are failing to show that this particular house of cards fell down ages ago .and truly, we don't need to shout ""conspiracy"" or place question marks next to your ""loyalty and motives"" - you (and the others on the csm) do a good enough job doing that as it is. we just nudge you in the direction you were all naturally travelling along.not that in the end it matters - as the summit meeting minutes show - it's all an irrelevancy anyway."
7/12/2010,"go ahead and submit; we've got two weeks to get your official status sorted with ccp. plenty of time, amirite?"
7/12/2010,"how about submitting something that the player base actually wants, say like dismissing the csm entirely.after all it only garners a max 12.6% of interest from the player base.it doesn't actually improve anything in the game.a complete waste of resources.stating a problem without a solution isn't very beneficial, so here are some suggestions:1. replace csm with eve-tv. the number of viewers for the last tournament exceeded the voter turnout for the last csm. that in itself is goo enough justification to get rid of the csm.2. replace the csm by hiring a person to go through the forums and bring up valid suggestions for improvement. far more effective than the csm (the members of which who are only in the csm for the free trip to iceland and to get sensitive info to benefit their alliances) and most importantly, less costly.and if this doesn't strike the csm's fancy (which most likely won't) how about adding in an additional voting option for things such as eve-tv or abolish the csm on the ballot for the next election.oh and a pro-trip; stop trying to act like you are relevant in changing things. all this formality garbage is for nothing; no software production house takes its player base seriously for suggestions so you can drop the charade."
7/12/2010,you are not the player base.
7/12/2010,"qft.can i suggest that the csm add ""progress update on ccp deliverables"" as one of the standing agenda items for fortnightly meetings? why not make keeping ccp on their toes w.r.t. csm issues an obvious part of the official business of the csm?"
7/12/2010,stellar idea (see what i did thar?!). consider it done! *points to agenda*
7/12/2010,raw logs are now available on the eve wiki or as a text download.if you want a tl:dr then the voting results are on the csm databasethe wiki summary and pdf will be out later this week. i'm catching up on the missing minutes with trebor's help.
7/12/2010,"reading the raw logs, makes me wonder how anything gets done in a bureaucracy? the chairperson becomes an egomaniac, if they weren't before, and everyone else concentrates on their own agenda with little to no regard for others opinions or suggestions.just how raw are the raw logs as i'm fairly certain there was more ramblings edited out than left in. why not have two chat windows, one informal the other formal. that way the csm appears to be far more efficient and professional to the public.just an idea."
7/12/2010,"the raw logs are not edited for content to the point of not even being run through a spell checker. for formatting i remove the date from the timestamps as suggested by another player.the only time i remove content is when there is any nda information, but in the very rare times that happens i put in a comment such as ""removed due to nda"". no secret edits, just everything from start of meeting till it is closed.we could easily have private channel discussions but that wouldn't be very good for the transparency of the process. there is even a specific rule that while a meeting is in progress everything is posted in that channel."

7/13/2010,"one problem i see with lowsec is that it's so all-or-nothing compared to highsec. 0.5 system is basically safe, 0.4 is totally unsafe. this leads carebears to only ever deal in highsec, as the next danger level of 0.4 is totally unsafe, full of -10 pirates.is there a need for a more gradual drop-off? how about in 0.4 concord turns up 50% of the time when you pirate, but you're allowed to escape if you can? (0.3 20%, 0.2 5%, 0.1 concord ain't there -- or something like that.)that might encourage carebears to accept the occasional lowsec mission if it's in 0.4, or maybe pick up some goods from 0.3, rather than lowsec just not existing to them. plus pirates would actually have to deal with real cops turning up sometimes, not just gate guns.</2c>"

7/13/2010,"the item of these three that i would address most directly is that space seems crowded. i think the best way to address that is to add many more solarsystems (e.g., 20 k new solarsystems), rather than to increase the average solarsystem-to-solarsystem route length (which presumably would not change the universal average solarsystem population).how about this as a middle ground?: substantially increase the length of high-sec routes between the major hubs, ensuring that there are much shorter (e.g., 5<U+FFFD> shorter) low-sec routes between the same hubs."
7/13/2010,"imho that won't help. as long as there is a highsec route, there will be autopilot freighters (some perhaps even augmented with warp-to-zero autopilot external programs).mdd"
7/13/2010,"as someone who is relatively new, i find this idea really good.but surely this has been suggested 100000 times over already?"
7/13/2010,i've been championing this exact idea every now and again over the years. (i think i might even have a post somewhere in the assembly forum about it)never gotten much traction unfortunately...the above being my main goal for making the change.i don't see the need for this however.it would simply get annoying.
7/13/2010,"sounds like a good idea, but if your just wishing for a way to get more pirate kills probably not gonna happen. people will use jump freighters instead and not have to risk their precious cargo."
7/13/2010,"i don't recall specifically where or when but dr. econ. says he wants central bank, racial currency, and few other absurd things."
7/13/2010,should probably be moved to assembly hall..i support this though but only if there are multiple lo-sec paths between each region. otherwise you just end up with 50 rancers.should be a high level of risk to travel between sectors but not guaranteed suicide.need to be careful about balancing though to avoid a mass exoidus of pilots back to their home regions.
7/13/2010,"yes, most are available only in their space, but not all. why not take it the whole way, only bpos available for that race available in that empire's space. not to mention this would effect skills the most.i mean right now i looked up amarr cruiser in forge and it's for sale in state war academy.. now this might be acceptable since amarr and caldari are allies, but why is gallente cruiser available at the same locations :)"
7/13/2010,sounds like a nightmare if you live in nullsec... what currency would you use? would a corp wallet need 4 wallets for each currency? sounds like a mess.
7/13/2010,"because gallente cruisers are the best back on the subject though... as far as most skills go, it's already rough enough starting out in eve just trying to figure everything out. much less making some poor noob fly 40 jumps just to pick up energy management from some amarr station who will probably end up going through lowsec because he doesn't know any better.now as far as racial ships, yes i can agree that they should be separated just like the racial ship bpos currently are."
7/13/2010,"more isk for my trade alts, more killmails from lowsec for my pvp alt.... hhhhmmm, sounds good to me."
7/13/2010,"to get around this you could have 3 currencies: amarr/caldari, gallente/minimatar, and then something sponsored by concord/ded. the empires pay for what happens in their hi/low sec space, and concord/ded pays for what happens in 0.0 (and maybe the x/10 rated complexes in hisec?). it'd be pretty easy to do some sort of rp explanation via some big schism that builds up over about two months before a patch. with the reduced cooperation and monetary support from the empires, concord would have to consolidate it's patrols, giving rise to increased low sec areas between the empires.all that being said though, i would like to see some more reasons for people to spread out, although i'm worried that tweaking drop rates like you suggested might give people too much of an incentive to stay in hisec, which goes contrary to ccp trying to get more people into low/null."
7/13/2010,we're becoming more civilized not less. system security ought to be going up and not down to reflect this. possibly some of the pipes could be determined by faction warfare i've always though system security ought to be unstable but just to go backwards while the game is going forward only makes sense from a profits point of view for traders. makes no sense from any other viewpoint.
7/13/2010,"huh? this makes absolutely no sense. four empires supposedly at peace with each other would make damned sure routes were clear and safe. you don't need any change to make a pitch for different currencies. trouble is, if it did happen, you'd have every wannabe forex trader screwing things up in classic eve fashion. anyway, ain't gonna happen. too messy. not needed at all.and there's the nub. you want to buff what is already the most most lucrative career in the game. ain't gonna happen.jita is the trade capital. caldari is the most popular race. your proposals would not change that one whit. this is the least rp conscious game i've yet to see, and traders are the least interested in rp. besides, nothing you proposed would do anything towards creating racial flavours.lowsec is a wasteland. it needs something radical, not tinkering with tarmac."
7/13/2010,i love the idea for lowsec border zones between empires.it would simultaneously stimulate low sec activity and create a more interesting global market.
7/13/2010,"agreed. and i believe i know why: it's too predictable. ""what?!!"" you exclaim. hear me out.those bent on ""involuntary pvp"" (a/k/a ""pirates"") *know* that concord will not get involved in lowsec. they *know* the damage they will get from gate & station guns. they *know* how much of a security status hit they will take (and how log they will have to rat to undo the damage, should they so choose).those who'd rather obliterate computer-controlled pixels (a/k/a ""carebears"") *know* that in lowsec they are up against *both* the pirates *and* the npcs. they *know* that a ship fitted for best performance against npcs would be handicapped versus a pirate, and a ship fitted for best performance against pirates would be underwhelming versus npcs.and guess what: very similar ""rules"" apply in highsec, too. the pirates know how long concord takes to respond, and they work out where they can gank successfully (hello, hulkageddon!). carebears cry that this is unfair and that pirates should be denied insurance for such attacks.and finally, ccp bemoans the distribution of characters, with gobs in highsec, somewhat lesser numbers in 0.0, and lowsec being a ghost town.clue stick time: make the transition from highsec to lowsec less clearly defined. i propose that concord's response *probability* and *time* be functions of:1. system security. concord responds faster in higher security systems than in lower security systems (no change). the probability that concord responds *at all* is also partially a function of system security.2. difference between aggressor and ""victim's"" security status. concord's likelihood of responding is higher when the -10.0 pirate attacks the 5.0 carebear than it is when the 0.0 pirate attacks the 2.5 mission runner. and when the 1.0 carebear chooses to aggress the character-with-a-lower-secstatus? heh. result: lower highsec systems are a bit more dangerous. higher lowsec systems are a bit less dangerous. high sec status carebears can wander into higher lowsec with some confidence that *maybe* concord will come to their rescue. or maybe not. pirates can polish their sec status and then prowl the lower highsec systems looking for the next big target, knowing that they get more useful time engaging, and might get away scott-free.overall, make concord's security status effects more of a continuum instead of the dichotomy they are now.mdd"
7/13/2010,"eve has 42-43k concurrent as any one time, at least when ever i log in. bloated numbers from a tournement weekend does not equate to a new all time high active subs, its jus a benchmark on server resources.and space would be less crowded if ccp would off its ass and balance out mission hubs instead of moving the player one jump out. spread out the level 4 agents, even more market hubs could spring up. there are many systems with out even a station, sometimes you get a chain of systems before hitting another station and some stations only have multiple level 1/2 or even have no agents at all (and this isn't ded). caldari have loads of combat agents from many different npc corps, which is why its so popular while gallente have maybe 2 decent corps to run."
7/13/2010,"the creation of lowsec borders between empires is a good idea. multiple currencies, not so good (just far too complicated). it wouldn't just act as a buff to bold traders compared to aping freighter pilots, but would go a long way to fixing lowsec's problems.+1"
7/13/2010,"i agree. it is totally predictable. what you propose would make it a bit more of a lottery for both sides, which is good. but i seriously doubt it would have a radical impact on lowsec population. so here's an alternative - do away with low sec totally. move some to high sec and some to null sec, and have done with it."
7/13/2010,agreed. low-sec between empires is a great idea. different currencies not so great.
7/13/2010,"+1 supports this idea, we might aswell get something usefull out of lowsec."
7/13/2010,"actually, just make highsec smaller. lowsec serves a valuable purpose, and is a different environment to null or highsec. eve does not need more safe space.in terms of shipping things around, it's very easy to avoid gatecamps and station camps, if you know how to and prepare adequately (read blockade runners, insta-undock bookmarks and maybe a scout), because there are no bubbles. in short, if you have balls and brains you can safely navigate through lowsec space and therefore profit. if highsec hubs were fully separated by lowsec space, and the number of low-high security border systems increased, you would find that the number of chokepoint systems would diminish because of the ""porous"" border. think of the brazilian police trying to stop drug runners in the amazon rainforest :)"
7/13/2010,"the lowsec borders sound like an awesome idea!currencies not so much, too complicated, as stated above multiple times."
7/13/2010,"i would support this on one condition. cyno works in highsec for jump freighters only.that way those that invest and are more then two accounts can haul large quantities of goods without having to take a freighter trough lowsec.that or give freighters low slots for warp stabs. a huge downside of the lowsec borders between empires would be that eventually people will migrate to a single faction, and do everything there (mission/mine) and those are most of the players, resulting in super busy caldari space and near empty amarr, galente and minmatar space. segregation isn't the best idea.i don't see how this would benefit anyone but lowsec pirates. but i do think the idea in itself is cool. if this were to happen, a few other changes would need to be done to balance it a bit in the freighter department."
7/13/2010,"if someone takes the time and money to invest in a jump freighter, they deserve to profit from its use. as to your original point, i am not a pirate so i wouldn't be out to get more 'pirate kills.' i am, however, training for transport ships .ultimately, the point i'm trying to make is that eve is big enough now to support four mostly independent population focal points (in empire space) instead of having everyone crowded around a string of centralized systems and a few scattered mission hubs. the incentive to travel through lowsec to connect trade routes will stimulate population out there, too, which would only exponentially increase with the planned public missions that they spoke about.@varo: well i just plain disagree with your viewpoint. as far as the multiple racial currencies piece, that was not the focal point of my suggestion and was more of a throw-away off the cuff suggestion.as far as your comment about 'buffing' the most lucrative career in eve; if you are talking about 'trade' you are painting with too broad of a brush. you've got to separate 'station trader' from 'interregional trader' or 'interracial trader' and certainly the latter two are not even close to as lucrative as the former, or to other career fields such as mission running, ratting, etc.i agree that station trading is the most bang for the buck, but my suggestion wouldn't really change station trading, would it?aub"
7/13/2010,"hmmm no. what you're saying is ""i want to ignore this cool new lowsec barrier in complete safety, while everyone poorer slogs through in hulltanked badgers""space would become homogenised, as it is at present, because the lure of empty, say, amarr space, and sky-high prices for corresponding faction items due to a lack of supply, would pull in a lot of people. industry and the market would follow this influx accordingly."
7/13/2010,it could be also a new role for the faction warfare : protect the borders and secure trade highways. there lots of thing that could be made with that.
7/13/2010,it makes no sense for the empires not to secure their interconnecting routes. they would loose profits and it would also be unwise diplomaticly.

7/13/2010,"fully support this thread. it could be the boost needed for the low-sec.pirats were to sit in sea and wait for other boats travelling by their area to make money by market use. this happened when the sea doesn't have ""secure"" area and travelling was quiet dangerous. by now you have the opportunity to make the same with planes and have more security for cargo. safe road is the empire connection between trade hub. if these roads will be cut, this will bring back piracy in line with other carriers and give lowsec better activity, for market, pvp, exploration, etc.plz ccp just do it !"

7/13/2010,soz.. reading the thread you and torn were the posts that made sense :) corrected it^^
7/13/2010,"let me start by stating: i hate low sec. having said that, i find this idea very interesting.let me comment on some statements.let me remind you of the empyrian age. which brings me to ...i agree on that ""least rp consious game(r)"" part. nonetheless, games changes based on the official back story still make more sense than all of a sudden, out of the blue ""wtf? planets?"" kinda changes.can't be more complicated than pi or wis. and it would add another money sink (""exchange fee/rate"") and even provide the chance to add an additional skill (another money sink) for lowering the rate/fee.i also agree that this thread would be better in assembly hall. the op might consider reporting his own thread and ask for having it moved to assembly hall."
7/13/2010,"it is a false asumption that the four empires would only benefit from ""secure trade"" in times of peace. actually the (cold)war is indeed one of the thriving factors that does generate the profits for them."
7/13/2010,"i also like mdd's suggestion - but they need not be exclusive.you could improve lowsec generally as stated by mdd, and further add lowsec paths between the various empires.as for incentives to ""risk"" goign through lowsec - simply create market rules and/or scarcity of goods between the races that aren't getting along. for example - gallente ships cannot be sold on the market in caldari space, or vice verse. i even think the currencies would be interesting, if not overly complex, with taxes on currency exchanges, etc.after pew-pew, eve's market is its best resource. no other mmo has as complex or rich a market. this would be a nice addition that would provide additional opportunities for hauling as a mini-profession. it might also develop some interesting citizen-police forces for those low-sec pathways ..."
7/13/2010,"it would make ""rp"" sense to have boycotts on gallente anything in caldari space, but that would also kill markets. which might not be bad, but it's reducing marketing/manufacturing areas for profit.i'd rather see..... you can't build anything gallente in caldari space stations (but you can at poses) and you can sell them in caldari space.this would mean..1) you have to travel to gallente space to pick up the bpo, or buy the overpriced bpo from jita.2) you have to build in gallente space and haul, or deploy a pos in caldari space and build at the (currently 1.1 waste multiplier) ship assembly arrays.3) buy ships from gallente space which sell cheaper because of cheaper build costs, haul them to jita.all the while taking the risk of transporting either ships or bpos across low-secs.if you want to build non-local racial stuff you have to do it from a pos. i could definitely support that."
7/13/2010,"i'm not convinced that driving people towards poses is a good thing. for starters, poses are corporate assets, not personal assets. the roles interface is already a mess; imagine how much worse (eve) life will be when you push more people to have to deal with it. actually, i think you (sencnes) owe a fine for even suggesting such an idea. (pay chribba; he'll see that it is properly disbursed to a worthy charity.) but i get what you're trying to do (introduce more racial effects into the markets), and agree that appears to be a worthy goal.but, i believe that the npc seeding of racial items should be addressed. and from a programmatic point of view, it seems like a trivial change for ccp. it has the added effect of stimulating more player-run economies (skillbook & blueprint trading).alternative to pos bonusing: have station assembly lines provide some bonus/penalty assessed because of the npc's standing to the race. so, for example, carthum conglomerate's assembly lines would provide some build bonus (time? resource efficiency?) for amarr blueprints, neutral for caldari blueprints, and penalize for gallente and minmatar blueprints. has the same effect of making building stuff in its racial home better, without the unwanted effect of pushing people to poses.mdd(edit: correct spelling of sencnes' name. sorry 'bout that. also added alternative idea to pos bonusing.)"
7/13/2010,"i doubt we'll ever see such a report even if we requested it, but i'd be interested to know how many non-caldari things are built in station slots in caldari space. and i agree pos pushing is not a good idea, it would place demand on pos fuel and cost more to run my poses :) so i would refine my statement to...have it cost 1.1 material multiplier for all t1 and t2, non-local racial items being built in stations. make sure if you build say a thorax in caldari space at a station it's 1.1x, and at a pos it costs 1.1 too (at the moment it's only 1) and adjust local racial t2 ships to have a 1 multiplier at poses. this means it'll be cheaper to build t2 ships in that empire's space, at station and at pos, and everything non-empire costs 10% more to build.create some real need for haulers to go from empire to empire picking up local manufactured t1 and t2 items for sales in other regions. taking the homogenization out of eve again.edit - after you're second edit my post is redundant but i like the way we think either a bonus for racial, or a penalty for non-racial items in each empires space is something worthy of a csm topic."
7/13/2010,"as a middle ground between ""can't build other race ships in stations - use pos"" and ""build where you like"" you could restrict building to the racial stations in the foreign empires.taken the gallente ship from the example: you can build it anywhere in gallente empire (or anywhere in gallente + minmatar empire) or in gallente (+ minmatar) stations*) in any of the other empires.not sure though, if the distribution of those stations would allow for this.*) ""stations"" as in ""stations controlled by a npc corporation aligned with gallente empire"""
7/13/2010,i wonder how many iterations it would require to get to this little lot to a non-****ed state.
7/13/2010,"umm.... because i'm a nerd. i agree. four distinct currencies would be a pain to keep track of. would the nerds like any of us like it? maybe. probably. would the mainstream computer gamer like it? hassle = no. if this type of system was implemented, i would advocate for no designated currency in null-sec. lawless space would most likely recognize the factional currency with the most purchasing power at the time, however it needn't be so. large alliances could say 'we only take tritanium' and in effect you would trade trit at their stations in exchange for goods/services.as for getting rid of the hi-sec highways, sure. i'd support that. i agree that it would probably achieve the op's goal of lowering the 'crowds' in some areas."
7/13/2010,"i think the op has a good idea... it would add excitement and challenges...it could create an incentive for more group play in trading if there were lucractive arbitrage profits where a corp controling a couple low sec systems could escort a jump freigter to cynos on both sides. perhaps the trader would be in corp or perhaps escort corps could build enough trust and repuation to charge tolls for safe passage.a suggestion though: i think that a few more low sec systems or links should be put in so systems like rancid or amake wouldn't be quite as much linchpins to travel. a few low sec systems parallel to them would allow a little more cat and mouse and make counter ganks on pirate gangs (or between pirate gangs) a bit more feasible without as many jakals concentraded in one system to warp in on others figts. (not a bad thing, just that it can get out of hand and a little tweeaking would help if things got too concentrated)"
7/13/2010,"a couple thoughts:i like the single consistent currency of isk, for use by concord. however, i can see a value in having a sort of empire / corporation specific currency for specialized items. perhaps the easiest way to implement this, would be to make lp a marketable item (sort of like tags). this could be coupled by expanding the lp shop, and adding more ways to acquire lp than just mission grinding.i'm not really sold on why anyone feels empire freighters need to be forced through low-sec. in my opinion, the whole concord system is a bit broken atm: you go from a guaranteed concord death to guaranteed concord leaving you alone at a clearly defined cutoff that divides piracy acts into very limited risk to the pirate, to guaranteed suicide. you feel empire ""carebears"" have it too easy: imo the problem is that piracy is entirely too easy, but then shuffled off under the rug where only a tiny % of the player base bothers with.i'd do this instead: make it really random in .5 - .7 systems how long it takes till concord shows up: essentially, it should be possible to gank someone and flee the scene before the cops show up, taking a smaller security hit and no concordokkan. possible, but not guaranteed. sometimes concord might show up within seconds, and bust the freighter gank. concord should also police the remains of any ship blown up: frankly scooping loot with a hauler alt right in front of the cops is terrible pvp design."
7/13/2010,"really? what purpose is that? which major section of the eve population benefits from low sec? you need neither balls nor brains. you need a frigate or a br. singing ""u can't touch this"" is optional.anyone with a modicum of sense knows not to take a floating brick through hagilur when the weekend weenies are out."
7/13/2010,"i remember reading somewhere someone suggesting that instead of concord being overzealous cops, they need to be peace loving hippies full of passive aggressive attributes. where concord didn't show to blow you to pieces but they showed up to rescue the ship under attack.it when something like this.. there should always be a chance for you to kill someone anywhere any time. however the higher the sec the more ""hippies"" show up to remote repair the ship under attack.attacking concord gets the local navy to attack you, but if you're setup right and can tank the navy you can kill the navy and the hippy concord, and then the target. but you have to be fast because the local navy spawns every minute or so, and concord hippies spawn every 45 seconds or something. if you choose to gank a freighter in a 1.0 system, you're going to have to come at it with more a lot of fire power, because the hippies have uber repairing abilities, all three to, remote hull, remote armor, remote shield.the idea was a something about removing sec-status but i can't be bothered to find it. old idea i've always thought might be fun on sisi but i don't think it'll work in eve. people will die all over the place without wardecs because you have 50 battleships camping jita killing everything that undocks even if it's empty."
7/13/2010,"done. if it does get moved, i hope that those of you who support the idea will continue to follow the discussion at assembly hall. perhaps we can get one of the csm on board. aub"
7/13/2010,"of course you do. :) consider this. caldari and amarr are allies. minmatar and gallente are allies. each faction has more than one region. it makes zero sense to have low sec borders between regions belonging to the same faction; and low sec borders between either amarr and caldari or minmatar and gallente. if you really want to play the rp card, think it through.a major change warrants more analysis and thought than an off the cuff suggestion. ditch it. it doesn't belong here.yes i am painting a broad brush. that's all that's needed right now. buff mining before you even start to think about buffing trading or pirating."
7/13/2010,"i had suggested something like this awhile back, the difference being that there could be a rolling ""security tide"" where security status would fluctuate predictably through the week. so on some days the empires would be surrounded by only lowsec, other days various combinations would be connected, and on others it would be as it is now.other possibilities would be utilizing fleet warfare to effect change in security status in some way.though i would certainly support a permanent lowsec around all empires as well."
7/13/2010,moved by request to the assembly hall from market discussions. if you support it please be sure to reply again with a thumbs up!
7/13/2010,"i like the mandatory lowsec to go to different regions, as long as (1) there are multiple ways to do it so that its not just a guaranteed gate camp/gank and (2) there are sufficient economic incentives to bother - i.e. disparate seed rates for highly used items (supply imbalances), possible restrictions on market listings in each region, etc. as long as every route isn't gatecamped and simply an insta-gank, it would provide economic incentive for haulers/traders to venture into lowsec (to get/deliver cheaper goods).i also like the idea of putting some ""risk"" into ganking people in lowsec by having some kind of chance of a concord response that is variable.a big part of the problem with lowsec is the perception that if you go, you better be in a fast covop or equivalent, or you better have friends, because you will get in a fight. this could change that and cause a group of 5 to think hard before jumping a solo frig trying to pass through - is it worth possibly losing all 5 ships for that one little frig?"
7/13/2010,"obviously, i support this idea. i certainly hope anyone else will take the time to read through the posts and continue the discussion. although i like the 'idea' of the racial currencies, if possible i'd like to drop that topic as it is not directly related to the main thrust of this post.csm reps, please take note! let's have this brought up aub"
7/13/2010,"this would never happen, but i do like the idea.one problem with the idea though, you might have people just moving over to one empire and then everybody does their missions there. right now this would pretty much be caldari space.so you could see everyone from the other empires move over to caldari space and the other three empires go bone dry.to the pirates that whine about no targets in low-sec, it might have something to do with insta-popping with 15 bs vs 1 cruiser, and scrambling once 3 bs show up to counter 15 bs. lay off the targets and just siphon off their profits when you catch them. if you make it unprofitable for them to be in low-sec, they won't go there anymore. simple."
7/13/2010,voting against the proposal for reasons allready stated within the thread.
7/13/2010,"first:lowsec is an extremely viable casual pvp environment that faction warfare and pirates benefit from. explorers go there. pos are set up there due to their proximity to empire. it is a good place for people to experience a life outside highsec without the drag of bubbles (pun intended) which poses a tougher challenge. i could go on, but it is safe to say a large portion of eve players live there.second:my definitions of balls and brains are relative to the majority of eve players i didn't mean ""navigate from gate to gate"". i meant ""move around in"". even so, if you believe you are perfectly safe going through lowsec in a br or frig you are mistaken. it's just safer. i'd say covops frigs are 99% untouchable, however."
7/13/2010,"i do not support this at all.it would buff the most lucrative profession in eve - trading. there's no call for that.as far as low sec is concerned, tinkering with the tarmac is pointless. the whole concept needs a radical overhaul, and this isn't it.it makes zero sense from a role play angle when you consider carefully the social context.you make some valid points. however, i disagree with your claim that a large portion of eve players live there. no, i haven't taken a census; have you? but all the whines about low sec being empty/unprofitable don't support your claim.nowhere is totally safe, not even high sec. but you have to be incredibly stupid or incredibly unlucky to get ganked passing through."
7/13/2010,"just chiming in with a thumbs up for a gradient of concord responses, multi-route low-sec borders. thumbs down for multiple currencies."
7/13/2010,"not supported, and it make zero sense from an rp point of view. you are telling me that some of what would be the most heavily fortified borders in the eve universe are somehow going to be less secure? that pirates are going to have a field day in the same area where heavily armed navies would logically congregate to protect their territory?makes absolutely no sense."
7/13/2010,just putting in my thumbs up since it got moved.- love the idea of lowsec only routes - and i'm a trader/hauler not a pirate.- think currencies is a tad silly and not something eve is ready for.
7/13/2010,"look, this argument that it makes no sense from an rp point of view is simply wrong. ""heavily fortified borders"" even if true does not necessarily equate to ""heavily policed borders."" in addition, who is to say they are heavily fortified? you don't just build a fence in space.i can point to real world examples, to the extent they are relevant, to support my position. take, for example, the united states border with mexico. the two countries are friendly, if not necessarily allied. yet the u.s.-mexican border is a lawless zone of terror, murder, kidnapping, drug smuggling, human trafficking, and gang and cartel warfare.there are other examples in the real world. think of the frontier time in u.s. history a/k/a the ""wild west."" there are many other examples but for brevity's sake i'll let someone else point them out. it only makes sense that states will focus their limited resources devoted to policing to secure the hearts of population and commerce, and that the fringe territories will be neglected.so this whole notion that concord, which is a police force, is going to focus its efforts on far-away solar systems that are not very heavily travelled is simply wrong.aub"
7/13/2010,"this would be a great change to the game as it matures. it would help spread the population out and it would give life to the lowsec border zones. fantastic, thumbs up!"
7/13/2010,sounds like fun.except the currency part.
7/13/2010,"i agree, there needs to be some form of separate of the empires. it's silly to think i can fly between amarr and rens and not have to go though low-sec combat zones.however, it does make sense to be able to fly from amarr to jita for example since caldari and amarr are allies.for that matter, you could probably get away with very few high-sec links from amarr to gallente space since they are not exactly enemies but not friends either. same goes for caldari and minmatar space.this would make it possible to travel from rens to amarr in high-sec but you need to go though caldari space."
7/13/2010,"no.you now simply place the lion's share of trader-generaated wealth in the hands of people who have jump freighters, and you isolate a lot of players in a single empire. now that there is no safe way of moving between empires, there exists no compelling reason for those players to do so - there is, besides the belt npcs, available mission agents and occasional standings issues, very little actual difference between different areas of hi-sec, and in making it harder to get between them you take away the already very small number of reasons for people who don't like low-sec to ever move between them. i realise that this will only inspire some people to comment on how the relevant people should learn to like low-sec, but you and i both know that's unconstructive and it's not going to happen anyway."
7/13/2010,"ccp please take a look on hybrid weapon.lasers have incredible flexibility in delivering maximum (eft) dps.artillery has incredible alfa. acs have good range with falloff, good tracking, small pg requirements. projectiles have selective damage type and are cap stable.rails have slow tracking, low dps. blasters have good paper dps with ridiculous range that makes dps like theoretical numbers. hybrids consume cap (it is strange for active tanking ships? )so where is a special feature that should attract to learn hybrid weapon?p.s. do not mention rokh range advantage. all caldari ships have optimal bonus for hybrids. gallente do not."

7/13/2010,they must eat their own dogfood. supported.
7/13/2010,i agree completely. devs not playing their own game is a recurring problem across many mmo's i have played.
7/13/2010,"strongly supported.i always wondered if it'd be possible to embed devs with large alliances. have them actually play along and be shown where the problems are but be monitored, regulated and known to be devs."
7/13/2010,i would finally stop losing my time arguing with them ffs. supported caps makes me look cool
7/13/2010,word
7/13/2010,so your idea is to somehow force the devs to play the game in a mistery time frame between their family time and their work time ? like on the time they spent to get from their family to the work ?
7/13/2010,"hey you csm's. i have a serious in-game gripe: why can't i un-anchor somebody else's pos? to date i have found 2 pos towers that had no forcefield bubble or any other defenses. my attempts to un-anchor was disallowed. no such option. kaput!is it truly fair that i cannot un-anchor a pos that some other corp left without fuel and undefended? it's a mobile structure after all! i'd be 600 million wealthier or at least have 2 additional towers, but noooooo. it was launched for this corp and i can't just come along and steal it! that'd be like - piracy. shucks, i kind of wonder what ccp was thinking."
7/13/2010,"it is a source of continued, albeit mild, annoyance to me that i can't tidy the local system of the offline, abandoned faction towers dead corps have left behind them without paying to wardec them and thus, blowing these multi-million items up, rather than stealing them for profit.let's expand on the proposal:how do we handle the mechanics of 'hostile' unanchoring? let's create a anchoring disruption unit [adu]: an anchorable module (2500m3, cost circa 100mill) which disrupts the control codes in an anchored and offline structure, causing it to begin its unanchoring cycleadus take 60 minutes to anchor/unanchor, 2 minutes to online.once online they project a field around them, affecting every anchored and offline pos tower within 10km. adu field takes 24 hours from the point it goes online to complete an over-ride of the pos anchoring sub-routines.the affected tower will send a notification to the owning corporation.the owning pilot/corporation of the adu gains an aggression flag to the owning pilots/corporations of any affected structures.adus become vulnerable to attack once they are online.adus can be deployed in any space where objects can be anchored.[list][*]adu requires hacking v and anchoring v to anchor (may as well get some more use out of anchoring v beyond t2 large bubbles and being the gateway to pos gunnery)pros: space garbage collector becomes viable. offline space junk can be recycled.cons: too easy?too complicated to implement?cost of adu means small non-faction towers still non-proit operation.thoughts?edited to take account of suggestions so far."
7/13/2010,"no.this is a terrible idea.why should someone who say... can't play the game for a week lose their hard-earned investments this way because their pos went offline? the mechanic, as annoying as it seems sometimes, works this way for a reason.if you really want those pos mods or the spot, you'll have to wardec them and get out your guns just like the rest of us.not supported."
7/13/2010,"how would this be different than if your pos went offline because you weren't there for a week and you got wardecced in that time and it was exploded? you still lost your hard-earned investment, it just got blown up instead of stolen. or is your contention here that this would make a pos too vulnerable to theft by smaller operators who would not normally be able to muster a large fleet to explode it?"
7/13/2010,"sounds reasonable.hacking unit (adu thingy) requires hacking v and has volume 2500 m3, costs around 100 mill with somewhere in the region of 100k ehp.you anchor it next to an offline tower (trying to hack an online tower obviously doesn't work) and activate it on the offline tower. a mail is sent to the pos owner stating that their pos is being hacked. the owner (or any random passer-by) has 24 hours to blow up the hacking unit / adu jobby (100k ehp, so a couple of minutes of bs fire, but not one-volley-able), or he can just refuel the pos and online it, raising the force field, which immediately halts the 24 hour hacking cycle. this means that a pos owner will know that his offline pos is being hacked and will easily be able to prevent it, if he chooses. this ensures that only truly abandoned towers are vulnerable to being hacked and stolen.if the 24 hour cycle completes, then anyone is free to unanchor the tower. if you wander across someone else's hacking unit just as it completes its 24-hour cycle on a third party's pos, well, lucky you!"
7/13/2010,"i support this. if someone can steal an 80billion ship that was stupidly left unmanned inside of the forcefield of a fully functional pos that someone just blew up, then someone should be able to steal a 100-600million non-functional structure that was stupidly left un-fueled or turned-off.it makes perfect sense to me. its like how if you don't password lock your cans, someone can just come along and take it (or they should be able to)."
7/13/2010,"supported with the following conditions. 1) the structure's status must be offline (not anchoring, unanchoring, etc)2) hacking requires an anchorable structure (someone mentioned this earlier and it's a good idea)if your entire corp let it run out of fuel then it's your own damned fault.keep in mind, a pos is a corporate asset, not an individual one. the argument that someone would lose their hard earned asset because they couldn't play for a week is hogwash. if you're in a corp all by yourself, either learn to plan ahead, or get some friends to join your corp and share the responsibility."
7/13/2010,"agreed, a good idea.soon wh space is just gonna be full of offlined towers, as i see many on my travels.the only problem with a 24hr timer though, is its a problem for whs as they tend to close quicker than 24hrs, and its hardly worth sticking around for 24hrs, just to get that tower."
7/13/2010,i support this idea.would be cool to be able to use the hacking module or the decoder as well on a pos that has shields up to be able to steal 1 goodie in the hanger or something.even be able to hack secure containers left around.either way - i like the idea.
7/13/2010,"this could be done, but a few balances would be needed.named gripe (genuine reutilization of inactive pos entities) xdanchored towers only (obviously)4h anchoring time64h (2d, 16h) online time in which it can be attackedpos cannot be onlined while the gripe is onlining/onlineall modules have to be removed (kaboom'd or stolen) before the tower itself starts to unanchormodules take their normal unanchor time, and are automatically queued and unanchored one by onemy two cents. hope ye like the name."
7/13/2010,"an intersting proposal. i would support this on the condition that the mechanics take into account the cumulative unanchoring times of the modules anchored at the pos and applies a multiplier. for example it takes about 5~6 hours to unanchor all structures at my medium production tower, it would be ass backwards if someone can do all that work in an hour or less, and would lead to exploits such as using an alt to disrupt the anchored state, and saving your self hours of work. the mechanic should really be tooled in such a way that it is more geared to cleaning up place holder towers instead of being a griefing tool against somebody who's pos ran out of fuel for 2 hours.remember, your looking to steal something that takes quite a bit of work and time to setup, why shouldn't you have to put some in aswell?"
7/13/2010,"you know what, game machnics and game balancing presenting players with totally counter intuitive situations are bad and should be avoided as far as possible. also, plan ahead. if you dont, you pay the price and learn to accept the consequences. it s simple, we already do it in real life.here are a few gripes i have with immersion breaking game balancing and mechanics:1. thread topic. unhindered scooping of abandoned poss - all their modules, hangars and towers. running out of fuel and going offline should render the tower and all associated pos modules unanchored.2. tractoring of other players containers and even ships. introduce a range of tractor beams with varying strengt and even allow for tractoring of player pods and ships. obviously, the strength of the tractor beam should determine the mass it could move. fit a bigger tractor on a smaller ship and trying to tractor an object with greater mass than your own ship would result in you being pulled towards the heaviner object. if you ar the heavier object, the lighter object will be pulled towards you. simple and straightforward enough.3. being able to board a ship even if its being targetted by another ship. wtf ccp!?!?!4. eject pod during warp!5. undock in pod if theres no other ship in hangars."
7/13/2010,if a pos remains unfueled for 24 hours then it should be unanchorable
7/13/2010,no.i know it's a nice idea and i can understand the issue.but that also means all fittings that are outside a forcefield anchored can be stolen.lot of people just anchore the batteries and will online them when needed.and if tower is blown away the owner still lost the pos but also the thief get nothing.well maybe the bill for ammo :)so at this point i would say no. maybe change if it will be worked out more.
7/13/2010,"this is true. but i feel you could work around this by stipulating that either the gripe/adu/whatever only effects pos towers.and yes, in response, i should go back and bold the anchored and offline part of my original reply. funny how sometimes, its someone else's proposal that inspires you in a few dull moments when you should be working, isn't it?"
7/13/2010,no fuel for 3 months = unanchorable by anyone.really the only fair solution i think.
7/13/2010,i would want the following.30 days unfueled.you have to declare waryou have to attack the pos to the point where structure is no more then 50% this would destabilize the structurethen you can unanchored it and have to repair it.

7/13/2010,"i guess that seals the deal, you haven't a clue."
7/13/2010,"lrat does not have ""heavy pg needs""an lrat has far less pg than most bs sized guns/launchers.this means you can take any solo armor repped bs , remove a gun and fit a lratin the process you will probably gain a large amount of free grid.try the same process on a shield tanked bs.an lrst has much more cpu than most bs sized guns/launchers.remove 1 high slot weapon and try to fit a lrst , you wont be able to as you'll be short around 80 - 100 cpu which is a huge amount."
7/13/2010,"giving shield tanked bs more cpu is no solution. it is the module, not the ship that needs balancing.if, for example, a buddy and me decide to to fly around with a geddon and a raven, then it's relatively easy to fit lrar on a raven. in contrast, fitting lst on the geddon will cause major headaches.additionally pls compare chimera and archon, or shield vs armor rep fits on nidhoggur and thanatos.and then tell us again fitting req. are fine."
7/13/2010,"i will not respond to this irrelevant side-discussion any further, as it does not have anything to do with the topic of my proposal. i am not here to discuss our rrbs fits and fleet composition, it's about a module with broken fitting prerequisite. that's all. if even herschel yamamoto agrees, and you are the only one trolling, i think everything is clear enough."
7/13/2010,"fyi: nid and thanny can shield tank much better than armour, and meanwhile they will be better at rr while doing so."
7/13/2010,"its only irrelevant because you refuse to accept any argument but your own, thats why he says you haven't got a clue.saying dps > ewar is just a prime example of how little you know about pvp, thus making any proposal you make, ******ed. your not actually prepared to see any point of view but your own, so i'm not sure why you ever made the thread. luckily, this will never actually make the csm's list of things, so theres no need to worry about your short sighted ideas breaking anything in the game."
7/13/2010,"ow, i am sorry to think that most battleships have guns for shooting at people, never knew that armogeddon and typhoon where e-war platforms and good at jamming. thought you have other ships like falcons and other recons for that."
7/13/2010,"the scorpion is currently making you look dumb.no wait, thats your idea."
7/13/2010,"good point, all the guns in the world will keep my enemies from warping away or burning back to a gate.the typhoon, dominix and megathron make excellent spider-tanking ships because they can field extra slots for rr, good resist/buffer, work prop mods/points/webs into their mids and still work out a lot of dps.the armageddon, raven, tempest, maelstrom make poor spider-tanking ships because they can either (in the case of the latter 3) fit tank or fit prop/cap booster/point/web or in the case of the 'geddon lack slightly in the mids. and let me tell you, i don't care how many spider bss you have - if you can't fit resist mods, you're going to have trouble.just because we use the word ""ewar"" doesn't mean we're talking about ecm - which should be left to bonused ships.on the other hand, tracking disrupters, extra points, extra webs, sensor boosters and all the other ""meh"" mods that fit in my dominix's extra midslot add a huge amount to its versatility.open up your eyes and *read* what is being said for a change."
7/13/2010,"while tracking disruptors are definately nice to have, mostly i would rely on ships other then battleships to keep enemy pointed, webbed, jammed, painted, and whatever else. if you rely excursively on battleships for all e-war in your fleet, you are doing it wrong. the scorpion is one battleship that does not have lack of midslots, excuse me. if eight midslots aren't enough for you, then ccp can't help you. either way, that does not justify stupid cpu consumption of shield transference module. still watiting for reasons why it should consume so much cpu."
7/13/2010,"no. just no.shield tanks allow for agility, passive recharge, and maximum dps.giving shield bs the ability to easily rr would just make armor bs pointless. shield rr should stay where it is...in the sub bs category.bravo. you just killed your own argument in the first post. they work differently. making them the same in areas where armor should have the lead will just make sp trained in mechanic a waste. not supported."
7/13/2010,"i would never fly one of my bs and look for a fight without a dedicated tackler because on anything except another bs i won't be able to catch it before it warps off or it will burn out of point/web range. so if i decide not to fit those modules or god forbid use drones for my ewar purposes in addition to a tackler i still just need the 6 mid slots required by sok to be effective as an active shield tanker. i have read all the posts and i am open to all ideas, i haven't seen a good reason as to why a lst ii costs more cpu to fit then 2 neutron blaster cannon ii's, or about 2 siege launcher ii's, or equivalent to about 3 ion blaster cannon ii's, or 2 425mm rail ii's, or 3 1400mm howitzer ii's, or close to 4 800mm ac ii's. on a side note i don't consider any of the ""meh"" ewar mods to be ""meh."" a sensor damped logi can't do its job unless it is sit in the middle of the fight, neither can an ecm boat. a tp helps everyone in the fleet do more damage/target faster especially the missile spammers. a few target dampeners can make any ship miss. fwiw all those mods have drone equivalents."
7/13/2010,"i am absolutely shocked and amused. there i have sorkatez making 20+ post, showing how inferior shielnd tancked battleships are, and how my proposal still will not make them viable, and then i have you and the other guy fly in and complain that shield tanks are overpowered. i just don't know what to say any more, so i guess i jsut woun't say anything. no matter what argument i make, i get attacked by one of you guys, either from shield-tank haters, or from the other side, don't know what it is even. you know what? if both sides are complaining that shield buffer tanking is either underpowered, or overpowerd, probably it is balanced. just fix the goddamn shield transfers and we are good."
7/13/2010,"really that's a thing? is it like racism or what?since you fail to make a cohesive argument for your nonsense, everyone disagreeing with you is doing it out of an irrational hatred of shields? wow, the ego knows no bounds...."
7/13/2010,"something's always irked me with the way salvage behaves in-game. since nearly all the salvage parts are also available in working versions on the market, it's like i could just as well smash items in perfect working order on purpose if i want to customize my ship with it.so this means i'm ""jury-rigging"" my ship with parts that need to have been used in building another ship, which is afterwards blown up in cold space, to then be usable in the making of duct-tape macguyvers for my ride as a way to slightly tweak its capabilities for my specialty - except that these rigs made out of mostly damaged junk can cost several million isk and can sometimes change an attribute by as much as 15%.right. enough venting and down to business.proposal: make rigs actual rigs: they are made out of junk, they tweak the ship a little bit, are less effective than stuff made out of legitimate and working parts, and require sacrifices.how:the rig system as we know it currently is switched into a customization system. same mechanics, new fancy name. they are intended as ""deep"" changes to the ship - too deep for standard modules. the difference is that the bom is changed such that the parts are produceable (via pi maybe!), bought on the market, and approximate the value of the rigs as they are now. it's a long-term investment for when you know what your ship is going to do.the salvage parts become used into a new rig system that replicates what's above, save that the mods have a reduced effect, more can be used on a ship, and the drawbacks are greater in proportions. they are meant to ""edge"" the ship, to make it squeeze every last bit of what you want it to do come hell and high doomsday device. it's short-term on-the-fly volatile modifications for the ever changing situations of outer space.despite my own programming experience, i'm pretty sure i'm underestimating the work required to make this a reality. anyhoo, up for discussion. do your worst."
7/13/2010,"in terms of roleplay, you're right. in terms of gameplay, this is an unnecessary and pointless change that'd do nothing but screw up existing supply chains for no reason. gameplay > roleplay, so not supported."
7/13/2010,"omg people what is this continuous bull**** about ccp not doing enough to polish features, divert resources to dust etc. stop that , everyone,like right now. certainly there ways to make things better , but you cant have all of it. stop that nonsensicall and idiotic trolling. the best thing you could do is to show some support and brains. i think ccp has a long-term view and long-term strategy how to expand the game - which is great, because that guarantees fun for us for many years to come. latest expansion conceptually is very good, the work put together might not be very evident. but it lays a solid foundation for future expansion of game. evegate is an essential tool in order to make eve community more interconnected and facilitate information exchange. my understanding is that list of features is far from completion. ccp would need to put together people from dust and eve universe, as well as allow a multitude of features for eve players, such a dedicated corporation shops for instance. pi is a great addon to pave way for succesfull dust integration into the game. all of those things have to be done one at a time, so not to disturb careful balance of game and at the same time keep a tight eye as to how develop game further. certainly dust is a risky venture, but so is any other venture out there. and its great that ccp has such an ambitious and long-term plans for eve universe. 5 years down the road i would like to see much more populated and expanded realm vis-a-vis what i see now (and yes i do plan to play the game for many years to come, it became an exciting hobby of mine). and i would praise ccp for that. i would only applaud to ccp for undertaking this kind of ambitious venture. i think strategically and from business point of view ccp understand that they have a very stable and growing base of players. hence a very stable cashflow. hence you can obtain high degree of leverage from banks if you can demonstrate stable cashflow. if i was ccp i would do exactly the same thing. leverage on my existing business and invest aggressively into new businesses and ventures in order to expand current enterprise. the nature of business is such that you have to grow constantly so not to be eaten by competitors. the moment you stop - you are dead. ccp is doing exactly the right things. certainly there are areas of improvements, but you cant have everything on the table at the same time. so stop those ""eve is dying threads""and show your support to ccp and say thank you for their hard work by supporting this thread !"
7/13/2010,1
7/13/2010,i support this cpp as an alternative to ccp's neglectful tendencies.
7/13/2010,please if you support it - post thumbs up
7/13/2010,"as if everyone needs another reason to run crap loads of alts.eve allows you to branch out into multiple fields, it being progressively harder to specialize. now you would be taking that away, forcing people who want to be able to do more than one thing to roll more alts to do it.interesting idea, but i'm going to have to pass on this one."
7/13/2010,i could live with that. problem is that new players will still have to go through a slow start.
7/13/2010,"to answer your question tavin: if you mean jita corner, or some other thread, no i haven't reposted this idea elsewhere. and i hope that reading wouldn't be involved with logic gains! and i would hate if it was eve sims!!! i would hope that any exercise to boost an attribute would have the opportunity to be competitive against other players, (and hold the value of repeating, even without attribute gains with the possibility of sporting wagers) so each exercise would have to be more of a challenge, or puzzle one could do against a few other players. those who excel in them against their peers rapidly max out their attribute. those who don't perform well still advance, but they have to do more challenges to max out. even for a poorly skilled player, it should not take hours on end to max out a particular attribute, but to max them all out would require a decent length of time. (requiring one to either focus on skills he's needing right now, or to make a decision to grind them all up at the same time, and hope that he doesn't loose them in a podding event.) this all works to take away the drawback of attributes being in flux in the first place by allowing you to acquire them more quickly. the drawback is also diminished because you can train a skill (hopefully) while you are also working on your attributes. (as i hope the instances where training is paused, and the new attribute is put in, and training restarts would be automatedand not something you have to do manually like when you put in an implant.) it actually would initially have the potential to be alt-friendly because while that alt is noobish and virtually useless, it will give the person working on it at least a reason to spend some time on it in stations. at least initially. then that character would only hazard those attributes points once it's actually being used outside the station, and only if its podded just as he does with his implants if he has them.i don't think i know anyone that gets podded everyday, so i don't see a huge drawback in thatmy goal isn't to create a real unthinkableunlivable drawback, (if it's that severe, it's not worth putting in) but just add to the dimensions and depth of the game, provide opportunities for increased social interaction, and influence slightly certain undesirable play-characteristics that involve meta-gaming. (like cloaking up in deep-space forever, logging off every-night there, or spending too much time at a pos.) although i think the pos could have a structure that wouldn't penalize you for logging off there as long as your character boarded that module. (it would roughly be like docking with a station that doesn't have cloning facilities.) the real intention of having a random draw-back to logging off out of station is to create a cost and consequence for meta-gaming decisions such as logoffskis and login-trapsand even then not an unthinkable one just an annoyance that would assault those who do it most frequently.but since learning skills only affect new players, and only for a short period of time, i can see where my idea would be horrid to many longtime players. i just think it would be a more organic method of handling attributes."
7/13/2010,"hello,i`ve read through the topics on the first 30 pages of assembly hall and haven`t found anthing that concerns the remap intervalls. (can`t imagine no one touched this topic before)the idea of the remap is pretty cool and i like the attribute based learning (although charisma is a little overrated :p). i know that new characters get a couple of free remaps to start with and this is a good thing because it can make initial learning (after the 1.6 mill. sp) a lot faster. for all the other characters a remap is possible every 12 months, which is a little too long imho.my suggestion is to shorten the remap intervalls, not by a lot but something like half a year or 3 times a year would be very nice!faster learning could be a great benefit for everyone, pirate, carebear and all the ones inbetween."
7/13/2010,"not supported, for one reason.eve is not intended to be a game of instant gratification. it rewards patience, pre-planning, and the ability to adapt to the situation at hand."
7/13/2010,"i agree with you but giving people the ability to gain a few extra sp/h a little more often wouldn`t be instant gratification, would it? especially in the first year of eve it would be a little bit easier for people to compensate for (unintended) indecisiveness. for example if someone started off with a industry focused set of attributes and he realized that he doesn`t want to do that anymore for whatever reason it would make things a little easier for him to make up for that. it is not a huge increase you get through this. you still have to plan carefully, but it makes things a little easier. eve should also not be a place of displeasure, imo."
7/13/2010,"i like the once a year remap, however i think getting a free remap when ccp decides to add new skill categories (i.e. pi). so that people can remap to bring themselves inline with the new content which they didn't know about when they did the remap."
7/13/2010,"absolutely no.the faster you can alter the attributes, the smallr is the difference in character's training speed. at some point we may remove attributes altogether and replace them with fixed sp/h rate."
7/13/2010,"i don't know that it's necessary to have this even. let's face it, if i had been mapped for leadership skills, i'd have been halfway to a pi map anyway (or better). but if i'm mapped for leadership and they introduce new gunnery skills, well...i'm just as screwed as the guys mapped for gunnery were when pi hit."
7/13/2010,"ghm.. while i personally do think that having it half a year would be more reasonable, it's not exactly an issue."
7/13/2010,"not supported.new characters don't start with a ""couple of free remaps"". before remaps existed, race and bloodline choices determined your starting attributes. now all races and bloodlines start with the same attributes, so a new player is given one remap to customize their character (which normally would have been done by the race/bloodline choice).after that initial customization, the new player has the same 12-monthly remap that everyone else gets.just be glad there is a yearly remap."
7/13/2010,"normally i would point this out as an example of falling for a slippery-slope logical falicy. however, that is pretty much the reason remaps are not shorter. with many level 5 skills taking 2 to 6 weeks to train, it doesn't take many to fill out a six-month skill plan. making the remap time significantly shorter would be very close to replacing attributes with a fixed sp/h learning rate. as it is, significant planning and sacrifice needs to be made to maximize training: working as intended!"
7/13/2010,"very often, if the eve client loses contact with tranquility, the client will start making silent assumptions and keep going as though absolutely nothing were wrong. very often, this is not desirable behavior because the lack of contact is not due to a temporary hiccup in the data stream, but a more serious interruption that would force the player to quit/kill the eve client and log in all over again in any event. in any event, the death penalty in eve online is very high, so the player should be made explicitly aware (sooner rather than later) if the client can't talk to the server.i propose some kind of visual indicator that appears on screen whenever the eve client has gone on without contact from the server for an inordinately long period of time, such as 10 seconds. an example of the sort of message that should appear is:""no data packets have been received from [server name] in the past [number] seconds. what you see on screen is based upon various assumptions made by the client program in the absence of data from [server name]. your commands will have no effect upon the game until contact is reestablished.you can wait for the client to reestablish contact with the server. once contact is reestablished, this message will automatically disappear. alternatively, you may quit the game by clicking the button below.the default span of time without server contact that causes this message to appear is 10 seconds. you may change this in the escape menu."""
7/13/2010,"how about it just says ""connection lost""."
7/13/2010,"hah, this ^^"
7/13/2010,"because connection lost is reserved for when the server has asserted that a connection will not be reestablished.asheron's call used to have alittle icon that indicated connection status, maybe ccp could implement something similar?"
7/13/2010,"i miss that game but agreed, there needs to be some form of visual cue as to server connectivity."
7/13/2010,"supported.i hate jumping into a system and waiting and waiting and waiting before i finally get a ""connection lost"" message and then log back in find myself in the clone vat. or even just back in the belt/plex/mission with no drones."

7/13/2010,eh.
7/13/2010,it is not fake rage. i despise pirates and grievers. the mass of idiots and bottom feeding ass hats make the few interesting points in the game not worth playing. he who has the most time to kill/waste and screw with other people wins is not a good game environment. the devs that decided that type of game play was a good idea need to be re-evaluated.
7/13/2010,"if you think you have the power to ""re-evaluate"" devs, then at least you should have enough guts to post with your main?"
7/13/2010,hello kitty online is that way --->htfu
7/13/2010,"lol, no don't think so. i will bet one thing though. if hko was subscription based it would make more money in a month than ccp makes in a year from eve. world of warcraft i know does. what do these games have in common a defined and ruled pve system. in the case of wow there is pvp but not harsh pvp results for loosing. does it make pvp and pve a little less meaning full maybe but it depends on what you are trying to get out of it.because eve is so focues on pvp it will never be a large game. yes there may be 300k subscriptions but i bet there are less than 100k actual players. the way eve is built it could not survive with 100k -> 300k actual active players all on at the same time.hopefully if the game ever does some how grow to that size and they have to shard the world due to technical issues involved with network traffic the new worlds will have a more aggressively defined rules set for high, low and null sec. leave the cesspool that is the current live shard as it is. the game as a whole is due for a reset anyway."
7/13/2010,maybe you should just quit?
7/13/2010,"1. the real reason some ppl won't play eve is they're just like u who need to be told how to have fun instead of actually using your own brain. the ""rules"" r there 'cause it's not like u can get shot inside a station *hint hint*.2. clearly, u just want another wow clone to suit your wow mentality. guess what? there's something even better than a wow clone--the real thing--go back to wow."
7/13/2010,"i am a miner.... this idea is stupid, and here is why:during hulkageddon, i mine in a retriever. i fit it to have a tank. because most gankers in hulkageddon don't expect a tanked retriever, i have been fail ganked 6 times since this has started.it is all about properly fitting your ship, a properly tanked ship can survive some of the best gank attempts.rat"
7/13/2010,"the whole idea of eve is that it is a massive sandbox and not a safe grinding environment because eve is based on becoming more of a sci-fi simulator and less of a game in the traditional sense. ccp has established a set of rules and tools and it's up to the players how the world is divided and shaped. the people who blow up stuff mostly do it out of competition and having a good time.now hulkageddon is just a fun event in which i planned to participate (internet issues ruined this) because it's a competition which was at first aimed against macro-mining and eventually evolved into a poking the bear contest, mostly due to the rage of losing a virtually worthless item.what i ask to you is to come back once you've borrowed a cup of perspective from your neighbour and mull over if this is the game for you."
7/13/2010,"as the title says to stop attacks on players from players that are in a npc corporations.we started brainstorming after a player stole ore out of a can while our alliance member was mining, a so called can flipper. his corporation members could attack the can flipper but other alliance members couldnt do much to help. we wondered why an alliance cant attack the can flipper, same thing as the corporation members can. at the end an alliance should be able to help their members no matter what corporation he belong to in the alliance.but we asked ourselves more questions in this brainstorming part. we believe we came to a good idea.new players that join the game will join at one of the school corporations as happen now. in that corporation he cant do anything against other players. he cant be attacked as well by players in player created corporations. say it will be bored to stay there longer as necessary and hopefully they will join one of the player created corporations. maybe it's an option to have a steady increasing tax mechanism on them who stay long in the school corporation.also players in non player corporation shouldnt be allowed to attack players in player created corporations and the other way.those ideas should result in that can flippers, suicide attacks can be countered by the corporations and alliances. those players cant hiding in npc corporations anymore and will lose that protection.if they have negative standing they cant return into an npc for a month after the attack.we are not against those players, we like to have them not but its part of this game. what we want is that the balance will be more equal so justice can be done.regards,"
7/13/2010,"not supported, as this will make travelling safe with a hauler alt completely riskless (no risk of being suicide ganked).edit: and macro miners, like anna pointed out, and isk sellers, and neutral spy alts for nullsec (what? i cant attack that carrier that is sitting on my station cos hes in a npc corp?), and... no, sorry, but that is a _really_ bad idea.alliance aggro is not the worst idea though."
7/13/2010,"not to mention macro miner alts would be even safer, as well as any other alt that was created to stay in high sec all the time.not supported."
7/13/2010,"not only is this a solution looking for a problem, but it also has some pretty ugly side effects. the single biggest effect of this proposal would be to make freighter alts immune to suicide ganking, for example. terrible idea, not supported."
7/13/2010,"errm, what? cycling characters to avoid security repercussions is a no-no so that argument cannot ""officially"" be used *wink*double or triple any and all negative standings/security adjustments made to characters in the employ of npc corporations.alts, the ones that are most certainly not cycled to avoid repercussions , can now only be used once or twice before they are forced out of high-sec or the soylent green (or is that quafe in eve?) factories.there is absolutely no need to go any further than described, make it such a bloody chore to use alts as principal aggressors and a lot of the incidents are no more."
7/13/2010,"reading over the csm minutes (which i've never done) it occurs to me that low sec should have its own sovereignty levels.edit: i see there is another low sec thread up. nevertheless, this popped out of my head as i read the csm minutes and i think it still stands on its own, as it is (hopefully) a more refined idea that is mentioned as a bullet point in the other thread.tl;dr: propose illicit underground criminal network and assets (covert stargates, stations, booster labs, etc) existing parallel to standard low sec stations/gates, offmap, not accessable by standard starmaps. also propose a parallel sov system, not recognized by concord, but one allowing usage of said underground network/assets. mechanism to claim/contest sov not yet determined. discuss.i would expect the corps that have criminal sov could access these places, and perhaps even allow access to other corps/alliances for a fee, using the standings system to allow them access via a tollbooth system (if there's a fee involved).i would expect there to be some way to hold sov where being a large alliance has no real advantage, merely the ability of a corp to subvert criminal organizations in some way. this way, an outlaw corp can in effect control their turf without needing to be a large alliance. perhaps making it so that only an unallied corp can hold sov, or perhaps controlling the amount of people that use a stargate or acceleration gate into a deadspace pocket where the outlaw station can be found. you would then have to find the gate to gain access for example, or have a tag or password to get through the acceleration gate, much like existing mission deadspace pockets, only these would use player access mechanisms. in this way, normal (read: high sec status and non-criminal players) people cannot find the station, and can only access the gate with the password/tag.this mechanism could extend to a network of covert stargates, which nominally could be spread around to facilitate travel through lowsec, similar to the regional gates found throughout nullsec. perhaps 5-10 of these gates could be set up initially, assessed for usage and function, and updated as needed. these gates may perhaps aid in inter-regional travel, trade, or logistics, cutting a 20-30 jump trip into 5-10 jumps. these would not be found on in game starmaps, but with the bm's and access tickets/password, could be used freely (or with a fee) as needed.in the aforementioned stations, you could rent out booster labs, research slots, etc, creating income sources for the criminal player corporation. presumably, the criminal corp (player run) would also incur standings loss with concord, reinforcing the motivation to stay in and operate out of lowsec."
7/13/2010,"i like the idea of some sort of sov for low sec, i was interested in the idea in the csm minutes that greyscale mentioned.i think that lowsec should be a criminal area, and that this idea has a lot of strong points.needs some refining, but other then that i like this idea.rat"
7/13/2010,this deserves a bump!
7/13/2010,"if the ""cancel""-problem is solved, i fully support the idea."
7/13/2010,"if you read the faction warfare part of the meeting minutes you will notice with this quote here that fw is not a priority. it should be since new players are immediately sent to fw almost after the tutorial. this alone should be enough to get high enough priority so they could work on making fw a better place.sure there's lots of things to work on but fw should get a higher priority since its a bridge between high-sec and null sec people. for now, the attention is with incarna and dust 514. since incarna is only a socializing tool and some mini game inside i believe that a fresh workout on faction warfare should have a greater impact on the pvp community."
7/13/2010,"i think i remember this story..its the whole socialistic crap about how people that have over-achieved should give their stuff to the under-achiever simply because.. it's the 'right' thing to do. right? that's pretty much it. but since crying to ccp to change the game from free will to forced singular ideals of only small warfare instead of both large and small.. time for plan b..create a massive super alliance to smash the other three, use isk to create internal disorder.. cause you know, isk talks. hence why the power blocks exist to begin with.. they create more iskies for people.so we have ultimately just end up with the three vs one.. pretty much equating into just two huge power blocks. yeah, thats really 'fixing' things isn't it? and even if successful.. people will band back together and reform new power blocks again..because that is where the isk is at. power and isk.. there are plenty of options for smaller warfare, fw, wh, npc space, even empire space i'd equate to small warfare for people to do. i'm all for adding more to create a more dynamic game, not remove aspects tho.so why remove the option to partcipate in large scale 'worldly might' if people want to do so? eh.. socialistic agenda to make everything fair n equal is only thing i can imagine. someone can't have the moon he/she wants, cause somsone else has more to hold it with so they got to cry about it and convince others his way is the 'right' way to think. kinda, really.. weak. or some butthurt indivual is reflecting too much on the past and is trying to 'right' a 'wrong'.."
7/13/2010,"i agree with the op...the simple fact is the current system is only good for people who established themselves years ago. all of the newer alliances and players get a raw deal. i've said it before, standings should be removed, it would make fighting on grid with ""friendlies"" pretty damn difficult. i agree its in peoples nature to work together, i get that and its fine, however the nap mentality of today bypasses alot of the issues these gigantic coalitions should be facing. if you took the entire northern or southern coalition and bundled them up into one alliance each, i guarentee they would crumble within days. by having lots of smaller alliances you eliminate all the major issues that should come with having a massive empire. in any alliance there is a small number of people in charge, the larger that alliance the more difficult it is to control and get a consensus. more than that logistics is made infinitely more difficult and complex. with more members you get more corporations and the more corporations the more ceo's and the more ceo's the more opinions.as it is now in alliances none of these are issues, because you have the stronger established alliances at the top guiding the weaker newer alliances at the bottom and if they dont take what is given to them then they're reset and someone else who will abide by the rules is brought in.it's all about the selling point of the game. this is a great game, and i wont quit regardless of what happens, however what ccp advertise is not what you get, they speak of large epic battles and space conquest when in reality pretty much no space is shifting hands anymore. everyone likes the idea of a war and i think most 0.0 dwellers enjoy a good fight. as it is now you have alliances making hundreds of billions to trillions a year, so much isk that they could lose dozens if not hundreds of capital fleets a year and keep on smiling - thats a broken game because it means it is nigh on impossible for others to break them or get established. if people want to group up, i think they should do so under one alliance banner, because that is what alliances were originally made for, alliances of today are now just the corporations of yesterday. if you were not around in 04/05 then you probably wont understand, but are there really any who were around back then who think the game is more enjoyable now than it was then?"
7/13/2010,"all the talk about about social and psychological behavior, isk, wealth, etc made me remember that there are actually lots of people making a living from online games and they are interested to keep a prosperous, stable and peaceful 0.0 status quo in eve.since rl income > any game, i can no longer support your proposal m8. sorry"
7/13/2010,"support 4 hydraoh waitbut seriously, dude you can't complain that someone holds space. if an alliance goes so big, claims and holds their space and doesn't fall apart after this many years, props to them.idk why u whine 'bout space, u'll never claim it, so its like complainin' 'bout colors not changing on the influence map."
7/13/2010,"you really believe what you just typed?you're saying people that have been around longer should not be entitled to things they have earned to younger people? strange. imagine shoe on other foot then.bolded the really funny part for people. because ya.. sure.. it isn't fair at all that the stronger established people have more power than the weaker. sorry, working as intended. why should that be different exactly?if someone is stronger.. they will become established and grow.. if someone is weaker, they will fall apart. its happened. alliances have crawled back from near non-existence and they have earned what they got now. and some have lost a great deal, and have become a memory."
7/13/2010,"you obviously dont understand my post, and resort to trolling.read it again, im saying atm its near impossible for newer alliances to get power, and weaker alliances to become stronger. its been the same now for years, the same people, in the same areas, mostly not down to their own work but rather the work of (in some cases) dozens of other alliances (most of which pets, who never seem to break the pet mould and just fizzle away and die before being replaced). the people are the same, just in some cases the names have changed. what i'm saying is really, that coalitions should be forced to be under one banner and one name, because the current system bypasses alot of the hassle that would arise if they were all under one banner, or in one alliance. i honestly couldn't care less who owns what now, my interest in space has long gone, but its boring. i'm not imposing my ideas on anyone, im saying what i think, and im using my memory to remember what it was like. it was far more enjoyable.i'm not saying i'm right, i'm saying what i beleive would improve the game, some other suggestions also warrant a look at and are perhaps alot less controversial, such as making people pay large sums of isk for standings/holding space. anywho, troll away."
7/13/2010,"i understand your point just fine. and perhaps you should understand what internet 'trolling' means exactly before using it in a sentence. pot call kettle black.. i've stated my point, you stated yours, i pointed out the illogical reason in yours imo.. and then you hurl an insult at me instead of actually debating my points. bravo.so who exactly is going to charge these alliances for holding empty, lawless, uncontroled space? as it stands now, and imo.. should, is the alliance charges corps to hold space or get forcefully kicked out.empire? its not empire space. but if they did that, i'd be all for it.. if they are allowed to fight and take control of empire space in return for them taking over player space. and if people are having to pay for space more so than they do now.. doesn't that infact make it harder for newer, startup corps/alliances to get a foot hold in null? why yes.. it does.i'm all for implementing/adjusting things.. but it should be fair to everyone. shouldn't spank older players that have achieved their goals over newer people that are trying to gain the same status, simply because they have more. that sounds so ridiculously unfair than how it stands now. why don't we impose a higher tax on players that say have x billions in isk, cause they can manipulate the market, make more items, buy more goodies than a younger player.. is it really fair to penalize older players that have achieved more? this whole idea stinks of the same skunk brew."
7/13/2010,i'm still kind of confused as to why this thread is in the assembly hall?
7/13/2010,"o7,this is a small issue i have, but it annoys the hell out of me and it would make life for everyone in fleets way easier. i have searched the forums for a bit, but did not find any proposal for this, so i am making a new thread. if there is already one about this, please pass me a link and lock this topic.current situation:someone in your fleet is getting shot. you are the logistics pilot. he broadcasts for reps. you have to right-click his broadcast and select ""lock target"" or something like that. accidentally, you hit ""show info"". the info box pops up. you need to close it, have to find the broadcast in the log because someone broadcasted a new target. you hit ""lock target"", get a lock and in the same moment, the target pops because you could not rep it in time.great.basic fix:allow targets from broadcasts to be locked like targets in overview: ctrl + click on the broadcast = target gets locked. afaik, its not possible at the moment. small improvement, but it would really help many players.this would obviously work for all targeted broadcasts (reps / target).advanced version could be:while we're at it:ctrl + click on ""align to""-order: align to the objectctrl + click on cyno broadcast: jump to cyno (if you are in a capable ship)...you get the idea.any opinions? again, if it has already been proposed, sorry...iltarus"
7/13/2010,"already been proposed(by me), passed, and brought to ccp. i like it, but this is a redundant thread."

7/13/2010,"how about this for a way for the player base and the csm to keep up to date on the plans of ccp. update the eve website.i haven't gone on to the drawling-broad or in development page in a good bit. but after reading the time notes from the csm. i thought well lets see what ccp is up to. what do i see?september 4th 2008?!?!? omg, you have to be kidding me. no one from ccp is updating this as items on the list are being implemented or just down right dropped. no wonder the fan base has no idea what is going on. and the csm is having such a hard time showing the players that they are making a difference.i am not saying that ccp should be holding our hand and showing all the cards they hold. but almost 2 years and not one thing has changed on the two pages. under drawling-broad there is a thing saying....planetary governorthe probable first step for planetary interaction, where you can manage planets from a station or other suitable structure.well no much of a governor but i think this is now post drawling-broad and into post production (if this is what you had planed) or in development for the next patch.please talk to your player base ccp. keep us up to date on your plans and what is going to take a bit. update your pages and the csm wouldn't have sure a hard time and it may make it easier on them because the players will know what is going on."
7/13/2010,"no, i like my 1261 units of water dropping from npc freighters i have to gank in lvl5's. it's not worth diddly **** but is a funny thing to get in loot. i just use that as an example. many pi items can be acquired from npc haulers and structures but really it's a good thing. i don't think they come in significant enough quantities to seriously impact market value. i for one don't even sell it, i just toss it in my ""funny ****"" can i have in my home station. thus stupid amounts of water, oxygen and rocket fuel get tossed in with the exotic dancers, spies and flower power powder."
7/13/2010,yes water drop maybe not significant but planetry vehicles will never be worth building since entire supply can be produced by running severals of those missions ( for all eve )unless pv are required for t2 production somewhere along the line that i missed it and its demand is greater .
7/13/2010,"only drop low-tier stuff, planetary vehicles are actually high-end good and should not be dropping in tousands, dropping biomass in thousands- sure. (blood raiders anyone?)"
7/13/2010,"too easy to answer.or at least, i have my suspicions."
7/13/2010,"now that is lulz. but yeah, i'm waiting for my sub to run out, and i was kinda hoping to get my first forum ban before that. not having much luck so far though guess i'll just have to troll harder but yeah, i've kinda lost interest in eve, and the minutes from the last csm summit was kinda like the final nail in the coffin. maybe now that i've openly admitted to trolling i can get that forum ban"
7/13/2010,a mistake that should be fixed.
7/13/2010,"+1 this is an excellent idea, i was thinking this myself, i just didn't think to post it hereanother thing to add would be javascript so that it doesn't have to reload the entire page in order to update the broadcasts"
7/13/2010,supported.an xmpp gateway would be serious win.

7/13/2010,"role playing huh? i have heard of this sounds sort of fun makeing stuff up thats not actually ingame.. not to be negative or anything. i like to imagine myself as a merc on my main doing missions and rating in lowsec. or try pvp and get my ass kick even though i had 13 million sp... but then i realize im constantly looking at this fraking ship and a pic of my face with a ton of ppl i cant trust and no ship to last more than 30 secs or a day if i decide to hunt pirates. (i like to play alone) solo pvp is dead.on top of this this role playing articles and of course the awsome eve chronicles are just a big tease to me the player cant do 89% of the things in those awsome writeings. then there is the shinny videos they always put out. where the game is nothing like those videos.im just saying i gess... all this writeing ccp has done could have been put into the game. i read a n article of a station haveing an explosion. i dont think they gave the location of the station, but if they did im pretty sure nothing actully happened ingame.i know intersteller reports what happens in game to players/corperations which is sweet i read it sometimes. so that said.. scope and eve chronicles are a fraking tease to me when i read them all it does is make me wish i can do it ingame. stop teaseing us ccp."
7/13/2010,to report on the daily enmass crashing happening
7/13/2010,are you referring to malkalen v - moon 1 - ishukone corporation factory? it's currently burning quite nicely and i am unaware of any other possible station that may have had similar misfortune.
7/13/2010,"that's typical ccp, though - start something, never finish it. i mean, what the heck are the station managers doing, buying oxygen so they can feed the fires? it's been years!"
7/13/2010,"we want to know how it was all done so that we can get rid of the rest of the csm by the same method.someone out there (who is not currently in the csm as they know but for obvious reasons won't tell ) must know what the secret is!!maybe it was her membership with a certain political party in her home country that advocates a method of software distribution that is anathema to ccp and other development houses. this was, i suspect, the main reason for it - which begs the question - if we send the other csm members application forms for that group, will they all be booted? or maybe we just sign them up anyway ."
7/13/2010,"i'm going to stop you right there to point out that i've already seen at least one huffy post (here or on massively) from someone who claimed to be in the uk branch of the piratpartiet, who apparently stated that eva jobse was pretty much on her own and that they didn't support whatever she'd done to breach the nda - that they support copyright, they just want to make the copyright system fairer for consumers.i'm jumping on you, because i doubt ccp would appreciate any sort of rumor that they canned her for rl political reasons - that sort of thing is anathema to almost everyone."
7/13/2010,"funny, i thought that by expelling her, ccp would have enough proof to say she's guilty"
7/13/2010,im surprised ccp published any reason for eva jobses removal from the csm. ccp are more than likely not obliged to. i would have expected to have seen eva has decided to leave her position on the csm due to commitment issues.
7/13/2010,"i feel a degree of sympathy for eva. i can see the effort and passion she felt for the game. but that is as far as it goes. this little event isnt a russian tragedy worthy of lamenting the cross over. whatever the facts, they are beyond us and buried in red tape we can't cut. so, even i can see that there is only one important and practical question left in the spirit of eve.her stuff, can i haz?"
7/13/2010,"good point. i have to say that if it was unfounded, wouldn't we see her making alot of noise about it? seems strange that she is so quiet about the hole thing. her blog on take care said she would post something tomorrow, wasn't that a day or two ago? and still nothing."
7/13/2010,18 pages of guff. who care's she's out of there.
7/13/2010,"aye blizzaed get a 2000 page thread and into the main news, eve gets a csm delgate relieved of her dutys.viral marketing blizzerd 1 eve 0"
7/13/2010,by now? nearly a week. the kick got published on the july 7th.
7/13/2010,it's the csm who gives a ****
7/13/2010,"that's actually a great document to have, because i can look at it every time i ask myself if something is coming up in eve that i actually care for... like spaceships and things that happen in space. obviously not. good riddance."
7/13/2010,"the minutes were a nice read, although i found this a little dissapointing:i guess i can live with small fixes."
7/13/2010,"it's their game and they can do whatever they please. end game for them is that whatever brings the $$ through the door is a win for them. tbqh, if they wish to make it pretty ponies in space, and it brings in the punters in droves - who are we to stop them?don't know what ""deceptive stats"" you are talking about - they wouldn't be the ones that reflect revenue coming into ccp would it? i mean, how deceptive can money in the bank be . or do you want them to do it all for free to satisfy the ""in crowd"". you know that if you try really hard, the cool kids might let you into 0.0 to play with them. a couple more suck up posts may do it"
7/13/2010,"tee hee hee""ccp stated that it decided not to react hastily once the issue was discovered because it deemed that the potential damage was limited enough to warrant waiting for a full and well-thought-out solution.""the solution was ""nothing""that was their full and well-thought-out solutiongoes to show"
7/13/2010,"<<all emphasis mine>>seriously? he offered a purely hypothetical conjecture (and a non-sequitur at that) in reply? meeting notes can never capture the nuance of such a charged discussion.i understand pride in one's work, and that dissonance may occur when confronted with strong criticism, but it is an important part of a leader's job to listen well. here's to hoping that some reflection follows, even if it wasn't obvious in the moment."
7/13/2010,"well of course they can do what they want. it's their game. but that doesn't mean that you need to encourage them to do stupid things. yeah, they can make it into a unicorn simulator, but they shouldn't and they won't. it's going to be a spaceship game featuring non-consensual pvp forever - whatever changes, it'll still be eve. i want this game to be the best eve it can be, and for that matter i think and hope that ccp does too. so while they could sabotage it, let's just ignore that as the silly rhetorical ploy that we both know it to be. regarding deceptive stats: i'm not ccp's accountant, i don't know their cash flows. but i do know that bragging about how much money you spend on game development is a hollow and meaningless number when you don't get anything for the money. it's an old maxim that anyone who can't measure output will measure input instead, and it seems to be as true of ccp management as it is of a government employees union at contract time. and let's not even get into how deceptive the ""new shiny sells better than bug fixes"" stat is - neglecting reputation effects seems like a brilliant strategy for a product whose long-term health is essential to your company's continued existence, doesn't it? and please, i've already done more than enough sucking up. i have it on good authority that dierdra vaal's alliance will take me any time i want to join, and i already have an alt in ankhesentapemkah's corp."
7/13/2010,bitter ccp exec alt is bitter...ifly
7/13/2010,"then i'd suggest your job, should you be interested in getting things done, is to figure out what information source management is relying on, since its apparently not the csm and/or their own devs."
7/13/2010,"honestly, i reported the op for trolling. this is so depressing i barely have words for it. i'd love to see ccp and eve succeed - i've certainly put enough effort into making the game a better place. but ccp execs/devs (i'm not sure which honestly, and the minutes aren't descriptive enough for me to know which) seem hell bound determined to drive eve into the ground.its very simple: we pay for internet spaceships - and ccp should feel free to devote resources to making other games and bringing other cool visions to pass. but dammit there are an enormous number of small things which could be done to massively improve the game. i'm so tempted to offer to work for free if they'll just let me fix the **** they're leaving to rot.low sec - broken content. #failfleet lag - broken content. #failcosmos - broken content. #failfaction warfare - broken content. #failthe ui - broken content. #failccp - broken company. #faildammit. so much invested.-liang"
7/13/2010,"this is something i'd be interested in finding out- who does the strategizing at ccp that decided that it would be a good idea to essentially loot the eve brand by extracting money from it without reinvesting in the game? putting all the resources into two other games that don't have nearly the proven solid, reliable, and most of all existing customer base that eve has? the amount of total accounts created nowadays increases somewhat exponentially while the amount of active subscribers increases at a linear pace, and with ccp owning half the advertising real estate on the internet currently, this can't be a good sign for the long term future of eve. and this is only from public information gleamed from various sources (and nothing to do with my csm alt status, they don't tell the alts **** anyways)- god knows what the private information would tell us."
7/13/2010,"what that says to me is: according to their 'data' new customers income due to flashy expansions can make them more money than retention of current customers through promised ""commitment to excellence""tm. even if i try to play devil's advocate, it's hard to take anything else away from that.resources committed != results. you know you're on shaky ground when someone is quick to tell you how hard they've worked, but not so quick to share their tangible results.i don't include this because the reality of a business needing to please shareholders and turn a profit eludes me.however this in conjunction with the other two paint a picture i don't think truly serves either ccp nor the players long term interests. management habits as companies grow larger can become frightful. the more successful and older a company gets the more you get people coming in offering the world, gambling big and failing. they focus on maximum profit and if the ship sinks, they move on. if the powers that be at ccp abandon their past ways of showing a commitment to excellence and trade that in for a ""commitment to excellence""tm, well you'll find quickly that empty promises and continued guarantees for ""it's going to get better we promise!"" is all you'll receive. regardless of best intentions by devs.while new product and new customers may show quicker immediate returns, doing this at the cost of a strong will to retain customers, scraping quality for quantity and a working ability to make good on promises to customers is comparable to trying to build a structure ever faster, ever taller, and ignoring the crumbling foundation.i really do care about eve but you'd have to be blind to see the cognitive dissonance between their game development assurances/promises/intentions and their blatant and self admitted 'full steam ahead new product' business direction."
7/13/2010,"it would probably tell you something like ...the average mmo gamer, including eve, plays any 1 game for between 19 and 22 months before they burn out and leave, regardless of how ""polished"" the game is.every $100 spent on new features will attract 10 new or returning players, of which 2 will hang around past 4 weeks for a full 19-22 month cycle.every $100 spent on advertising will attract 20 new players, of which 5 will hang around past 4 weeks for a full 19-22 month cycle.every $100 spent on ""polish"" will attract 2 new players, neither of whom will stay (statistically) and will have a negligible effect on extending the 19-22 month cycle, which is set by ""burn out"" factors unrelated to game polish or features. that'd be my guess ...."
7/13/2010,"well... reading all that was a gigantic waste of time.ccp, incarna better be off the chain since everything gets put on the back burner for it."
7/13/2010,"those statistics seem very flawed and presume a functioning game with a non-toxic player community to start with. mmo history is littered with the corpses of mmos that lived by this mantra. sto, who, swg, etc.-liang"
7/13/2010,:'(
7/13/2010,"i obviously made up the specifics, but i think that's the general belief prevailing in mmo management at this time.take a look at this year old interview with the directors of bohemoth bioware as an example ...."
7/13/2010,the take away there doesn't support the comment though. it supports the comment that polish is the most important thing in an mmo.and ccp is sacrificing that.-liang
7/13/2010,"yep and i'm looking at your account with my finger poised over the ban button stupid poaster is stupid oh and shiney stuff ftw!!!! no one cares about the 0.0 denizens, they contribute a small percentage to the game costs, a small percentage to the game environment (out of sight and out of mind to 95% of the player base), yet they make up the majority of the whining and forum wastage. look at the ongoing disaster of the majority 0.0 run csm - irrelevance is their motto, self-indulgence is their rationale and failure is their aim."
7/13/2010,"the latent psychological issues in this guy are just straight comedy. thank you.so you are a high sec carebear that gets owned during hulkageddon but you applied for csm and were promptly denied for your lack of intelligence, tact, wit, ingenuity, or communicability. explained, much is."
7/13/2010,"the problem is, mmo managers are reliant on statistics that only represent the short term, and are making assumptions that simply aren't justifiable. i mean, seriously, does anyone think that wow has had ten million subscribers for the last three years because they advertise better? that doesn't even pass the laugh test. it's the most popular, because a) blizzard polishes their games until they sparkle, and b) blizzard has a reputation for polishing their games until they sparkle. it's the same as every other mmo, but better, and it has thirty times their subscriber counts because of its quality. ccp on the other hand makes code that most garage programmers wouldn't pass through qa, and has made it to #2 based on a unique user experience. that's great, of course, and it's why i play, but it is just a completely different entrant into the market. and yet, they try to market themselves like any other mmo, they try to run the game like any other mmo, and they plan for customer retention like any other mmo. then they wonder why they have a lower retention rate than most flash games. if you're going to be unique - and that's what ccp was founded on - then you have to act it. you don't advertise to the wow players of the world, because they won't put up with your crap. anyone who plays wow for the quality of design won't finish their eve trial period. anyone who plays wow for a nice stress-free grindfest will quit eve the first time they lose a ship to hulkageddon. you find the players who want what you make, and you cherish them, because they're not a common resource. if you **** off the pvp-lovers once, you have no fallback market. wow can churn users but eve can't, which is really ironic given their respective attitudes towards ****ing on their existing customers. i don't deny that the conventional wisdom at ccp is an accurate representation of the short-run state of affairs. but reputation and word of mouth matter, and they're just ignoring that in favour of their first-approximation data on user acquisition from new features. i have nothing against new features, but i do have something against ccp's near-pathological aversion to fixing past broken content. dominion sov and some balance changes aren't nearly enough to fix the state of this game, and until that changes, eve will have a reputation for being buggy, incomplete, and not living up to anything like its potential. ccp needs to spend less effort trying to attract more people who will never play eve for any length of time, and more effort trying to get those of us who want to like it to keep playing. we'll advertise for you, if you give us something we can tell our friends about without shame."
7/13/2010,"they probably are worse for eve. everyone is annoyed about them adding new stuff, but the player community needs to realize that eve specifically drives more people off than comparable games. part of it is the poor ui and learning curve, part of it is the community being toxic, and part of it is the pvp focus. i think if the community had a better attitude and stopped focusing so much on htfu and tears you might see a lot more player retention. the other two can't change, but a lot of eve's bad rep is due to us too. the best way to keep people in is to invest in them. i mean, this has to be one of the only games i've played where the community delights in running certain types of players out of the game rather than try and integrate them and help them deal with the pvp focus."
7/13/2010,"nice try csm! i fully understand how much thought and effort you have put into this attempt. now all we have to do,as players, is get them to listen to what you have to say."
7/13/2010,"i'd love to know where the management is getting their statistical data from and how they verified that it was applicable to a persistent mmo like eve. i sure hope they don't use data from single release games, because those are not comparable.single games are throw away products, fire and forget, release on the market and make a new one, if popular make sequel or expansion. but a mmo like eve does not forget the old releases, they're still around and pile up. and if they're less than excellent, they form a huge junkyard of not quite finished features where the lone new content is slapped on.every expansion and every new feature for a persistent mmo needs to fit in seamlessly into the whole game and form a new or expanded single game with many features. every intended game style needs to be deep enough that a player can fully immerse oneself in it. failure to do so will result in people hopping from feature to feature only to realize how quickly they get bored of them, burn out, quit and never come back.think of all the old classics people still play after 10 or more years. these are games that have reached a level of excellence that makes people replay it even if the technology in them is old. the game design isn't.keeping players playing is essential for a healthy and reliable player base, resulting in a high resistance to revenue loss at the appearance of rival products and a low risk environment for investments. with the design strategy ccp is currently running they are increasing the risk of a total product failure. the mmo market is no place to become complacent."
7/13/2010,"thing is, this game was literally created for the purpose of harvesting tears. a bunch of dudes from iceland got annoyed that they couldn't grief in ultima online, and decided to make their own game where griefing was encouraged. if eve loses that, all it'd be left with is a decent market simulator and a third-rate pve experience, run through the worst ui in a major release this decade. eve has to acquire and retain new players with that as a constraint, it's not something that can be set aside."
7/13/2010,"to the csm members, have you consider resigning?(thank for the hard work btw, too bad 90% not heard by ccp for the 5th time)old players use plex, plex comes from new players who want isk.hence ccp needs new players.with that said, it still a joke at how they just say well we ""won't"" fix anything cause we are busy with other ""cool broken"" stuff.i saw we all take our spaceships to eve gate and mass destruct to show our disappointment.at the moment i feel like ccp saying you don't pay for expansion so stfu and deal with the bugs they bring."
7/13/2010,is this video available to the public?
7/13/2010,"i dont know if its public. it was a morsus mihi video on how to deal with lag. it doesnt really contain anything shocking or super secret, which is why its surprising that ccp didnt seem to be aware of all of it."
7/13/2010,"hmmm, could this be the arena stuff that was rejected by the cluster before?if so i need more popcorn. waaay more popcorn."
7/13/2010,uploaded it here.
7/13/2010,thanks! may i suggest eve-files.com as well? no nag-screens/stupid popups and automatic torrent! :)
7/13/2010,"after reading the report and seeing ccp plans about:- no changes on the actual fw mechanics for at least one and a half year.- generally not changing any of the other broken/unbalancing issues.- incarna - no i dont need another glorified chat window, i like spaceship games.- dust - why should i support a game in which i wont play but affects the game i do play on is really beyond me. its obvious to me the ccp just want my money to do things i am not really intrested on.i decided to stop my alt accounts, my main will remain for the time been as i do have personal friends in the game.but even that might not last long.great work by the csm as they did show us how ""player friendly"" ccp is really like."
7/13/2010,"i'm not saying for the gameplay to change focus or strip the pvp elements from the game. it's more that players can make it a lot worse and drive people from the game, by their attitudes towards others. you can still have pvp without a griefing mindset, even open world pvp. if you don't want them to add fluff instead of meaningful changes, help retain people. you are not going to do that by acting like a tool each time someone dies in a barge in hulkageddon, or constantly htfuing."
7/13/2010,"i just re-activated my account on the 5 day offer. won't be subscribing beyond that, though. i'm not going to bother downloading the new client.looking at the forums, it seems that my reasons for originally unsubscribing my two accounts are vindicated.i started my first account in 2006, then added a second in 2007. i lapsed both of them at the end of 2008 when it seemed clear that ccp had abandoned many of the things i was enthusiastic about.in the time between early 2006 and late 2008, i had spent around <U+FFFD>450 on eve. was it worth that much money? well, no - there were some big quality of service issues and the new features like faction warfare had been released half-baked and then never followed up. lag was terrible even in relatively small fights. i kept paying because i had faith that ccp would sort it out.essentially, i was paying because i was investing in what eve was going to be. there were problems, but they would eventually be sorted out.i lost faith. i thought that ccp were just using eve as a cash generator to finance other projects. they also re-wrote history to suit their changing policies. faction warfare was supposed to be an ongoing development - a bit pointless to begin with, but later things would be epic. that changed to ""faction warfare is just for newbies to get their feet wet before joining a 0.0 alliance. working as intended. no more development in the pipeline.""crippling lag was always on the verge of being conquered for good (we are at war with eurasia. we have always been at war with eurasia...)now i see that there will be very little development on eve until 2011... but they're always late.so, with all the problems that caused me to lose faith in the first place still very much in evidence, why would i pay another <U+FFFD>350+ on a very vague promise that all will eventually be well?if i hadn't unsubscribed in 2008, i would have spent around <U+FFFD>700 by now. i can buy a lot of games for <U+FFFD>700.how many of you have kept the faith and kept paying because, whilst you might have been less than happy with eve as it is now, you trusted that eve would be something epic soon? how much have you invested?the infuriating part for me is that eve could be great. eve could be so good that i'd be prepared to sign up for ten years... but with ccp at the helm, it won't be. it won't be. ever.you're paying a lot of money for a sub-par product. it won't change until at least 2011, and realistically it won't change at all."
7/13/2010,"i don't think we really disagree. i'm just saying, that between the brutality inherent in the game's design, and the level of community decay inherent in any large group of gamers, i don't expect better. i try not to be a jerk towards people who are new to the game and don't ""get"" eve, but expecting the entire forum community to be decent, reasonable folks is like expecting world peace to break out after woodstock."
7/13/2010,"pvp in eve is generally good. better than any other game out there. the problem is that the giant battles, the crowning moments of glory, fall flat on their face currently.pve in eve is... not so good. better than it used to be, but still lacking. honestly, i think part of what it is lacking is real boss fights. there aren't any true boss characters in pve. a boss always does something different than the other npcs. it isn't just another character with more tank and more dps, it uses different weapons, has special weapons, and has a higher functioning ai so it responds to the character more than the charge-n-shoot of the rest of the npcs.sov, both 0.0 and faction, is less painful than the pos warfare of old, but still is lacking.pi just sucks.ccp is able to float by on these things, but not for terribly long. definitely not another year without showing some interest in fixing things."
7/13/2010,"the sad thing is, you missed the ~6 month interval last year when lag was pretty much fixed, and things were generally awesome. look at the forums this time last year - we were much happier"
7/13/2010,"indeed if ccp get eve sorted out, i'll be delighted to play again. i just can't bring myself to financially contribute to ccp if they're not properly committed to their product."
7/13/2010,"2-3 years ago i used to rave about this game to anyone who would listen, now i dont even mention it.ccp remember a happy customer tells 3-5 people about a good experience an unhappy customer tells 100's about their bad experience."
7/13/2010,"""players will be required, when the new character creator will be released, to recreate all avatars in the new system. ccp will probably continue to provide the paid service of remaking avatars. csm requested that ccp take measures to compensate charges imposed for old style portrait swaps that occur within a reasonable time-frame prior to the release of the new character creator, as it didnt seem fair to charge people for something that would be negated by the new avatar requirements.""this is when i quit - i dont care about a new avatar how does it help me in the game, it doesnt do anything of any benifit to anyone - will new subscriptions when this is introduced pay for their character creation or is a money making excersice to fleece more money out of an already disgruntled existing player base?"
7/13/2010,"uh, ok look there's plenty to be discontented about but this really does seem a pretty trivial thing to get worked up about."
7/13/2010,"i don't think you have anything to worry about.to me it looks like this is a precursor to incarna. you are asked to redesign your avatar because they'll be redesigning it for that system, and possibly generating it from your eve avatar rather than having you make it completely from scratch.the charging thing is just saying they wont be charging people within a short timeframe when this change goes live, in case they miss the update notes and pay to change it when they could just wait a day or two.there's no charge to remake it when the update goes live i think, so you are probably misreading what this means."
7/13/2010,"man... i hate to be able tell you i told you so . . . . remember when everyone was saying ""its a different group of devs..."" ""ccp isn't using all their resources on incarna/dust - those are different dev groups...""i *love* internet spaceships/drama/freeform game style... but not this crap.this just feels like:csm: ""we would like to look at features x, y and z, and see where you stand on fixing or iterating them as you told us you would do when you released them to us...""ccp: ""lol!""csm: ""what?""ccp: ""lol! stfu n00bs! htfu!""csm: ""!?!""to ccp:this is the best internet spaceships game going (at the moment). there is no guarantee that it will continue to be, especially with your attitude. i (don't) hate to break it to you, but incarna and dust are *not* relevant to your core subscriber base... (personally, without any player interaction planned more than what 2nd life would deliver, why the f88k would anyone bother?).to quote malcanis again..."
7/13/2010,"you are confusing things a bit. dust and incarna are very seperate entities. dust is a product outside of eve online and being developed from a seperate developer group in china. incarna is a future eve online feature and is being developed by the eve developers for that reason.as far as i remember (and i might aswell be wrong), ccp never claimed that the dev-team working on the incarna feature were outside of the eve development team."
7/13/2010,"as dv said, it's pretty obvious that players can't credibly threaten to quit en masse.it might be credible, though, for people to boycott for a single month. say something like december, when people have holidays/exams/general rl stuff. i like the game, i'm not gonna pretend that i'm gonna quit immediately over their broken content development strategy, tho my interest is waning. but i've got three accounts, and if i thought cancelling them all for a month along with a suitable number of other people would get them to listen, i'd do it. i'd think of it as training excellence to level 5 (it's a rank 7 skill)."
7/13/2010,"i just want to go on record with a bet that ccp will continue to clean up pi in order for it to function properly and in a way that goes well with dust. ccp will then say ""see we fix old content expansion""."
7/13/2010,"wtf is that? i mean, how is it justified!?edit: 0k, something constructive. quoting myself here:it doesn't take that long to figure out what is needed and fix it, at least in some points. surely we don't expect to get stuff of incarna's level, but you can always start with basics: boost mission lp payouts, boost belt rats and anomalies, boost ores. this alone will cause a great happiness among low-sec dwellers."
7/13/2010,"all you guys are so selfish, the players always whine but ccp tries its hardest to keep everybody happy, and they have a clear view of their prioritieeaahaha i'm just screwing with you they've got their heads up their ass.it's going to be a long couple of years."
7/13/2010,"these minutes are a fine example of basic economics.when you possess a monopoly on the supply of a product (in this case, internet spaceship mmos), you are allowed to do as you please without risking significant changes in the level of demand you're faced with.one can only hope another internet spaceship mmo of sufficient quality makes an appearance on the market soon, if only to give ccp the kick in the ass they so sorely require."
7/13/2010,dust 514 what a joke. a shooter that will be played for a few weeks then never played again. ccp expects a fly by night consle game to be a permanent feature of eve online? i dont think so.
7/13/2010,"i'm amazed at how little player reaction is to this scandalous results. ok, maybe the economists and marketing people are telling them that $100 invested in new features and commercials gives them far more customers than fixing crippling bugs and issues, but even if that was true, if they abandon eve for 18 months (which they wont, they wont fix anything but they will shove in new features that no one wants and will also be abandoned and broken) that ""eve is dying"" joke might stop being a joke.and what other mmos does that ""$100 invested there does that"" analysis? from pretty much polished and bug free wow? where any major bug is fixed in a couple of months at worst? i don't think all that talk about ""how much money invested into new shines and commercials you need to retain customers over 18-22 month period"" can come from all the other mmos that died in fire long before they were a year and a half old.i honestly believe that ""lifycycle"" of eve player is much longer than average generic mmo, simply because you need first 6-9 months of skill learning to get into most basic stuff. and if someone has been stubborn to keep in game that long, he wont quite in next 6-10 months. and second, eve spreads a lot by word of mouth.if ccp stays true to their word and abandons eve for next 18 months it will be horrible. if they continue piling new features without fixing anything, it will be much worse, as 18 months from now we will have several new features that need dev attention and that have introduced dozens of new bugs and performance issues upon servers.while we as eve players can't influence ccp a least bit about dust as its separate game for a completely different platform, we must take a strong voice and demand incarna do be delayed indefinitely until at least some of current major issues with eve are fixed.lowsec situation was iffy for years and new probing system was pretty much a nail in the coffin. fw was bugged and broken from the start, it has been 2 years now, and ccp tells us we need to wait at least 2 more for anything to be fixed there?! :("
7/13/2010,did you even read the minutes?
7/13/2010,yes i have.and in them i read that ccp rejected every csm proposal and dismissed every csm concern. that they said that they will do no work on lowsec or fw in next 18 moths. that ui change is too difficult and also cant be done in that timeframe. that even ccp forming a small team that will fix a minor bug or two every moths is impossible with ccps allocation of resources until incarna and dust are shipped.
7/13/2010,did you? where exactly are you disagreeing with him?
7/13/2010,"it must have been a tense affair once the csm heard that the next 18 months or so of dev time is already accounted for it could very well mean that csm 5 and 6 achieve nothing but making ccp aware of things they already know about and have already decided on whether to ignore it, develop it or scrap it altogether and of course the time line on which it all happens.if it wasn't tense i would feel done in, from that comment alone no matter how much time, energy and valid points the csm brings to the table it won't change ccp's attitude and their agenda. less than 10% of accounts voted in the csm 5 project, if it stands true of not fixing the fixable in the next two/three updates that figure will be actually lower, assuming the account numbers are relative.end of whinenow for the good bit, the positive.what should csm 5 be focusing on this term?csm 5, has to focus on bringing ccp to task on it's ""commitment of excellence"" programme, and ensuring the dev blogs and action points are completed, why there are more action points that the csm has to carry out i'm not sure of, but of course they should be done in as timely a matter as possible.to save time at the meetings don't discuss any game mechanic changes for the rest of the year, it's evident that ccp has their own schedule and the csm didn't get a look in, rather bring them an overview of what the players believe the csm should be, and how it can obtain it's own sprint team for backlog issues and future items that can bring measurable items within the csm cyle or of course 6 months in to the csm afterwith the backlog as big as it is, please don't let ccp ""forget"" to provide all that you asked for in terms of accountability and progress updates.tl:dr - if you play eve, you should be used to reading long passages of text, or do you grind missions for the isk/lp/standings/loot?"
7/13/2010,get your facts straight.
7/13/2010,12.67% voted. ok that is over 10%. a little
7/13/2010,"word now is that 3rd party forums discussing this topic, such as shc are blocked for employees on the ccp premises."
7/13/2010,did you really fall for that ? haha nice
7/13/2010,isn't scrapheap owned by a ccp dev?
7/13/2010,"nope, but you just fell for my trap quite well. we know who you are now."
7/13/2010,"hello employee, time to reskin, and learn a thing or two about entrapments :p"
7/13/2010,"look at it this way - ccp will resume work on lowsec, lag, ui, bugs and faction warfare etc when they've finished the other games they're working on at the moment.that's only 12 to 18 months away (assuming they release on time). you only need to give them a few more hundred of whatever currency you use to pay your subscription, and they'll start working on your concerns.they won't take the money and run. they won't just start work on the next game after dust/world of darkness. they'll finally sit down and make eve work properly. you won't have spent years waiting and paying for a promised-land that was perpetually over-the-horizon.trust them. they've never let us down before."
7/13/2010,"oh, please, you think they'd let you touch their baby? by all accounts, they don't let actual devs work on the game in their free time."
7/13/2010,"herschel, by all accounts from the csm, they don't even let the devs work on eve in their paid time. not until they finish the dual abortions that are dust and incarna."
7/13/2010,"if enough people unsubbed and stated why, ccp would act. problem is, people won't. ccp can either allocate their resources to their shiney new games, or they can make eve what it should be. they know - they know that they'll get subscriptions to eve either way.if the shiney games prove to be more popular (and more lucrative), will they start to invest in eve again? if the shiney games are a flop, my guess is that they'll redouble their efforts to try to make them successful.eve isn't priority one anymore. it would take a very sharp lesson to ccp - and soon - if they are going to ever make eve their top priority again. there won't be any such lesson."
7/13/2010,"no. what you have to understand is that ccp is at the top making a conscious decision to follow specific business doctrines. the product is great, but it is coming to a choice between doctrines. they can afford to recycle the subscriber base, quite easily even. and they have factored it in."
7/13/2010,"it's business for sure, but the only revenue stream for that business right now is from subscriptions to their service/product - eve.subscribers to the service/product are unhappy with its flaws. they were led to believe that their concerns were important and that the flaws in the product would be corrected. now they learn that the flaws will stay because the subscribers money is being used to fund another product.the subscribers want the money they're paying to be used to improve/repair the product they're paying for.ccp aren't ""wrong"" - either legally or morally, but there's a conflict of interest. before the csm minutes, that conflict of interest was suspected, but now it's been out-and-out stated."
7/13/2010,lol i doubt that :d
7/13/2010,"i just can't believe this. nothing for 18 months. nice. not even a roflkets or af re-balance on the horizon. what i kind of wanted to see on ccp's 18 month plan was some stuff like...1. kill the lag monster. using whatever means necessary.2. low-sec expansion (awesomeness)3. improvements to fw, re-vamp cosmos4. mining expansion. (to completely re-vamp and fix mining)5. general additional polish such as re-doing pos mechanics, adding a fifth t3 subsystem, etc..i'm going to have to wait a minimum of 24 months for any of these. not fun."
7/13/2010,"i've already unsubbed to be honest.all 3 accounts expire in november, if there hasn't been some rather gigantic change in ccp priorities. not just empty words, but actual fixes/changes by then, well, i will enjoy rl again without the looks my gf gives me from time to time."
7/13/2010,but are you gonna delete your characters ?
7/13/2010,touch<U+FFFD>...
7/13/2010,fix rockets in 2012! (before we all die)
7/13/2010,"that's nonsense. do you realize that people love this game, but not the direction ccp is trying to take it to? for my part, i don't intend on throwing away four years of stories and development attached to my character, and i love the thought of being able to come back. but as i wrote elsewhere, i'm not going to pay ccp for waiting until they start to clean up the mess produced by the last couple of expansions (never mind the stuff that has been broken for longer than i can remember)."
7/13/2010,"exactly that is the reason all the ""rage quitting"" over the past years have not left a mark on ccp. people say ""hey i gonna quit and now ccp wont get my money anymore"", but what they then actually do is sell their accounts or give them away, so that indeed they are being continually paid for and thus the intention of the quitter is never reached. people allways talk boldly on the forums they will all quit and stuff, but then silently they continue to hold onto their accounts and do in effect do nothing. if your serious about quitting, delete your chars. thus it is assured this account will never be paid for again."
7/13/2010,"all i have to say is: what the hell?something like 85% of those proposals were met with ""we're looking at it"" (sure they have) followed by a ""we'll get around to it when we have extra time/resources"" (which they never do, and we know that and they know that and we know that they know that we know that)i don't particularly want walking in stations--that looks nice, but it serves no real purpose. i do want meaningful missile pos defenses. i do want rockets that have a place other than the last high slot on a dramiel. i do want faction warfare that i'd be willing to try because it's worthwhile. i do want a ccp that's less concerned about churning out new content than it is making eve a good game.the primary reason eve is so popular is because it is inherently different than world of warcraft and other popular mmos--yet now ccp is following blizzard's business model of ""expansions = quality"", whereas they started out with ""let's make a quality game. what can we do to improve eve?"". except that that new model misses the point: expansions filled with new features aren't the only thing that makes eve a better and more popular game. and simply throwing them out there without considering the implications that they have on the overall workings of eve is beginning to ruin the experience."
7/13/2010,thank you so much for not reading what i wrote and just spewing the same blah again. i now know it can safely be ignored.
7/13/2010,your welcome.
7/13/2010,further proof that you work for ccp.
7/13/2010,ccp works for me. (no not really :p)
7/13/2010,"i actually don't know how this will end. i have learned to love eve as it is, so i want technology, ui and most gameplay fixes to things that already exist. but the vision for eve by ccp, that is provided by the creative director (that is ccp t0rfifrans, right?) is really different from ours, they claim to see further and to make the eve universe more rich and various, with incarna and dust.they go on with their ambitious project about the ultimate science fiction simulator, but this in the end is not what players want: we want a game. we want fights, we want adventure, we want game politics and economics, and we want to have fun. we don't need a nice ""philosophically complete"" game world. we want to get a funny and deep gameplay.for example, it is known that incarna will not allow fights in station. while for ccp philosophical vision this is okay, this is not okay for the players that want to play with it: only carebears have something to do in station. so, it is understandable that ccp does not want to include a combat system beacause of eye candy (maybe it's hard to have combat animations at the level of a walking animation), but in the end a player wants something deep to do with it, that involves shooting stuff or people. even the carebears have to tank rats!/begin{eve_is_dying}and when people say that there will never be a sudden mass unsubscription, they are right. but a worst thing could happen, that is player slowly becoming tired if the game, and leaving one by one. this is somewhat aldready happening, but the rate at which people leave is lesser than the rate at which new player subscribe. this process could change the playerbase composition, killing the most active players of the game (mostly 0.0, lowsec and wh alliances and corporations), with the result of ccp neglecting even more those areas of the game. /end{eve_is_dying}and...fix the damn lag! why at ccp they don't understand that 1000+ pilots fleet fights are not fun? why they didn't even comment on gameplay solutions to lag (thanks trebor, you're my hero), that are the only ones that would work? ccp owes us a non-lag-generating mechanic for sov. it is possible to have coalitions split their forces onto a number of solarsystem at once, this is the only thing that will obviously reduce lag without reducing the epicness of the fights. i think it will even increase the depth of the gameplay."
7/13/2010,"most active players are 0.0, lowsec and wh alliances? i don<U+FFFD>t buy that. maybe most active on the forums. besides there is a statisic i believe in one of the qen that show only a very small fraction of the playerbase are in 0.0 and lowsec.i agree about fixing bugs being more important then adding new content but i also think that incarna and dust are important milestones for the eve-brand."
7/13/2010,"i think the real problem is that they have a bottleneck in developer talent that actually understands the eve internals and can be trusted to make major changed to the code without ****ing things up.that is why new people can be put on relatively light weight new stuff like eve-gate, pi etc. (new stuff is also where unit testing and scrum etc. seems to work well.)- gameplay balance (how to avoid the need for massive fleet fights?)- lag fixing (architecture changes)- ui functionality overhaulare what is really needed but developers who worked on that originally may have moved on or are now dealing with kids at home and just do not have the time to get in the zone as they used to.that said there really is no excuse to not have small teams dedicated full time on features that were left half finished like fw."
7/13/2010,no surprise here. ccp needs to continue working on their ambitious projects.full steam ahead.
7/13/2010,"1. by activity i mean something that creates game content for other players. players in empire (apart from pirates and griefers that i respect very much) do not create game and content for others, they play a sort of single player game, and 2. you're right with the statistics, but i just think that this means we need more reasons and possibilities for people to get into lowsec and 0.0.everybody knows that lowsec is just a playground with no value, and conquerable space gameplay is boring because of lag. people stay in empire because for many people it's the best place to stay.these milestones have to prove to be worth their expectation. full body avatars without a combat system is quite pointless to me, and many people. the only form of player interaction will be bumping, gambling and minigames... and dust has very strong competitors, let's see how many players are they going to get."
7/13/2010,"how do you know what forms of player-interaction there will be in incarna? only because they have only yet shown minigames and chatting doesnt mean that is it. also why does it need a combat system so desperatly to have meaningfull player-interaction/be competetive?research/production/market are all mechanics within eve that provide competition amongst players and are based on players interaction with each other in a non combat way. i dont see why within incarna there could not be a similar mechanic.nontheless i think that at any point there should be a dedicated bug-fixing dev team within ccp, while other teams focus on new features and also that when the scrum goals/features are decided they should look back more at improving old features."
7/13/2010,"if anyone truly thinks that eve is dead/dying - they have large lumps of veldspar in their heads. if you look at some of the real train-wrecks out there in mmo land (for example ... starwarsgalaxies - may she rest in peace) they are all still going, and never got anywhere near the state that eve is in atm. there is enough in the game in terms of content and shiny things to continue to bring the punters in. and to ccp - that is what matters. expansions are there and being worked on because that is what they promised the market. so who is going to be more important - a few whiny internet spaceship flying players or the folks who have their hard earned readies invested in ccp. it's so cute though that some of the folks here - and the csm - actually believe that they can make any difference.what some people in here don't seem to understand is that their actual numbers in game mean diddly squat to ccp. they may give you a nice room to play (0.0), some nice toys (that you are already getting bored with) and some fancy titles to flash your epeen's with (csm), but at the end of the day, if you decide to unsub and leave - there is a whole heap of people out there just waiting to replace you. so go ahead and rage-emo quit - who cares, heck you can burn your stuff and sell your characters and vow never to come back .... and by the time i just typed this you have been replaced by 5 other new players subbing .and if you think you are ""special"" because you have been here since 2003 or 2004 or 2005 and have ""invested so much time"" in eve (both in game and out of game) - then you probably are special, in your own unique way ."
7/13/2010,i picked up that it looks like incarna will be staged in (hopefully not like the pi disaster) beginning with new avatar tools in a winter expansion (ie the next one?).hopefully they actually finish the feature that's apparently so important to them.
7/13/2010,we at the cartel are all about injecting pythons into...everything.
7/13/2010,"it's very obvious that you don't believe your own nonsense here and you're just using dishonesty to troll sok. when sok reported the actual, verifiable facts about ank, all of a sudden you demanded his resignation (and conveniently forgot your promise to demand ank's if the charges where shown to be verifiable facts). and yet, when mynxee posts her opinion (not even facts, just her own personal opinion) about one set of facts sok reported, all of a sudden that's gospel and one person's opinion is, in fact, a ""widely recognized"" fact.have you, perhaps, considered not trolling? just for a change of pace?"
7/13/2010,i know - and you are refreshingly honest about it
7/13/2010,"i once tried to insert my python and my wife was all like, ""i have a headache!"""
7/13/2010,"the csm should not be disbanded. its a unique feature in mmos that puts players in touch with developers for the betterment of the game we enjoy. this is a good thing even if its just for appearance's sake. or perhaps, i am selfish too. ill admit that there is this cynical part of me that finds the whole mess around them vaguely entertaining. spoon throwing, angry directors, offended code monkeys, nda breech, lawyers on call, careers in jeopardy, smack talking reps, csm booted, others threatening to quit who needs lindsay lohan?its my daily soap opera to break the total monotony of grinding faction rep as a rookie mission runner. id snap, flip out, and kill s**t randomly without them as a game related distraction right now. *shrugs.* so thanks."
7/13/2010,"now this is the first decent reason we have heard so far as to why we should keep the csm. well done sir, well done. have you thought about running for the csm yourself? oh you aren't in a major 0.0 alliance, guess you aren't eligible then . sorry to get your hopes up."
7/13/2010,"enough already. look at the slate of csm delegates currently, how many are in major alliances? you don't like the csm, we all get it. enough."
7/13/2010,"oh ok - i should of said ""major alliances + alt/pet alliances"". best to make it more factual i suppose.and it's not so much i don't like the csm - i just think it irrelevent (and by the sounds of things i am not the only one and even members of the csm seem to have the same opinion). one thing that is a pity is that no one else seems to play by the rule of ""that all people say their piece and be done with it"". i mean, even you yourself don't follow your own advice and keep blathering on about stuff in here and elsewhere . so why should i again?this though is eve, where even the most minor hirring gets repeated ad-nauseum. so please don't diss on that which you have helped create. it just makes for sad pandas."
7/13/2010,"just so not sure about it myself, when cpp say no to the csm do they think their saying no to the whole playerbase or no to what was at the time just over 11% of the playerbase.now i have heard and rightly so, that people who dont vote should not have a say in csm issue,then on the otherhand do the 89% not voting(spoiled papers counted)give cpp moneymen validation for not takeing them serious.todays minutes were a bitter pill to swallow for any player and lord only knows what the people at those meeting must have thought, when i get some sleep i shall wake up and just make out i never read them and they dont excist and i can only think some of the csm are thinking ank is the lucky one.well next time i vote i would like 100k free sp please to make it worth while. wether i like the idea of csm or not does not matter, i do like the idea of being bribed to vote."
7/13/2010,"can we please shift bile away from the csm members and towards ccp management?i don't want to see the csm disbanded, but i would like to see the entire csm resign, if only because it's probably the only way to get ccp's attention. i appreciate what the csm have tried to do, but they pretty much failed, not through their own incompetence, but through ccp's reluctance to listen.from what i can tell, the summit is just lip service."
7/13/2010,"the nine elected members are from the following corps/alliances, in order of votes. - noir mercenary group(small, independant)- aliastra(npc)- ivy league(large, independant)- shadow kingdom(small, i think independant)- morsus mihi(large, nc)- agony empire(small, independant)- rooks and kings(small, i think independant)- initiative mercenaries(large, i think sc)- against all authorities(large, sc)fully three of the nine are from groups that are even somewhat serious in terms of 0.0 blob warfare. of course, mazz replacing ankh does swing the numbers a bit, but even after that the big alliances are a minority. or do you have specific people or groups in mind when you start throwing around ""alt/pet"" labels?"
7/13/2010,"don't you think that if -a- had been serious about pushing me forward as a candidate, that i'd easily have made chair? truth is that the majority of -a- doesn't care about the csm and most of the rest have voted for other candidates. (omber zombie to name a popular one)"
7/13/2010,"except you're wrong on that count as well. that's the thing. it isn't mere repetition that's the problem, it's the fact that your only real point is ""grrr, csm!"" and it's backed up by factual errors. the reps aren't all 0.0 power players (and even if they were, it wouldn't matter), they don't bring back secrets for their alliances/power blocs to distort the game, etc, etc, etc... yes, ccp has rather obviously decided to **** in the face of the playerbase (via the csm). i think everybody gets that at this point. but instead of demanding that ccp actually fix what's broken now instead of ""in about 12-18 months, assuming we don't see something else that... oooooh, shiny!!!"", your argument is that csm is horrible. all indications are that they're trying their best to help us, so cut them some slack."
7/13/2010,"finn, did you ever run for the csm? you've got the mouth for it.i mean that as a genuine compliment."
7/13/2010,"the csm shouldn't be disbanded.if it wasn't for the csm, we probably wouldn't know that ccp will be doing very little with eve for a long time while they busy themselves with other projects.the csm may cause ccp's policy to change. even if they can't do that, they may save some people hundreds of pounds/dollars/euros subscribing to a game that they were hoping would be fixed, but never would be.the csm have been on the player's side. they haven't toe'd the party line. they have challenged ccp and they have informed the playerbase.my guess is that ccp are probably regretting the creation of the csm, but it was great pr for them for a while."
7/13/2010,"in my experience, it's completely impossible to persuade a conspiracy theorist with anything as intangible as ""well yeah, i'm a member of that group, but they don't care"". the sort of mindset that leads to this nonsense considers any link, no matter how tenuous, to be proof of collusion. i decided to try it with hard evidence instead. i don't expect it to work any better, but i was curious."
7/13/2010,"thank you for that wonderful ray of truthfulness. this is the exact thing we have been talking about all along.the csm is completely irrelevant to both the player base and ccp.oh and it's funny how corps/alliances made up of alts are considered ""small - independant"". it's like saying that the teabaggers aren't made up of republicans honestly, if the vitriol and ""i'm right"" foot stamping from those on the teetering pile of meeting reports weren't so funny, it'd be almost sad.oh and finnagain - why should the members of the csm be cut any slack? they volunteered for the jobs, no one held a gun to their heads or forced them to do it - and to be quite frank, they are being treated here in the exact same fashion as they treat others (both ingame and out of game). to hear them (or the lone one or two supporters like yourself) go all whaaaa over a bit of criticism is the height of irony. i see it like it is and call it that way. and everyone knows - heck as we see above, even members of the csm acknowledge this - that others feel the same way as i do - whilst the vast majority of the playerbase couldn't give a toss - as they accurately surmise that it doesn't affect them one iota (or there are completely ignorant of it's existence)."
7/13/2010,"well the tea party may be made up of upset republicans looking for a new direction in politics but the common tea-bagger is usually quite liberal as they are less concerned with emotional restraint, keeping up appearances, and all that.however, the current situation is sad."
7/13/2010,"think about that for a moment. the csm volunteered to do the job of helping give the playerbase a voice and defending our interests while dealing with ccp... which is evidently terminally out of touch to the point of carelessness and is using our subscription dollars to pay for the development costs on new games while they let all the damaged bits of eve rot on the vine. in payment for their effort, folks are slinging conspiracy theory nonsense at them and doing their best to remove the limited ability that the csm does have to put pressure on ccp. and you're justifying spitting on them because the csm candidates are trying to help you. oh ffs it's easy to spot the non sequitor where the logic train jumps the rails, goes off the grade and falls into a canyon:-x% of the members in one specific alliance do not care about the csm. -therefore, the csm is irrelevant to entire playerbase and ccp. i see we're deep in conspiracy theater tuesday today. yeah, all the small alliances are really just alts of the large alliances. we don't have enough time and energy spent with our own mains, capital ship alts, cyno alts, pve alts, logistic alts, trade alts... that we have gone and created entire other alliances that we've also staffed with alts. me, i run 37 accounts."
7/13/2010,"in light of the content of the summit minutes and ccp's statement that they will not be undertaking meaningful work on existing features for 12-18 months, is there really any point in looking for issues to raise? i don't mean to knock you guys - you've done a good job in showing just how little ccp thinks of its customers' wants and expectations. however, there are already a huge number of things in the csm backlog, and many of those things are vastly more important (and well-supported) than anything that is realistically likely to be raised between now and the next expansion. trawling for inconsequential issues that will just be buried in the backlog anyway (and then, given ccp's attitiude, probably prioritised above more important things if/when they get over their fixation with the new shinies) kind of smacks of make-work, tbh"
7/13/2010,^
7/13/2010,"i think it might be a good idea for the csm to have a fairly in-depth discussion about whether the current way that the csm works between major iceland summits is practical going forward, particularly in the light of the results of the june meeting.adding up to 9 new issues to the backlog every couple of weeks doesn't seem to me to be sustainable. the issues seem to vary wildly in scale (from trivial fixes to major expansions), and timeliness (from urgent action required to wishlist).it seems to me that the csm should seriously consider putting less effort into sending new issues ccp's way, and more into championing older but very critical issues. to some extent, i think the csm are already doing this -- i was pleased to note in particular the amount of time they spent pushing for fw and lowsec to be fixed in this last round of meetings with ccp -- but i think that the split between creating new issues and maintaining old ones is still not quite balanced.ccp have promised to give the csm more insight into the status of the backlog, and i look forward to hearing about how you intend to make the most of it."
7/13/2010,"maybe, instead of raising new issues (since ccp won't fix any for a while) the csm goes through and prioritizes/updates old feature ideas so that when ccp does get around to fixing things they know which ones are most critical to the player base. maybe create a rough draft list of say the top 10 items and allow players to critique the refined issues for further discussion in the next csm meeting."
7/13/2010,"irregardless of the ""why"", this is not the firt time a csm member has been booted.ccp needs to wake up and smell the coffee, like so many other game companies over the years, and realize that you can not give access to sensitive game issues and/or material to players. ever.just get rid of the csm."
7/13/2010,"to all members of csm5 i have to give you all a rather generous amount of congratulations for your work at the recent summit with ccp.i read the minutes of the meeting and although i have followed previous csm's somewhat loosely and with little expectations, this one has given me the most hope for the csm in general and the overall effect on the progress of the eve-online mmo which currently see's so many people brought together in one of the most amazing games in the world.your vigor with which the core issues plaguing so many players where addressed and forced at least some regognition out of ccp in a way that we simply do not get by the raging and trolling which these forums are usually subjected to.my wish going into the future is that you not loose that vigor and push for these things you championed for us, that in the future we can see eve become, once again, the most well polished and unbeatable mmo on the market.and to ccp - this csm has set the standard to be followed, i doubt a better result could be garnered from the meetings as they exist in their current form, their arguments and issues where spot on the money and informative for the playerbase that continues to see this great game continue.now i just pray that somewhere in the next 4 expansions we get the issues and problems belted out, so that eve can again be seen as the uncompromisingly polished and strong product instead of its slow decline into a generic ""shiny new stuff"" mmo - something that would probably destroy eve as we know it.in closing and tl:drcsm5 - you are awesome and i give you tons of props for a summit well done.ccp - don't just talk with the csm, their influence is a positive one and can be your saving grace"
7/13/2010,"thank you, on behalf of all of us. although the result may not be quite satisfying we believe we have tried our best in order to get our message across. the only question that's left now is whether ccp will listen, and if not, if we can make them."
7/13/2010,i endorse this thread. :)
7/13/2010,"seconded.while the summit minutes depressed the hell out of me, it wasn't because of the csm; the csm did a great job. keep it up, guys. we're behind you."
7/13/2010,"thirded. csm was great, brought up a lot of important things. ccp, not so much, but remember that they are likely under contract to finish dust by a certain date and they want to meet that date. sucks for us, though.this is a really outside idea that probably has no chance in hell of getting ccp's approval, but what we saw constantly was ""no resources available."" all the developers are tied up with incarna/dust. but: what if there was a volunteer developer team?ccp gets work for free - they win. we get some of the bugs / features taken care of that we want - we win. the developers get something to put on their resume, and it would be a good foot in the door for paid employment at ccp - developers win."
7/13/2010,"it's a noble thought, but it's way too dicey for ccp to handle. i don't think they even allow people to be employed remotely, and you just don't want to trust your players with the internals of your server code. you really just don't.it just boggles me because i imagine there are a good portion of fixes which would have great benefits and yet be amazingly easy to implement (i'm thinking primarily of af bonuses and rocket fixes here which would be 99% design decisions and 1% database entry modification)."
7/13/2010,hmm..maybe part of the eve server/client src as a managed opensource-ish community project...this has some cool potential and i have no doubt whatsoever competent and passionate community developers would jump at the opportunity.tho there are loads of obvious hurdles to make this into a reality ofc...
7/13/2010,"and those are some of the reasons why it would probably never happen - but, it can't hurt to have the csm ask them about it and open up the dialogue. we may end up being pleasantly surprised."
7/13/2010,"yes, great work from the csm so far. don't get demotivated by ccps behaviour, you have the support of ccps customers, more than ever after we have seen the minutes."
7/13/2010,"a person with passion and some level of skill is a very valuable asset for any business.there is a relative high percentage of people who meet those criteria in the eve community.this could be a resource for ccp if played right.i don't know what the top dogs (hilmar, nathan, etc.) actually are thinking but, by the minutes, it does seem to me thatthey are very confused atm."
7/13/2010,"you guys need to start working on your proposal for low-sec improvements. if i read the minutes right, ccp is looking for something explicit from you guys that they can consider down the road.also, congrats on your hard work."
7/13/2010,10 posts including one from a csm and a couple of alts - yep the support and love for the csm is here in droves

7/14/2010,"supported. paying insurance on ship losses incurred during criminal acts breaks the suspension of disbelief. if you want to get paid for hi-sec ganking, buy a policy with the angels/blood/guristas/whatever [those would be some awesome commericals].the concept that ""you can get the kill rights for getting ganked"" does nothing for the miners, haulers, or traders. that's pointless, because we won't use them. we're miners, get it? most of us don't have combat skills to compete with gankers, because we devoted ourselves to our profession. having the cops tell you ""you should go beat up that bully, we totally won't prosecute you if you do"" does not mean that we will; that's a losing proposition, that's playing the gankers game. they want easy prey to come to them, for cash and prizes and lulz. (if they didn't want easy prey, they would stay in low/0.0 sec) if we don't fight, they victimize us and tell us we should fight. if we fight, they slaughter us [shane]...until we become just like them, playing the game their way. i want to mine; i like mining. why should i have play the game your way? i tank as much as i can. i don't afk mine. i like to watch the dials spin, and the cargo fill up. it makes me happy. it also makes me money, but not a fraction of what it has cost me to get to where i am. like any sensible buisnessman, i am trying very hard to make the greatest return i can within slim profit margins. that means shaving away my tank in return for more cargo space and mlu ii's, and staying in hi-sec to live long enough to see a return on my investment. it also means grinding rocks for hours on end, lather-rinse-repeat, as well as dual-boxing so that i can haul and mine at the same time. it's engaging and entertaining and hectic. to be able to do so, i have trained and saved and run rocks for months. why would i allow a system to continue that pays you even one isk to rob me of my efforts? there is a phrase that goes, ""if you can't run with the big dogs, stay on the porch."" well, we hi-sec miners are on the porch. so quit barking.by the way, i applaud the true suicide gankers - the ones who are determined to kill a ship and/or pilot no matter the law, penalties, or personal loss - the ones who would do it for free. they are the ones who keep us on our toes, aligned and tanked; these 'welfare pirates' are just annoying."
7/14/2010,"if anything the untanked hulk should not get insurance either, it usually takes basic precaution to get insurance (e.g. locking your car etc...).altogether insurance is silly and should be removed altogether."
7/14/2010,"1. games = fun. fun = lulz. lulz = happy. u just want to take away other ppl's lulz while u have fun...shooting rocks all day? 2. oh and low sec/0.0 pirates don't gank easy prey either? same fail excuse, different idiot that says it.3. that's the thing with using an alt--if u have a pirate main but your mining alt gets attacked, your pirate main won't be connected to the gank u suffered. aww can't hide behind your mining alt when things aren't going your way? deal with it 'cause despite your claims, which sound just like the others, u're probably a pirate as well so htfu. because your efforts have no other risk for its rewards, just like low sec/0.0 blobbing. that's why your profession has slim profit margins--because many like u have abused this otherwise riskless profession to this point. u can thank yourselves for your own continuous whining that u've brought upon yourselves. hell, i'll thank u as well. at least that's what u claim to be on your mining alt.there's little to no difference between the two. u're just want your mining alt to be 100% safe in high sec so it can be something u can actually hide behind, just like the alt u're posting with."
7/14/2010,supported. stop paying suicide gankers.
7/14/2010,"i support the general idea of making insurance less useful to those characters that repeatedly lose ships to concord. instead of denying insurance altogether, i would tie the payout to the security status at time of purchase (better would be the time of payout, but i don't know how hard that might be):0.0 - 10.0 = full payout-10.0 - -.001 = payout/(|sec|+1)i.e., the absolute value of a negative security status +1 decreases the payout by that multiple. this allows the people who just try suicide ganking out once or twice, or make an aggression mistake, to refit w/out too much pain but would certainly make insurance worthless for those who get concorded a lot.this algorithm would tie insurance and security status together in a simple, easy to understand, story-oriented way."
7/14/2010,"i'm not a pirate. i have no alts; i have two accounts. i think your protest to my statement rides on my having a pirate main. sorry, i can't help you there. i just mine. it may offend your sense of fun, but that's what i do. it doesn't make me wrong, just different. personally, i don't see the fun in being a jerk to a bunch of strangers, but that's me. and this misses the point: gank all you like. just don't expect the government to support you for breaking the law. i don't fear lowsec/nullsec pirates - they have their playground, i have mine.i also don't get the fun=lulz, lulz=happy. lulz relies on making people suffer for pleasure. i don't get any pleasure from making people suffer, and i don't know a way to ""mine 4 teh lulz."" i still have so much to learn. you're welcome. it's nice to know my hard work provides you with the tools you need to live and play. it makes it all worth it. everytime concord wastes a ganker in a t1, i get another customer for my ships (buy caldari). again, i accept ganking [and can flippers, rats, market forces, etc] as a risk to my profession. my stance is that you should not get an insurance payout for getting smoked by concord.my e-peen is very small. very small. you cannot insult me as much as nature already has. i cannot hold up in a fight, and i have run from rats in .7 belts. i am a complete coward. but i am not an alt. just a miner. this is not about my safety; it's about insurance subsidised bullies, which i oppose. don't change the subject, it clouds the issue.and there is a great difference between the two types of gankers; i hope you see what i mean someday. and what's 'htfu'? is that some kind of martial art? i keep seeing it in your posts. is it an acronym like stfu? what does it mean, have to freshen up? hygiene is important, but stay on topic!"
7/14/2010,"i agree, gettin killed by concord should not give you money as you are breaking the law. suicide ganking in general seems kind of counter-productive for haulers in general. i mean courier missions are crap because of the risk of losing your collateral because of suicide gankers."
7/14/2010,"/signedi seriously wouldn't mind an entire year spent on fixing what is already ingame and no new content expansions. it's a sandbox game, people will keep doing what they do since it's character driven, and will do it with more joy as things improve, instead of more new broken features get added."

7/14/2010,"hear hear!time to end the ratrace, time to do some horizontal development.make it so ccp!"
7/14/2010,"i support this even more than i did 2 months ago when it was first posted after reading the csm minutes. for shame ccp, for shame."
7/14/2010,"sorry ccp, but after all your marketing fap, i'm seeing a complete lack of commitment and excellence, especially when compared to the competition. as a new player you'll need to do more than just tack on half working features to get me to commit, after what i'm seeing on the forums, and what's coming out of the csm.i started playing eve because i'm waiting on the next wow expansion, and things are up in the air as to which i'll carry on playing. all blizzard has to do is not break something new when they fix an existing problem with pvp (incidentally one that players asked to be fixed), while eve remains as it is. all ccp has to do is show that they listen to customers, like blizzard have already proven they can, and keep a simple promise, proving they're not just full of ****."
7/14/2010,make it happen ccp.
7/14/2010,"i didn't ask for pi.if i wanted to walk around and look at my avatars buns, i would play wow. much of the content (storylines, escalations) are like half-written stories. as a developer myself i know it's hard to fix bugs in legacy systems, but this going off in different directions."
7/14/2010,i 100% agree.fix pos'esfix showing blueprint copies.fix the interface.fix the click fest that is pi.the whole console game interaction dust (ie dirt) bad idea!
7/14/2010,"i was looking forward to playing dust and getting my non-eve playing friends into eve via dust until i read the csm minutes. i will no longer be purchasing dust. i'm not ready to quit eve yet, but frankly ccp is showing more and more that they no longer are committed to a quality game over spamming half-finished content. signing this thread for whatever good it does. i'm far too jaded to think that ccp cares anymore, however."

7/14/2010,"agreed. among the items i can think of offhand which are presently broken or incomplete:drone control(incomplete and buggy)gallente drone-boat progression(myrmidon matches the dps of the vexor, should have at least a slight boost similar to the drake's role... more bandwidth please)defender missiles (broken, useless as is. perhaps if it were to target more intelligently? [if missile x has been assigned d-missile, reroute to missile y])rockets (broken, lacks the speed to catch frigates at point blank range. perhaps doubling the speed and cutting the flight time in half would fix this.)faction warfare(i don't know where to begin with this mess)active tanking (semi-broken, on most smaller caldari craft - including those where ccp reccomends it - a passive tank is superior; while in gallente craft, the armor repairer bonus is almost completely ignored outside of pve.)gallente hyperion (semi-broken, powergrid issues, often the second bonus is ignored due to said fitting issues)lp pricing on ships and weapons. (broken- by the time i can use it, i've outgrown it - 80,000lp is insane for a t1 frigate. same with the weaponry.)blasters (semi-broken: inadequate against anything not sitting still, thanks to the awful tracking and pathetic range. buffing the falloff may help.)assault frigates (broken, what purpose does this fill that a cruiser can't do better for a fraction of the cost?)aggro-lag (seriously, what the heck is up with this? had a corp-mate lose his boat because corp aggro was delayed on a neutral repper for over 2 minutes. after he had died the repper finally turned red.)destroyers (broken, signature radius of a cruiser, slower than a cruiser and tanks like a frigate... what purpose does this serve?)interdictors (semi-broken, could use the resists t2 craft are known for)ewar drones (semi-broken, perhaps a t2 version of each type, or allowing signature skills to apply would help)that's all i can think of at the moment."
7/14/2010,unfortunately as seen in the csm summit minutes at the highest levels ccp think quantity of development time means excellence.i can't quite get my head around the double think that allows them to state that won't polish anything that they acknowledge desperately needs polish for more than 18 months yet turn around and state they are achieving excellence.

7/14/2010,"i doubt that stretching the development cycle will have the intended effect of allowing more time to fix bugs and flesh out existing features. the issue is as you discussed ""must haves"" and ""could haves"", bug fixes and extension of existing features will more like than not fall into the ""could haves"" 90% of the time.what would be better is to have two teams running on different schedules with different priorities. have a ""patch team"" work strictly on extending and fixing existing features with a one month development cycle. and then an ""expansion team"" on the current six month cycle working on building new features. this would allow for the different teams to have distinct priorities and should lead to more regular bug fixes."

7/14/2010,empahtically supported. those minutes were eye-opening to say the least.
7/14/2010,"you know, there's a lot i could say here.i've been playing since 2003, on and off. in that time, other than major stability and graphical improvements, there has been very little added to eve. planetary interaction is awesome and everything, and lays a framework for vast changes coming with dust 514 and whatever else.but they keep promising things and never releasing them. walking in stations is a great example. another is the atmospheric flight trumpeted for a while there.overall it starts to look like ""pig in a poke"" marketing, getting people to buy sight unseen, based on potential which never quite materializes.i agree that they need to fix the broken subsystems before they fart around with other stuff. interestingly, most of these are in the endgame, where people won't be affected by them for quite some time.but all in all they need to fix the subsystems that are broken, and add lots more working, polished subsystems.fwiw, wormhole space added a huge amount to the game and i would unquestionably have stopped playing it by now otherwise. all in all, eve is great, and i don't really know if any of this is as bad as all that (tm).but a lot of these complaints are about real gamebreaking bugs that affect a lot of the old-timers. maybe ccp is actually trying to drive some of them off?"
7/14/2010,excellence my arse. i've seen used car salesmen with more excellence and insurance companies more commited to their customers than this. +1
7/14/2010,"is it really that terrible?for my money it's the best thing out there, by far. but it does kind of get silly when they're releasing all kinds of crazy new stuff (pi) without fixing what would seem to be some fairly simple and straightforward bugs.i wonder what the code is like. maybe the server code is such a terrible rat's nest that they're having trouble with it...it almost seems as if they're trying to maintain the existing userbase with some incremental improvements while focusing a lot of the development effort on something else. it would be really interesting to know how much actual development effort is going into eve. weren't they talking about releasing a vampire game a while back, during the white wolf acquisition? could it be that all the development effort has gone into that and that eve has just been left in a holding pattern?"

7/14/2010,good idea.
7/14/2010,"i've just read a csm meeting minutes that explicitly said that ccp aren't signing any significant resources to correcting the many issues for faction warfare untill dust and incarna(walking in stations) are introduced. that's 18+ months.the players and the csm have brought fw issues time and time again sinces it birth, and it all has been largely ignored. this is unacceptable. why would anyone want yet another buggy feature if you can't even fix what is on the game now?i understand dust opens you up to a new client base, and thus is more money, but ignoring fw totality is unacceptable.fix it now."
7/14/2010,"if there was an easy fix i would be all for it, but the entire premise is flawed as well as the execution.we participants can't even agree on what is needed to make it all it can be and i am sure that ccp is in the same boat (although they don't have to live the horror )eighteen months is nothing, cosmos is just as buggy and pointless today as it was 4 years ago .. some farming potential was eliminated but that is all it ever received.fw is in low-sec and as such merging a possible solution into what can be cooked up for the area as a whole will not only increase invested people but could make for a genuinely unique environment."
7/14/2010,"yet csm has brought up specific issues with fw that have never been looked into.for example, i had to sit out this year's tournament because to be on it it meant i not only needed a holder alliance, but to leave fw for 2 months just to be abble to fly in the tourney. the issue of alliances and fw has been brought raised countless times, and ignored just as many times."
7/14/2010,"i get that fixing fw is no easy matter, but come on ccp, throw us a few bones at least."
7/14/2010,i'd prefer they work on low sec as a whole personally. by necessity any fix to low sec also has a benefit to fw.
7/14/2010,"fixing fw wont attract new players. i think people miss the point of incarna, it's to get a lot of new players into the game, and ones that wouldn't try eve otherwise. ccp has to attract new business it seems."
7/14/2010,"please explain because when i look at faction warfare i do not see what can they fix which will benefit it as well ?this may seem very odd or weird but i don't even see low sec and fw as the same thing. fw involves pvp'ers fighting together in low sec which is consensual per say. for low sec pvp, its pirates and most of the time pirates attack people that don't even want to fight. they try to run away. again unless some information is missing i don't see any benefits if they work on low sec at all.i've seen the idea's from the csm and community in the minute meeting and none of the ideas should benefit faction warfare. this is only a very small portion and its only considered brainstorm ideas so don't take this as finalized version of the future version of low sec but this is what they talked about at the meeting. so besides mobile homes, signal dampers or hidden secret stargates which takes you from low sec to low sec without going to high sec i don't know what would benefit us.please explain what would benefit fw ?=========wrong, fixing fw will keep players playing it and will attract new players already playing eve to go in fw so they can pvp.for incarna, the whole purpose is to make eve-online more socialising...nothing else. theres seem to be a big boom in social tools and sites like twitter, facebook and all those useless ugly site. why ? because people like to chat together and it's a big business oportunity. i mean they live in their mom's basement and they aren't respectful to each other. so they go online and socialize instead...ok nvm, i got off the track here lol."
7/14/2010,incarna has taken how long??who cares about walking in stations. ill go play an fps or something if i want to do that.
7/14/2010,good!

7/14/2010,"3rd alt in a row. xdccp, hurry to do this!"
7/14/2010,having to spend weeks training learning skills just so you can train at a decent rate means your new player sitting in the same t1 fitted rifer not being abble to fit new stuff for weeks. that has to be annoying. i know i didn't even bothered to do anything with my alts until those where done.
7/14/2010,choice. i've been running missions with my t1 fitted rifter while training them. there is no magic rule that you have to sit in station while training learning skills. if the skills didn't exist you wouldn't train them - so don't if you support this proposal.
7/14/2010,an example of why a proposal that is dressed up as something for the new players (save the children!) is actually a proposal to make it easier for vets to train up alts. what is best for an alt and what is best for a true new player are not the same. still not supporting removing learning skills.

7/14/2010,"supported. not the first nor the last time i'll have supported an ""un-suck rockets"" thread. yet another thing ccp should be working on instead of incarna.i want to fly my khanid ships, please. ccp?"
7/14/2010,"i am pleased to see that this issue was brought up at the csm meeting. tthe only responses i have seen from ccp on this issue are along the lines of ""we might think about looking at this later on"" so i do think this is a relevant topic for the csm to bring up.however it is a shame that this whole aspect of the game (the address book/contact list) which could for years use some improvement is now only being focused on for ""bugfixing"" (and eve gate).a label system is greatly needed for both players and corporations, but a few other issues are being overlooked, especially the issue of the transaction log for standings which was removed in tyrannis as well. when you set standings to someone you really need to have a way of checking why standing was set and also when it should be removed/changed. the removal of the the transaction log is a great hindrance to the managing of standings. most ceos/directors probably would agree with me that it is virtually impossible to remember why standings were set to most entities after just a few weeks. and if someone else in your corporation set standings, you have no way of checking why they did it other than the transaction log.another feature that i consider greatly missed is the ability to differentiate whether or not a character placed in your watch list should show up as a login/logout flash in the lower right corner. often enough you want the ability to check if someone is online or not without having the constant spam-flashing in the lower right corner.there are probably more ways the existing system could have been improved on and i think it is a shame that this whole area was not only overlooked but virtually removed by ccp during the introduction of eve gate. so what i am hoping to see is a signal to ccp that we the players do use and need this functionality (and not just the new facebook like features) rather than just sending them the signal to fix/re-introduce one specific feature (the folder/label system). but of course the label system is needed."
7/14/2010,i approve of this.
7/14/2010,i agree completely. revert this at once.
7/14/2010,"this comes from an idea off market discussion forum.a way to group planetary structures to perform the same actions on each structure in the group. e.g. you have all your heavy metal extractors in a group, you click on that group and tell it to perform the five hour extraction cycle. then each extractor in that group scans the planet, and selects the five hour extraction cycle. this would be for all structures and all operations from setting the schematic on processors to routing materials. however, the main focus would be extractors, being able to group them to perform the same actions all at once, is highly desired by those that regularly tend to their planets.on a typical player in high-sec you could have upwards of 12 extractors per planet. the quickest way to perform a new cycle is to double click the extractor then double click the cycle you want to perform. this means you currently have to click your mouse near 50 times per planet just to perform extraction. i recently counted how many clicks i have to do in order to refresh my planets, 274 clicks later i was done. this could be replaced with as little as 30 clicks.to prevent this from being too macro-able, the implementation of a captcha is one suggestion. since this is eve and fully animated you could create a very effective very difficult for ocr to work out captcha, rotating static/letters or changing colors etc.the captcha is just to address the ""easy to macro"" implementations of having groups. if ccp believed the captcha is not required then that's perfectly fine, it's just an idea to address that one aspect of the proposal."
7/14/2010,supporting the idea.
7/14/2010,"make the command center actually useful, link groups to/through it.my suggestion, instead of having the command center centered when entering planet view... add a slight randomizer to it. without being able to predict where center is, all the time, it should be near to impossible for macro programming to function.could we also ask for these things as well:1 - no more survey for each hourly selection. it's unnecessary to know this each & every time. just have a time frame selector and if we want to know how much that extractor extracts a totally separate button.2 - remove the rotating building images. they are pretty but add no substantive value to eve (though i'm sure dust is another thing) but they do cloud up visuals. for instance, in a tight pack layout it is impossible to see links from a southward placed facility to a neighboring northerly one.3 - extractor status displays need improving. for instance, when it is doing nothing it should flash like a processor doing nothing. it should not flash when it has been given a job but not submitted yet. and could we stop the rotating timer for each extraction and just set it for the overall depletion? also, instead of going from min to max on the circle perhaps inverse countdown as well?be nice(est) if these were options tbh but any direction here would be good.edit note: i forgot these additional thoughts."
7/14/2010,"cant believe im doing this but its really not a bad idea, so here goes...oh, and for those that are going to come in here saying ""oh noes, a captcha!"": if combined with the grouping of extractors you will still save a crap load of time, believe me."
7/14/2010,"hmm, it would mean that you could click once per half hour per planet if you have all the same type of extraction there.so a set up like:planets 1-56 extractors, 12 basic factoriesplanet 618 advanced factories making p2.5 clicks per 30 minutes and collecting in a hauler once per day for a vast amount of p2 per alt. 3 alts per account.this would radically change the market, there would be no reason not to set cycles as short as possible for many people.i think it would be good to separate the capcha idea from the i hate clicking idea. they really are unrelated concepts. the capcha i hope isn't needed because ccp can control macro farmers through some clever secret method. (i'm so optimistic!). the clicking thing is the only reason the market isn't swamped. p4s and p3s are already plummeting. p2s are only cheap because most of them used to be npc goods and there are vast stockpiles. i really don't think clicking is a big problem except for people who are trying to run 8 pi alts on 5 hour schedules. the longer schedules are there for a reason."
7/14/2010,"great idea, puts a end to bots."
7/14/2010,"the problem with this idea, or this philosophy, is that it supports something that is intrinsically bad in the guise of something good.two reasons this is bad: repetitive stress damage and handicap accessibility.now, before anyone goes stomping on any cranks here, i've suffered significant neurological damage. this damage has displayed itself in some loss/alteration of motor function as well as other impairments. (word recall/vision issues). using alternate input devices (love my belkin n51) i am able to overcome many hindrances that exist for me though normal computer users do not encounter these.if the purpose of the excessive clicking is to create a ""speed bump"" increasing ""time vs reward"" then let us, and ccp, come up something that is a valid implementation of that, not just a pot luck solution. at least then the disadvantage would be shared by us all and not just those of us who are handicapped... or soon to be from all the clicking."
7/14/2010,"think this is kind of the point, the naysayers see rancer gatecamps everywhere, the people for the proposal see a three thousand mile long border.in order for this to work there needs to be a lot more lo-sec added, some routes one hop deep, some up to five and multiple paths at each point. means far less gate camps and finally the chance of lo-sec being seen as less like certain death.but no to the currencies."
7/14/2010,i support all of it except the currency part as there is just not need for it loli would love to see both lowsec routes only between empires and all empires moved away from each other a lot so there will be the need for smaller hubs on the way as traveling all the way from one to another empire would becrazy for one person but for that to happen there would be the need for hugely long ways like 100 jumps or even more which i think is way too much i rather increase the warp ranges by a lot which would actually make warp speeds of ships much more important too which i think would be nice
7/14/2010,"they don't need a fence, they've got fleets stationed in these systems, and as you only have a few entry points, all they'd have to do is sit on their gates and blow you up when you come in through the 'gate', much as you'd do when you come in through the gate of a fence. only here you can't climb over the fence, so its actualy more effective.this is eve though, not the us-mexico border, the cartels have their own space here where they have their warzone and lawlessness (see .0 pirate owned space). on top of that, the us-mexico border is a long line that can't be quite completely foolproof watched, the eve jumpgates however are much easier to monitor, definatly if you own the things (as i can imagine the factions do in their own space)the distance between say amarr and jita is only 9 jumps, if the amarrian and caldari navy cannot protect that many systems between their 2 trade hubs, then i doubt they'd be capable as empires to defend themselves against the pirate factions should they ever decide to come and say hi. so no, this is not the wild west, this is not some place that is just being colonised. rather, its a hi-tech civilisation that will do everything in its power to insure its wealth remains intact and giving away trade routes to pirates is not one of those things.i would believe that concord is stationed according to sec status, and sec status is higher in more populated systems, hence you void your own point about 'far-away' solar systems, its the same as where a city has more agents than a town has, no matter how much closer the town might be to the capital than the city."
7/14/2010,"nice idea but severely flawed. this is an age where everyone and their mother has a jump-capable ship. markets would be about as homogenized as they are now. any practical trader has more than one account, and it wouldn't cost much to keep a disposable cyno alt in a system...jita to dodixie - ark rhea anshar nomad1. warp to perimeter gate & jump (saves some fuel)2. jump to cyno alt in decon3. slowboat to dodixie, 3 jumps.4. profitdodixie to jita - ark rhea anshar nomad1. jump to cyno alt in ignoitton2. slowboat to jita, 3 jumps.3. profitamarr to dodixie - ark rhea anshar nomad1. jump to cyno alt in decon2. slowboat to dodixie, 3 jumps.3. profitdodixie to amarr - ark rhea anshar nomad1. jump to cyno alt in naguton2. slowboat to amarr, 4 jumps.3. profitnot even going to go into hek/rens, my ****ing redeemers could (and do) jump that run."
7/14/2010,"you're comparing a vast border with countless points of entry between two mostly friendly nations to a very limitted number of points of entry between potentially hostile empires.and you're implying that those well known points of entry shouldn't be fortified to hell and back.the empires better pray you never take charge of their defense. also, one of concord's priorities, rply, would be to secure routes of safe trade between empires. just from a logistics standpoint, concord isn't going to allow its network of control to be carved into four seperate divisions unable offer each other support."
7/14/2010,"rl examples rarely help as we're talking about a game set far, far, far into the future. however, us comparisons are not appropriate at all as you're talking about a land-locked country - and most trade historically has been by water.countries like england, spain and the netherlands went to great pains to protect their trade routes. stands to reason that empires that far into the future would do the same.it is nonsense to think that low sec areas would abound along trade routes. so, yeah, this proposal makes no sense from an rp point of view."
7/14/2010,"erm, what the hell are you on? only two countries (paraguay & bolivia in south america) in the western hemisphere are landlocked, plus mali and burkina faso if you want to count them."
7/14/2010,"posting to add support for this suggestion. (although i will hate it myself, but it does make sense, game/rp-wise, in my opinion)."
7/14/2010,"you propose a solution that doesn't really fix something that isn't really a problem. and the issues with low sec are more grave than you could fix by driving more people through it. and like was mentioned before, trading doesn't need a buff, especially those already flying jump freighters.that's the result of efficient markets, not necessarily smallness. anyway, if you think space is too crowded and that markets should be de-homogenized a bit, there's been a few proposals around citing the following ideas, among others:- make the universe bigger by adding more systems/regions, maybe also increasing the distance between the main hubs- tweak resources and drop rates in each region to make them more distinct then they are currently (you mention that too, point given)that's just complexity for complexities sake -> bad game design.all in all an interesting proposal that's not really feasible. glad it came up tho, as the discussion brings up all counter arguments."
7/14/2010,"denied.that is one more attempt to nerf highsec and to lure all the highsec players into lowsec to gank them, because pirates have run out of easy targets.so no. not supported."
7/14/2010,"supported. freelancer discovery server, anyone?"
7/14/2010,supported.anyone saying that it goes against lore isn't exactly educated in the subject.make jump freighter's able to jump between low-sec system's but give ap freighter's a longer way around.
7/14/2010,"fantastic idea. supported.i would like to briefly state that most of the replies against this proposal miss the main point. that is, to actually make the empires their own separate communities in and of themselves, making it dangerous and lengthy to travel between them.if this were actually implemented (please, ccp!) i would be making my home in the space between the empires as i'm sure it would be full of content and lacking any significant population = profit. also i like nonconsensual pvp, even if i'm on the ganked side every now and then.someone mentioned 'everyone and their mother' has a jump freighter these days. maybe among the alliance ceos, but your average joe certainly doesn't."
7/14/2010,excellent idea and i fully agree with the original poster. i don't think it really nerfs any activity. but it does add some real potential for profitable trade between empires.
7/14/2010,"yeah, bad choice of words. the fact remains that the us does not provide appropriate comparisons for trade routes.and there are 44 land locked countries in the world - they all count even if 42 aren't part of the americas."
7/14/2010,"for sure this will happen.do you really think carebear will move to low sec ?you saw this will lv5 missions, they won't do it.""you"" hate carebear because they don't want to take risks, and you think they will do it with this change ? no way.with your idea go live jita will become way more crowded, as all people who don't want to go to los sec will move to caldari space.and as some already said, traders who are capable of using ls without much risk will gain ever more than before.if the goal of this idea is to have more people on ls it won't work at all.on the price difference between empire, it will change a little, but not so much.it will only change who get the money by trading from a lot of people to a less people.if you really want more people on low sec (and i'm for), you need to make it more profitable living inside, or adding something new on it.this tweak won't work.moreover there's a real risk about a part of players stopping the game with this, and of course ccp won't allow it.not supported."
7/14/2010,1
7/14/2010,"i support lowsec borders, but there's no reason to abandon isk as a universal currency."
7/14/2010,"no, i want them to play eve at work - or perhaps ""subsidize"" their eve playing time. suppose they have a 40 hour work week, they should play eve at least 5 hours a week. so if they play 5 hours, they get 2.5 off work early on fridays or whatever.something.also, get the suits in here too.-liang"

7/14/2010,target painting dreads
7/14/2010,i come across abandoned pos's in wormholes all the freakin time. out of fuel and offline. contacting the owner yields no results because they truly did abandon it. packing it all up for removal from the wormhole is too much of a logistical hassle so they leave it.i think out of fuel and offline pos's that have been left in this state for longer than one week should receive some sort of armor/structure penalty. enough of a penalty so that small roaming gangs have the firepower to take it down.
7/14/2010,"this actually sounds pretty good to me, more or less.what i really didn't like about this proposal was the ""but why can't i haz your stuff for free with no effort"" aspect.but what sencnes suggests is reasonable."
7/14/2010,"with respect, one could ask the question about regular scams, carbon/charon in particular."
7/14/2010,"i think that's way too different to compare to this.and scams take advantage of people being idiots, not people who are unable to log in for a week or two."
7/14/2010,"advanced hacking 4 and i'm sold...not keen on the wardec idea, this is supposed to be a utility service to a large extent and the currently proposed process will only affect offlined towers.though it would be nice when, if fuelling a pos, you accidentally move the fuel the wrong way it didn't immediately offline the damn thing and the storage that all your fuel is now in, requiring a frantic 14 jump round trip to buy some more...damhikijdok"
7/14/2010,"not sure where ""unanchor anchored pos mods on an online tower"" came in... just make it so you cannot anchor the gripe/adu on the grid of an online/onlining tower and you're good.edit:oh and this thing should have 0 shield regen. ****ton of ehp via extra high resistances (more effective rr, forcing attacking fleet to actually kill the defenders and not just blob moar). maybe after all that, a single 8 hour invuln timer when it hits hull, which only has maybe 25k ehp? just thinking out loud."
7/14/2010,"ok: please outline to us the scenarios in which your tower goes offline due to no fuel and no one in your corporation to refuel it for ""a week or two"" in which there is no chance for you and your corporation to plan for this eventuality?please also outline the ways in which your tower going offline for a fortnight unexpectedly and you being wardecced in that fortnight and it being blown up and all its mods removed (stolen) is so very different from someone coming along and un-anchoring your tower?in both instances you're unable to log in and in no position to do anything about the situation. hell, if you're a small corp there's often going to be nothing you can do even if you are online. at least in this proposal you could go and fuel your tower and set it onlining, breaking the adu's 'unanchor' cycle.your line of argument, to me, seems to centre around one man and his alts outfits who have a tower up and routinely let it run out of fuel to; save isk, cause they can't be arsed to do pos logistics that week, ignored the r&d alt corp for too long, whatever.why should they be allowed to reap the rewards of a pos without the risk of an equal-sized operation coming along and taking advantage of their laziness in not properly maintaining their multi-million isk investment? people whose poses go offline due to lack of fuel are idiots. you get hourly spam from the tower for a whole day prior to it going offline, you can stuff a month of fuel into the fuel bay and its a matter of minutes to move fuel from the corp hangar to the tower. when a tower offlines due to lack of fuel its because someone dropped the ball, hard. people should be able to take advantage of these peoples' fail by methods other than ""i pay to declare war on you and blow up your floating space junk."" your multi-million isk investment, your responsibility to protect it from the depradations of the rest of eve."
7/14/2010,"30 days unfuelled.... i think we've covered already, the various reasons why, if you let your tower go offline, it's your fault. i fail to see why a number of days that the tower has been offline should be brought into this.there's no requirement for a corp to have been active for x days or for the pos to have been offline for x days before you can pay a couple of mill and blow up the tower. why should it be any different if you're stealing it in the manner outlined?why a wardec and bring damage into the equation? if this is in additionto the adu, why not just make it so you have the option to unanchor a tower at 50% structure without having the new anchorable?also; i thought of a new name for the adu. structural interdiction protocol module. strip. as in ""i'm going to strip your tower."""
7/14/2010,yes ~o~
7/14/2010,removing offline towers through some other mechanic than just shooting them is something i've wished for for years. there are so many of them out there and they clutter up my scanner.
7/14/2010,"not supported. wardec and steal the labs like everyone else.on a second note: if a structure has been abandoned for a large period of time, say 6 months, maybe something can be done about it."
7/14/2010,"it's pretty simple... one man one pos corps.. he gets into an accident in real life, ends up in hospital for a week, comes back knowing his pos is offline only to find his entire pos is missing.. that's just adding insult to injury. there needs to be a least a little time passing between when it goes offline and when it can be unanchored by anyone...main reason which will probably change your mind...corp member alts.you have a corp member that is a pos fuel tech with no other rights (he can't unanchor etc), he knows the tower is about to go offline, instead of fueling the pos, he is looking for some easy profit. he logs into his alt, travels out to the pos, waits for the very second the pos goes offline, then starts to unanchor all the mods and the pos. sounds reasonable to you? or are you just a greifer?this is why i proposed1) a reasonable time frame to pass before anyone can unanchor anything.2) you have to declare war. a wardec warns the entire corp something is coming. besides you can't attack structures without concord coming to bbq you, which is why.....3) attacking the pos to structure is a reasonable game mechanic. you do not have the right to just unanchor, but you can attack it to destabilize the achnor. in fact i would propose anyway even if this proposal is rejected by ccp. i want to declare war on one man corps and attack arrays around offline poses and unanchor them, without having to destroy the pos.the idea of you can't just warp around looking for offline poses in a orca scooping them as you come across them.. that's not good game design."
7/14/2010,suport.and he is right. you cant just willy nilly just run around in an orca and just pick them up. a war dec must be declared and and a lenght of time must pass to take it.
7/14/2010,supported - some form of game mechanic to rid our moons for idle assets due to people losing interest in the game without having to get 50 bs's together to solve the problem.great idea. fits well within the sandbox schema.
7/14/2010,"there's lots of good ideas in this threadwhat i think useful (almost all have been said) ; * a special module to force the unanchoring* the module need anchoring 5 and hacking 5* the module have at least the price and the volume of a small tower* can only be used on offline tower, and can't be used to unanchor modules outside bubble range of an online tower* need some hours to works (at least 6 hours, 24h may be too much)* unanchoring time the same / greater than normal unanchoring* need a war dec if the pos is on hs space, and our module can only be targeted by the owning corp on hs* the owner corp got a mail when we online our unanchoring module, and another one for each module we unanchor"

7/14/2010,"this is addressed to current members of the csm, specifically about how ccp seems to be ignoring your(and by extension, the playerbase's) concerns.if you recall, the csm was established so that the playerbase could get what mattered to them through to ccp. this is obviously not happening.when the csm was first created, it received quite a bit of press. i believe the new york times even had an article on it. the idea of a csm was revolutionary, bold, brilliant, and highly approved by everyone.the new york times might not care about the current situation with ccp and the csm, but you know who i bet will? game informer. pc gamer. ign. imagine an interview with some members of, or even the entire csm appearing in one of those publications. csm members will be able to tell their story of how the csm started and what a great idea it was, and how it has fallen short. how ccp is pretty much going to ignore the playerbase for two years.just an idea, take what you want from it."

7/14/2010,self-quoting ftw.
7/14/2010,"your argument makes no sense.as others have pointed out spider shield rr gangs would use mid slots for tank.this means that spider shield rr gangs would have far less ewar ( scram/dissy/web/damp/ecm/tp/sebo's ) ability than spider armor rr gangs.considering that 2 mids are gone straight away to propulsion mod and injector most bs would have very few slots left to fit invulns/lse'sslots free for resists/buffershield raven 4armor raven 5shield mega 2armor mega 7shield tempest 3armor tempest 6shield apoc 2armor apoc 7etc, etc,currently shield rr skills are wasted unless you also train for carriers/logistics.as you pointed out its not acceptable to have wasted skills for armor rr.its also not acceptable to have wasted skills for shield rr.shield spider rr would not become better than armor spider rr it would just be different.depending upon setup shield rr would have better dps , but would suffer lower or at best equal resists / smaller buffers on most ships due to lower base resists and fewer slots to tank with.spider shield rr setups would have inferior ewar ability.currently the debate about which is better is of course just speculation as for some unknown reason ccp decided to make spider shield rr setups impossible due to insane fitting reqs on the mods that make them possible.as a supporter of this post i think the game would be a better game if there are more viable setups and tactics rather than fewer."
7/14/2010,pretty much this. why fixing something that isn't broken.
7/14/2010,"but we don't support it, that's the thing. ccp has stated outright that they're not going to put any serious effort into fixing the thousands of things that are wrong with eve for at least 18 months. given their track record, i'd wager good money that they'll say exactly the same thing in 18 months when we ask for them to finally start caring for their flagship product. yes, i have a lot of respect for ccp and its staff in a lot of ways, but sticking your fingers in your ears and loudly proclaiming that everything is perfect is ridiculous."
7/14/2010,"i don't want everything on the table at the same time. what i want is some basic commitments from ccp to fix obviously broken content that can trivially be fixed. it doesn't take 18 months to fix this stuff - most of it can be done as trivially as:update solar_systems set sec_status = 0.1 where sec_status between 0.051 and 0.44;awesome, a huge lowsec boost which normalizes rewards with risks!-liang"

7/14/2010,"no way. i would guess that your mom and dad are paying for this account? or perhaps you are just really ****** in the head. if this was a project that ccp had developed for free and said ""we need your help and guidance"" maybe i'd support this topic. as it stands, you don't need support and pats on that back when you are getting paid to do your job. ccp needs to wake up. the game is falling further and further into low quality coding and ideas. simple fixes are ignored in place of ""shiny new useless primaes available!"" and ""click fest worlds now open for boring colonies!""don't make these kinda posts anymore."
7/14/2010,"i don't think either lol or rofl would suffice to describe what i'm thinking.i think my brain imploded.we should support ccp you say - like, for example continually giving them money? like in paying our accounts?..."
7/14/2010,"is that an informed well thought out guess or is that wild uneducated idiotic guess ? - i guess the latter because you are nowhere near the reality with your guess.is it just me or these forums are filled with nonsensical trolls who can't acknowledge some simple logical facts and prefer to throw around insults just because.you know what you remind me off people ? - you ever seen monkeys in the zoo? - sometimes they would just start throwing excrements into each other for no reason. that very closely resembles the majority of people on these forums. take for example this guy quoted on top. why all of a sudden he decided to make it personal and throw a piece of excrements my way ? he probably does not really understand that himself. the problem here is that if you behave like monkeys then you will be treated as such. what makes you think that ccp or even anyone for that matter will listen to you, if all that you do if just throw excrements around without any decent reasoning? if anything , go ahead and present some decent reasoning well argued statement. clearly layout what you are unhappy with. then think does ccp have the capability to implement your idea. if you would have watched fan fest videos then you'd see that ccp is quite transparent in many regards. with respect to workflows and how system works within the company. for one they say that game designers present a lot of fantastical ideas, but there are no feasible programming tools to implement those ideas in some reasonable timeframe. pos deadhorse for example. what makes you think that ccp did not consider that. i'm not saying that it actually happened, but there is no tangible evidence one way or the other. so as tons of other ideas and fixes. eve online is a project, every expansion is a project. those of you who worked in project oriented environment would know that most important skill is ability to prioritize, and select those tasks which are more important for business than other. yes there are some areas which require attention. then go ahead and explain why (with clear and consistent argument) for instance pos system overhaul is more important than long term strategic goals such as dust for example. otherwise if you continue to behave like monkeys and throw excrements around you will hardly achieve anything. and no, i don't work for cpp just a very long standing player."

7/14/2010,"crowd pacification productions?theyve moved on from control have they? ;)on a serious note, i personally have faith in ccp to do the right thing (yes im misguided), but just want them to focus on all the broken and buggy things & half finished features they have given us over the past few years rather than focus on more new things that will be broken, buggy and generally unsupported going forward."
7/14/2010,"true.the concept of the last 5 expansions or so was very good. but the implementation was horrible. most of the features were scrapped before launch and the remaining ones were filled with bugs. and instead of fixing that and using the foundation they had, they just decided to make the next expansion that is conceptually very good but in practise horrible. one that is a foundation for new iterations but ignored again, just like the previous expansion."
7/14/2010,i'll show my support for ccp when they show their support for me.
7/14/2010,"i think the only one trolling here is you. why would we as i stated in other places, need to support people who are already being supported by our subs. what purpose does the op serve? are you trying to form a coalition of ccp fans? or are you filling the forums with a thread that says ""stop what you are doing to ccp!""? i believe it is the latter in many forms and it serves no point. there are always going to be trolls, though your way of describing them is pretty idiotic. you also seem to have no grip on the way the changes in the game come. it is not a game designer who has thought of most ideas for eve, it is the playerbase, and all the fixes the playerbase has been screaming to get for years now, have been in a large part ignored. simple fixes are being passed over to work on avatar's for a game that in 18 to 24 months will be more broken than it is now. why bother playing it just for an avatar at that point? ccp has tons of ""support"" but they have abused the customer base badly with no communication that matters, no deadlines that are being met on a consistent basis, half finished projects, terrible coding, numerous bugs, a lack of ""excellence"" in all arenas and overall, the snobbish attitude of a company that has lost it's focus and center. you sir are just too happy to be playing a space game to notice these things. wake up."

7/14/2010,no... i'm not going to give my support.all i saw in those minute was pure unadulterated arrogance and ignorance of the problems in eve online.i get they want to do grand things... i get they have great plans for future expansions... hell i'm all for it.but ever since apocrypha i've had nothing but trouble as a stubborn mac gamer.i've seen in-game issues that are very troublesome and completely ignored.i've seen countless issues raised and ignored.i see ccp ***** footing every time the csm brings up a valid point that's clearly a problem and ccp just passes it off.i continue to play this game in hopes of them getting off there ass and focusing on quality and not quantity... but even i have my limits.you want my support and thanks?fix the ####ing game.put some damn effort into showing you give a crap and your listening at least.want proof? go check the mac boards some time.... this goes far further than in-game mechanics being screwy.... there's much more to this elephant in the room.that's my 2 cents... don't like it? don't care...
7/14/2010,"your post in and of itself would seem to indicate the latter.i will support ccp when they support me, namely by learning how to prioritize and fix what their paying customers actually care about, instead of adding more half-broken and useless features.also, excrement. just because."
7/14/2010,emphasis on paying customers
7/14/2010,"let me get this straight: you want me to support the ccp that does have the time and resources to introduce a completely useless (albeit pretty) hauler, but doesn't have the time and resources to fix rockets? or assault frigates? or scan probes on overview? or any of dozens of other trivial fixes that have been awaited by the playerbase for years?support the ccp that put 20 people on to the evegate team to produce a social networking app used by about 12 players and that was requested by nobody, but that only had one guy on the ui team until recently, when we've been begging for a ui overhaul (or at least fixes for some of the more glaringly awful issues) since... well, since eve launched?yeah. no.i'll support the ccp that says: hey, wait, maybe we've been doing things the wrong way around here. maybe we should pay some attention to our customers' priorities, and not just squeeze out yet another half-finished, untested, unwanted, poorly balanced ""new shiny"" to lie stinking up the game with more useless features that would be great if they actually worked."
7/14/2010,"dear mr. and mrs. csm delegates,please propose to ccp to develop new ship hulls. as eve is a game about internet spaceships, spaceships are the lifeblood of the game. i, and surely plenty others, would like to see new ship hulls introduced in future expansions; some possibilities include:- new (tier 2?) destroyer hulls- new (tier 3?) battlecruiser hulls- moar t3!- moar faction!- jove (pushing it but who knows)!once again, this is a proposal for new hull designs, and not just new ships that use existing hulls (navy scorpion, etc). let's put aside the wild and crazy stuff like landing on planets and walking around stations for a bit and get back to the basics: internet spaceships.kindly,gam"
7/14/2010,new ships already come out all the time. lets not put aside walk in stations ok.
7/14/2010,i would prefer it if they fixed the game before adding another year of skill training so i can fly a ship that can salvage as it runs a mission....
7/14/2010,there are plenty of ships. new ships are not needed. go away.
7/14/2010,"going through these one at a time.would be nice to have a t2 destroyer than can be used in actual combat. having said that it would be nice to have a t1 destroyer for that too.would brefer bss first, im sure they will all come with time.see above.no.god no.and once again. no. t3 will be new hulls but t2 and faction have always been upgrades to the base hull.so in other words, this is a proposal for what ccp is already doing?"
7/14/2010,check out the sabre scrub.
7/14/2010,have a look at the blood raider/angel/sansha ships.
7/14/2010,"no, please lets."
7/14/2010,"there's a limit to how many ships the game can handle, simply because of psychological limits on the attention span of the player base. as such, there's a limit on how many ships you ever want to have in the game, for any reason. we're not there yet, but we're actually getting up to the level where we're close. as such, ccp needs to be careful how fast they add new ships. sure, they can have a 2005-style orgy of new hulls, but if they do that then they never get to add new ships again. i'd rather they trickle them out over several years. sure, i'm less happy now, but over the long run it's more enjoyable and better for the game."
7/14/2010,there are no faction industrials.
7/14/2010,"thank you for misunderstanding what i said. tier 2/tier 3 is not the same as tech 2/tech 3; i want to see new, tier 2/3, tech 1 hulls, as well as more tech 3 (battleships would be amazing)."
7/14/2010,there are plent of ships right now.what i would like to see is new drone models for logistical and ewar. instead of recycling empire combat drone models how about coming up with something unique for each class.
7/14/2010,"problem:according to the csm 5 summit meeting minutes ccp searches for a solution to ""regulate"" the blob building which eventually causes the lag. the lag itself is in my opinion not really a bug, it is a technical challenge. so as the hardware advances and software solutions may be implemented the max amount of players that can be handled may rise over time. the solution therefor should be able to adjust that maximum.proposal:there is another area in eve that is almost unaffected by lag and where small gang warfare is usual, the wormhole space. this is regulated automatically by the max mass amount that can pass a wormhole. if you form a blob that is to big the wormhole simply collapses and divides your forces.a similar mechanic should be adapted to the 0.0 gates and cynos. something like an adjustable variable throughput of connections from system to system (not for individual gates/cynos). the throughput may or may not depend on the distance between the systems. the throughput should be initially big but deplete as more ships jump. this still allows big fleets, but not that big.any suggestions to this initial thoughts?"
7/14/2010,"yet again, there's no sov holding in w-space. so you are suggesting that whoever gets in the system first wins the sov with no actual fight ever.terrible idea.edit: lag should not be fixed by changing basic game mechanics. lag should be fixed by optimizing client and server performance."
7/14/2010,"but this is bs, how should it be possible to fix that by performance. would actually be interesting how much a single ship increases the load on the server and the clients. i bet it is not linear. so this will never happen means you have to whinne forever except you bring up some alternative solutions."
7/14/2010,what are you talking about? this is the fix we've all been waiting for. or are you saying learning skills isn't a horribly obtrusive hurdle for new players and alt makers alike. i'm pretty sure 90% of everbody else that plays eve would say otherwise.
7/14/2010,"there is (or was) a hook in the tutorial where you had to kill someone who offered a pirate's life to you. a fair few people asked how they clicked 'yes' to the proposition, they still wanted to click 'yes' after we'd explained (for the nth time) if it did let them do it then it'd mean they'd be -10 and kos to all the empires. so people are more than willing to join sansha's nation and co if given the opportunity with all the risks entailed with doing so."
7/14/2010,"if members of these factions aren't able to enter empire space without being jumped on by concord or local navy how do you explain all the pirate npcs that live at asteroids and are fought in countless high sec missions? following your train of thought all pirate rats should be removed from high sec as well as all combat missions.a more reasonable approach would be to leave concord out of it, since they're essentially unbeatable and more about a control of certain player behavior than a good representative of game lore. faction navies would be another matter, personally i think those should have a much slower response time and be less dangerous, so that they stop enemies lingering but don't prevent brief raids. such that in lower security areas like say 0.6-0.5 faction navy doesn't show up for a few minutes, and then only if you attack someone or linger at a gate or a station. ...or perhaps response time should be based on the signature of enemy faction ships vs the security rating of the system, thereby effectively limiting players to the same size hulls as the npcs that occupy local asteroids.likewise, the pirate aligned players should get a degree of assistance from their faction, not the same or as much as empire factions, something like as i suggested above in my first post.put in that context yes i think i would give serious consideration to joining a pirate faction as would i imagine many others.... then again moving all npc combat (asteroids, exploration, and combat missions) out of highsec doesn't actually sound like a terrible idea now that i think about it. certainly makes much more sense in respect to the game lore in that it would synchronize npcs with existing mechanics regarding player criminals / faction enemies."
7/14/2010,thinking the same thing here
7/14/2010,"it's probably useless to say this or to propose this since ccp won't do squat for the next 18 months or so about low-sec or fw but anyway, but anyways.proposal: make fw missions not appear on overview. heres is my explanationhigh sec mission: no one see it in overview. people have to scan it.null sec mission: same as above.low sec missions: same as abovebut for fw all of a sudden, it appears. its a big invation to everyone to come in and kill people in ????i just dont believe in free stuff in eve. pirates or othert pilots should work to get the missions in my opinion. it shouldn't be free like that. besides scanning for a ship is really fast anyway. i don't even see the point of why only the fw missions should appear in low-sec ? is it because of the lp reward. of course not since the mission location itlsef is pretty risky alone. and if you don't do it right, you can lose your ship (npc or pirates !)"

7/14/2010,wat?
7/14/2010,"the other day roaming around in low/nullsec i was thinking wouldnt it be great if there were random fights/encounters between npc factions. leaving behind some loot [odd faction item maybe?] and salvage. but also allow players who happen to see it [maybe have to scan it down with d-scan or s-scan] to get a higher standing boost with whichever side they choose to help and likewise standing loss with the other. this could help people, albeit dangerously in low/null sec, to gain standings boosts to help them get back the ability to go into high sec. this would help to get some people out of highsec and offer another way for people to gain some standing quicker. what do you think?"
7/14/2010,idk if you live in lowsec and dont know how to scann for sites to shoot npc pirates to gain standing and lowsec missions are available. npc fighting npc would be cool though.simple sites to scann can be done at the star/sun in solar system without probes.
7/14/2010,i'm getting sick and tired of a blob coming and anchoring up bubbles off our station to catch our friend who try and warp in to fight and then there is nothing we can do but spin the ship. this is getting out of hand and it must stop!there needs to be sentry guns that we can upgrade the outpost to to beat off these lame campers. camping is not pvp and this would discourage risk free pvp that plagues this game.everyone knows that the people in the station are at an extreme disadvantage and this would even the odds.
7/14/2010,i have an idea. the people in station could watch intel channels and undock before the reds come into system and form a home defence fleet
7/14/2010,that is more like your personal opinion and not a legitimate proposal. not supported for the obvious reasons.
7/14/2010,sounds like your tactics are just terrible and you want an iwin button to solve your problem for you
7/14/2010,"npc stations got guns, poses got guns, but outposts for some reason are defenseless?why not give it ability to anchor some pos guns in the vicinity, maybe 2 large guns worth of pg and 0 cpu(so no ewar/disruptors) - not enough to make it a serious threat but enough to give some advantageor give much more guns and nerf the crap out of docking games"
7/14/2010,the outpost defense is the guys docked inside.
7/14/2010,"i've previously proposed sov upgrades to make this sort of thing possible, but frankly, posts like this make me think twice about it. defenders are at a dramatic advantage in a fight on an outpost - you can redock/repair/reship, your opponents can't - and they shouldn't need a home-field advantage of the sort you describe to win a fair fight. if it's protecting people like you, i'm not sure i want it."
7/14/2010,"i also think it's normal to have gun on an outpostnot something powerfull that can have an impact on a siege, but enough power for people to think about it when staying near it.like 2-3 guns like on npc station or stargate.wich can be easily incapacited when a fleet attack, but will stop (or at least hurt) a gang of 2-3 people."
7/14/2010,"if you need some sort of help against that gang.... sorry to say, may be you aren't entitled to live at that station ?"
7/14/2010,sounds good to me.
7/14/2010,bump!
7/14/2010,"population control in piunder this proposal, capsuleers involved in pi will have control over how much they pay their dirt-side workers. the amount of pay set for an installation will effect how many people are willing to work at that installation. each planet will also have a minimum wage based upon its security status.population:each planet in eve will have a population of workers and a standard of living based upon its security standing. planets in high sec have high populations and a high standard of living. the high standard of living means those workers need a higher wage in order to be satisfied. low-sec is a frontier section of empire, and has a medium sized population but much lower standard of living. this requires a lower wage in order to satisfy them, but also a lower work force to be distributed among the installations. lastly, w-space and nullsec have very low populations of workers, and are frontier planets. they need a very low wage to satisfy workers.lowest possible wage= high sec wages >>> low-sec wages > o.o and w-spacehowever, this is just the lowest possible wage. capsuleers can set higher wages to insure that workforce is always available for their installations, or to seduce away workers from competitors on the same planet.effect of wages:people on a planet will want to work for whoever is offering the highest wages. capsuleers who offer the highest wages will find their installations fully staffed. this will trickle down. if too many capsuleers have installations on a planet, it is very possible that lower-paying pilots will not have enough workforce to fully staff their installations. installations that are not fully staffed will operate at 50% efficiency.example:highest wage: fully staffednext highest: fully staffed....3rd lowest: 60% efficiency2nd lowest: 55% efficiencylowest: 50% efficiencythe formula for what efficiency the underpaying pilots would receive would be up to ccp, and probably not a linear progression. this is just as an example. adjustments would be made at downtime, and it would be a gradual shift of workforce from lower paying to higher paying installations (assuming that there isn't excess workforce, in which case all installations would be fully staffed)the combined effect of population and wages means that high-sec worlds can support more simultaneous operations, but requires a higher expenditure for workforce. low-sec worlds can support slightly fewer simultaneous operations, but have a much lower cost of operations from wages. lastly, 0.0 and w-space planets will support very cheap operations, but cannot sustain operations for more than a handful of pilots with their population.this will make pi operations spread out, as currently it is possible for thousands of pilots to use a single world for their manufacturing (not excavating) with no decrease in efficiency. this is highly unrealistic.further iterations could also involve transporting people from one planet to the next, which would increase population at target planets. dust would also effect population numbers, as sustained warfare would result in collateral damage and a decreased number of workers available."
7/14/2010,"this would have been a sensible, coherent, wise way of designing pi. as such, it's doomed to failure. still, it sounds like a good direction to go, and like it would be an important part of a good pi system, so i'll support it anyways."
7/14/2010,"unsupported.your assumption that thousands of pilots can all pile up on the same world with no loss of efficiency is flawed from the outset - too many extractors piled up one deposit deplete the deposit. this feature is currently (i believe) disabled, but it can be enabled by ccp when they deem it necessary.this feature does nothing except make pi more expensive for high-sec dwellers. it's already a bloody nuisance for those people, why make it even less attractive?now, from the rp point of view, planetary incomes are a pittance compared to isk. a couple of isk would likely pay for the yearly income of a small family. your export/import tariffs are much higher than that."

7/14/2010,"essentially bioships will be farmed ships. they get farmed in space and eat planetgoo that you bring them. the farms can only exist in wormspace. they start off as larva and can grow into whatever ships. these ships arent allowed to dock because their nature of destroying docks due to clautrophobia or such.their weaponry are primarily composed of acids which bypass shields and melt the ship; this generates heat on the ship and overloads your racks. the counterpoint is that it takes a fair bit of time and attacks to effectively disable your ship; the acid melts your engines so you cant move and your racks are too hot to run modules. it is possible your thermodynamics skill to be high enough and to be beefy enough to be able to sustain attacks from the lower damage bioships. the larger bioships are however very poor at hitting targets which can move.the more special ships have features like pos infestation which essentially puts the pos into reinforcement, in that you cant makes any changes to that pos. or bioparasite which gives the assailant full sight of the victim wherever he may go.the drones for the ships are default little biodrones."
7/14/2010,"so you're proposing an entirely useless class of ships, with a bunch of abilities/requirements that obviously haven't been thought through very well, and to top it off, you're proposing it in the assembly hall before f&i?"
7/14/2010,like this?/agree
7/14/2010,why are you still posting?
7/14/2010,the bio dread is actually interesting in that it doesnt actually have primary weapons. the bio battleships fire their usual 1000dps at the dread who then redirects and increases the damage into a beam which does massive damage.
7/14/2010,"yep, pretty standard functionality that's missing."
7/14/2010,"ouch. similar thing happened to a friend of mine in his golem once. and a corpmate once warped out to our pos in 0.0, ejected, boarded a new ship, then dc'd and logged back back in to find his domi had been destroyed in the belt he warped out of.of course, the logs showed nothing."

7/14/2010,"oh yes. a boost lowsec thread. don your flameproof suits. grab the napalm canisters.anyways, my idea was kinda simple: reduce refining in highsec stations to a max of, say, 90%, but leave the 100% refine in low/nullsec npc stations. yay incentives.actually, that was my first idea. here's the next one:make research/copying/manufacturing/invention/whatever other blueprint thing i missed decently faster and/or cheaper in low/nullsec npc stations.yay, another incentive for industrialists to go to low and nullsec.there you go. those are my ideas for making lowsec more appealing, now go ahead and flame away as you wish. it won't matter, because i'll be gone for a few days and can't reply anyways. and it's late, which is probably why this thread makes less sense than it would if i were sober/alert. also proposing that ccp introduces t2 exotic dancers. but i'll save that for another thread."
7/14/2010,"if you have read the ccp-csm meeting minutes you would have noticed that ccp is unhappy with the ""easy"" 100% refining everywhere. so probably you will get your wish in one form or another. not that it will do anything as mining in low sec is not worth it (too risky for the return) and no one (or at least very few) will mine in high sec and move the ore in low sec for refining.low sec research stations are already used without the need for any incentive. the problem is that people using them will put up a long research job, possibly 1 month long, and will go in low sec only to recover the bpo and eventual copies. so faster research in low sec will not mean more people there, simply it will mean that in 1 month a bpo would be researched for more pe or me. and remember that with the right skills it is possible to start and deliver a research job from a long distance.edit:in the minutes: ccp will not do anything for low sec for at least 18 months."
7/14/2010,that is your idea?are you sure you haven't read that in ccp-csm meeting?

7/14/2010,"read the op again, he is not talking about cycling characters at all. (i realize its hard to open ones mind to a terrible idea like this...)"
7/14/2010,"the difference between carebear alts and suicide ganking throwaway alts? suicide ganking alts r throwaway, which means sp training time spent and isk on skillbooks repeatedly every cycle. and how many times does this have to be done for carebear alts? once. that's why hiding behind a carebear alt when things aren't going their way should have risks and consequences 'cause not every carebear alt is from a carebear main (aka pirate main). of course, u probably knew this last part already since u probably fit this description."
7/14/2010,"ok maybe safe is the wrong word here but the main thing is that it's too easy for suicide gankers, can flippers etc to hide in the npc corporations. as if we want we can't war dec them. the basic idea is equal out possibilities. as i said we not against it, we will not like it, but it's part of the game. we just want them out of the npc corporations so those corporations where the character belong to can be war dec'd.the points made earlier about the haulers and freighters. yeah we overlooked that issue and we thanking to put it up to make the idea more suitable. we gonna work on that as well."
7/14/2010,"tons of 0.0 has no sov. why? because nobody can hold onto it; mostly because they cant easily become allied with the block in the area. if you show up... you get spanked out of the area.lowsec getting sov will be even worse. you literally cant ally the area. the resources are all claimed more or less; the resources arent even worth fighting over most of the time.want to fix lowsec? you have to fix why people dont go there. i think the resources are sufficient. we need to eliminate the piracy part; not remove it, but nerf it. furthermore we need to fix the sec hit problem. sec hit should apply only to piracy.if i go to destroy someone's tower.. i lose sec. nobody should lose sec nor go flashy. nor should the defenders.if my 100man group fights another 100man fleet. the first group's fc calls his primary who isnt flashy while the other fleet calls a person who isnt flashy. everyone then goes flashy and loses lots of sec. when none of that should be happening."
7/14/2010,"low-sec is just that, low-sec. there's still the wardec mechanism for getting out of the sec status drops, but dealing with those sec status decreases is part of unsanctioned fighting in empire space.the problem(s) with low-security space at the moment imo:1. insufficient financial motive to go there, you can make more money mining veldspar, and l4's are readily available in high-security space (not to mention the need for increased security or evasion would wipe out any potential profit margin.)2. the tendency of everyone in low-sec to kos, even if for no other reason than killmails.now as a noob, why would i want to leave high-sec to deal with getting killed all the time to pull less money than i could in high-sec? low security needs work, but i don't think adding sovereignty is the way to it. it's still part of the 4 empires."
7/14/2010,"to address this: first and foremost, this is not an extension of nullsec sov. low sec sov as i propose it differs in a few (critical) ways.first, sovereignty will not be tied to sbu's or alliance assets. it is critical that low sec sov be different in this respect, otherwise, there is no difference between lowsec sov and nullsec sov. low sec must function differently than nullsec, it must create an environment favorable to lowsec activities, and in some way impede nullsec and high sec activity.the low sec activity that i envision would revolve around the criminal economy. it would open up new income sources, which are balanced by risks inherent in lowsec, namely, piracy. according to the csm minutes on the topic, lowsec should favor criminal outlaw activity, and it should favor corporations versus alliances. what i would like to see is unallied corporations operating a criminal stargate and station network that exists alongside legitimate gates/stations. the point is that the illicit network will have no immediate impact on legit networks with the exception of the (hopefully) increased population. this obviously envisions more ppl coming to low sec and taking advantage of these assets.to be more specific, i envision:criminal stargates: you've seen the missions, they're there in the mission deadspace pockets. the only thing we would have to do is connect the stargate to a destination stargate, in another deadspace pocket in another system, voila, underground gate system! you can even charge for access to others via standings or tollbooth systems.criminal stations: booster lab production, criminal npc agents, and the regular fare (repairshop, lp store, etc). if criminal npc's exist in deadspace pockets in hi-sec, why is it so hard to imagine them being in low sec? again, as with the criminal gates, we can just use existing dungeons and just open up the stations with docking rights, etc.criminal complexes: i'd like to see some expansion of exploration into the criminal realm. perhaps we could see some concord or empire faction navy plexes, i.e. shoot them for some sort of bounty, make them rats all the same. why should ""good"" rats be any different than ""bad"" rats? we could pick up those faction or concord tags for lp rewards, buy orders, etc from the criminal npc's. i already get sec status hit by taking out gallente as a caldari pilot. why wouldn't i just go to gayllente lowsec and kill them off just for the tags? (idk much about fw, so idk how closely this mirrors fw mechanics)that said, low sec sov must not be an extension of nullsec sov. the way i see it, there must be a mechanic that favors small scale gang combat, and impedes large scale combat in such a way that alliances won't even consider attempting capturing low sec sov. to this end, i recommend (again) limiting lowsec sov to unallied corps, and getting a sov mechanic in place where you cannot bring a blob, perhaps a ticket system on acceleration gates into a deadspace pocket or series of pockets, a sort of ""arena"" if you will, with a limited number of ships on each side, and each side must plant some sort of flag or something (does this sound like fw?)the bottom line is this: lowsec inhabitants will have low sec status by virtue of their activities. once you go pirate it'll be hard to go back (for a while), making this a ""career"" and not just a hobby. living dangerously will be a given for these people."
7/14/2010,"something i want to clarify is how the current stargates/stations would exist parallel to the criminal ones.a normal traveler with high sec status jumps thru a gate into the ""pirate"" system. they do not see criminal sov. they do not see anything other then the standard concord/faction sanctioned gates/stations. they can warp to the station or gates of their choosing and dock or move on. exactly as it is today.a criminal corporation member (that has sov in this system) jumps into system. they have another o/v folder or setting that allows them to see the criminal sov of that system as well as the illicit gates/stations in addition to the standard gates/stations. they can warp to the regular or illicit gates/stations. when warping to the illicit gate/station beacon, they arrive at an acceleration gate which will require a password or tag, then get accelerated into a deadspace pocket with the gate/station.a capsuleer with good standings to the criminal corporation jumps into system. they also have nav charts to the illicit gates/stations. once they arrive at the acceleration gate, they get charged a certain amount determined by the criminal corporation, to either personal or corporation wallet (if permission is set for that purpose), and can access that gate for travel purposes. they could also access the station, with the possibility of a charge for that as well.now, as far as contesting sov, i was still pondering that, but this is the current idea i have as to how to implement that.a capsuleer with bad or neutral standings to the criminal corporation jumps into a system. to contest sov, they probe down the arena and set about accessing it. the acceleration gate limits both ship/size and number of pilots through that gate. this would put the two forces on equal footing. say this gate is set up for [cruiser or smaller], 3 tickets. three pilots in cruiser size or smaller ships can enter on the hostile side and plant a flag, which sets off a counter. both sides must be at their gates awaiting a countdown timer which opens both the hostile gate and the occupant gate (which has the same constraints as the hostile gate, 3x cruiser or smaller) and the two sides duke it out until the winning sides annihilates the other and plants a flag which counts down and resets sov.this would of course make it necessary to engage in combat regularly, but my guess is that those who naturally gravitate to lowsec would probably enjoy this system. of course those carebears who want to avoid pvp will not like it, but i really don't think lowsec should be be as appealing per se to the carebears."

7/14/2010,"do you actually have any changes/fixes in mind?i've spent a lot of time in fw (1600 kills with amarr militia), and i'm really not sure what changes are needed.not saying that improvement isn't possible, just that this proposal seems to be lacking in actual ideas."
7/14/2010,"wtf are you talking about ? i'm talking about making fw a higher priority than right now - not a list of fix. seems like its gonna be left over for 18 months or so.theres a whole list of things to change, csm is aware, ccp is aware of it. i wont repeat myself. just look and search. especially in the meeting minutes"
7/14/2010,"i visited that station today, yup its on fire. im sure its not the station that had an eplosion i few months ago. you say this station got like thisa few years ago in some story lol? wow ccp... u can still dock in it like a new station lol makes no sense.the only thing thats effected in eve is my wallet, sec status, player rage, and things blowing up. these scope news articles do nothng.. sansha arent attacking and kidnaping ppl ingame u have to makebelieve.i know ppl have player sansha corperations and act like they are sansha or something like that. idk what thats like."
7/14/2010,andbasically (needed bump to reinforce quotes)
7/14/2010,"yep was same as you, boasting how awesome eve is. now if a friend asked me about it or anyone i would tell them not to bother. i mean there vids are good for the expansions but i point out to friends that game would crash, and you be lucky to get into game if involved in big fleet fights. hell it pointless trying to fight with 100 in system these days."
7/14/2010,"i've been playing eve since 2003/4 and i can honestly say that if i was still having to pay real money, instead of being able to buy plexes with isk, i would have cut my losses some time ago.the only thing that keeps me here now is the fact that the game is - in effect - only costing my time. time spent chatting to friends while making my 80mil a week target.the things that originally attracted me to the game have been left to wither on the vine and the new stuff always comes in broken and gets forgotten after 6 - 8 months."
7/14/2010,"from reading the minutes; best i understand; what the csm were(are) asking for, is to do just bugs/hardening/spit 'n polish development, for a release cycle.personally, i would be happy with 1 ""expansion"" per year going to polishing older content. even if it was 1 every other year.edit: quote is from this post"
7/14/2010,i dont understand why it is ccp think they need to wait for expansions before they can fix stuff. why not have a seperate team working on making small fixes. a small patch every couple of weeks to fix probelms. just show us your doing something about the existing problems. 18 months before any real fixes. how can they even think it's alright to say that. eve is a great game. i have never played one game for so long. it does seem like broken things never get looked at or fixed. after 12 months without sound i'm just glad my sound is working again.
7/14/2010,a 29 page wall of text i'm not reading because i can sum it up in bullet points:a) the game is brokenb) ccp can't do anything because of a crappy console fpsc) it will remain so for along time to come and theres not alot you can do about itdo i get a cookie?
7/14/2010,"there's a beauty to this mess:- players keep playing eve -> eve remains profitable -> management stays the course -> players lose- players quit en masse -> eve gets into the negative -> eve gets shut down -> players losethere's a chance that enough but not too many players quit to make management take notice, take the right actions and get eve back on track. pretty slim if you ask me. so, will eve go the way of 9 out of 10 mmos?"
7/14/2010,"there's other things of significance in there, plus a few scattered gems of good news, but yeah, you've got the core of it."
7/14/2010,"the pdf link appears to be broken at the moment; it worked for me yesterday. anyone else seeing a message like ""file does not begin with %pdf-"" trying to open it?"
7/14/2010,something has broken. instead of the pdf it is returning a html page about the pdf. because the url ends in .pdf your browser is just passing it as is to the pdf viewer which is unable to display it.i will try to find out what has happened...
7/14/2010,really embarrassing for ccp and depressing for the rest of us.hopefully this debacle will force ccp to realise that a relatively small effort from them to fix even the really easy and frustrating problems would pay massive dividends in terms of community relations.edit: pulling the minutes off the website probably won't help
7/14/2010,a new version of the pdf should be uploaded. i have alerted the proper authorities and this should be fixed asap. apologies for any delay.
7/14/2010,"it better be identical :p by all means change the shiny stuff like logos, but not any contents :p"
7/14/2010,"i might be in need of a tinfoil hat, but just a note; the original version is safely on my disk and i will be comparing the two for any ninja edits."
7/14/2010,"what changed, if this is a new version?"
7/14/2010,"could you define ""new version"" please? there were some pretty glaring spelling errors that i could understand you wanting to sort out.will there be a change-log and have the csm been consulted about the changes?"
7/14/2010,"original version, just in case they accidentally the original and didn't save a copy :pbtw, it lacked logos and such :/"
7/14/2010,"i did a cursory comparison between what's downloadable now and what is saved on my 2nd pc and saw no difference, so it seems to be the same file. :puts the tinfoil hat away:"
7/14/2010,"wow, the drama resulting form the latest csm minutes is better than the game itself. it has all the needed features; intrigues, lack of trust, lies, damn lies, layoffs, incompetence, extortion, threats you name it.ccp has certainly lost the ball when it comes to customer trust."
7/14/2010,a quick diff shows 3 lines were changed and in each case it was to add to (or correct) the list of ccp who attended.
7/14/2010,"isn't it better to admit now that the csm is a nice idea in theory but in actuality it really is a marketing exercise to demonstrate engagement with the customer base to defuse tensions and encourage subscription retention?ultimately ccp develop and run the game and so decisions will always reflect their interests, ambitions and vision. players are no doubt heard from forum posts, feedback and petitions and it is unlikely ccp is not aware of what frustrates them as demonstrated in alot of the feedback from the meetings.i'd rather see regular state of the game blogs from senior developers encompassing design vision and stated aims than continue to push the facade that is the csm, a group that from voting figures doesn't even enjoy the full confidence and support of the player base.the latest minutes just seem to confirm the obvious and the real influence is exercised by players and their choice over whether to subscribe or not. i for one continue to trust ccp to support their creation and unlike some companies (soe **cough cough**) they genuinely do seem to care about the game as more than a financial endevour.anyway just a thought after reading."
7/14/2010,"after reading through the minutes (and some sections more than once), i'm left with mixed feelings about ccp, the actual effectiveness of the csm, and the future of eve in general.i'm all for incarna personally and have been anticipating it for a long time, but after reading the responses from the devs at the meeting, incarna is not going to be anything like i (and probably many others) had envisioned and hoped for. incarna is going to be nothing more than a piece of fluff that has literally no game impact and will be left floundering in a semi-finished state shortly after it is released. there will be no interaction with dust players in the stations, no walking in your ships, and probably no walking on moons nor your pi complexes, etc. there will be no fighting or other activity other than pure socializing and playing mini games. the potential is there for incarna to be an outstanding addition to the eve universe, but i seriously doubt it will ever come close to that potential.the winter expansion that is supposed to be all about fixes and polish is also going to include new character models which will force every eve player to redo their avatars. this isn't just a shiny new feature or merely an upgrade, it is the precursor to incarna since with incarna, you will need full-bodied avatars and not just a head and shoulders pic. that in itself is a major undertaking and doesn't involve just graphics. so where is the time and manpower coming from for the 'fixes & polish' they say is going to be the focus of that winter expansion? i fully expect that there will be some, but i'll bet my bottom dollar that those fixes and polish won't include any of the major issues (i.e. fw, lowsec space, learning skills, bounty hunting & smuggling, lag, imbalances of weapons and ammo, useless ships, etc.).18 months in the gaming world is a long, long time. there are a lot of games on the horizon, many anticipated by the same type of player that plays eve. ccp claims that data doesn't support the assumption that polished content retains more players and sells more subs than does new features and additions. that is just ludicrous. how many games have failed due to poor maintenance and half-finished features? how many games have languished with a small player base due to broken promises of improvement and updated features while rolling out update after update of things the players care nothing about and fixing things that aren't broken (the new plex revision is a great example)?the data doesn't support it simply because there is no mmo developer with the gonads to attempt an entire expansion of nothing but fixes and polish. if ccp truly wants to commit to excellence as their new motto for the year states, then stall dust 514 and incarna for a period and commit the resources and manpower to fixing and polishing the basic eve. my guess is that the media and the gamers would eat it up. ccp would be hailed as truly innovative and committed to excellence and i'd bet that the subs for eve would go up as well as a higher interest in dust 514 when it is released.my gut feeling is that the devs and management are beginning to lose interest in eve after all of these years. dust 514 and wod are becoming the focus and incarna is just a way of placating the many players (whether a majority or a very vocal minority) who have been clamoring for it since the beginning. many, if not most, of the devs no longer even play the game, they have lost touch with the players, csm is nothing more than a figurehead of the players that really has no power to get anything done, and all of the major issues with the game are more or less ignored.i'm currently only playing eve. i happen to like most of the devs and the game is still, imo, one of the best on the market today, but its future is beginning to worry me. i've played many mmos and other genres in my gaming lifetime and have witnessed many go down this same path. i hope i'm wrong."
7/14/2010,"some things to consider if youre planning on running:many csm candidates have an expert knowledge in a certain area e.g. low sec, sov wars, economics etc so don't get paranoid that you know too little. try to see what you consider is wrong with the area of eve you play and base your campaign on the changes you would like to seekeep your message clear and keep it short. consider that there will be who knows how many candidates running against you and that the voters will have to troll through their messages as well. summarise your campaign message so that it isn't skipped over. tl:dr is not your friend.use multiple tools to get your message across. podcasts, personal blogs, video message, in-game mails and chat channels, interviews with mmo websites, forums.... all of these can be used to make your name widely known.check your work! it is a constant source of amusement to me that people will spend hours on their campaign message but will f**k up the url to their blog. check and double check your work!thats some of the basics of campaigning for the csm. if you want more detail on running a campaign then go back over the last couple of csm's and see what make the successful delegates stand out from the ones who fell by the way side.on a side note i did consider running for the next csm but after the recent csm headlines and reading blogs such as mynxee's life in low sec the idea had diminished somewhat. if you are successful then be prepared for frustration. best of luck to you."
7/14/2010,"as a long time player myself, i've also considered running in the past, but geographical distance, family responsibilities and more importantly available time are against me. and i guess that this is one serious consideration that potential csm candidates should realise; being on the csm is going to be a massive time-sink."
7/14/2010,"this right here was easily one of the most disturbing answers in the whole summary.if cost equaled excellence the new york rangers would have won 20 stanley cups, nasa would have parked a major city on ****ing pluto by now and waterworld would have been the next citizen kane.sure, spending heavy scratch on development shows that you are willing to foot the steep numbers required to make a quality game in this genre. however, that does not mean that said resources are being used appropriately."
7/14/2010,"you reckon? 5 starters for every leaver? that's a serious exponential growth. unsubbing due to poor product support is not rage-emo quitting.i doubt i am alone in this... my 5 day re-activation runs out shortly. i won't delete my characters because ccp might decide to do the necessary work on eve. if they sort eve out, i will definitely resub and ccp will definitely have my money. paying customers have a right to expect decent service. there's nothing about ""special"" in all this. many subscribers have put up with paying for what they consider to be a poorer service because ccp said that the problems would be addressed. now ccp are saying that the problems must remain for at least a year - more likely two years."
7/14/2010,those 5 people do not join because i leave.it's not like you have to wait for an open seat so you can join.a lost customer is a lost customer.losing her/him and getting 5 new customers is not better than not losing her/him and getting 5 new customers.
7/14/2010,about sums it up really
7/14/2010,these minutes are a depressing read. while the csm seems to have done their job ccp's attitude is deplorable.
7/14/2010,except its their money and not yours.
7/14/2010,"mynxee, is the presentation you gave (""making low sec matter"") available publicly?"
7/14/2010,"true, that's the one thing that bothers me about the sig. still, it gets at the crux of the issue - this game is broken, and they're refusing to fix it for stupid reasons."
7/14/2010,"they are not refusing to fix it. they will do small fixes and stuff inbetween. people read the minutes like ccp said ""we will do nothing except incarna for the next 18 month"" and that is not true. what they said is they wont be doing resource-heavy (big) stuff/fixes until after 18 months."
7/14/2010,"it's so hard to read your posts without translating ""they"" as ""we"".-liang"
7/14/2010,"tbh i have no problem with shc people confusing me with a ccp dev. as long as the gm's dont approach me and say something like i'd pretend being a dev.in short, believe what you want, conspiracy theories ftw."
7/14/2010,"...maybe. it's not as if previous csms had raised extensive lists of issues already... (this blog post has a nice summary on the csm4 issues.)and we all have our long-standing favourites... small ones like perhaps overview ghosts (you know, those non-existing ships that only disappear when you refresh the overview by pressing tab twice). or the brilliant ui choices like having destructive actions right next to often-used actions on right-click menues (really, really hard to fix). or bigger ones like the missing iterations on the new sov concept that has been introduced with oh-so-great expectations (never mind that people constantly have to petition broken sov structures - and don't even get me started on factional warfare). or perhaps a working forum that has been promised for years...instead we have great new features like planetary interaction, which is about as immersive as a small cup of warm water. (from a company that has phrases like ""a virtual reality is about true human interaction and true human emotions in a living and evolving world."" on their web page...) oh my."
7/14/2010,"there is allways gonna be new features. and there is also allways gonna be bugs. that doesnt mean that no bugs get fixed tho. all you need to do is read back through the changelogs of the patches. in every patch some things get fixed. even tho you might all say that bug fixing is more important then new features, truth is: if ccp would only bug fix for a year and not release new features, they would loose more subscribers over that. and if you were to really adress all bugs, you would need serveral years like that."
7/14/2010,"i stand by my previous post. they make poke and prod a bit, but they aren't doing anything that even approximates making an attempt to fix the game."
7/14/2010,do that. :)
7/14/2010,"not spitting on them at all - we have just been pointing out the whole irrelevancy thing - you know how they meet, publish notes, nothing happens, rinse & repeat. it's like the old adage, if you are doing something pointless and it results in nothing, why do you keep doing it? anyway, there are lots of means for the player base to get their info across to ccp, they just don't need the cool kids to do it for them.and you seem do seem to delight in spending time trying to poke holes in the whole idea that they are somehow relevant, and will grasp at any little straw waving in the wind, brandishing it for all to see as the proof as to your view. but hey, irrelevance does as irrelevance will do."
7/14/2010,"i point out the actual serious logical and factual flaws of your argument, and instead you'd like to pretend that it's ""foot stamping and arm waving"". i guess when you can't address an honest argument, you can start flamebaiting. just like you admitted that you were spitting on the csm and said it was justified because they were volunteers who'd signed up for the job and nobody put a gun against their head... and then you turned right around and denied what you're just admitted. but your comments are still on the record: all your nonsense about major 0.0 alliances staffing smaller ones with their alts and thus the csm is a conspiracy of 0.0 alliances, that the csm is indefensible and its members know that, and that it's perfectly valid to posit a conspiracy and question the loyalty and motives of all the csm members. and that's just on the last two pages of this thread alone. we get it. you don't like the csm, and you're willing to make up anything that supports your preconceived notions. okay. the csm has an uphill battle to fight in order to give a voice to the playerbase, including you. and you're doing your part to make it harder. good job."
7/14/2010,"thanks, we all contribute in whatever way we can"
7/14/2010,which csm owns the finn alt?
7/14/2010,"bah. everybody knows that sok is my alt. however, i am vuk's alt. you know how those nc folks stick together."
7/14/2010,bitter ccp employ spotted
7/14/2010,i hadn't seen this thread before. i had no idea that anyone could actually be this sincerely sycophantic...
7/14/2010,just check out the posting history of the op. it's no surprise.
7/14/2010,"google tells me that ""excellence is the state or quality of excelling. particularly in the field of business and organizations, excellence is considered to be an important value, and a goal to be pursued"". it goes on to tell me that ""excelling is to surpass someone or something; to be better or do better than someone or something; to be much better than others"". so - excellence is to be much better than others.the recent csm minutes have left many - including me - feeling incredibly depressed. really, has ccp given up on us? have they given up on excellence? no polish, no bug fixes, no exploit fixes - nothing for 18 months.. until these unwanted dust/incarna features are released?well... maybe they haven't given up on excellence. you just have to look at it from the right direction to see it. let's start by examining some excellent things that eve has:the player run economy. i know that certain people, usually people who have spent lots of time looking at the market or economy can potentially dispute the ""player run"" and ""economy"" parts. yes, ccp controls the isk faucets/sinks and the material inputs... but the players do the rest. we even have a real economist studying the game economy. really... it is excellence.epic alliances, wars, and fleets. i remember a long time ago, when i was in corus of dawn (which became youwhat) there was an alliance mail detailing the bob vs nc war and all the implications of what each battle meant. the person who wrote it obviously had a spy ring, and come to find out that spy rings, epic tempers, personality flaws, personality cults, emo rage, and an enormous amount of player blood, sweat, and tears are all but the start of this. really... it is excellence.i could go on, but for the sake of brevity i'll stop here. we can all point to our favorite fight, mission, loot drop, blueprint, ship, espionage, corp theft, etc. that's why we're here. because we love eve. and now we - through the csm - are saying that eve isn't excellent. we point at fleet lag, the new sov system, faction warfare, cosmos, low sec, and much more. things that to us reek of being unfinished. and we look at the resources taken from this and given to dust/incarna and think ccp has given up on excellence.but i think that ccp is still devoted to excellence - a dream that is all consuming and perfect. the desire to go anywhere, do anything from shooting people on planets to serving drinks in bars. should ccp truly restrict the sandbox to purely internet spaceships? well, i don't think so - so long as they don't neglect internet spaceships.i think that what we have is a failure to communicate properly. most of the major outstanding problems mentioned in the csm minutes are pretty minor on the whole. fleet lag is killer, and resources are already being devoted to it. faction warfare exploits are rampant and low sec sucks - and ccp doesn't deny these things. they do want to fix them. but they don't have the resources to do it excellently.what i'm going to argue here is that ccp does have the resources to fix these things with excellence. many people in this game are experts on their fields of interest - and these are untapped resources that can be used to remove the overwhelming bulk of the ""grunt work"" from the teams. we can come up with solutions that can be completed by a scrum team in weeks instead of months.what this really gives us - all of us, including ccp - is the excellence we seek. and nobody really gets left in the rain, and dust/incarna pipelines aren't appreciably taken away from.ccp: delivering 80% now is better excellence than perfection after dust and incarna!-liang"
7/14/2010,"what you have is a catch-22 situation in that most of us who have been playing eve forever (i know, i know...) and hoping for fixes, are so far gone as to having much faith in ccp that we just play the game and find a mediocrum of fun in what is.we could write up big and impressive ideas to collaborate on to improve the design of eve in areas we know well, in fact, we've done it. i can think of two topics off the top of my head...one on needed corp tool/ui improvements and another on pos functionality and ui improvements. oh, and did i mention that they've been there for *years* and not a bit of these topics have been implemented or even discussed with us by ccp?ccp, your original player base (2003, 2004) is either working at ccp, quit, or so apathetic we don't care what you do anymore. as long as i can ctrl-click and f1-f4, eve's working."
7/14/2010,"i agree that eve is excellent, and apparently csm are a bunch of self-important complainers. i mean its one thing for them to denounce ccp here on the forums, another thing entirely to show up in person and tell the human beings over there that they're failures because they haven't solved lag or something."
7/14/2010,are you lana torrin?
7/14/2010,"here is one giant hole in your logic. last time i checked, fleet battles were borked and have been borked for 7 months. still not fixed. and still not going to get fixed. yep thats right the #1 advertising feature of eve are these epic wars which are currently unplayable. sounds excellent to me."
7/14/2010,"while i completely understand your point of view here, you have to understand that ccp didn't say they weren't going to fix fleet lag - instead they said that they are working on it. my post is mostly aimed at the overwhelmingly frustrating parts of the csm minutes where ccp isn't quite getting the optimal amount of excellence.there's a lot that can be done to improve the game with pretty minimal effort.-liang"
7/14/2010,the only part that gave me a glimmer of hope was the part about them trying to support more keyboard shortcuts in the ui and make things less clicky.
7/14/2010,liang nuren is david cameron. i wonder who is her equivalent of bumboy clegg?
7/14/2010,"minor nitpick:ccp advertises it (for a good while now) as ""player driven economy"" (as in, ""the source of motive power driving it"", not ""the guy behind the steering wheel""), and that is quite accurate, players are the fuel for the economy engine, while ccp is the one that controls the direction.back to the op's point...while theoretically and at first read sounding like a very reasonable idea, i seriously doubt ccp will ever be willing to ""unload the grunt work"" over on their players, without having a serious degree of control over them. just look at the csm, which is actually more removed from the development process than those hypothetical players helping ccp scrum teams would be, and they still had to go through the nda thing and talk face-to-face to really get anything even remotely done (and we already had one booted for allegedly breaking the nda, about something so minor we don't even really know what it was).now imagine what would happen if some of the players ""doing the grunt work"" would quietly let some friends or friends of friends know about possible upcoming changes nobody else in the game knows about.realistically speaking, i don't think it would end well if you try to do it that way.short of hand-picking players and actually giving them a job (which, again, i have a feeling they don't really have the budget for) in order to be able to keep them on a tight leash, it's nearly pointless to even fantasize about it, sadly.sure, it could maybe work for some specific areas of the game, but since a lot of things are linked together in ways which only become apparent later on... well, you probably get the idea.tl;dr :it was a very idealistic and nice idea, but the practical implementation of it would be a total balls-breaker.the alternative of throwing more money at it would be feasible, however most likely not budgeted for."
7/14/2010,"you're far too idealistic mate, there's no way the player base could be trusted with specifics of the game.what ccp need to do is have members of staff that actually play the game and not just plsying the game in jove space\empire\solo.create an alt on the db, give it what ever age you want to give it, faux a back storey for kms etc (surely that's not too hard with direcet access to the server) apply to some of the larger alliances and come fly fleet then tell us there's no lag.go run cosmos missions and tell us they're fine.go join a pirate corp and trawl lowsec.go and actually try doing any of the things that we keep screaming about.gah, i'm trapped in the circle again, this isn't suppose to start till monday <U+FFFD><U+FFFD>**** it, i'm gonna go play civ 1"
7/14/2010,"well... i think that there are parts of the player base that could be trusted. ultimately the selected players' responsibility would be to come up with solutions which are simple to implement - it doesn't have to be super fancy just something that'll make it work until ccp can get around to making it perfect - which they won't do because 80-90% of the benefit can come from a 5% solution at this point.its not that i don't agree entirely with your post.... but i got into a ""discussion"" with my wife and realized that maybe the source of ccp's problem is that they want perfection while we want something that works. and how can we get that - hopefully without further alienating the ccp development staff?also: if only that were true i think things would be a lot better on many fronts.-liang"
7/14/2010,"while the original intentions may have been altruistic, over time, it will breed nepotism accusations and further segregate the community into an inner circle/outer circle camps. nice idea, but it doesn't work quite well with us humans.i must admit, there are a lot of talented players out there that would happily spend their hobby time supporting and making eve better in numerous ways. this is an untapped resource. what may be acceptable is a form of an oversight committee, leading, guiding and cataloguing this resource. in the simplest term, think of it as a heavily/draconianly moderated f & i forum with mentors and heavy devs feedback.you need to get the culture going before the rest of the pack will follow."
7/14/2010,"rather than talking about how the players might be able to provide better solutions, why don't we come up with better solutions? that's what the features & ideas forum is for, after all.i too would love it if the csm was taken seriously by ccp as an actual stakeholder, in the order of at least a ""chicken"" in the typical scrum methodology ""pigs & chickens"" scenario. it's a fact of life that people will be tempted to abuse their privileges - t20 did it that we know of, and two csm members have broken their nda agreement that we know of. these are just identified risks that ccp needs to deal with - many of their developers also play the game, so it's going to happen again - and not try to over-insulate themselves from by keeping the csm at arm's length.in the meantime, keep trying to come up with suggestions as to how faction warfare, lowsec and nullsec can all be ""fixed"" in terms of gameplay, and trust ccp to solve the technical problems of making huge fleet fights playable.features & ideas, assembly hall, csm - these are the tools we already have at our disposal to change this game for the better."
7/14/2010,"that's not the way player ui design works at all. there is absolutely no access to any server code and no confidential information is required.it does work and its been done successfully for years. it was stated as one of the key reasons for another games growth. it simply needs a scripting language, which is very easy to amend, such as lua. it's even free for ccp. its a simple language that allows fonts, colours, positioning and all the elements of a ui with absolutely no change or knowledge needed of the server side code. it also very versatile as ccp can control easily any of the lua features it does not want to use.when i came here from the other game the first thing i noticed in eve is how terribly designed the ui is and it puts many people off playing. that's a shame.many eve players are so used to the ui now they don't always realise the shameful state of the game ui compared to even basic, free mmorpg's you get these days.ccp must know this or do they only look at eve? i can only assume they have decided its too much effort to correct. that means this game will have a limited shelf life and has no change in hell of getting beyond a certain level of subscriptions."
7/14/2010,"the sad thing is, ccp's playerbase would be more than happy to improve the ui for them. all ccp have to do is make the ui moddable and we'll do the rest."
7/14/2010,"some things new to eve have been awesome, some sub optimal. wormholes were the last really good thing brought in, but quite a few new things in game have been pretty average and with planetary interaction i think i can here the sound of the bottom of the creative barrel being sc****d.as a longtime player i would love ccp to spend a year polishing whats already in game, improving server architecture and then finishing off a few of the things they put in (fw, cosmos, pi,low sec, 5th subsystem for t3 etc.)it's still the best game out there for my hard earned pounds. the combination of setting, relative lack of big brother control, action and consequence, social engineering and sleipnirs is just made of win."
7/14/2010,"while i agree that this would enable the playerbase to do some of the improvement work ccp doesn't want to do, it also opens a can of worms regarding cheats, macros etc."
7/14/2010,"hell, for a large portion of it, not even scripting or modding would be required  give us a clear understanding of the capabilities and constraints of the ui system and we can build static or animated mock-ups of it.while some complex options screens would require a bit more (i'm looking at you corp role interface), a vast portion of the current ui problems is a matter of poor placement and grouping of ui elements; poor colour and contrast choices; unintuitive symbology and iconography; poor font choices etc  none of which needs to be ""live"" to be redesigned and which can be done ""on paper""."
7/14/2010,i agree with that.which makes it even more impressive that nothing is done to improve the ui.
7/14/2010,"i think most of frustration and whining on the player side are because ccp doesn't communicate what they are doing regarding the issues we care about even when they may have a bunch of devs full-time on it.here is an idea: use scrum artifacts to your advantage. ccp should be doing sprint review meetings where each team present what they got done a the end of the sprint... just have a pr guy sit on these meetings and put what he can reveal in a periodic dev blog for us.this means, if ccp is doing, let's say 2 week sprints, we have a biweekly sprint-review devblog to tame the whiners edit: rephrased the whole thing after drinking some coffee"
7/14/2010,"why yes, i suppose it would be terrible for the game if the client allowed cheating and macroing. gosh, that'd be awful."

7/14/2010,"a lot of really good feedback here, but i'm not sure you're really running any more risk of nepotism than we do with the csm, fanfest, or just living in iceland. i think at this point its really important to give ccp easy options with which they can achieve something either at or very near excellence.perhaps a process could work something like:ccp forum post/dev blog:we are spending the next scrum cycle on faction warfare and we're asking for ideas from the player base on what they'd like to see fixed or improved. remember to keep this relatively simple - we aren't overhauling faction warfare at this time and we're only devoting one cycle to this before we move on to the next issue brought up by the csm. get your ideas in here (subforum link) in the next week! things will be heavily moderated and the developers will give heavy feedback on appropriate ideas.player 1:faction warfare should be completely redone! you guys suck raaaage /moderator deletes topic and bans the player from the forums for 6 weeks.player 2:hey so if you toned down the ecm on the caldari rats it would help a lot. /15 supports, 25 not supportsplayer 3:hey so if you just *removed* rats from the plexes and made lots more of them it would help a lot. /18 supports, 100 not supportsplayer 4:hey, think you guys could fix the remote-repair-your-flashy-friend-and-take-a-faction-hit bug? /100 supports, 3 not supportsccp:we've decided that we really like the suggestions from player 2 and player 4 and we're going to run with them. stay tuned and we'll post updates every friday afternoon before going home!week 1: we fixed the remote repair bug and started on the plex timers. turns out there was a bug in the timer code.week 2: we finished fixing plex timers, and we lowered the frequency of these 5 npcs.week 3: we fixed a couple of exploits we received via bug reports.week 4: we fixed a few more exploits. it's out the door to qa. if all goes well expect it to hit the server soon(tm)week 6: it's through qa, with a few minor fixes. this will be released in tyrannis 1.2 on 2010-08-01! thanks for the help guys!come on ccp - giving us the 80/20 solution now is better excellence than waiting years for perfection!-liang"
7/14/2010,"i doubt the op was talking (only//mainly) about ui design, and i certainly wasn't talking about ui design at all.ui design is actually one of those ""it could maybe work"" areas i was mentioning, but that would require some major redesigns in the way the ui is handled in the first place and the way the client ""talks"" to the server (just see the recent python-injection-or-whatever-it-was exploit debacle for one example of things that can go ugly) so that things really become the way you describe it.right now, if full access to the ui was given, you could probably code (eventually) insanely efficient mining bots (amongst other things), enhance pvp situation awareness beyond anything available in the current client, maybe even write down some networked pvp bots. i can almost see a hybrid multi-account client where the owner is controlling dozens of pilots in a rts-style pvp op, or maybe alliances requiring people that do enter into fleet ops to install the ui plugin that slaves their clients into the fc's custom client or god knows what else.it's nowhere as simple as you seem to think it is, there are serious potential consequences that must be considered."
7/14/2010,"the problem with the minutes from iceland is that they left ccp and the csm with a bad public image. both parties failed to inspire confidence. both parties failed to provide something, a token treat even, to be viewed as a positive. instead, we only heard what we are not getting from the document.just reading that the dev staff was alienated and angry in response to elected player reps (who provoked a scene) makes me cringe. it shouldnt have happened that way.woe is me! its christmas! and all they left me was a dirty old pdf *phooey!*i dont blame ccp for wanting to integrate dust and incarna before looking at other major changes to code. once done, they can look at the more complete game they desire to offer and polish the whole. along the way some of the major issues may be resolved simply as part of the process.in truth, there is so much no in the document that its easy to lose track of what unsaid or noted as an affirmative. we only know for sure that no major changes to code will occur right now. some fixes might be on tap.really, for me the most redeeming feature of the iceland minutes was amusement generated by some of the things you suspect were covered up by summary blurbs. true or not."
7/14/2010,"as luck would have it, this very morning, while taking a break after an extended session of self-important complaining, i wrote a blog posting addressing the very issue of how ccp could use the csm and player expert focus groups to iterate design proposals."
7/14/2010,"off topic:the thing is that thee is no guarantee that they will go back and polish what needs it once dust and incarna are done. the meeting in question, in which ccp was asked to""commit to excellence"" got nothing of the sort from ccp. all we got, and i quote, was:whats to say that the execs at ccp won't be distracted by their next 'big idea' and forget about excellence all together. the thing to to do is not to let them forget, keep the pressure on, keep reminding them. there have been many blog posts and forum posts regarding this already. we need to keep at them, constantly, permanently. and when subscriber numbers start to fall we can say ""we told you so, turn the lights out when you leave. kthxbai.""all that we we the players, through our representatives on the csm wanted to take from that meeting was a committment, a promise, a pledge. what we got was a 'probably' and some guff about spending more on development than other companies. we don't care about other companies, or other games for that matter. we care about eve and the ccp execs need to get their head around that and get back to caring about eve as well instead of their bank accounts and anonymous statistics. stop looking at the bottom line and come back to the game you created, and which you used to give a damn aboutthe csm haven't got a bad public image from this, they did what we asked them to in the most supported thread in the history of the assembly hall. ccp have got themselves a bad image from this and it is all their own doing. it was quite clear from the minutes that there are no resources for even minor fixes and anything that does get fixed is a side-effect of other projects (the graphics fixes and memory leaks detailed in a recent dev blog for example, came from the mass testing being donn in an effort to figure out how to fix the lag problem).that being said, hats off to ccp for releasing the mintues at all, they were under no obligation to do so and the ****storm they're weathering now due to their release is far worse than the one that would have come from not doing so./rant overback on topic: ccp don't need players to help them fix eve, they have plenty of talented and passionate people working for them who want to fix eve and polish till they can see their faces in it, they're just not being allowed to."
7/14/2010,"seems kind of silly that the csm complains about not being taken seriously and then you have idiots emailing the contact individually rather than coordinating/communicating as a group. i don't know that ""no emails cept through chair"" is necessary, but posting all communication on the forum so the rest of the csm can see it seems like common sense."
7/14/2010,thank you!hopefully some people at the ccp management will wake up before it's too late.
7/14/2010,"i'm pretty sure that most people would have prefered the combined csm standing up, taking (especially) nathan and shacking him back into reality.the really hard thing is, though, that ccp bascially isn't wrong with most things that were said, but they basically always managed to aim at the heart of the problem, then turned around 180<U+FFFD>, shooted and proclaimed to have hit the target, but didn't actually check where the bullet landed.beyond that, the csm generally did as well as they could, under these circumstances."
7/14/2010,"they didn't for all the other csm ****ups - i still can't fathom why anyone expects this one to be any different (aside from breaking nda's and seeing some of the lovely attractions that iceland has to offer for free )and nah not mad, just very amused"
7/14/2010,"honestly, the most effective strategem at this point would be for a story to be run in massively, or better yet the ny times (which has run stories about the csm before) detailing the state of frustration that the csm/playerbase has with ccp and the state of disconnect ccp has from the csm/playerbase. might take some serious pull to get that sort of stuff in print, though."
7/14/2010,excellent suggestion. i really hope that something big catches this and eve loses a lot of new subscribers. maybe someone should give a well written tip to massively.
7/14/2010,i dont want eve to lose subscribers because ccp has poor strategy. i want eve to retain and increase subscriptions because ccp realise they need to rethink and change direction.
7/14/2010,"yes, and from what i have seen the one depends on the other."
7/14/2010,"thanks for the support here...and if not that, at least for caring enough to post an opinion whether pro or con. i'm not quite ready to give up on the csm process, the game, or ccp just yet but a lot depends on the nature and timeliness of ccp's responses to both players and csm between now and the december summit.also...lots of posts in this forum i want to reply to but work is easily 12 hrs a day this week and no web access from there either...at least, not to here. stuck with posting via iphone which is tedious at best! but just wanted to let ya know i'm reading."
7/14/2010,"in the resent minutes from the csm meetings in cpp hq, cpp sugested that csm work with players to come up with a vision for low sec. this would prolly be best served with a forum section dedicated to it, the missions thread had a pretty good low flame thread that shows people are willing to help with idea's.so for such a big project and to save differnt threads in differnt sections and as it seems their are people so fundermetaly opposed to csm they would keep quiet on what may be a good idea rather then post it in a csm forum, the only soloution would be a one forum for all low sec idea's.gen chat is only good for good posts bogged down by spam/flame/trolls idea's forum, just go and look how empty it is. so thats what i want and for cpp to be very heavy handed with trolls on it.me bad ment to post this is the other csm forum, could a mod possible put it their for me ty."
7/14/2010,"if this got its own forum section, then a dozen other game change categories would need their own forum sections too. that wouldn't be viable at all. just make a few threads, if you think one's not enough."
7/14/2010,"get a sticky in the f&i forum and a thread in the assembly hall to show general support with the sticky linked.have people post threads about their ideas in the f&i forum and have them linked into the sticky, popular and/or ideas with positive constructive feedback get linked in the op of the sticky.support threads about single ideas could also be made in the assembly hall to vote on which ideas are actually popular enough for greater exposure.it's a bit to and fro, but it is definitely possible to create a input flow on this with the existing forum sections."
7/14/2010,"but its only low sec that cpp have said they havnt got clue what to do with it that apsect it is already unique. both other secs they know what they want.yea its a mammoth task if people get on board, not a case of 1 person with that lightbulb idea, more 600 people all with their own lightbulb idea that thens needs either saying ""yea great"" or ""wont work becasue of blah blah"" and for sure its not just a csm burden and for all to be peachy it has to have input from the whole cummonity csm while do a good job under difficult circumstances are not yet at the stage where they even come close to representing the players of eve as a whole, maybe they can mod the forum or at leasat some of them can.maybe even have it as a thrid forum in the csm section, assemble hall, jita park speakers and then low sec something or other."
7/14/2010,"maybe we could use an external tool like google moderator which collects ideas and allows users to comment and vote on specific ideas, helping popular ones bubble to the top. i dunno. i just threw together an example:"
7/14/2010,"yea that sort of thing. we all been focused on the down side of the meeting mins and seem to have overlooked this part about wanting players to basicly make the vision for low sec, cpp could get some doesnt pr about giving players real game input, havnt ever seen areana net or blizzard say"" ok were putting a new map in, now you guys fill it and storyline it"""

7/14/2010,this is totally the first thread of its kind
7/14/2010,"salute it or shoot it - anyone emoraging quitting can be as rude as they like with their departing comments, but for those people working hard with ccp to improve our game (btw, thanks to you and ccp), there is no benefit in getting ccp defensive and argumentative (paraphrasing iirc nathan's reaction) and he does have a point - one can do an excellent job of implementing ten things of two-person-months effort each as well as two things of ten person-months each.caveat: i doubt there will be overly constructive dialog while the lag issue is so prominent. elsewhere, my interpretation was people were not so much saying that ccp did a bad job per se but rather they did not do enough of job. the former is an implementation issue; the latter is a planning/management issue.on a lighter note, ccp lucked out: youknowwho is saying ""one of the basic tenets of blizzard game design is that of concentrated coolness. wed rather have a simpler design with a lot of depth, than a complicated but shallow design."" once the eve playerbase realizes that blizzard is in favor of deeper design, there will be an immediate, vociferous outcry for shallow development from ccp."
7/14/2010,"it's hard to tell if anything would be better received than excellence. we'd have to get some first, so that we could compare."
7/14/2010,"i'd like them to add more depth to existing features instead of adding new shallow features. immersion needs depth, width does not do. after all, it's space, it should be deep in all directions."
7/14/2010,"i am led to believe that several of the csm members regularly blog about csm issues. unfortunately, i don't seem to be able to find a list of links to the blogs of the current csm members.would it be possible for csm members who blog about eve and/or the csm to add links to their blogs on evelopedia and/or in this thread? (i'll update this post as i get links).contributions so far:mynxeeteadazetrebor daehdoow"
7/14/2010,you could call these blogs as they were done on a per-day basis in iceland. don't expect me to bore you with these awhole lot in the future though.

7/15/2010,supported.insurance payments resulting from concord losses needs to stop. these are payments resulting from criminal action. what's the point of a police force in concord if you're going to undermind their authority with an insurance payment to re-imburse a criminal action? perhaps a better question is who from the csm is willing to pick this issue up and run with it? ahs
7/15/2010,"i look at it differently.i agree with the post but with a modification.the ""aggressor"" should never have insurance paid.that would also make can flipping a bit harder. if you get can flipped and you kill the can flipper - they should not get insurance.so i look at it - no insurance payouts on the 'aggressor'."

7/15/2010,like sw tor spring 2011 - i know from the wow forums that there'll be many players leaving wow for the bioware game - might be here in eve as-well if ccp don't react.
7/15/2010,supporting the thread. hope ccp fixes things.
7/15/2010,"holy mother of god, yes."
7/15/2010,"hello guys,well, i just read the forums a bit, especialy this post. 1 corpmate was taliking about in corp channel.well... i know this game lack on 1 or 2 points, as every game got his weak points. considering the ressource they got comparing an other game with 6 to 10 million player!!!!, they still do better. ccp, year after year have 1 big new features while improving his graphics contents! name me an other game doing the same!!!. just look at the basic content, you gather, you fight, you build, you transport the whole game and gameplay is owned by the player!. no game have this feature as far as this one. does i have to remember that everytime you ask something, it sacrifice somewhere else. its life. investing in a car, may cut off your new pc dream for a while:pevery mmorpg got his cap point, when there s no much thing to experience the new feature are made for those player to keep them. theres only a way to keep customer and it s make them enjoy what they use. there s bug, there s weak point but at the end this game is simply wonderful. always remember there s always 2 side to a medaland to survive this game is in a perpetual rush of improvement. and it s for us at the first place:p"
7/15/2010,"ccp has major releases every 6 months (apocrypha for example was amazing). this is excellent. some deprecated features (like cosmos) that sit in the dark of the universe are good as well. this means that there will always be some hidden, forgotten features that you can learn about. as a new player to eve-online, this is one of the amazing things about the game.but, i would like ccp to devote more resources to fixing up old features. every old feature doesn't need to be squeaky clean, but important features (such as factional warfare and the corp management interface) need a complete, version 2.0 revamp. in my mind, if ccp doesn't do this, they will never acieve excellence.they will be a niche, unique company, but never excellent unless they devote significantly more resources to expansing and polishing older features. the game as a whole should always be roughly on the same level of quality. my friend who tried eve for example, ended up quitting because missions sucked horrible. i told him epic arcs were cool, and wormhole npcs were worthy opponents, but the 5 year old missions he was running turned him off of the game."

7/15/2010,"i spent the day at work thinking of things ccp fixed, and did it well. this is just to give them an idea of what to aim for, when they get around to it....in a year and a half.- the rigs revamp was spot on, and put rigs on practically every ship in new eden.- the scanning system was much improved with apocrypha. while i wouldn't call it fun, more of a chore, at least it won't make me want to claw my eyes out anymore. - weapon grouping. made life easier for players, reduced server load. everyone's happy.- stealth bomber re-focusing. made the ship usuful again, and fun as all hell to fly. it's practically made for wh-space - all the server upgrades with quantum rise, stackless io and all that techno-babble. it worked like a charm, and for a while there, lag was manageable.- wormholes. alright i'm biased, since i'm a fulltime wormhole jockey. but damn...no blobfests, no local, good ganks and tonnes of isk to be made. tech 3 to boot!hell yeah!- sov changes in dominion. while i've no experience with sovreignty, a change to sov was long over due. whether the fix ccp came up with was 100% succesfull, i'll leave to the nullsec crowd, but i'll give ccp partial credit for trying at least. however, the idea of paying 'rent' for space you claim as your own, is a cognitive dissonance, if i ever heard one...- doomsday change was a good thing too....i think. never been on the receiving end of one . however, the proliferation of titans warrented a change, no doubt, and the boomstick they came up with, looks to me like a decent fix.- faction ship revamp, barring the dramiel, has turned out well too. no longer pricy hangar queens, you see them out and about all over eve.- in-game mail and browser. waaayyyyy more than 18 months over due, but at least an ok fix when they got around to it. still missing flash functionality with the browser, though....- last and least, planets. they look pretty cool, granted, but, pi is a disgrace as is, at least we got some eyecandy in the bargain.so, fellow bitter vets, nil desperandum. ccp can fix stuff when they are allowed to. they can even achieve _excellence_ once in a while, but the future is looking pretty damn bleak. we've waited for incarna for what 3+ years? i can wait 3 more, if it frees up resources to get eve back to it's former pewpew'ing glory, hopefully with a ui that's so obtuse, that religion seems reasonable, when compared to it. please add all the cool fixes i've missed have a pleasant day, everyone."
7/15/2010,please
7/15/2010,"oh good i can hardly await for walking in stations, not flying a spaceship, in 2011? thank goodness eve isn't buggy, laggy, and made up of a dozens of half-finished features. imagine if something as important as sov was bugged. that would suck wouldn't it. imagine if modules wouldn't cycle in fights. imagine if fleets were unable to load systems with less than 100 people in them. i can't wait until another space game comes out that's actually playable."
7/15/2010,"i think the csm minutes and ccp's conspicuous lack of a reply to this uber threadnaught are evidence enough that management is hell bent on cramming more useless and unwanted crap down our throats. they wave their newest buzz-word (stake-holder) about like they'll actually listen to anything we're saying. ccp says they listen to the csm, but the minutes say otherwise. i know the csm brought this issue to their attention and ccp then told them as politely as possible to, and i'm paraphrasing, 'shut the **** up. you're getting dust and incarna and you're all going to love it you ungreatfull little ****s."" one of ccp's concerns is developing new content to draw new players. does that sound stupid to anyone else? a:) if they're new players, everything is new to them!!! eve is complex enough, they don't need more **** they can't use to confuse them further. b:) most new players never stick with eve that long anyway and all this new crap and all the broken old crap is exactly what's preventing ccp from growing the player base.apparently, several members of ccp management are console gamers who don't play eve and another portion are more interested in trying on outfits and fancy hats all day rather than actually 'playing' eve. on the other hand, i guess that seems perfectly reasonable when you don't have to worry about how much isk is in your wallet and you can just roam around in jove battleships all day or just materialize 50 billion isk into your wallet."
7/15/2010,running late to a doctors appointment...still had to stop to +1 this. ccp: this is an opportunity. don't let it pass by.
7/15/2010,"i support this. however i don't expect or want everything to be 100% perfect, that's impossible or in reality it would take so long to get all possible kinks out of the code it'd never see the light of day.but yes, more quality less quantity is something i happily support. 1 expansion a year is fine by me."
7/15/2010,"from the minutes its pretty clear ccp thinks new content is the big selling point. i dont think they will rebalance the ships. everyone can agree something is very wrong, but at the same time they can not make everyone happy. the reasoning is why bother."

7/15/2010,i support. good ideas.
7/15/2010,excellent ideas.
7/15/2010,"faction warfare seriously needs an overhaul soon.boost the roleplay backgound, fix the endless (senseless) capture-the-flag standing factory and add some effects on gameplay in occupied systems, e.g. no docking rights for opposing militia. a bit similar to 0.0 game mechanics, it's working pretty well there.(edit: typo)"
7/15/2010,"18 months, correction, at least 18 months, before ccp will look into faction warfare fixes/updates. that's just wrong. i know only a small percentage of people do fw, but part of that is because it is still buggy.please ccp fix faction warfare!"
7/15/2010,"i don't think its reasonable to take a `minimum time spent broken' into consideration when looking for what to fix first. factional warfare is as close to eves core business as it gets, since its about player spaceships blowing each other up. therefore it should get more attention than cosmos, or indeed incarna (which is neither about spaceships, nor even about pvp!).do want fixes for fw sooner than 18 months from now."
7/15/2010,vote against.makes no sense to shift their scurm teams and planning around. too much time would be wasted by overhead
7/15/2010,"fully supported. balancing/fixing fw and lowsec is doable and easier to achieve than ""fixing lag"". eve at minimum needs those two fixed out of sea of issues that should be higher priority than wis.i'd like to remind everyone that ""we cant start on that in 18 months"" means that no fixes or balance will come at 18 months but much much later. if they start working on stuff in 18 months we likely wont see anything fixed in 2 or 2 and a half years."
7/15/2010,"why doesn't it ? new players that just started this game are thrown in faction warfare almost from the start. this has some importance only because of that. they should work on fw. lots of bugs, imbalance issues and lots more in fw needs work. it won't take months to fix these issues if a team work on this believe me. theres lots of veterans in fw from all the races know what's going on and how to fix those imbalance. all ccp needs to do ( if they don't have the info...which i don't think that's the case) is ask them what's going on.making the transition to fw less steap that should help. i keep hearing ""i just finished the tutorial , what do i do now ?"" in the militia chat channel. for me that means ccp has to work on fw."
7/15/2010,it makes no sense from the economical / project management point of view. switching up development is not as easy as you all like to believe. it would result in wasted time and money basicly.
7/15/2010,i don't give a **** about fw so i rather have them work on incarna.
7/15/2010,"i do think there would be a relatively easy fix for fw. i have posted about it here and the url is in my sig. i know you disagree (the details can be read in the thread in my sig) which brings us to your second point. it does seem the participants cant agree on what changes should happen. the minor bug fixes proposed (and backlogged) by csm will not fix fw. i think fixing fw means participants actually engage in, and enjoy, the fight for occupancy. that is what my proposal would do and without too much work. but i fear so many have long since given up on occupancy in its current lacking form that few are interested in the topic.ccp is saying incarna and dust will be here in 18 months? i doubt it. but if it is here in that time they will have bugs with incarna that will need to be fixed before fw will be addressed. incarna is just really like designing a whole new game  only harder as it needs to tie in with eve. fixing the bugs will likely take an additional 6 months. the changes to fw that i and others request are not that big of a deal. we shouldnt have to wait 2 years. make the minor changes i and others have requested now and then if they still think they need to do some big overhaul after incarna is out they can. but they wont need to! if they made the changes i proposed fw would, by far, be the best pvp in eve. those seemingly minor changes would revolutionize eve."
7/15/2010,"i don't give a **** about incarna so i rather have them work on fw. i don't play this game for walking a guy around like an fps, i play this game for srs bsns internet spaceships.seriously though, i think they should let alliances join, with a no-sov-holding stipulation."

7/15/2010,learning skills are used to separate long-term and short-term players.
7/15/2010,"what, there's no problem with learning skills, who's complaininghow about ccp starts fixing the actual problems this game has"
7/15/2010,agree. starting with the alt-posting issue.
7/15/2010,"you're an idiot for even saying that, not menioning the fact you don't know how ah even works."
7/15/2010,"if ccp plan on removing learning skills and i don't for a minute think they do then i suugest that they simply remove the books. those that have trained the skills get to keep their attribute increases, those that haven't get to play the game not having to worry about training them.nice and simple solution."
7/15/2010,"one solution. since everyone says that it detracts noobs from actually experiencing the game because it seems like they need to do learning skills before anything else. why not make it so that learning skills can only be attained after 2 million skill points?after a player reaches 2 million skill points, he can than purchase skill books for learning which he can than decide to choose to learn.in the mean time, the first 2 million skill points he can spend towards things like a nice ship, fittings, etc...this way, all the old timer's still have their attribute advantage, all the newbies won't be detracted by ship spinning right away and have a chance to experience the game, the depth/strategy to learning skills still remain in the game at no ""initial"" cost to newbies! the best part of it all, is you wouldn't need to reimburse skill points at all to anyone, rather you could simply extend the sp learning bonus for new characters just a little more.-wandering deathstriker"

7/15/2010,"nonononononono, that is absolutely not what this is about, again... it isnt about getting carebears into lowsec. it is about making lowsec better for the people who live there, hisec has 6 security systems, lowsec has 4, 0.0 just is 0.0.there is plenty of hisec, we dont want a 'gradual' falloff where outlaws have an even tougher time. outlaws live in lowsec, this is about making the game as deep and immersive for outlaws (and the lawful folks who want to live there too) as it is for the hisec multitude and the 0.0 empire builders..."
7/15/2010,why would you make it better for people who have already chosen to live in lowsec? that's not the objective of the lowsec change at all. it's about encouraging other players to go there.
7/15/2010,"wait a minute, i just thought of something....if ccp did allow players to buy skillpoints, wouldn't that cause the character bazaar to crash?i don't buy or sell characters, so i'm not personally affected by this. but, character-sellers would suddenly have to compete with characters that players could create by buying skillpoints straight from ccp.i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
7/15/2010,it has been said that lotteries are a tax on the stupid and poor. i do not care to argue for or against that position. however; i do think that lotteries have become over represented in the sale subgroup of eve marketplace.i would like to see them segregated from the other sale threads so that those inclined to be bamboozled buy in to these instruments can have a place all to their own to find such adds.

7/15/2010,hate to be the minority here but i invite the complexity that four currencies would bring to the game. i'm all for realism of this idea. it would bring an immersive gameplay aspect unique to each empire. and as much as i dont like adding skills to the game this is one that i would definitely promote added trade skills for. such as racial brokering.there i said it.
7/15/2010,"thumbs up for the idea but, nut for more than one currency"
7/15/2010,so for those who cannot compete with the pirates the end result is shrinking the playable universe to 1/4 of the size? with the most likely result that 2-3 empires will become back-waters the on-line guides recommend against starting in?terrible idea... unless you are a pirate. and if you want to get newbies or pve people into 0.0 then focus on actually making the pvp gameplay fun.
7/15/2010,"supported, and nice way of framing it op. :)no new currencies though."
7/15/2010,"i lol at the op cause this wont happen. you saw what happened when autopilot broke. rancer was camped 24/7 with some 200+ ships. so what you are suggesting is, have 4 empires, completely seperate from each other and have a list of systems heavily camped 24/7 which would not allow any trade?oh and oursulaert was a trade hub long before dodixie."

7/15/2010,you grossly overestimate the recruiting standards of both yours and every other alliance <3
7/15/2010,"we come back to this week long timeframe. which is not 30 days. also, back to the point of: same scenario, he gets wardecced in that time and his pos is still gone. furthermore, as people have stated - a pos should be a corporate venture. too many 1 man and his alt outfits have towers up - a pos has ceased to be something special. i'm all in favour of making it less easy to maintain one solo.well, assuming the alt in question brings along a strip waits for the pos to online, spends 2 hours anchoring the strip, onlines it, waits the 24 hours for its cycle to complete, scoops the pos and its mods and no one else from the corp notices this happening or decides to read the notification that your tower is being stripped or the mailbox full of ""tower low on resources"" mails...i say tough luck.24 hours of the tower moaning about being low fuel plus 24 hours for the strip to complete its cycle, provides a reasonable timescale, to my mind.ok, the whole purpose of this proposal was to provide a mechanic to remove offline towers without having to attack them or declare war on the corporation. so, if you want tack having to wardec them on top of the other requirements suggested, why not just amalgamate your suggestion re pos hitting structure rendering it unanchorable without any of the suggestions i've made?as to warning, again, the activation of the strip sends a notification to the corporation.i think though, that you're missing the main thrust of the argument here - this is a corporation that has left its ""multi-million isk investment"" abandoned in space. they've ignored 24 hours worth of warnings that their ""time and effort"" in putting up this structure is about to be rendered moot. in my opinion, so is being able to set up massive, expensive structures in space, and just leave them floating, secure in the knowledge that if you leave eve for a month that the tower will still be there 'cause wardeccing them and assembling a fleet to take out an offline large tower is too much effort for minimal reward. your pos is at risk if you do not maintain the fuel bay in a proper and timely manner."
7/15/2010,strip/adu/whatever - not supported.stealing/removing a tower is a group effort now and should remain so. i would support making offline towers unanchorable once they hit a certain percentage of shields/armor/sructure though.
7/15/2010,"as soon as pos goes offline and all structures are destroyed, you get an option to force unanchor the tower. imo that should take about 24 hours and the owner would get a notification about it.if nobody shows up in those 24 hours, the tower is yours.if you would rather have the mods than the tower, you'd still need to blow up the tower."
7/15/2010,i like this approach better than the original proposal. i would add one item for the high sec pos's. any high sec pos that is unfueled for 120 days gets reclaimed by concord and is removed.ahs

7/15/2010,"the community team tossed this thread over to me since it's pretty topical to what i do. they read and forward everything that is pertinent to the appropriate departments, as you can imagine, and keep an eye out on the ""biggies"" for positive and negative player opinions. just because there's no dev actively posting in a thread, it doesn't mean they haven't seen it or it doesn't go into a special report prepared by the community team that's sent to the dev team in their capacity as advocates of your voices. this happens a lot on individual features and things like plex.before i dip into the below point, i do want to say that (although many of you won't believe me), the dev team does take the csm very seriously. we do have a history of inserting/reprioritizing things based off of their input, with a heartfelt attempt to find other ways to address the technically impossible suggestions/issues. more will be said on this in the near future since it's of obvious concern to players here, so by all means don't take the pr guy's word for it.during the first csm, we invited the nyt and wired and a few other publications out to the csm to check things out. there was also a camera crew from europe that mostly followed around their ""local hero"" rep, but also did a feature on the whole thing for their documentary. we set up a ""round robin"" time post meetings and pre-dinner for any questions they may have. it really helped them to understand the varied nature of the player base, some of the politics that went into the summit itself and rounded out the coverage. post meeting we offered up contact information (assuming the csm members themselves signed off on it) to all our media contacts and offered to help arrange interviews, typically for the chairman first.for each csm after that, we've tried reaching out to new outlets, mostly gaming, to bring them over. unfortunately, scheduling, interest and cost of traveling (and some not allowing us to pay) have prevented journalists from attending each one. for each csm though, we have done outreach and tried to help set up interviews again with the permission of each csm member. this has been an ongoing effort.pc gamer sent out josh augustine to the csm 4 and he did do a whole feature on it in pc gamer, so you are right there :)while many think that the csm is just a pr stunt, it wasn't dreamed up in my mind or the collective minds of marketing. the select few witchdoctors who do pr for eve purposefully take every precaution to paint the csm as it actually exists: not blowing its power out of proportion, being honest about it in the early stages still trying to find its ""legitimacy"" amongst the player base (which still happens now), being transparent about the voting numbers and setting up interviews directly with csm members without interfering or editing their responses or demanding that we as developers get ""equal response time"". hence, it doesn't get as much press as if we actually did make it into a pr stunt."
7/15/2010,"(cont'd from above)for those csms that weren't attended by press, we did a wrapup for the press (like fanfest) who were interested in attending but couldn't, providing pictures, meeting minutes, access to our dev team etc. in the lead-in to each subsequent one, we do similar outreach and summaries as well.the csm 5 is no different. we did outreach before and we stand ready to put any interested press in touch with the csm members directly if we are contacted by them. it's one of the perks and responsibilities of their elected positions and one of our duties in supporting this part of eve online.again, we take efforts not to censor the csm in the press, because we do feel that it's another step in them forging their own legitimacy with the rest of the player base and to a certain degree in gamingdom as well.hope that clarifies things. if not, just ask/comment."
7/15/2010,"i don't doubt that, but from the decision-makers we have little more than lip service.what is your definition of stakeholder status?"
7/15/2010,"i don't want to hijack this issue, since i think it's an important one, so a quick digression here.stakeholder status...if you are a stakeholder it means that your position has a representative interest in the issue/feature and that your input carries weight when it comes to refining it and following its development, while not necessarily being part of the development team who is designing and coding the feature. i am sure development has a much stricter definition of it but this is my basic understanding.for instance, i have been a stakeholder in a few things, one of which was the redo of the ccpgames.com website. for that there was also stakeholders from h.r. and operations and web. in most cases, each issue/feature has multiple stakeholders.being a stakeholder does not mean an automatic push through of your priorities, however. i know from personal experience :)i'm sure you are asking because the csm was recently elevated to ""stakeholder"" status in terms of eve development, meaning that their recommendations bear similar weight to those from other departments in the company and are judged accordingly, such as marketing. also, as i said above, it doesn't mean automatic implementation of a ""wish list"", but it does mean a seat around the table where all ""wish lists"" are prioritized. hope that clarifies it.another interesting shift in the recent csm not mentioned often is that we are showing them a lot more of what we have planned going forward. some people i've talked to outside of ccp consider this a serious, dangerous gamble, but we feel its necessary to get the dialogue we need from a more informed csm. this includes technological dependencies, plans for growth of features etc. before we didn't let them that far into our future plans (i was at the first one), but that evolved over time to a more open dialogue with them."
7/15/2010,"um, that is painting a very twisted picture. creating the impression that a process stakeholder is the same as csm or the stakeholder function advertised for the csm. not to mention, this is getting a little close to backpedalling after confusing the stage a little bit :peither way, i doubt many people are tripping over the csm concept or definition, but over some other things.very notable is how on a decision level, the csm in any function is basically gimped since all processes are already committed on, and the minutes make very clear that this is something that will basically never be compromised on. i doubt that is conscious decision, but think of it for a moment. on a basic level you are asking for feedback and input, on upcoming cycles, but all those are set in stone tablets already by the time the csm arrives.most notable however is how on an executive level, there is a reliance on definitions and methods which are not just giving secondary returns, but are not based on common definitions and suffer from what you could call a translation gap. excellence has nothing to do with code. you are not selling a game in a supermarket. you are selling an experience. the experience is defined through principles of concept and design by the emotional link customers make. now it is visible that at the top, ccp doesn't even think of eve or their company this way. that has some pretty disappointing consequences. players want to believe, this is inherent to this emotional link. it is why in a market like this with a product like this people do not vote with their feet, and why in times like these they go ever more quiet on the main forums. the reason eve and everything around it is so unique and powerful, is because once upon a time long ago a bunch of people got together and got to work with and on a shared emotional connection.because of that, eve and all around it is so strong, that it stands seperate as its own mmo and even platform type. this is why unlike other mmo's players of eve can so easily go through more then one mmorpg subscriber addiction curves. yet now, it is visible that while players have and desperately try to maintain the primary element: that emotional link. we all go through the ups and downs with it. and there you see execs in those minutes and on facebook making it clear that this emotional connection that made everything possible, has zero meaning, because metrics that are only secondary business variables have become dogma.p.s. do you not see that it is rather significant, that for a csm 1 you invite press. but for a csm 5 with stakeholder advertising, you just sit back and wait to see if press shows up?i mean, eve is a game that according to one of the recent interviews with a producer attracts smart people. don't you think they read these things, and then ask questions to themselves and others?"
7/15/2010,"manifest, while i appreciate your reply, i think you're completely missing the op's point. aerilis wasn't talking about getting the csm into the press for the purposes of promoting the process or the game. he was talking about getting the csm into the press as a specific, direct attack on ccp. trying to use their experiences as a way of making ccp look bad, making it look like your company's priorities are destroying the game. in other words, not the sort of press that you get from an information handout and q+a organized by ccp. i don't think it's a very good strategy, but it's what he had in mind. so while what you do is good for the process, it bears very little resemblance to the topic of this thread."
7/15/2010,"what else can be said, then: geez! many people, here and on eve-related forums are convinced, that the developers are doing a wonderfull job, but the management ****s up the planning and assignments big-time, by drawing the wrong assumptions from their numbers and figures (just see nathan's plea-comment in the minutes) and distributing all priorities at the wrong places.eve is by far, the most complex and most ambituous, as well as most promising space-mmo (if not mmo overall) out there and the decision to basically leave eve running on ""idle-mode"" for at least 1.5 years is putting your flagship to a dangerous risk there, especially since people have seen forth-coming this whole thing, but were put down with yet again broken and forgotten promises."
7/15/2010,it also sounds like ccp has it's priorities a little skewed from the minutes.if most of the players want improvments and upgrades to existing systems and all ccp seems interested in incarna and the bloody rts/fps interaction with eve. take a hint make dust a separate game set in the same universe but don't tie it in directly with the mmo.
7/15/2010,unfortunatly ccp's actions contridict your statement.supporting the op. some gaming magazine coverage of how this game is becoming more and more broken might be what is needed as a wake-up call to the devs.
7/15/2010,"many people are concerned about the direction of eve (myself included).while some of us wish priority were evenly split or more focused on a backward maintenance/improvement/balancing of the game we have vs future additions/other games, this thread reeks of cutting off your nose in spite of your face.when ccp does/says something i don't like and i decide to hit the forums, my personal goal in coming to the forums is to try and convey my concerns to the people at ccp who matter and hope they take that under advisement.what op suggests is that ""if they won't listen we'll hit em where it hurts"". while it's not only a juvenile approach to the issue, if you were successful (which even if ign or someone writes up a 'ccp shifts gears' article, you won't be successful in the way you think you want to be)where was i? .... if you were successful what do you think the future repercussions would be for the csm and further player/ccp relationships? i hate people that respond to those of us upset with ccp's admission of priorities with ""well if you don't like it leave"" and while i think that it is a simplistic response to most threads, it does have merit in that if you really are that mad that you think you need to strike out at them with any and all channels available to you, you've probably lost focus and need to quit playing pushing the csm to make some type of media rage about ccp being open with their future plans is == shooting yourself in the foot.what do you think the article will read? -ccp opens player council to make players a part of the process-ccp makes business decision and doesn't do exactly what players want -frjewpofjkl: ccp is tereibal!!!????perhaps that's what op wants however? at best a troll at worst he has ulterior motives. being a part of the process, having them share their plans with us openly is a privilege for us and a bit of a gamble for ccp. while i may come to the forums and call nathan a hypocrite for stating he has a ""commitment to excellence"" and then stating 18months to review crap we want done yesterday... that doesn't mean that i don't at the very least appreciate the openness in them sharing those pieces of information with us. thanks to the ccp guy for responding, and to all the devs that respond. just because we are upset with your managements' priorities doesn't mean we aren't happy that there aren't ccp guys that really try to make the game as good as they can every day. i bet we'd be surprised just how many sympathized with us on some of these issues. and fix the game so i can pvp."
7/15/2010,"my motives aren't revenge, i'm not looking for a direct attack or to cause harm to ccp, but i don't know how else the playerbase can get its message across. the csm literally looked hilmar right in the eye and said we don't like what you're doing with eve, you lied to us about your commitment to excellence, you lied to us about the role of the csm, and hilmar just shrugged and denied it. gd is flooded with players voicing their opinions about what a bad decision ccp is making. i really don't know how else to get this message across.and yes, i'm sure most of the hands-on devs, the people actually making the content and the game we love and enjoy, can sympathize with the concerns of the playerbase. it's just the upper level guys seem to only care about money, and have no qualms about lying to their most loyal customers to get it. we need to make them understand that we are the source of their income, we are their greatest recruitment asset when it comes to new subs (i've convinced so many people to try eve, and quite a few have subbed and are playing at this moment), and it is our opinions and concerns that should matter, not some ruthless corporate market model.please ccp don't turn into cryptic studios."
7/15/2010,"i know alot of people are pretty upset with hilmar's comments, and saying sorry won't fix it, we want fixes to eve. this news is spreading fast in the player base and alot of people feel annoyed. this should be a sign to fix eve then work on dust. you guys think you get all your new customers and from shiny toys? what happens when the game is so ****ed that it won't work and no one wants to play it? you are heading down a bad road, and could easily fix this instead of producing things like eve gate and other failed ideas. just do the right thing and listen to the people who are the only reason you all have jobs."
7/15/2010,it's all fine and dandy that ccp cares about the csm and all that jazz...but the core of the problem is that ccp is tied up for 18 months making features that the community isn't that enthusiastic of. the csm is just a pawn in the players vs ccp metagame. for us as current players fixes to the current game far outweigh some vague future feature.
7/15/2010,"i can't help but wonder if this wasn't influenced by the similar suggestion i made over in jita speaker's... that being said:i read it less as a ""direct attack on ccp"" and more a ""direct wakeup call for ccp."" there are several in-jokes right now that've existed for years. when there's any patch, especially a big one, set a long train skill. not because long train skills are nifty, but because ccp is probably going to break something and then use us as beta testers to try to figure out wtf they did. from deleting boot.ini to totally undoing the need for speed with crushing fleet lag in dominion, much of the playerbase has gotten used to the facts that ccp's development schedule is artificially rushed and leads to half-baked products being pushed out the door simply because they're married to a six-months-or-die schedule instead of a we'll-release-it-when-it's-ready schedule. and there are many, many minor issues that don't require a massive scrum team (fix a few numers in the database for rockets' damage profile, etc...) that would at least show that ccp was aware of the playerbase's legitimate complaints and was willing to work on fixing them asap even if it would take some time to work through the backlog. instead, we see from ccp that they consider the game to be, stability/performance wise, better than ever. it's not. instead we see from ccp that they'll use massive fleet battles with titans and motherships blasting away to make the trailers to their expansions, when battles like that have become virtually unplayable because of their expansions. instead we see that while ccp was telling us that their wod team wouldn't take away from eve, that their resources have been redirected to wod and dust and those of us who want the ""modify"" and ""cancel"" buttons on the trade interface to be moved apart finally or (gasp!) to actually be able to have the same kind of fights we were having before dominion, are simply out of luck for the next 1.5 to 2 years. the idea isn't to hurt ccp at all. it's to get something, negative pr, bad word of mouth, whatever, to pierce the insulating and self-augmenting cocoon that seems to have enveloped the real decision makers at ccp. because, seriously, when the entire csm tells them that the game is doing worse than it has before and its kluged together bits are grinding like a machine with sand in the gears, and we've long since lost ""excellence"" in exchange for new (but not really polished) content... and the response is ""nah, things are better than ever!""well... there needs to be some sort of wakeup call or they'll keep sleepwalking. at this point, i wouldn't advise anybody new to get into eve. maybe in 2 years' time, who knows. but perhaps more importantly, even though i love the wod source material and ip, i will not sign up for that game when it goes live. because at this point i don't have faith that ccp will manage that game properly, either. and i'll tell the same thing to folks thinking about playing that game that i tell to people who're thinking of playing eve: it's a great concept but ccp is unable or unwilling to do the work required to make it work. so, yah, don't hurt ccp but do get this into the news so that someone in a position of power at ccp will realize that a game about space battles and player-driven content where big space battles that players use to define the content are unplayable slide shows is a bad thing. supported."
7/15/2010,you'll need this too. but you seem to have missed the real problem.edit: added a hint.
7/15/2010,"i didn't put enough text to that point but i did understand it--perhaps not quite explicitly saying so and giving you the impression that i didn't. i was trying to speak to that point when i was relaying that pr will continue to help match csm member to journalist from a detached standpoint, whether the csm is made up of all peaceful intergalactic ambassadors or tom zareks. i personally agree with you that the tactic wouldn't be a good strategy and ultimate self-defeating, but that certainly doesn't mean that ccp should herd the csm or gag them from expressing their opinions.the differing personalities and the issues they represent are one major contributor to what makes the csm compelling from a journalistic standpoint and frankly lends credence to its representative nature..."
7/15/2010,"you are jedi with the photoshoppery, using it to great effect. i actually noticed the ""blue bar"" thing you point out when i made the post. i believe there's a reason for that. this section of the site is meant to help identify, distill and strengthen player issues to be raised by the csm, but in the context of player discussion. hence the devs typically steer clear from commenting here except for comm team moderation i believe--so as not to taint opinion, sidetrack commentary, obfuscate etc. your next statement will probably be that more devs need to be more active in other parts of the forums and engaged in dialog there. you're right. but as i mentioned before, they do pay attention to the forums more than they have the bandwidth to respond to them--thanks to special reports and forwarded threads from the community team. trying to find the right mix is tough.as for me posting here, i just saw an opportunity to clarify the ""pr stunt thing"" since someone asked. i might even get spanked by wrangler for doing so :)(i say this not to make light of current unrest). seriously, i'd at least fit tech 2. give me some credit."
7/15/2010,"i cannot in any way support the op. apart from the fact that ""destroying the village in order to save it"" has never been a smart move, it's very disrespectful to some very hard-working and dedicated people at ccp.manifest, thanks for posting. i do hope you activated your armor testicle hardener ii's before doing so -- though i would not recommend that you overheat them...going forward, i would hope that the relationship between the players (and csm) and ccp is defined by increasing amounts of:transparency - so we see the effects of player input on backlog prioritization.communication - so that quick iteration between ccp and csm (with input from player experts) results in leaner, easier to implement, and more useful versions of current proposals in the csm backlog.process - so that csm's ability to act as a proper stakeholder is not crippled by the fact that we are not on-site in iceland.and while we are at it, gentlepeople -- criticizing ccp is fine, i have been known to indulge in it myself. but raging invective only ensures your message is ignored. a single cogent, well argued post is worth a thousand ""ccp sux!"""
7/15/2010,"actually no, i tend to thing that the devs (not short for developers?) spend entirely too much time moderating this forum. i especially like when y'all troll a thread by locking it for trolling. suave.but i digress. my mspaint-job was not sufficiently specific. i was reflecting that the 2000+ posts about development standards had been entirely ignored, yet 3 posts about bad press was worthy of ccp-employed interaction. *applauds*"
7/15/2010,"well, there is another way to protest and open a few eyes, without having to go directly to the press. hold a 24hr (or whatever amount) blackout for third-party eve support websites the likes of eve-central, eve survival, evemon etc etc. whether anyone can organize it and pull this off, it won't be easy, but it's important to communicate the blackout plans (both the reasoning and schedule) in advance so that users won't be caught offguard.that way you get pr with the public looking curiously on wtf in going on over there sort of thing (rather than a direct smear) and at the same time show the public the perception of solid solidarity amongst the eve community. as they say, any type of pr is good pr"
7/15/2010,"yeah i read this as just another whine thread.you claim ccp does not listen to you or hear your voice which is just flat out demonstrate-ably wrong. the csm has voiced concerns and the players have voiced their concerns over and over again. has ccp locked all these threads and declared you cannot talk about that? no. has ccp gagged the csm or fired them all or dissolved the csm so they cannot speak their mind? no.so you have been heard and anymore whining that your opinion hasn't been heard is simply that - a whine.now what you are really upset over is the fact that after the csm voiced their opinion, ccp has not followed their advice. i don't really see how you can change ccp's path at this moment. they have pulled a lot of people from eve-online to work on dust514 and wod. when you develop new games you are always short on cash and people so how is ccp supposed to get cash/people to work on eve now?how about this, are you willing to pay $5 more per subscription per month in order for ccp to hire a new team dedicated to eve in the 18 months interim before dust514 comes out?any proposal simply demanding that ccp fixes stuff without suggesting a way for ccp to fund said activities is just a whine and not constructive. we have heard you already. whining to news media or bashing ccp will not help anything."
7/15/2010,"it's also something that hasn't been advocated by this proposal. publicizing ccp's failure to tend to issues within the game while they focus on content 1+ years down the road is not disrespectful of anybody.you've forgotten one, without which all yours are meaningless: effectiveness.all the transparency, communication and efficiency of process are well and good, but when ccp responds to the fact that there are major bugs that need to be fixed with ""nah, we're not even going to start looking at them for a year and a half, at least."" then you've accomplished nothing. if your only goal is a conversation and not impact, then we can replace the csm with a politely worded letter. 1. as already evinced, ccp is more than willing to handwave away multiple cogent, well throught out arguments, posts and proposals. 2. which gets to the fact that if a significant portion of ccp's customer base is responding with 'raging invective', that alone should be a good clue to ccp that they're doing something wrong. ""many of our customers are furious at us, but it doesn't matter because they're not making good arguments."" is hardly a effective response."
7/15/2010,"i still find it amusing that companies feel that they can control information among their customers and also that this is a positive thing. one of ccp's strengths has been its interaction with the customer base and rejection of this line of thinking. even though we have suffered setbacks as ccp has grown up into the much larger operation it is today, the communication lines are still visible. i think that sharing information and thoughts on the future is far from risky; that it is in fact, healthy.what is really risky is uncontrolled or poorly controlled growth (and the resulting lack of focus) that often comes when a company grows too quickly. this is where the playerbase is genuinely concerned. eve has a ridiculous amount of potential, and is one of the only mmos to have maintained slow, steady growth over several years. some of ccp's customers fear that caution has been set aside, that too much has been bit off with the dual projects of incarna and dust, and that this is risking the entire shared dream. ccp has put itself in a hard place because they can't drop projects as this would be financial ruin, and they obviously can't simultaneously maintain a strong focus on eve. whether this is due to poor resource management or actual need on other projects, only ccp management knows, and it is mostly irrelevant.the bottom line is, even if ccp thinks that they can pull off incarna and dust while preserving the shared dream of eve, many customers resent that they would even risk it in the first place. others just carry on and hope. but all eyes are watching, because there is a lot invested in this place, from both player and developer alike."
7/15/2010,"must be troll. i think the suggestion in all of these ""whine"" threads is that ccp is devoting too much resource into things the current subscribers don't want (like a first person shooter game and a virtual reality game) at the expense of things they do want (like improvements to current spaceship combat game)."
7/15/2010,"no, the claim is that ccp has heard the facts and handwaved them away for a number of reasons. you should be a detective. that's your argument, really? ""ccp has decided to strip vital resources from eve, leave glaring bugs unfixed and shaft the eve playerbase, and the eve playerbase should be fine with that because ccp is doing that so it can make other, non-eve products."" how about this, tomorrow ccp decides to simply shut down the servers for eve and just use 100% of your subscription money to fund dust, and not reimburse you a single penny. that's cool, right? because, i mean, how else are they going to fully fund their new projects? would you whine about that, eh, eh?"
7/15/2010,"make no mistake, yes it has. the goal is a wake-up call, but the method is badmouthing eve and ccp in the gaming press. that's a dangerous game, and i have zero faith in our ability to play it as deftly as it would need to be played to work. unless a couple bitter vets off scrapheap are secretly ign reporters, we're relying on people who have no horse in this race to report on drama in a way that exactly serves our purposes. in order for this to work, it has to be seen as damning by ccp management to the point where it convinces them to change their ways, without damaging eve in the minds of the potential subscribers who the article is written for. that's not just a dangerous game, i'd wager that it's actively impossible. given the choice between letting eve slowly fall apart, or hastening the process, i'll let it be. trying to bring the gaming press into this dispute is playing with fire - have no doubt about that. don't do it unless you know exactly what you're trying to do, and unless you know that you can succeed at doing it. i don't think that you, or i, or anyone on the csm, does know those things. it sounds nice in theory to call in some big guns and pierce the illusions of ccp's management, but it will not work out that neatly in real life. there is a price to be paid for such tactics, and it is eve itself that will pay it. i don't think it'll be worthwhile. never forget that our goal here is to fix eve, not to break it. don't do anything unless you think that you're furthering that goal."
7/15/2010,"the op actually went on to specifically clarify ""my motives aren't revenge, i'm not looking for a direct attack or to cause harm to ccp, but i don't know how else the playerbase can get its message across.""people can continue to act as if this is about destroying/hurting/whatevering ccp, but it's not. you may argue that it would have negative side-effects, but that's not what it's about.this is not 'nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure.' the method was stating the truth and facts about what's going on in the gaming press. if the facts are so damaging to ccp, then the course of action isn't to worry that they might be publicized, but fix the problems at hand. that's a false dichotomy. for instance, such articles might turn off some subscribers but when ccp fixes things new articles about how things are working might attract more subscribers than were lost. or ccp wakes up and fixes things while some potential subscribers are turned off to the game but not enough to seriously damage cash flow. or ccp, when contacted by the times (or whoever) snaps out of their somnambulism and the article is ""ccp has been resistent to fixing major bugs in their game as their attention has been split, but their player-representative council, the csm, has convinced them to rededicate themselves to the functionality of the game."" and so on. things we know for a fact that also aren't furthering that goal so far: posting to the forums with constructive criticism and well thought out arguments and proposals, subscribers not resubbing, the csm telling ccp what the problems are and suggesting fixes. what course of action would you suggest to change how things are going before the 12-18 month timeframe? what guarantees could you offer that, at the 18 month mark, ccp doesn't decide to do something else? after all, if their customers are willing to keep paying for a broken game that ccp admits it won't be fixing for years, why not develop a new product after dust and wod, or why not invest dev resources in the new games themselves? after all, all those damn eve players who've stuck around are already hooked on the game, like junkies or something, and they need to make sure that wod and dust are polished and have continually polished and engaging content (at least for the first year or two...)while insanity may or may not be doing the same thing over and over and expecting a new result, futility probably can safely be defined that way."
7/15/2010,if i believed for one second that csm is useful i would consider myself ******ed.***** word starts with reedited because of all this ******
7/15/2010,"dear, sweet finnagain, never change. you work so hard for our entertainment."
7/15/2010,"i take it from your response that you have no actual substantive answer to your errors that i pointed out? if you do, provide it please. the nonsense in your last post is, or should be, beneath you."
7/15/2010,"oh boy... yes it is. once the **** is boiling, good luck trying to get it cold again. you're making the mistake of taking apart cause and effect and completely ignore, that ""getting the press on your side"" is never ever going to work like you expected, but instead will develop a life on it's own... yes, ccp (at least the higher-ups) need a waking-call, maybe even some serious shaking to get back to conciousness, but taking them and dropping them out of the hatch, without a space-suit, isn't going to work as you intended... you basically missed, what the whole t20-incident gave ccp and eve for a reputation? that happened 4 years ago and is still raising it's ugly head whenever something doesn't work quite as smooth as it should. the attention was well deserved back then and it may be again today, but you're demanding to risk more here, then you realize.screaming for the inquisition never yielded a positive result."
7/15/2010,"i'm going to contact the press and complain that i havent gotten my csm forum tag, ingame medal, and free game time yet. this is a serious breach of justice"
7/15/2010,"please, seriously, let's drop the strawman. nobody at all in this thread has advocated trying to ruin ccp over this. even a string of negative articles would most likely not ruin ccp over this. let's keep this in perspective. if you have to argue against a proposal that nobody has made, it's a good indicator that the proposal that has been made is pretty solid. and no, letting ccp get an outside point of view (and not ""oh, those players-who-got-elected-are-complaining"") might be a wakeup call. it wouldn't be analogous to death by asphyxiation. and again, the tacit assumption underlying such an argument is that the facts themselves are so damaging to ccp that merely reporting on them would be massively detrimental. if that's true, it's an argument for why ccp must be jolted into fixing them asap and not why we should hope that they don't see the light of day in wider circulation. you just changed the subject from the fact that ""do nothing or ruin ccp"" is a false dichotmy. in any case, no, i didn't miss anything about the t20 scandal. but now your argument seems to be that it was right for ccp to try to cover it up because of how damaging the bad press might have been. surely that isn't what you mean, though, and whether it's a cheating dev or ignoring glaring bugs in an established game in order to devote resources to new games, the answer should be to fix the problems in a transparent manner rather than sweeping them under the rug lest they provide bad pr? sure, now please quote anybody in this thread who's called for an ""inquisition"" and not simply the facts to be more widely publicized in order to jolt ccp's management out of their cocoon. and i'll ask you the same question that you seem to have skipped over: what course of action would you advise, then? we've seen that cogent arguments don't work, that massive player support for excellence doesn't work, that players dropping their subscriptions over the years due to bugs doesn't work, that the csm going to ccp and explaining the problems and suggesting fixes doesn't work. okay. so what's your suggestion?"
7/15/2010,"okay.........been looking into this and eft warrioring like mad. i've been comparing all tier battleships with their counterparts of all races in a rr fleet setup. be it shield or armour.i gave myself some rules. these are as follows:fits must maximise dps*ehpfits must be practical (not fail)fits must have a warp disruptor/scramblerfits must have a mwdfits must have some way of supporting capacitor useage (remote/self)fits must have defence vs ecmfits must be within 3% of cpu/pg budgetfits must be designed around operating within 30km as rr battleships. not purely logistic/ewar supporteverything else is simply a bonus. so what did i find:1st tier...all but the armageddon is rr shield tanking possible. however, rr shield fits tend to have lower sensor strength (due to low power eccm mods), require remote capacitor support, have lower ehp and similar dps to their armour rr counterpartsso no advantages but some disadvantages.2nd tier..only the tempest and raven can pull off either armour or shield acceptably. however the shield variants offer no real advantage over the armour versions and the raven requires a fitting mod for either armour/shield. the tempests requires a cpu mod for shield fit.3rd tier..only the abaddon is singled out here as being incapable of a rr shield fitting. all the other ships can do either however, when they step outside of their natural tanking ability they lose a small portion of their ehp. shield tankers also have lower sensor strength. again this is due to using low power eccm mods. only the hyperion requires a cpu mod when fitting for shiled rr's.in summary: rr shield tanking is possible however does not provide any real advantage over armour rr tanking. it does however have the drawback of relying on low power eccm modules and generally lower buffers. there also appears to be no real dps advantage either. as low slots are being used up for cpu (when req.) and eccm mods.an absolute bare minimum of 5 mid slots is required for shield fittings.if the lst was to have slightly lower cpu fitting stats, then it probably would help rr shield fits by freeing up a low slot for moar damage.so after all that, i'm in support of an adjustment to shield transporter fitting stats (lower cpu)anyone who wants to argue that my fits are impossible/impractical tell me which ship you are having trouble with fitting and i'll post the fit. i won't post all the fits on here in one go though."
7/15/2010,i agree.
7/15/2010,"gypsio's excellent post outlined the problem. the solution is also viable.one observation:a lot of the people who are championing sok's opinion also expressed their concern on the potential imbalance of lst on dedicated logistics ships once they are modified. do they realize that sok's suggestion to include an extra med slot or two on existing shield tanking battleships would introduce more balance headaches than reducing the cpu requirements of lst? for balancing the reduction of cpu requirements, you would just have to reduce the cpu capacity of two logistics by a proportional amount. balancing the extra slot(s) increase, however, would be far more difficult.edit: i support this proposal."
7/15/2010,"i still don't know what you guys expect a lowering of lst cpu needs to achieve, but more battleship shield rr gangs will not be it."
7/15/2010,thread should have stopped here tbh
7/15/2010,not supported for the simple reason that its pointless giving a useless ship a role if you don't also give the player base the ability to build them.however i do agree the model is very good and would support a proposal to get the same model makers/designer to go through and redesign some of the older ship models.
7/15/2010,1 fix all the clicking. there is way to much bull**** clicking in this game. when i am crushing ore it shouldnt ask me what installation i want to use seeing as its the only one capable of doing it. pi really create link create route route product nice waste of my time there.2 cloaked system campers index falls everyday on its own i dont need help from some ass clown with nothing better to do than sit cloaked in system all day.3. invention waht a load of crap 30 days to copy obolisk bpo 6 days to invent and it hasnt worked the last 4 times off 2 bpos 8 copies down the crapper.4. hulkagedden holy **** a sponsered event to kill ships in high sec. and they all get paid to do it from insurince.4 why can we pull ore from the corp hanger for compression but not the ore hold.5. it carriers fighters and bombers both are manned craft now but it cant carry a frigate with someone in it.6. new space there needs to be a resone for some of these huge allainces to leave some of the 0.0 space so the littler corps can move down the there . give us a brake our little 10 man corp has to pay a rediculous rent to stay in a system that we dont have full rights in. ie moon mins plexs shuffle the moon minerals around a little or add them to wh space so smaller corps can have there own little part to call home.
7/15/2010,"how ****ing dare anyone out there make fun of ccp after all they've done for you.!they made factional warfare, they made wormholes. they made ****ing planetry interaction.a developer turned out to be a cheater, and now they're trying to finish dust. all you people care about is.. playing eve and having fun.they are human! what you dont realize is that they are making you all these games and all you do is write a bunch of crap about them.they havent released a good expansion in years. their motto is we care more. we work harder. for a reason because all you people want is more! more-more, more: more!leave them alone! you are lucky they even made eve for you bastards!leave ccp alone!..please.dierdra vaal talked about excellence and said if ccp was a excellent they wouldve pulled it off no matter what.speaking of excellence, when is it excellent to publicly bash someone who is going through a hard time.leave ccp alone please. !leave crowd control productions alone!right now!.i mean it.!anyone that has a problem with them you deal with me, because they are not well right now.leave them alone!"
7/15/2010,"not supporting the current course of ccp.introducing bugs is sad but happens - we're all human.not fixing them as soon as possible and instead introducing more content (that will have bugs as well) is wrong.you don't correct one mistake by making another.in 18 months when incarna and/or dust will be released there will be the next project/expansion on the horizon and new reasons to say ""we'll just do this, then we'll get back to fixing stuff. promise"".do it now, do it right.one thing you should learn early when developing software is leblancs law: later equals never.so please stop hoping you will have time later."
7/15/2010,here's an idea.spend less money on advertising and marketing... and more on fixing the bloody game.let the pilots advertise for you.it's how i found this game... word of mouth.i can tell you this much... the only reason you guys got people here who have played for years is because of loyalty over the spirit/uniqueness of eve... not for the frakking new features... i guarantee it.
7/15/2010,"you fail to consider that ccp/eve has been around for many, many years.the amount of very basic, reproducible bugs (not even considering more complex issues like fleet lag) is staggering for such a ""mature"" product. ccp has stated that devoting even a minimal amount of resources to this problem is out of the question.with this in mind, what grounds do you have to tell the player base to stop whining and support ccp?"
7/15/2010,"developing eve is ccp's job. i get up in the morning and go to my job and in return, i recieve a paycheck. if i did my job half-assed, i would be fired. end of story.ccp, however, gets paid roughly $15 per account per month regardless of how ****ed up they're most recent 'efforts' (and i use that term loosly) have been. we're the boss here people, and our employees are drinking on the job and stealing from the supply closet. time to put the hammer down and demand ccp quit ****ing around and follow through with their promises."
7/15/2010,sort out af's and make bo's worth their while first please!
7/15/2010,they need to make some new capitals or at least sub caps like the orca. this game is in need of some serious anti small ship caps. a gang of 5 recons can hold down a carrier forever and kill its drones and or fighters easy had it done to me and done it to otheres. get a sub cap that has rof bounus for large short range guns make a real battle ship. secondly make a capital mining ship that really mines not crunches ore make it a t2 version of orca or rouq park it in siege in a belt give a good range and yield bounus for strips. it would be great for mining and a target since it would have to be deployed in sige mode to mine.
7/15/2010,"sense and logic has been put aside for at least 18 months, havent you heard?"
7/15/2010,"there are enough ships already, ccp should just get to balancing them.and yeah, **** incarna, it's messing up the game completely and it's not even on the horizon."
7/15/2010,ccp...**** new ships...**** incarna...fix whats broken first.
7/15/2010,supporting wat is obviously the best idea. eve needs new ships. 10 years from now we cant be at the same ones.
7/15/2010,agreed all of you saying we have enough ships you missed the point. he's is talking about hulls if you haven't noticed most of the ships in eve are the same ships with different paint jobs.
7/15/2010,"i have only done a little research on this but as i play eve almost everyday and i have been for almost 2 years now i would like to propose that ccp implement several points (in high traffic areas maybe) where players can meet and fight against each other in a concord sanctioned battle. the players would be able to gamble with isk, items, or just for bragging rights. they would bring their own ship fitted how they like to the battle and would lose their ship or destroy their opponents' ship resulting in a recorded kill. this isnt meant to be a virtual battle as i have read about in the forums. instead as i stated it would be a willing agreement between 2 or more players where wagers could be placed and other pilots could gamble on as well or just show up to watch. other details would be that only parties that enter into this agreement can interact, this means no third party join in at the last second to help there friend by repping his/her shields or otherwise turn the tide of the battle. and perhaps the battle arena itself could take place in a ""pos shield"" type arena preventing either one from running and giving spectators a boundary from where they can watch the fight and as i mentioned before, place bets on either side. thoughts and suggestions are welcomed and if this forum allows it i will update the details and give credit to the person responsible for any new ideas. thanks for reading and as always...fly safe!"
7/15/2010,i have posted this idea several times. not as some ccp spawned thing but as a really really expensive really really big thing carebears build and control permanently. thusly i cant support.
7/15/2010,no. go on the test server
7/15/2010,"get a bunch of guys into 0.0, bubble them and there you go, you have an arenait's a sandbox, just diy, it's perfectly possible and no one is stopping you"
7/15/2010,"fair enough... was just a suggestion and i wanted to see how you feel about it. and i agree, there is more important thigs to take care of before that."
7/15/2010,"sweet. by the way, what's the name of your dev account?"
7/15/2010,"pretty self explanitory here, the orca is a fabulous mining support vessel, but only can specialty haul for one of the three types of raw material it helps gather. it's only logical that the ore hold also be eligible to store ice and gas."
7/15/2010,have you tried to put ice blocks in the hold cause i am sure last time i did ice mining they went in that hold
7/15/2010,ice can be moved to the ore hold i think..gas can't.but if i was wrong (and it has been a while since i've ice mined) i'd like it to be so.that's the whole reason of the ore hold isn't?(granted its not really ore but the point is storage of raw materials for processing amirite?)
7/15/2010,"gah, ice may indeed be allowed. i just finished a massive gas harvesting kick, and it was rather frustrating to not be able to bring it all out properly.we could use a ""bottling"" system for gas to be compressed via the rorqual, but i'm not holding my breath."
7/15/2010,"this is just a shot in the dark but i think its a good starting point for this idea. as we all know 0.0 is the main arena for large-scale pvp. this is not to say that large fights can't occur in low-sec or high-sec, but it means that large battles are much more likely to happen in 0.0 and since they are there should be a system in place to provide a boost to one of the highly prized aspect of this game which affects everyone in it. ccp have changed how sovereignty evolves and changes hands which is fine, but now they need to do something to stop the lag that is caused by large-scale pvp. my proposal would be to create some way to have the eve server automatically reinforce a system or systems around a large group of people moving through 0.0. an example would be if there were say a 150 member fleet jumping into a system, that system should be reinforced automatically and then the surrounding systems should be reinforced to be ready for the fleet to move into them if they did jump to them. one problem of this plan would be if they went through a jump bridge or a jump portal. i will admit to you right now that i don't know anything about gaming design or server managment at all so i do not even know if this is even possible. however, if there is a way to do it it should be done and i can tell just by looking at the map ingame when there is a large group of people moving around in 0.0 and asking ccp to reinforce a system or group of systems before a battle is very inefficient and against the basic rules of the game where battles anywhere should be able to happen without monsterous amounts of lag or manual beggin for reinforcement by gm's. i again stress that i do not know a much about how this game operates and what the server is capable of doing, but i think that this is a valuable idea that should be discussed and debated by all. marund"
7/15/2010,funfact: reinforcement happens during downtimes for a reason.
7/15/2010,"also something should be added to make your space in 0.0 a little safe with sov 5 you should get benifits like maybe npc patrols, scouts, or them dinky gate guns like in low sec. nothing huge but an advance warning. you give us super cap facilities at sov 1 but nothing at 5?oh and cyno jammer should come before cyno gen helps secure the system for the miners and builders."
7/15/2010,giving support knowing it's not possible.
7/15/2010,"you've effectively missed the whole point of fw. while i agree that fw should be fixed, i can't support your proposal."
7/15/2010,in general i hate having to fit a probe launcher on my ship to look for fights. thats why i don't go in wormholes. i tend to see things the opposite. i wish the fw plexes just appeared on the overview so we didn't have to scan them down. its just another way ccp wants us to pvp in gimped ships if we want to fight for occupancy. (fit a probe launcher fit some pve mods to fight rats that are in occupancy plexes etc) this is why its a rare bird that fights for occupancy in fw. i think the missions are pretty decently balanced. they are close to high sec level 4s (but they should be equal to them. but if they wanted to boost the fw missions i wish they would include more fw exclusive items like they did with apoc 1.5. or at least give some of the items they gave us a boost. things like amarr armor plates are worthless.
7/15/2010,not supported. 1. mission beacons on overview is invitation for fights. that's the whole point.2. having fw missions on overview keeps carebears from over fishing them.
7/15/2010,really this is some bull honky. our corp is small and we bust our asses to get our indexs up to 4-5. we rent space where ever we can and at the moment we are in a tuff place due to la differences. ( i am to stupid to learn another one).now comes along the asshat that wants to sit afk in our system cloaked all day for a week. what the hell are we supposed to do?? cant mine tried that hotdrop rouq hulks all dead cant rat pinned in belt until his buddies arrive dead again. so now we dont know if the guy is there or not we just know he is in the system. we can return the favor but there is no real threat from us to them. sure we have a carrier or 2 but the minute we do it to them there whole allaince is going to camp and **** us all day.there needs to be a limit on how long someone can remain cloaked or a sov structure that alows us to find them or small corps like ours arent going to make it.
7/15/2010,"i agree, delete local."
7/15/2010,"this. and op, get out of 0.0 if you can't deal with *one* person."
7/15/2010,read closely what it says before you comment. its not the 1 person that worries me its the fleet he cynos ontop of me. reading is fun.
7/15/2010,gee i don't know... maybe its because it takes a more than a few people to secure 0.0 sov?try several large corporations eh?maybe your not quite ready for 0.0... maybe you should start working on getting stronger/better organized and less complaining about your shortcomings.welcome to eve online 0.0 warfare... don't like it... leave. it's not supposed to be easy.
7/15/2010,"so, when he's there, ignore him and do nothing. don't even think about trying to communicate with him and absolutely don't respond to any smacktalk.a day or two of; no action, no kills, no fun and he'll bugger off and take his fleet with him. sure, you might have to suffer not being able to rat/mine for the same time period, but that's better than losing ships.if you know you can't fight the opponent on his terms, don't."
7/15/2010,lania thank you for the intelligent response. i guess that is all we can do for now. that and camp there systems.
7/15/2010,"everything in your post is just wrong, including your signature (i actually have glasses and can read that text)."
7/15/2010,sids is not funny man. it's just not funny. how dare you make dead baby jokes on the forum.oh lol wait. wrong sids.
7/15/2010,posting this twice does not make it look any better.
7/15/2010,"how does this aid lowsec in any shape or form?sorry, this makes no sense apart from making carebears have 'safe' pos's. no."
7/15/2010,"@indy yep, im aware of those sites and run them often. i am thinking more along the lines of a npc factions shooting at eachother and the ability to help one side or the other with even greater standings gain/loss."
7/15/2010,since when is eve all about fair fights?
7/15/2010,"reasonable, easy, go for it."
7/15/2010,eta on this simple fix: 18-24 months
7/15/2010,"sorry pressed wrong button. meant to post in a topic, but accidentally made a new one. can a mod handle this?"
7/15/2010,thread closed as op's request.
7/15/2010,"pi is only brought to the game because ccp wanted to get rid of npc sell orders for pos fuel and modules. any proposition about expanding pi to be more ""interesting"", time consuming or complicated is against everything that eve was (and hopefully still is) for the last 7 years - a pvp based space exploration game.not supported."
7/15/2010,"font's were talked about at the last csm summit this june. it is on friday at 13:30. i have the section quoted below if you don't wish to go to the link, it is a big pdf file.so we may see a new font before the end of the year. which would mean in the winter expansion. one thing to consider, it is a new font. they mention nothing of scaling. so we shall see what happens. in addition note that they are not allowing the choice of font. lets just hope that whoever they have is more competent at designing a legible font then the last one."
7/15/2010,i have to agree with the above and say that this action by ccp and csm has soured me on this game.
7/15/2010,"ccp suggested that csm work more with players to draft a well-supported vision for low sec, then submit a ""foundation story"" to ccp as a proposal that reflects that vision.in regard to this i will put my limited vision to the task. i think low sec can only be improved my encouraging more players and more types of players to interact together in low sec systems. i think we should encourage a mix of three different types of players law abiding players, law enforcement players and of course law breaking players. if we get a mix of these players then low sec would be a more fun and dynamic place for pilots use.law abiding playersthese are players who are not interested in pvp and so at the moment are very unlikely to use low sec. in order to encourage more of them to visit there can be a number of changes. the first could be to remove the jump highways and force people to travel through low sec when moving around the empire as discussed elsewhere on this forum although the discussion is still going on the basic concept is that to move from jita to rens as an example you would need to fly through some low sec systems which would encourage you to bring escorts/scouts or fly in convoys which brings more players into the systems. to go along with this there should be more of a need to travel through such as more npc buy/sell orders are contained in only one part of the empire to encourage traders to go get them, or these orders actually being in low sec systems themselves. another option which many people have put forward is to have some sort of industry that is contained within low sec however this will require a lot of time from the devs so its not likely at this point in time.law enforcement playersas it sounds this is players who have a high security status and like that but also want to pvp. as i write this most players dont see bounty hunting other players as a real or even side profession within the game. in order to change that i think player pirates should have a bounty on them (on top of player created bounties) this should be based on the size of ship they are flying and how bad their security status is, and to make life more interesting the bounty should double if you can kill them when they have gcc. to give these players more targets i think anyone with gcc should be a valid target for them regardless of security status. also while in low sec people who show up yellow because of a poor sec status should also be legitimate targets. in some forums there is talk of brining concord into low sec in a limited fashion. i think that would be wrong and players themselves should be encouraged to step in to act as the deterrent.law breaking players even without making changes a lot of people will be pirates. they will attack easy targets like miners/transports and any wannabe police they think they can take. however i think it could be worth giving them something to do when there are no targets going through. for example pirate mission agents could be added where a low security standing is needed along with the faction standing to increase the level of agents. these mission would be combat based within low sec where the pirates could then also be checking local for real targets as they do the missions.to make this fair however i would make it that you need a bad sec status to get much out of these so the players must make a choice to cut themselves off from high sec for a time to do this.going by the minutes from the csm meeting it seems to be up to us to provide the ideas for change. what i have written is only after a day of thinking about it so most of the ideas will have a problems and probable wont work but i believe i am right when i say we need different types of players in low sec to make it fun and so we need different incentives to encourage players to come in. i know most people wont agree with everything"
7/15/2010,second life in stations = incarna ring a bell anyone
7/15/2010,"i disagree because very little more would be required for it to be more than just marketing: ccp committing some dev resources to csm requests (as implied by ""stakeholder"" status). this must be reflected in ccps resource planning. even just 5% of the total dev resources would do wonders. i'm guestimating that would mean about half the resources of one scrum team. seeing that many csm requests are low hanging fruits, a lot could be done with that already."
7/15/2010,wow ccp alt much?your excuses for ccp are absolutely pathetic
7/15/2010,"hmmm..how appropriate, you fight like a cow !"
7/15/2010,very concise and well written post. tks for the advice mate.
7/15/2010,"at a first glance, the minutes seemed very well-written.but then.... ""hanger"".ffs, illiterates. go back to friggin' elementary school."
7/15/2010,where are those 'small' fixes i have been wondering in the 2+ years i'm playing eve. ccp hasn't been able to fix something simple as the price history graph that has been broken since dominion for instance. i doubt if they even located where the problem is tbh.
7/15/2010,you forget to mention that bugs often return in ccp land or that they are claimed to be fixed while in fact they are not. drones having a will of their own comes to mind for example...
7/15/2010,"i do not disagree to that. as said, there will allways be bugs, and there are allways some bugs fixed in each patch. read the patch notes, its all documented there. wether or not you would like ccp to fix more bugs is a completly different matter, but saying ccp does not fix bugs, or that they said they would not fix any bugs in the next 18 month, is just untrue."
7/15/2010,"we all know that there is no such thing as bug free software. thing is, ccp seems to be introducing more bugs than it fixes, at least in my experience. and letting simple bugs linger for years is not good game making, you can spin and twist that all you want but it simply isn't. look, if ccp introduced a bug in expansion x, i expect them to fix it in patch x.1, x.2 or even x.3 or .4. i do not however, expect that bug to linger and even survive the next expansion launch. furthermore, there are aspects that should have een overhauled, long, long looooong ago. take sound for instance, take the ui and i'm sure others can name a few others of the top of their head. i truly believe that the path ccp is walking right now and has been walking the past few years will be the death of the game. the lack of competition has saved there butts for now but i doubt that will last forever. myself i would not even be playing eve anymore if i couldn't sustain my accounts with plex without too much trbl as i simply don't think this game is worth cashing out 20-30 bucks a month for..."
7/15/2010,"hard to say that, but is true, csm is useless.why ? because nothing happen when they give to ccp an idea, what the players need.just check this date and promises. submission date: 02-12-2008 votes:yes"
7/15/2010,"that would be me, although i'm sometimes wondering whether it isn't the other way around."
7/15/2010,"its not true csm(not this one) got the mete 0 item drop taken from bs, was i think bunyip and or ank."
7/15/2010,fyp
7/15/2010,"the op doesn't seem to be ank, they just have compatible personality disorders."
7/15/2010,excellent player run economy. ok.. obviously you must have been recycling pos mods just before pi started.epic .. fleets? wtf game are you playing? i had more fun in 2005 with issn than recently on a shc angel slideshow night five years later.
7/15/2010,wot-oh!
7/15/2010,#NAME?
7/15/2010,"that is how i would title the csm minutes i just read. what i read is ccp is going to work on incarna and dust 514 for the next two years instead of eve. lets face it, both are different games than eve. incarna is some sort of sci fi second life and dust 514 cant even be played on a pc. pi  i havent tried it as it just seems tedious. maybe its important for dust 514, but i really dont care. im not against either of these games (dust or incarna) and i hope ccp does well with them. but the only reason is because i hope they make more money to spend on eve. however i do have some expectation that *some* of the money i spend on this mmo will go into the game i actually play and love. tyranis was the worst expansion. the only thing that even remotely captured my attention made me wince. a cheap t1 battleship used to be a good way to fight even though you were against larger numbers. the insurance would allow you to get back the cost of the hull plus some of the expensive large mods. now that is gone so there is no cost effective way to fight when you are outnumbered. that sums up tyranis for me.arnar, matt and guilhem responded that low sec is a bit broken, is not what it should be and ccp are aware of this. a specific low sec expansion is not on the 18 month plan; however ccp is looking into a combat expansion, where combat awareness and information regarding combat would be refined for the user (not the combat mechanics themselves), which would benefit every eve player rather on focusing just on low sec. at the moment ccp are focusing on planetary interaction and incarna but maybe next summer there could be a combat expansion rather than a feature specific expansion. even though ccp would like to change low sec it will not happen in the next eighteen months. what does this mean? combat awareness and information would be refined? will the overview indicate who is neuting us? will it make it clear who is scramming you as opposed to just disrupting you?ccp, you have to understand that this is not what people who play eve want to hear. remember we are the ones who actually like eve enough to pay for it every month to play. as far as im concerned you might as well tell us you will not spend any time in the next two years on eve because all your focus is on this really cool new twilight game your making complete with hunky werewolves suave vampires. until you guys are actually going to work on eve why have a csm? is it to grief us? when you want to start working on eve again reconvene the csm and let us know what your thoughts are."
7/15/2010,"i'm not happy with ccp right now, but there is really no need for a twelfth thread on this issue."
7/15/2010,"1. yes, we have many, many threads on this already. 2. and evidently we're now not allowed to use the sig that criticizes ccp for abandoning eve's problems? not that i am discussing moderation at all, only mentioning it."
7/15/2010,"i read the minutes with interest. i believe most people, least of all the csm, are not surprised by ccp's responses but i applaud this csm for posing the right questions nonetheless, good work!"
7/15/2010,"i doubt it. have you read some of the garbage they publish as serious articles? i'd say they're desperate for anything legible.on another note, i agree with the endorsement of the thread, and hereby second, third and fourth it."
7/15/2010,seems like mynxee was taking the lead on that topic at the summit. i'd be interested in her thoughts about how to collect and organize the ideas.
7/15/2010,"i recently read an article on microsoft's 1 vs 100 being canceled, and while the article was all about the gameshow being canceled, one part stood out to me:linkage - ms cancels 1 v 100as i look around at other large multi-user sites, all downloading and uploading and changing data by the millions, like facebook, myspace, even the various player-run forums - i am curious what our current limitations are with eve and what the difference is from these large scale operations, and eve's. is it the ""amount"" of servers running simultaneously? their speed? is it the underlying code of eve? is the budget of ccp smaller than i thought? 600k accounts brings in quite a bit of dough i would think, and server rentals aren't that expensive. is it the location? would thinks be faster if they spread out the cluster over the world, ie renting servers here in los angeles, in europe, in asia.i may be alone here, but i look around me and see things on equally massive scales, and i wonder why we can't duplicate this in eve. why it takes forever to check email while in game, as opposed to evegate. why they can't split up servers dynamically, based on the player load. if the player load goes above a certain amount, no others are allowed into the system until it is switched to a different server, that can handle the load.theoretically, eve should be able to support any number of people all in the same system at once, the trick is to seamlessly shift the physical servers their session is hosted on. i think most people wouldn't mind a queue, as long as the fleet stayed together. this would help fleets plan better so they don't overload the system.also, adaptive switching. if a fleet of 1000 are warped to the same gate all at once, the server could attempt to foresee where they are headed, and allocate a dedicated server for the upcoming battle before they even get to the gate.i know i'm showing my ignorance here - but it doesn't seem that far fetched to think ccp should have 1000 blade servers all running at the same time in different parts of the globe. instead of a refrigerated closet in newcastle."
7/15/2010,"it all comes down to the amount of interaction between players that the server has to keep track of.firstly look at facebook. every time you (or other people) refresh the page it causes the system to query the database and return the most recent status updates. if you are in the middle of updating your status then people continue to see the old status information until you finish posting it. it is also fairly simple (for a given value of simple ) to split this load by having multiple servers. each ""client facing"" server can have its own cached copy of the database and updates can be passed through to those as needed. essentially the data is flowing in one direction and doesn't depend on anything else.now look at a different example.imagine a bank dealing with millions of transactions a day. each of those transactions is a simple process, move x cash from account y to account z. to ensure money isn't lost the system will do something like this* lock both account y and z* debit account y* credit account z* unlock both accountswhen the accounts are locked, no other process can read the balance (so as to not return incorrect values) and if anything tries it will be queued until the lock is released.however the system can still handle transactions on accounts other that y and z and as each transaction is fairly simple any queued requests are dealt with quickly.the bank might have millions of customers but for each transaction there is only interaction between two accounts.now look at eve. each ship on grid is interacting with every other ship on grid. even if it is cloaked 100km away from the action the server still has to check for collisions and also send updates for all the visible ships/drones etc.if there are 100 players on grid (including me) and i move my ship then* my client sends a move ship message to the server* the server calculates my ship position and checks for any collisions etc* the server sends my updated position to each of those 100 playersfor practical reasons there is a global tick which limits the updates sent to each player by batching up the player requests.so the last example, my gang are shooting a primary target.* each client sends a shoot gun message to the server* for each gun fired the server calculates hit or miss based on the various parameters (tracking etc)* for a hit, the victim's ship stats are locked, the amount of damage done is subtracted from shield/hull/armour and then the stats are unlocked (this isn't likely to be the way it is really done but conceptually only one process should be able to change the ship stats at the same time).* once processing for that tick is complete then the server sends updates to all the clients.this is more akin to the way bank transactions work than the facebook example, but rather than each interaction being limited to two bank accounts each interaction on grid could be a thousand clients or more!it is a far more complicated problem than allowing 100,000 people to vote in a gameshow"
7/15/2010,"i don't believe they actually send information every clock cycle. the game simulation is deterministic, therefore they only need to send information back to the server when there is a user input. each user input is sent to all the clients, which update based on that input so all the client simulations are synced. the clients run the simulation, therefore they calculate the collisions, damage, etc. teadaze, if it worked the way you are saying then the only thing that the client does is handle graphics. sorry, but you're wrong."
7/15/2010,"there is most definitely a global tick, you can observe the phenomenon in many situations. i'm simply saying that the current ""public"" game state will be likely sent to all the clients on grid at that time. even if it is only based on player input in most fights people will be making user inputs all the time.the client may well run its own simulation for display purposes but the server has a ""master copy"" and that was the reason for desync back in the day. the server also deals with damage etc because the first rule of client server is never trust the client. i can't prove anything without the code of course..."
7/15/2010,"i really love the csm - that was a great reply, thanks!i guess it would be very similar to a site like e-trade - making millions of transactions per second, yet needing the security and still be in real time.i read in the csm minutes that they are developing a more modular and dynamic way to allocate nodes. i would think this architecture change would be at the top of the list. why not? did ccp give a reason? i think people would be less vocal if the game ran smoothly in it's current state. i know it would give me more security knowing that incarna wouldn't just layer on top of faulty architecture.and - would more servers grouped in various parts of the world help? the more i think about it, a market trading site would be an excellent case study, comparing the two."
7/15/2010,"i think i'm agreeing when i say that in other networked games such as the unreal tournament series (which is well documented and allows you to poke around in the script) both the server and client simulate the physics of moveable objects but the server data is authoritative. in most cases the client assumes that in the absence of user input, objects (such as players) keep moving in the same direction with constant velocity, and intermittently the position and velocity are updated (causing visible jumps on screen, and similar 'desync' behaviour). (for decorative elements in a level sometimes the simulation is carried out purely client-side as the decoration does not interact with the movement or combat, and it doesn't matter if different clients see different animations.)i would imagine the same mechanic applies to eve, although because you have the option to set a ship to orbit at a certain distance - and many people just leave ships doing that - and also because of finite aligning speeds, there will be less obvious desyncing with movement in combat. desync effects have been reduced in eve over time, which i would attribute to a combination of more efficient transfer of data to clients (for example by prioritising the data better) and eliminating bugs where the client simulated something differently to the server.(punkbuster type programs aside, yes it is possible to modify a client to alter the simulation or input data. if you want to hack the game so your interceptor goes at twice the speed you can do that, but what you will likely see is a succession of 'snap backs' as your ship position is adjusted to the server version, and phantom damage appearing on your ship as the server values (calculated with slower speeds etc) get updated to the client. what you shouldn't be able to do (if the code is doing what it should) is be able to get an actual combat advantage by such hacking, as you can't override the server model of events.)in a game like unreal tournament, there is a certain bandwidth between server and client (which can be manually throttled by the client) and the server prioritises data according to this bandwidth. all relevant game data (including high priority data such as position and velocity of players and ditto for projectiles, and low priority data such as game scores, taunts and chat) cannot be sent in a single tick or packet - far from it - but it is queued and rearranged so that the high priority data is sent sufficiently regularly to provide reasonably seamless action, and the low priority data is squeezed into the pipe as and when space is available. no reason to suspect eve does things any differently, but this kind of netcode can look incredibly simple but be a real brain melt to debug and improve."
7/15/2010,"some very clever people are working on this stuff. we've asked for a dev blog about the presentation we were given on scaling etc.some of the time it does run fine, it is the cases with hundreds of people trying to fight in huge battles where the issues kick in. they are working on this bit (not fast enough for the players of course!).moving the servers apart would likely be worse because remote nodes would have less bandwidth and higher latency to the database cluster.as i said, i'm just assuming a number of things based on best practice and other games (as fatmarrow has done in his excellent post above) so don't take my answers as complete fact."
7/15/2010,"you make a great point about less bandwidth. and i do understand that eve isn't just a bunch of numbers like a market trading site. even simple physics can get crazy complex when done for thousands of players at the same time.i'm glad we're having a discussion about this though, i feel more comfortable knowing the challenges, and what's being done to overcome them. i think people get a little frustrated when they get little nibbles of devblogs that don't actually speak to the actual issue of the lag - ie the server move devblog. i think everyone thought that the server move would fix all of the issues.by the way, i do quite a bit in highsec, but as soon as i started setting things up in lowsec, whenever i'm out there, i do see noticeable lag certain times. a few of my corpmates have been kicked even, and my client kicks me more when i'm in lowsec. i haven't lost a ship yet though."
7/15/2010,"i've lagged out systems, with game-crushing jump lag, fc'ing a fleet of 13 corp mates. and part of the situation is that, pre-dominion, we used to be able to have huge battles with hundreds of people shooting at each other. lag was bad, but the game was playable. now we've got y-2ano and 6nj8-v. the game is actually going backwards."
7/15/2010,"i guess in terms of what finnagain is saying about life in eve post dominion, maybe it's down to the assumptions that the game makes about why players are in a system. to elaborate, since dominion we have seen more and more ""new stuff"" being added to systems - whether they be anomalies/plexes, the changed sovereignty structures, planetary interaction, etc. what i have yet to see is a good explanation on how the loading up of all this stuff affects a systems load time performance for each player that enters that system.for example. pilot a jumps into a system that currently contains no other players. upon landing in the system, the game code makes the determination that the pilot, now that he/she is in the system, may wish to do any (or all) the following things;1. continue through to the next gate, doing nothing in system.2. flies around in system dropping probes looking for stuff.3. flies to a pos to do pos stuff.4. flies to a moon to drop a pos.5. flies to a ss to do some pi stuff,6. rat.7, mine, etc, etc, etc.prior to the expansions after dominion, the amount of things that one ""could"" do in any one system were generally limited to at most - say half a dozen activities (with the necessary db interactions happening in the background). post dominion though and the number of ""possible"" activities per player in a system starts to rapidly increase, and when you consider that not every player will enter a system to do a single thing, the game logic will try and provide each player who enters the system with the range of choices on offer. now this is fine if one or two pilots enter a system, but when multiples of players enter the same system almost simultaneously, the game is unable to differentiate between whether these players are going to,1. continue through to the next gate, doing nothing in system.2. flies around in, (you get the idea).now as the game can't determine the intent of the players once they are in the system, it still has provide all of these options and attempts to make the necessary system resources available - db pre-loads, etc - ""just in case"" (so for example, anomalies are flagged for creation, rats and flagged for spawning , roids are flagged mining, pi is flagged for scanning, etc). and of course it does this for each player.so it is possible that the underlying logic behind what is available to a player when they enter a system, is in fact causing increased lag as the game assumes that no matter whether 1, or 500 pilots enter a system, they may wish to mine, rat, pvp, run plexes, play with colonies, etc - and so consequently tries it's hardest to make all of these options available. this as each expansion adds yet more things to do in a system, the amount of possibilities available to a player expands exponentially to the point where the amount of resources needed to service one player in a system, is the equivalent to what was required to service say 20 players in the days of dominion.just a thought."
7/15/2010,"well - it seems to me that lag tends to present itself in 0.0 most of the time. since highsec has the most people, i see lots of people flying around, and fleets don't appear to be effected much. jita even runs smoothly for me. but as soon as i get into 0.0, where people generally move around quickly, systems can be empty, then all of a sudden full of people and it starts lagging. even a gang of 10 can cause a system to lag.i'm curious why they don't have a queue set up based on fleet size. if part of a fleet, and the fleet will cause the system to become overpopulated, why not halt the jump and make the fleet wait until the fleet is moved to a dedicated node (whatever a node is). this way, you don't have 3 that manage to jump through, but they can't see anything because their overview hasn't updated, and the next thing they see is the inside of a station, while the other 300 in the fleet is still stuck on the other side, in limbo, unable to do anything."
7/15/2010,"that is my feeling seriously.csm was created as a pr tool mostly ( i am not saying it was the only reason)after i read csm minutes , private blogs of csm members , threads on this forums i think that tool of ccp got out of hand and went ""rogue"".after reading all of that i asked myself a question , do i get the impression that ccp is cooler company or not... well certanly _not_ ( i specificly say impression , coz ccp is probably a very cool company but csm is not adding to that image)pshint ,hint ...such jewels from minutes do not help either (blunt lie) ""lag will always be an issue however eve, but eve is now, from a technical standpoint, in a better state than it has ever been."""
7/15/2010,"please allow me to refer you to this thread, where i've commented on some of the things you are bringing up. hope that helps a bit with your changing opinion.you bring up an interesting point which i think shows one of the reasons why other developers i talk to think we are absolutely ridiculously insane for engaging in something like the csm. that being the possibility that they will vocally disagree with us. in fact, with eve, that's more likely a probability instead of a possibility. eve's complexity, metagame and very design lend it to so many various playstyles, opinions and social groups that representatives of each of those groups will almost necessarily clash to some degree. and, well, if they didn't have serious issues to bring to us, would they really be worthwhile? i've been amazed with each csm the amount of preparation and thought they bring to the table. while they might not have represented ""pilot x"" perfectly, they do represent the player base pretty well it turns out.so yes, the csm thrives on diversity and difference of opinion, like any good political body should. the members didn't go through elections and travel to iceland just to play fanboi and get signatures on their copies of the burning life. trust me, i had a sharpie ready! they, as players, have issues they think will improve eve online. internet spaceships can be very serious business. expect dissent? indeed. kinda cringe every time they aren't giving us a high five? instinctually :)"
7/15/2010,"manifest, did you read the feedback in that thread?i mean, all due respect, and i think it is fair to say that after that csm summit people have a new found respect for the actual devs, but you're confusing a few points. mixing up a bunch of definitions. and missing the actual points in question.i really am sorry, but this method is not going places, other to engage on and confirm a negative spiral. there are much better methods at the disposal."
7/15/2010,"i thought the same thing; either ccp is using the csm as a pr front, or they're nuts.having suffered through soe's many swg snafus, i remember their attempt at having class leaders bring forward issues to the dev team. while the dev team was filling the class leaders with sunshine and rainbows to feed the players, management was pulling assets off of swg to take things in another direction.when the class leaders started making noises that management didn't like, they started dissapearing.soe management was so focused on how to change their game to get new player numbers (like the game that shall not be mentioned), that they failed to realize one simple thing. people that wanted to play tgtsnbm, already were. people that wanted to play swg as it was, already were. in the end, they failed to get the new players, lost nearly all their current players, and ruined the company name in the process.history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. i do hope i'm wrong, but i'm starting to see that pattern come around again.only time will tell."

7/16/2010,"i don't recall the part of the insurance contract that refers to fun. can you quote it for me? i read the insurance contract the last time i insured a ship; i understood it. we're proposing a change to the game, so the contract doesn't apply. we're going to change the contract, so that it doesn't pay out for piracy. we're not outlawing piracy.because i don't want to lose my ship? i don't fear low-sec pirates because they stay in lowsec, and i don't go there. once they come into hisec, they become hisec pirates.i am sorry it bothers you that i don't want to play the game your way. but you cannot insult me into changing my mind. again, this is not about ganking, or risk, or currency farming. this is about insurance payouts.thank you for restating my point. no, i have no problem with suicide ganking as an action, just as a profession. profits from suicide ganking should proceed from salvage and cargo, not insurance fraud. we are closer to agreeing than ever! and as a reference, an excuse is something you have after you act; a reason is something you have before. the vote has not been made, so we are all expressing our reasons. again, insulting me will not change my mind. and for the record, i did handle the rats - i ran away. i lived to mine another day. w00t!carebears are mission runners, even i know that. i'm just a miner. i'm not a roleplayer, so i'm not playing an angel/angle. if i wanted to play wow, i would, so that's not what this is about. i don't recall using semantics in my earlier posts, but i don't put it past me; if i did, well spotted. i do, however, fail (fail) to see how playing eve invalidates my argument. explain.i'd think many people would have given up on this by now, but i won't. go ahead, gank all you like. my objection is to insurance payouts on pirate vehicles destroyed by concord. my personal safety doesn't enter into it. the difference between a true ganker and a welfare pirate is, the ganker will kill you even if he doesn't stand to make an isk from it; he does it for lulz, love, or hate.he wants you dead, not an easy paycheck. and of course, you're right - suicide gankers are the least of my problems. i worry more about mineral prices in jita, because, you know, i'm a miner."
7/16/2010,"try to keep up: the contract is part of the game so it does apply. and if u wanna take away the payout, then that means i can take out exhumer mining in high sec. and i'm not outlawing high sec mining either.that means u do fear low sec pirates. u just said they're the reason u're too scared to even go there. likewise. after all, because of the way we play, u felt ""affected"" enough to cry for this change and that's why it ties in with ganking, risk, and currency farming. u're the one who wants to deter our way of playing because u're incapable of even defending yourself...in a game. 1. insurance fraud is only punishable in real life, which means it's allowed in eve. just giving it a real-life reference does not make it ""bad"". ppl kill each other all the time in eve but that does not make it murder. 2. a reason can also come afterwards. and there's a reason why after all these years, payouts still exist in eve, which means it's still there for a reason--it's a game.running away is not handling--it's running away. and if macro miners can create a program to automatically handle rats while they're mining to show how easy and otherwise riskless your own profession really is, yet u can't even perform that simple task while u're actively playing, then like i said, suicide gankers r the least of your problems. 1. a carebear is anyone who wants to avoid conflict entirely. that is u, which makes u a miner and a carebear.2. u don't want to play wow, yet u want to turn eve into wow...that's some good logic there... 3. ""insurance fraud""--there's your semantics, which i explained above.4. eve does not cater to ignorance and stupidity, something u have more than enough of to even be incapable of performing a task so simple that another player can create a simple program to automate. 1. that's good to know 'cause that means a. u'll be wasting even more of your time here while everyone, including me, laughs at u and b. your current ""issue"" with suicide gankers isn't really an issue in the first place if even an utterly incompetent carebear like u, will still mine.2. once again, your personal safety does enter into it or else u would not be crying about it in the first place.3. ""true"" suicide gankers don't profit from blowing up exhumers, at least not the exhumers that were fitted with expensive mods due to the miner's stupidity. the ones u support r the ones that r killing u,...unless u were blown up in a faction-fitted ship...oh wait...4. don't forget the high sec rats either, lest your own incompetence costs u another faction-fitted ship. but plz continue"
7/16/2010,"i am sorry. i won't change my opinion just be cause you don't agree with me. and i won't agree with you if you only insult me. i hope you continue to enjoy the game in your own way no matter how the vote turns out, as you can be sure i will. if this thread and the others like it are any indication, the insurance will stop covering acts of piracy, and you'll need to find a new source of income, which i can understand your being pretty upset about. if you put as much energy into creating emergent gameplay as you have into deftly refuting my arguments, i'm sure you'll be wealthy in no time. have fun, and good luck out there!"

7/16/2010,"this is something that has been on the top of my mind for the past month. i got involved with eve because of all the little cool things i saw that made it appear like the company was different from all the other ""let's make shinies so the ignorant masses will flock to our money farms for a month. the marketing numbers never lie!"" companies out there.sadly, i am learning that it is quite the opposite. respect to all the awesome developers like manifest, you guys are what makes the game worth playing, and the executives unfortunately leave an awful smell in their wake that is very unbearable.i am paying very close attention to how ccp handles everything in the upcoming months, and i am prepared to quit if it becomes obvious that ccp isn't going to start taking responsibility. and seeing how long it takes to get a character going, i will probably never come back if i have to pull the plug. i'm gonna take a radical step here and point out the obvious:remember how csm got started in the first place?if eve can survive the t20 debacle, it can certainly survive a ""hey you made your promises, now keep them"" article. i love the idea of a protest, and i would certainly take part. unfortunately, it's very difficult to come up with one that would be effective. i highly doubt management would care about taking down third party sites, or even people refusing to log in (they've still got subscriptions). and press coverage would only be effective if the reasoning for the blackout were addressed. this begs the question- ""why not just go straight to them in the first place?""i'd suggest everyone gathering in a single system, with ships named to show protest, to crash the server, but that would be inviting a ban for ""making it more difficult/expensive to run eve.""it'd be cool if someone could come up with an effective (and non ban-inducing) protest idea though."
7/16/2010,"its nothing personal here but really?the idea of organizing a press attack to convey a few fans disgruntlement over lingering lag, factional warfare issues, and an empty spot on the map, is just stupid. not only that but overly self important this isnt cnn news worthy. it isnt even worth a blurb on massively, unless they are desperate for an article and on the way out. if you love the game in such a way as to kill it (or try to slap it around) for leaving you then you are in a sick and dysfunctional relationship. we know how those turn out for people in real life. if you are that ticked off over ccps current direction then do yourself a favor and vote with your wallet. thats the only real voice you have with any consumer product.enough of the player base seems quiet, stable, and happy enough mission running along in hi sec that i can see why some of these issues may not be considered a high priority. ccp doesn't have any reason to believe that they are ignoring the player base, just ""you."" really, you want change and an issue brought to the forefront? then find a way to motivate enough people within the game to come over here and vote or pontificate on it.as soon as you have to look for external stimuli (like a news agency) to poke a hole in something like this for you, then youve already failed before starting."
7/16/2010,notice how close this would take you complete failure cascade ccp?
7/16/2010,"you are aware that the ny times has, several times, reported on eve goings on? remember the pink hat? it's a bit unconvincing for you to say that this is all ""stupid"" and nobody wants to cover it... when the mainstreadm press has covered things of less importance than ccp admitting that they're letting the game rot on the vine for a year and a half to two years."
7/16/2010,"i don't think they're ignoring the csm, or the playerbase for that matter. i just think that they believe - perhaps correctly - that sticking to their development cycle and releasing new content every six months is overall better for the game than the alternative suggestions. i don't see ccp absent, not responding, not reading the feedback, not flying people out to sit down and discuss .... what i see is ccp ultimately disagreeing with your (our?) (the vocal forum warriors' and csm's?) assessment of what is best for the game - at least on the issue of ""stop development and bug fix"" versus ""finish development cycle then turn to bug fixes""."
7/16/2010,"ccp manifest has gigantic stones for daring to step into this viper's nest. you are one cool dude, and if i make it to fanfest i'm buying you some beer."
7/16/2010,"if the csm is a stakeholder and being a stakeholder means ""a seat around the table when the priorities are set"", how can it be that the csm goes to the summit and the priorities for the next 18 months are already cast in stone?"
7/16/2010,"a pop culture bit in the arts section about a pink hat wearing cow poke playing eve in a struggling news paper looking for a gamer feel good piece and a couple of liberal arts dollars is supposed to convince me that the forum ranting of a few disgruntled fan boys who cant motivate enough of the current player base into caring about their issue right here to make a difference is news worthy????k. i hear people cover kitten births too. maybe you could convince a hack to write about it. but thats just not enough to do anything worthwhile.if you want to see what a motivated player base can do, then just look at the wow real id fiasco. this just doesnt compare. ccp isnt leaving eve to rot on the vine. thats your perception. they are expanding the game with new features while leaving your issue as well enough done for now. but keep trying. you may get somewhere if you figure out a worthy strategy."
7/16/2010,"""our issues""? dude, you got no clue. just because highsec missionbears can play the game just fine, it doesn't mean the game runs smooth or that we, as the playerbase, should ignore broken promises or wait another 2 to 4 years until the broken or uncomplete stuff finally gets the dearly needed fixes and attention, and even then only probably, as the minutes put it..."
7/16/2010,"for example: suspend the automatic renewing paying subscription saying that you have doubt on the future development of the game and that you didn't want to be tied to a 6 month commitment?it is exactly what i have done for half of my accounts. if things continue as they are doing they will live with plex or, more probably, they will go dormant. if ccp don't take several years old accounts unsuscribing as a bad sign, i think nothing will change their course. if, on the other hand, i am the only one or one of the few doing that it mean they are following the right path."
7/16/2010,"i'm not in favor of csm bad mouthing ccp. that is a bad idea for everyone in eve. ccp is the greatest game company and has made the best computer game ever. i complain as much as anyone but we cant lose sight of that. that said after reading the minutes, i don't understand what csm is doing other than pr. (btw im actually fine with it being pr and i hope its good pr for the company. ) every topic that csm wanted to bring up was met with same response. not for 18 months because we are working on incarna and dust. well the players really know nothing about incarna or dust. therefore how can csm possibly represent the players on these topics?ok csm says they want to be able to punch each other in stations. well this was never discussed with any players on forums that i saw. my own view is that if punching each other in stations would delay ccp from getting back to work on eve for even a *single day*, then leave the punching out! bottom line on all this is that incarna and dust are basically different games that players know nothing about. therefore the players havent given any input on it. therefore, if csm makes recommendations they cant be speaking for the players. so what is the point of having a csm over the next 18 months  if not for pr?ccp keep some people working on things for eve. dont put everything off for 18 months (which i easily read as 2 years) maybe only allow one type of station to be walked in. dont design navy stations yet or any of the types of stations that are in jita. that way you dont have to worry about jita lag right now and you dont have to spend time developing all the different stations. limit the work on incarna to allow *some* concurrent development of eve - as we know it."
7/16/2010,"it's interesting how quickly your argument went from ""that's not newsworthy."" to ""okay, sure, the ny times has covered stories about eve just like this but, well, hey, look over there! p.s. hacks!"" oh hell no. you can't reason someone out of a position that they didn't use reason to get into in the first place. i was just pointing out the facts. common misunderstanding. paying with isk means that someone still payed with cash. this is not an effective protest. nor is stopping playing, as lots of folks over time have done just that for various reasons and ccp is unfazed. if anything, lack of old players just reinforces the strange belief that ccp seems to have that they need to crank out half-finished buggy expansions in order to attract new subscribers."
7/16/2010,"common tactic: changing what other people say to suit your argument. that is not what i said.when you explicitly state: ""i want to be capable of stopping paying in any way within a month instead of the current 6 month plan"" and "" i don't feel that the proposed future developments are worth 15 /month"" they should take note. that is a valid argument instead and something that i have covered already in another thread. sadly i don't feel that currently eve is giving me back my 71,70  for the six month subscription, at least not on the secondary accounts. maybe it is worth the 300milion isk/month, maybe not, it all depend if they can make the isk passively. as you say, voting this way has drawbacks as it can reinforce ccp opinion that they need more new players (an argument that dr. battlesmith covered reasonably well in gd), but doing nothing will reinforce this opinion the same and ""calling the press"" is a dangerous move an the press has different goals from the eve players."
7/16/2010,"i didn't change anything. suspending renewal does nothing unless you let the accounts go inactive. and if you don't let them go inactive then either you're paying with money but on a non-six-month basis or you're paying with gtc's, which are still paying with money but you're just using a proxy. if all you do is remove automatic renewal, then all ccp really knows is that some people aren't committing as much cash in one go. the point is that nothing so far has had any effect or it's had a negative effect. -people not re-subbing some or all of their accounts: no effect or causing ccp to focus on getting even more new players-writing well though out, coherent arguments on the forums: totally ignored.-nearly 2000 accounts taking the time to support the drive for excellence and against half-baked crapware expansions: ignored.-the csm taking the time to draft a comprehensive proposal and demands: not just ignored, handwaved away and told that new content is their drive. the point is that nothing else so far has worked. i've seen a lot of naysaying, but not one solution that hasn't been tried and that might work."
7/16/2010,"the problem i have with this is that it's usually just a very few loud minority that screams to have certain things changed to their way. and when that doesn't happen then this is somehow translated to ccp isn't listening to the playerbase. i'd be curious what percentage of the playerbase is the csm really representing. it doesn't take much to realize that these forums are plagued with whines concerns from the same usual suspects. these suspects bump their csm to get their changes through even if they don't represent the playerbase.the csm is there to advise and somewhat oversee what ccp is doing (transparency and all that). they're not there (at least i hope not) to strong-arm the game into the direction of the few that voted them in that particular term.if the csm ever turns into the final say decision-making entity then that will be when the game will lose balance and thus, start to die out. ccp has been successfully managing their game for 7+ years now. give this power to the very loud minority that won't be happy until their paper beats rock and scissors and **** will finally hit the fan."
7/16/2010,"in the csm minutes i noticed attention was paid to unfinished/forgotten content, and imho cosmos is pretty much at the top of the list. it is broken down, busted, on the state line road.so here is my proposal. first, the fixes. 1) bring gallente and minmatar cosmos up to speed with caldari and amarr. more missions and better rewards are absolutely necessary for these two.2) modules. leave the fittings the way they are. boost the meta level of all items attribute wise 1-2 points. 3) make all blueprints a maximum of 3 runs.4) decrease the skillbook drop and increase training time on the ancient tech skills, not the invention skills.5) balance the rewards in the lowsec amarr and minmatar cosmos constellations. they suck. now on to moar cosmos.1) add 1 new cosmos constellation to each empire in highsec, continuing the arc.2) add gallente and caldari lowsec cosmos constellations to bring it in line with amarr and minmater. 3) add 4 cosmos constellations to rogue drone space with new bpc's and items. these should preferably continue on with the whole soct/drone mother theme found in parchannier.4) add pirate agent cosmos constellations to all 0.0 npc regions with the same amount of agents as the highsec constellations, with yes, new bpc's and items. that have nothing to do with gas harvesting por favor. give them gate agents that hand out pirate ship bpc's based on standings just like in highsec5) add a fourth gate agent (the ones that give out the ship bpc's) that hand out a sort of end-of-arc epic storyline. one time only like the rest of cosmos, so your choices matter. these should require insanely high standings like the bs offers to make the choices during the arc seriously matter and prevent a guide coming out 2 days later.6) add 1 more lowsec constellation for each empire. 7) wormhole cosmos sites. stranded agents in space is win. eta: increase difficulty accross the board. cosmos should be a group effort. it adds alot of flavor when you do them in a group and get lots of giggles when everyone gets to read michi's psycho-yoda babbling. to put my money where my mouth is, about the skills and training time, i sold my all level 5 cosmos building alt a long time ago, and do not have them trained on this character, my main. i also totally volunteer to be ccp's slave and work for free to help get any of this done.cosmos is fun, the one time missions make it a little bit more exciting for people who want a break from pvp than doing normal missions, the items really need a boost to bring them in line with the times, and the whacky pf in the arcs is good for lulz and speculation. basically cosmos has amazing potential and should be a priority as far as content. thanks for taking the time to read this."
7/16/2010,"bumpand guys, i've answered that question 7 times by now, unless you are willing to make any sort of constructive argument (which you clearly are not willing to do) stop."
7/16/2010,"this is a response to the devblog dated 16/07/2010, titled ""iterative development and what's happening in 2011"" by ccp zulu. i would like a vote on wheather ccp has now committed to overstretching itself at the cost of the eve online gaming experience. further, that there is not enough commitment, resources, time or interest being focused on that game we all knew and loved of 9-18 months ago compared to 'sidline' projects.first, i think this post may upset some people- i'm sorry about that and this post is not about what shouldn't be in eve as this is unqestionably ccp's choice as a buisness first and game developer 2nd. however, i would like to express concern, even anger at ccp's proposed timescales. now i would again admit that ccp is a buisness first and game developer 2nd and thus it has to do what is in it's interest in terms of product development timescales. but i think there has been an error in judgement. my problem is that i think ccp is taking on too much stuff, in to short a time frame in order to meet arbitrary time scales for other products. i fear this is a problem for three reasons, the first is a matter of personal opinion, but relates to the other two which relate to a wider refelection on eve as a whole and the quality of the game. 1) as a pure eve player i really don't care about character interaction or fps consol games that link to eve. i appreciate this may be important to some gamers (both current and future), but i'm really not interesed. does ccp even know what percentage of the active eve community want these features over, as an example, game stability? i know i wasn't asked- were you? i am worried that these large scale and difficult undertakings (by ccp zulu's own admission) will side track from eve, especially when taking into account the possible ramifications listed below in points 2+3. 2) i really have to question the gaming quality of eve at the moment. i am concerned with eve's ability to offer a stable gaming platform for it's current users. the game has, even by ccp's admission, become less stable over the last 9-14 months. now while i admit ccp is trying to resolve this via mass testing- a clever 'solution' (nothing has been solved yet) to a problem that should have never existed. i question how much resource is being put in to fixing it, and what the proposed timescale is- ccp are putting up a smokescreen here, apparently to shield a problem with no discernable conclusion- this worries me, as they can tell us the release dates(ish) for ambulation and the fps consol game (whatever they are both called). am i the only one sat here worried coz all i want is a stable game to enjoy. i worry that with twice yearly upgrades (none that solely focus on stability) and now not one, not two but three (if u include the latest planet mining initiative) large projects that ccp is now spreading itself far to thin to provide a quality gameing experience for the current and future gaming community. 3) linked to point 2, if ccp is further expanding, whilst not maintaing a stable and reliable platform for product 1 (eve online), what hope is there if ccp is extended over new projects and new games to provide support for a game that is already loosing stability (especially in null sec)? proposed recruitment expansion aside, if ccp can't do it now will they be able to with multiple large projects? i don't think it can. further, if these new projects draw in the new gamers to eve that ccp hopes it should, will this not make the game even more unreliable? it is not even working at current capacity. now this may be selfish, but i enjoy playing eve online coz i enjoy flying internet spaceships in fleets of like minded people, against similar opposition. now i may be wrong here, but am i alone in thinking that rather than all this other stuff, that it would be nice if eve as it is now (or was 9-18 months ago) just worked - plain and simple."
7/16/2010,"clarification: i make this point: "" am worried that these large scale and difficult undertakings (by ccp zulu's own admission) will side track from eve"".please note that i refer to the fact that ccp zulu admits these are large and complicated projects. having re read my post i see it could read that ccp zulu has admiited that these projects are a side track- this was not my intention, i only ment to show that ambulation and fps were large and complicated projects by admission of ccp zulu, but i don't have the room to edit this in the main post. additional:as of 23/07/2010 i have changed the title of this thread for clarity.sorry for any confusion."
7/16/2010,no.
7/16/2010,"i don't think that you read the proposal. the idea was that the primae model would be used for new ship types that fulfilled specialized roles that haven't already been filled. this would essentially be a reskin, allowing ccp to make the most use of the ship model."
7/16/2010,"good looking ship.bad stats.please ccp, next time you guys create a new ship model, make it at least worthy to fly. the primae in its current state is a piece of crap. i can't even sell it at a decent price it's that bad."
7/16/2010,i fully support the idea that the ships model is reused to form another ore ship.
7/16/2010,this is a pulse which when it hits the drone; it incapacitates the drone. the controller loses all control of the drone. they'll need to fly to the drone and rescoop them to get control back.
7/16/2010,this sounds remarkably like a smartbomb.this is a pulse which when it hits a drone; it vaporizes the drone. the controller loses all control of the drone. they'll need to fly to the market hub and restock them to get control back.
7/16/2010,instead of a pulse just make it so a neut that drains a drone's capacitor has a similar effect. a neut can power off a drone.
7/16/2010,opps forgot to mention that the pulse doesnt do any damage to the drones.that's not bad an idea. infact doing this and neutbombs can serve as the idea
7/16/2010,"noooooo way... i do believe that u dont give a @@@@ about ""salvager"" profession, u just want to scan down the unprobable ships like t3 now lol"
7/16/2010,so the few brave people doing for some reason missions in low sec should now also be able to get probed down quickly by core scanner probes?
7/16/2010,"not really thought out, not supported. plus, ninjas have it easy enough already."
7/16/2010,"i've thought these same things for a long time.- i'd make the first wreck in each ""room"" spawn a mag site beacon. that's the same sig as salvage profession sites.- agree that deadspace should mask the sigs, so it's harder to probe down an active mission runner or their current battlefield. but you can easily locate a discarded battlefield if no one salvaged it first.- i'd also change the mechanics, so wrecks are considered neutral. but the loot spawns in a corp affiliated jet can. that way anyone can tractor the wrecks, but only the proper owners can tractor the loot.as for the arguments of whether or not wrecks belong to the runner... a quote regarding the new abandon wrecks function. i highlight for emphasis"
7/16/2010,what would make sense is to be able scan down abbandoned cans and wreck's. as for the so called ninja salvaging... if you start a career in this business you should do you homework properly and learn all the skills. if you have done so you will be able to find stuff pretty easily. this form of carebear-salvaging is laughable.
7/16/2010,"it's the same in real life, several cars use the exact same chassis, it's realism for space chips. new ships aren't a massive priority, that said:rogue drone dominix:role bonus: +50% drone mwd speed, +25km drone rangegallente battleship: 10% drone damage/hitpoints per level, +5% velocity per level, +20% damage to japanese schoolgirls per levelthat would be nice :3"
7/16/2010,because we really need more half finished content.yeah.

7/16/2010,this already is possible. the epic missions are all remotable.they dont do that for lvl4s for obvious reasons.
7/16/2010,"this has been proposed multiple times & ccp were planning on adding it at the same time wormholes appeared. the problem is ccp wanted to add virtual arenas where nothing would actually be lost, the backend doesn't support such objects (it's also why we can't have decoy's). so having coded it all up they couldn't impliment it.now i don't know if ccp will be willing to revisit this concept and dispose of the ""nothing is lost"" part of their idea. because frankly if i step in to the ring, i'm going to fight tooth and nail to keep my ship going and win my bets :) so supported... kinda."

7/16/2010,"as has been made clear ccp aren't going to touch eve for 1.5 year, in which time they're going to deploy incarna and dust. despite loads of devs being available for a useless thing as spacebook there aren't enough to make any large changes to eve, as only useless 'features' get priority.ccp have made it clear you, the csm, are a waste of time and pointless, as none of your proposals will be taken into account anyway. thus, the only way to make it clear to ccp, and the world, this is unacceptable, i recommend the csm en mass boycott meetings with ccp. then, when they bring journalists in to promote the csm as something relevant they can film empty meeting rooms."

7/16/2010,"this is an issue that's been around for ages and is a really easy fix.the main problem with rockets is that their explosion velocity is too low.fully skilled t1/faction rockets have an explosion velocity of 127.5 this is way too low to be effective against other frigate targets, especially with the prevalence of afterburner frigates since the scram changes. your average ab frigate, when webbed, is still going 300-500 m/s. even a scram/webbed mwd frigate will not take full damage. (an armor tanked rifter, for example, will be going 177m/s)please fix the explosion velocity to make rocket based ships viable for pvp. malediction, hawk, kestrel, inquisitor, breacher and flycatcher could actually be effective pvp ships. not to mention the plethora of other frigate hulls that often use rockets as a secondary weapon system.the actual fix is quite simple, just increase explosion velocity. a 100-150% increase would be just about right."

7/16/2010,cons:it messes with the timeline. say i wanted to see what the first corp was he joined. with your example i would be inclined to think eve university were it while in truth m0o was it.what they could do instead is only show like the last 10 employments and then have you press a button to load the next(previous) ten entries. kinda like with the wallet transactions dialog.
7/16/2010,"so you want the goodies but don't want to pay them?""yes faction navy, but first nerf them"" noif this is implemented you get exactly the same deal of fw participant: enter high sec and the faction navy attack you as you have declared war against all the empires. and you will get exactly the same level of assistance of fw players: special store and special missions in hostile territory. no doubt that some will join, the question still stay ""how many?""i feel that fixing the current iteration of fw is more urgent that adding another feature to it, a feature that will probably stay half finished for years."
7/16/2010,"um what exactly are the ""goodies"" that pirate faction players would be getting in your mind? i don't know about others, but ""special stores"" and fw pve missions is not what i want out of being involved in a faction war at all. other than that what are you offering me for all the penalties you want to impose?"
7/16/2010,"certainly there's gonna be some issues to work out, but generally, i like the idea.supported."
7/16/2010,"i am not sure how difficult it is to create a ""content creation suite"" of tools that allow us to develop new and exciting content for eve. this content can be tested on sisi, and voted on by players & reviewed by ccp. the best can be implemented into the game with a patch by ccp. ccp can reserve the right to change the content as they see fit, ie tweak it, or add things, etc, change copy, ship models, textures, etc.things that can be player-created:ships (hull variants, geometry, textures, etc)stationsstar gatesposmissionsmodulesclothing & accessories (post incarna)npc ships, shuttles, busses, luxury liners, personal spaceships, etcportions of the code can be opened up, allowing devs to work on certain aspects of the game. some will break it, some will improve it, and ultimately ccp still has full control. they're just helped by the cloud. democracy in action, right?"
7/16/2010,"i'm going to design a rookie ship that can fit a doomsday device that requires no fuel and minimal skills, which i also designed. this will be an aoe doomsday, like the ones before the titan changes. it will get bonuses to damage for this device. it will have a one-second cooldown to ensure that i can fire it in high-sec outside jita 4-4 and kill everyone, then fire again and pod them before i get killed by sentry guns. implement this ship for it is awesome."
7/16/2010,you know how stupid the average person is? half of 'em are dumber than that.
7/16/2010,"that's not entirely what i meant, and while there will definitely be terrible submissions, they can be opened up to the player community via a ratings system on sisi. or - a smaller ""user content"" test area, that is separate from the full sisi test server, that basically allows limited testing of missions, flying ships, clothing, etc.ccp can review these ""ideas"", and since most of the work has already been fleshed out, pick some to implement into the game.for instance: how many artists and devs worked on the primae? the hull that is. now imagine if there was a player in iowa (usa) who was a good 3d modeler and texturer, who created a great new ship design, and the players voted it up to the top of the list. the work has already been done, all ccp needs to do is drop it into the game. if they want to release a version with unique stats, then they run through the play-testers for that to make sure it's balanced with the rest of the game."
7/16/2010,"go to spore, search for '*****'i believe that's your answer.edit: since basic anatomy is taboo here, you'll find many examples of player generated genitals there"
7/16/2010,i agree (and have mainly player created exploration sites or missions in mind).
7/16/2010,"i'd wager that the time they would have to spend vetting player submissions, and making the lawyers happy about the process, would far outstrip the amount of effort involved in just doing it themselves. game design isn't just a matter of doing the coolest everything right now, there's a ton more subtlety and long-term planning than that."
7/16/2010,"considering a lot of alliances are still waiting for ccp to vet and deliver their logo's in to the game you really think they're up to looking through thousands of player made missions, items, encounters, ships and weapons? i suppose sure. but you'll be waiting a decade for the reply that your doomsdaying velator didn't make the grade. if ccp had shown they could cope with their current delivery of player made content i'd be all for this, but until such time.... no."
7/16/2010,"yes yes yes it is sh*ty but this new system is worse then the old one.part onetakes a week to conquer a system. how many rf timers 3???defenders have to win once. so blob the system 3hours in advance call friends. call fiends call friends sbus? wtf? nuf said concord why should 0.0 alliances have to pay concord for space. all the alliances does is drop space. in the center keep a border of systems and rent everything else or put renters on the borders but everyone knows who has the space... fail ccp the sov structures have 30m sp+part twothe attacker due to having 3 rf timers to deal with can only relay attack one system at a time. this relay give the defender a huge advantage. defend once. move to the next system and keep up the chain. due to them being on there ""home turf"" they can reship then jb to the next system. the last so called great war showed this when the sc attacked (sbued) a dozen system. but failed to take any. now the nc did put up a great deference and idc bout sh*t that happened up there. just shows how the game is now much harder to take space. then it comes to the two real ways to honestly conquer space now days. the first is the alliance leaders emo rage and quit and disband the alliance. the second is the alliance leaves without a fight. the north showed if you fight all you have to do is win one fight and u stop the assault.part 3 more alliances in spacethe goal of the new system was to give small alliance the chance to take space. in my honest opinion it made it harder for them. they have to fight the sov holder when the sov holder only has to show up once in there peek time to save the system.all the new sov system has done is make it harder for anyone to enter the 0.0 landscape. now yes you just become a pet and pray that you obtain space form the holder but you are still a pet. now im not saying that the old system was better but this new system is far far worse the the original. other player feedback wanted bout my thoughts1) insurance system. i would have just dropped the payout and left it alone with the old system drop the payment by 10m on bs and then people lose money from dieing but not as much as it is now. a titan the biggest ship in eve only get 15bill when they cost 55-70bill to buy and fit. 2)invention why not just bring back t2 bpos (given idk much bout invention) just make them a reward like others but you need a decent chunk of change to buy one from a agent.3) add more moons to eve. the goal of the new moon goo system was to as i understood it reduce t2 prices. by having the large amounts of rarer moons you need less of that type of goo. but what ccp didn't do is add more moons to the game. then reduced the amount of goo that is produced. so the price sky rocked on some stuff. (hulks 100m to 200m command ships and interceptors etc)4)i would like to see more space added into the game. more high sec regions. low sec regions and 0.0 regions. the discovery of a super gate or something like that. more eve good eve.5) ccp needs to fix the lagg in 0.0 or stop advertising the fleet fights in there chimerical. yes this takes time i know but its been 6months i don't care bout new ships when the first time i fly it ill die due to lagg. then get a response ""our servers show no irregularity"" i was black screened woke up in a station 3 hours later. the only suggestion that i am making is the top 3 the rest are all feedback i want to know how the player feels about these topics."
7/16/2010,"yes, please bring back the endless pos spamming and the ensuing grinding that caused. sure, its much more time consuming than 3 rf timers, but its more fun, right?and yes, lets bring back the pos system so that alliances can spread poses around all they want to secure systems that they actually never use. sure, that'll detract from the ability of smaller alliances with some cajones to claim a backwater system that no ones uses, but who would bother trying to do that?[/sarcasm]"
7/16/2010,so bob aka band of developers lost delve. they knew itd be next to impossible to take it back. the change sov mechanics to get delve back. now you wanna go back to the oldsystem? dohoho
7/16/2010,"ccp's ship balancing is typically an all-or-nothing affair. the changes are massive, happen once in a blue moon, and totally upend the existing order of the universe. sometimes they have the complete opposite of the intended effect, or have no decent effect at all- and as soon as they are made, they are left there regardless of how big of a success or failure it is.some examples:-motherships were never intended to defang poses in a few minutes, but they do that really well nowadays-titans were intended to reduce blob sizes with their aoe doomsday, created the biggest blobs ever seen in eve and were *****ed about for over a year before anything happened-a hundred million freaking hp on sov structures wtf-how long have rockets been messed up, and does a fix involve any more than editing a few numbers in their attributes table?so my proposal is to turn ship balancing over to the players. assuming there is anyone actually working on ship balancing right now, we'd like to have devs throw up preliminary ship stats on the test server more often, and rely on player testing and feedback more. while there's definitely a place for math and calculations of ship stats to plan changes with, nothing predicts how players will use a ship better than giving players the ship to use.this is of course assuming that any potential risks for ccp will be mitigated- this assumes that players are capable of discovering, identifying, and reporting gamebreakingly overpowered ships before they go live, as well as participating in the first place. this also assumes that there will be manpower available to receive feedback from players, so for example the planetary interaction npc sell orders screwups don't happen again even though it was predicted by the players to happen."
7/16/2010,"as much as i might like this idea, i can't really support it:- game balance is, on the whole, better than i've ever seen it. some things could use with tweaking, but i don't think we actually need anything nearly as large as the projectile buff a while back.- players are as a rule pretty poor at game design and game balance. its very difficult to keep track of all of the things that something can do - and your example of a mothership defanging a pos is a great example of that. most players simply don't have the background to know that these things are even possible.- players tend to have ""favorites"" or simply be ignorant of large parts of the game. they don't have perfect sp and they don't play all the races. what you're suggesting is effectively asking warriors whether wizards should be nerfed. ;-)i think the best case scenario is to use player experts to do the grunt work for ccp. my favorite example of this (other than myself, of course ::buff nails on collar::) is to point at akita t as an untapped resource for market changes. yeah, he's a bit arrogant on occasion but he's able to deliver predictive results amazingly accurately.but even then you can't leave it purely in the hands of akita t. take technitium for example. akita might have suggested making more 10% more tech moons and 30% less titanium moons, but that wouldn't have solved a weird problem like the geographical distribution favoring the nc and reinforcing their control over most of 0.0.anyway. subject matter experts are probably better than ""crowdsourcing"" - especially if you nda them pay them a contractor's fee.-liang"
7/16/2010,agreed. why not simply make the sig of modules small enough not to be hit my the compact citadels?so we need something new which reduces blobs? what might you suggest?it hinders the small guys. they made it so big such that you need a capfleet to take em on; this stops stupid roaming gangs from taking on them. however they also hinder the small alliance from taking space.
7/16/2010,"i think you've gotten it backwards. its often the devs that can't forsee the unusual uses for items and it's always the players themselves who are the ones who discover the flaw and exploit it. of course, any exploits the devs do notice do not even get far enough to be discovered by the players.overall i agree that game balancing is quite satisfactory. but when things are clearly and demonstrably wrong, it takes a very long time to get anything done about it, and when they start working on a fix, it seems to take them a really long time when they could instead throw up some numbers and ask the players to give their opinion about the new x.this is mostly an attempt to address the perception of low productivity in the specific areas that players care about a lot."
7/16/2010,"no, certain players are good at game balance. when was the last time you perused ships & modules and a game balance thread? do you not even remember the bitter disputes between the amarr and minmatar - where one race was so pathetically laughable that nobody flew anything other than rifters, hurricanes, and vagabonds?i know what it is - but i don't think that we can directly use player input as a balancing tool. that's why i suggested smes contracting to ccp under nda. it simply makes better sense.-liang"
7/16/2010,what are sme's?
7/16/2010,"subject matter experts. for instance, akita t would be a subject matter expert for the market (imo) and sok might be one with supercaps. i'm not sure who would be the best choices for general ships/modules - its such a divisive topic that even if you're right you'll **** someone off.-liang"
7/16/2010,"then you only keep fotm laming forever, because majority flies fotm and dont want to lose their solopwnmobiles."
7/16/2010,"sup, that's exactly what the csm is. ccp already blatantly ignores them year after year. stop kidding yourself.edit: supported."
7/16/2010,"i must have missed the part where there was a csm that had time to give a detailed presentation on what rocket explosion velocity/radius should be, and how utterly ****ing useless the t1 amarr cruiser lineup is.-lianged: and in case the implication doesn't hit you: the csm delegates are politicians hoping to provide player feedback and hopefully push the general development of eve in a better direction. they hardly have time for such small issues as the nighthawk needing some extra grid.i'm also very curious which csm delegate you think rivals akita t's knowledge of the eve economy?"
7/16/2010,"the csm are figureheads for blame, little else. ccp isn't interested much in what players think is wrong with the game. they are interested when they agree, but not when they do not. the devs are pretty hostile towards people who dont agree in person if you have never encountered one. if you think they are going to listen to an ""expert"" you're a special breed of stupid."
7/16/2010,result of plex for haiti is that ccp ceo have now brand new shiny jaguar. just kidding :d
7/16/2010,by all means.i mean i should be able to remap my attributes every time i start training a skill.i also shouldn't be restricted to having to keep minimal attribute levels and be able to pump all my points in the primary and secondary traits.after all we all benefit by making my ....i mean our skill training faster. and all you nay-sayers are just trying to protect those skills i haven't trained up yet!
7/16/2010,"nice, first troll enters thread!"
7/16/2010,"i have a beef with current disconnect mechanics.however due to circumstances beyond my control i am wireless that is not 100% reliable. eve is playable, but i do have some disconnects. this in and of itself is not a problem. what is a problem is the 3.5 million isk worth of drones i leave in space every time this happens. rats of course target the drones as soon as leave space, and even though i reconnect right away, i will usually lose 1 to 2 drones. a single dc a mission pretty much nerfs my pay.i don't have specific fix in mind for this. but i do have a suggestion, namely when you dc, your drones dc with you, provided you don't have player agro (in which case you lose your stuff).i'm a gallente pilot, mostly focused on drones. and many people are trained that way. its silly for us to suffer a disconnect penalty. now people might say ""lame drone domi pilots need a nerf! good lol!!!!!"", but its still a bad mechanic. if you want to nerf drones in missions, losing them on disconnects is a dumb way to do it. might be able to help server load to. pretty much end of every fleet flight there are like hundreds of drones in space. i could imagine that after a pilot leaves the field, (ie ship destroyed) it would be easy enough to remove his drones using the same code. this would cut down the lag and the crap that really doesn't ad much to the game. at least let us maintain drone control on dc. i dc and my drones are 50km away, i basically have to slow boat over to them and get them. i come back within seconds of dc but to bad, you dc, you lose x million. haha you lose.basically its a dumb way of doing things. i think you should punish people for failing tactically, not for technical difficulties, at least as much as that which can be rationally and reasonably avoided."
7/16/2010,i'm pretty sure this is already planned for future development.
7/16/2010,"because ccp's server code is ancient and doesn't know how to dynamically allocate resources. i'll support this, but then i also support a more general ""refresh the server code"" type proposals as well."
7/16/2010,"this is working as intended. it is called risk vs reward, which is why the few people with balls to actually run them, can also make more isk then most people do out in 0.0."
7/16/2010,"i wish we could get one of those drama movie prologue closings. you know? eva, 21 days later. this just to get an idea of what happened to her in later life so that we can all finish the popcorn and move on to the next movie soap story."
7/16/2010,please don't be a emo fanboi because you like eva.
7/16/2010,"now that ccp stated most of the resources are already committed for the next 18 months, what will the next csm meetings be about?it appears there is little sense in pitching more proposals since the reaction has to be ""after incarna/dust""."
7/16/2010,"this seems to be the six dollar question. is csm going to give input on incarna and dust? if not then it seems their input is not relevant. if csm members are going to give input on incarna and dust, then they should make it clear it's just their own personal opinions and not claim its the views of the players as a whole. no players really know enough about these other games to discuss them or formulate opinions of how they should be developed."
7/16/2010,"this to be fair has to be resolved ccp must invest in polishing game content for a time, personally i'm hopefull they will eventually get the message but we're already startinjg to loose long term players like flies we all know of them we've all played with them hell it might be an idea to start a forum and list all the people you know who have left the game due to frustration with this issue.however i'd like to explain how the top level managers don't have a clue whats happening through my own experiences of corporate business, it goes something like this:staff/low end managers: ""god damnit somethings terribly wrong here!""middle management at the board meetings: ""as you can see we're doing exceptionally well in these areas here are some (cherry picked) statistics showing our great success"".execs: ""excellent work you've justified my position to the shareholders"".shareholders ""are we still making money? good"".rinse repeat until company starts loosing money and low level workers get made redundant followed by asset stripping and eventual sale of the entity. descisions made of win"
7/16/2010,this is probably true -- or would be if ccp wasn't a privately owned company owned by the execs.
7/16/2010,"board members are always incentivised by share options its a way to actually try and force them to do well (by linking their own personal economic gain through company growth, this also explains a lot behind why ceo's want immediate growth as they're generally only with a company for a limited period before they cash in), either way however someone is making the cash and basing their descisions on what middle management (or whoever is pulling the figures out of their hat at the time) are reporting. problem is the middle management barrier which is generally based upon the fact that no one wants to say ""we need to improve in areas x & z"" because that means either a solid questioning on why there is a problem in the firstplace or an increased workload whilst the changes are being made and hell who wants that eh?anyhoo this is just a theory on my behalf so please don't take it seriously i could well be and probably am wrong most of the time"
7/16/2010,"dillon's list is excellent. and em'phasis' observation above cannot be overstated enough. csm takes an inordinate amount of time if you take the job the least bit seriously. i would conservatively guess 12 hours a week; more if you're chair, and even more if there's drama. it is one of the most intense--and sometimes thankless-seeming--volunteer jobs i've ever done. and oh yeah--be sure you have a thick skin. the hate mail can be epic, though!"
7/16/2010,hate mail? you like drama alot right? i dont like you but hate over a video game? only ones i see hating people are usually people like sok and maz just reading their posts confrms most of that.well i could be wrong about them might just be thei ability to think like a adult. as for a csm how about one that actually acts like an adult? i get all the kids and the wifes toon to vote for one like that as well as the guys deployed with me that play. so far not all but most of the ones i see posting act like they are still in high school.
7/16/2010,"no, i don't like drama...but yes, some people apparently feel it is important to express how much they can't stand me in personal email. whatever floats your boat, i guess. you can't please everyone. all you can do is be who you are, do what you said you'd do, and be consistent about it. if people don't like you for doing those things, oh well. as for a csm that actually acts like an adult...it's an organization made up of 14 individuals (9 delegates, 5 alts), each of whom has their own idea of what constitutes proper behavior in these forums and elsewhere. there are no organizational rules governing csm behavior (besides eula/tos), so it's left up to each delegate to make a choice about how they conduct themselves. when someone steps over the line, the rest of us may talk with them behind the scenes to encourage different behavior, but at the end of the day its like herding cats to get everyone to conform to a given standard of behavior."
7/16/2010,for once you actually posted something i can agree with you on mynxee. as for mail thats funny is the way i meant it. as i am still waiting on some goons/bobs/ noir/ atlas and several groups that have disbanded to fly over to afie and teach me a lesson or actually goons where supposed to fly over to iraq in 2005 but never made it hahahah. just means we been playing eve to long.
7/16/2010,issues:devs should play the game. this would probably just turn into a discussion more than anything else but ill throw it in here to see how it goes in the meetingcrowdsourcing ship balancingedit-clarify the actual changes when updating the eulaapi security and development priority changest'amber made me do it.
7/16/2010,see also this extremely related thread.
7/16/2010,"it doesn't matter whether its a new issue or an old issue or a high priority or low priotity. *they aren't working on eve* other than lag, pi, and maybe some vague ""combat expansion"" that won't effect mechanics just information, for about 2 years. so post your pi proposals and ""combat information"" proposals (whatever you think that might mean) but otherwise enjoy your time in iceland. it's hard to see why csm shouldn't just adjourn for 18 months and reconvene when ccp might want to get back to working on eve."
7/16/2010,"it's one thing to say they are not going to focus on fixing old features before they bring out new ones, but here they are saying they aren't even planning *anything* new or old for eve. they are simply working on different games.in apocrypha they gave us a new feature - wormholes. some people may be uspset and think they should have fixed older features instead. but at least it was an expansion in eve. now they are effectively saying they won't do anything for eve - not adding new features not fixing old. just working on dust and incarna."
7/16/2010,"the op's claims could be considered slanderous to ccp. ccp has not abandoned eve. dust and incarna are enhancements to the overall eve universe and experience.the csm minutes has stated clearly that ccp will devote more resources to fixing issues with existing features after both expansions. i think that will be the appropriate (though overdue) time to carry this out, after major expansions that will bring the game to the next level."
7/16/2010,bull****.yes in 2-3 years time.
7/16/2010,also ccp minerals nerf or maybe ... screwup? basically have nerfed the drone region terribly. after 6+ years in this game i am wondering wtf are they thinking. i am losing my attention span for this game. soon it will be time to start turning accounts off just because i am not doing as much anymore in it. owell its been a nice run. been messing around on the perpetuum beta. a big change that is for sure. bored... spin ships faster..o/
7/16/2010,"yeah, and, *we* are all going to ""abandon"" eve if ccp doesn't s(traighten)tfu (and it won't take two years)how can they use our money to make some other game that i'll never play, and then tell us that they don't have resources to work on our game for 18-24+ months?sound familiar much?"
7/16/2010,lol i'm not going to rage quit over this. eve is still a great game. but i am trying to communicate my own player opinion that (from the tiny bit i know about them) i see dust and incarna as basically separate games. dust is obviously different. incarna although i suppose i will be able to walk in stations with my eve account is of very little interest to me. i always thought ok this will be some minor throw in that they are working on. i knew my current interest in eve (fw) was put on the back burner. but i had no idea that they basically halted work on everything - missions - fw - null sec - high sec - low sec - wormholes - balancing - you name it - in order to focus in on incarna and dust. i mean they do throw us some sort of bone with the combat expansion. i quoted that in my op. but we (or at least i) have no idea what that means. can we get some idea here what that is? because that and lag seems to be the only thing eve related that they have going on.
7/16/2010,it ceased being your money when you gave it to them.c.
7/16/2010,"so your message here is... cancel our accounts, right? if not, you musta meant to say something else*edit* and by the way - i find this funny, though you may not understand - there are still *some* people to this day who pay soe to play swg"
7/16/2010,"some people would play anything wrapped up in the sw world, simply because it is sw. that, and from what i hear from the single old friend that still plays, the game has had *some* good elements put back.myself, i couldn't have cared less about the sw skin. i'd have played the pre-cu game if it was dressed up as smurfs online. because at its core it was a good game that like this one, needed some balance & polish. if they'd have simply made doc buffs percentage based like entertainer buffs and reigned in the most op weapons... i'm falling off topic; easy to do with something when you're passionate about it.i guess my point is that eve was a great game with huge potential as it was in 2006. many of the features added to the core game have had huge potential for adding great new toys for us to play with in our sandbox; but ccp hasn't followed through with their features. imo, if they feel that a release date has to be a drop dead date to release core functions to a new feature, so be it; but stay on that feature until its implementation in the live game makes the dev team happy. once they get to that point, see how that new feature is affecting the rest of the game, then decide on actions to take in a balance/polish pass. only then should they look around at the core game as a whole and decide if something is missing.notice, i said ""if something is missing"". not, ""what can we add now."" if a game is complete, polished & balanced, it doesn't need to have major new features every 6-12 months to be popular. look at diablo ii & starcraft. dii hasn't had a major feature added since lod in 2001. sc hasn't had a major feature added since bw in 1998. they're both still available at major retailers as a boxed set. why? because for each of them the core game is complete, polished & balanced.eve is a great game with loads of potential, but the game isn't polished or balanced. if ccp would give us polish & balance, it would be readily apparent if players felt it wasn't complete, and what was missing. unfortunately, they've always been too focused on the next big feature to look at where their game is. now they're focusing on features that distract from the core game, and leaving them unfinished.dominion traded one sov snafu for another. eve did not need pi. the bpo's for npc goods could have used existing resources and facilities. wis is not needed to improve the core game, it's needed to distract from it. dust isn't even the same game.i have no issue with ccp developing other titles, but the eve dev team needs to be focused on the core elements of eve; flying & destroying internet spaceships with other people for fun. every aspect of eve, and every change to eve should give a reason to pew pew, be a way to pew pew, make pew pew more fun, or be a way to get more stuff to pew pew with and pew pew on. anything else is a distraction from what eve is."
7/16/2010,"""probably"" don't sound lilke ""we will do it"" but like a ""maybe"". it is as much probable that ccp would spend the resources they have fixing incarna and dust (and at the time they will be ""existing"" features, so that phrase will even be true) instead of fixing older content."
7/16/2010,"finally i am catching up on posts. take a look at my new post writing low sec stories: challenges, process, tools over in the features & ideas forum. i think that's the best place to begin in terms of taking action based on the low sec discussion at the summit. (i hope this isn't considered cross-posting)"
7/16/2010,"some previous posts have described a concept without actually mentioning its name: complexity classes. without going into too much detail, when looking at algorithms or computing scenarios at an abstract level, you can determine a complexity class, which expresses how the computational complexity scales when your input increases. an example:a) a pure download site. the complexity increases linearly with user count (n). since each download is independent from other downloads, you can just add more servers and split the load between them.b) fleet fights in eve. the complexity increases exponentially (n^2), as all pilots interact with each other (even when not shooting each other, positional updates etc. must be distributed to all of them). so not even that many pilots generate a disproportionate amount of load. also, since they are all part of a single simulation, it becomes very hard distributing the load.if interested, i've written some about scaling in eve a while ago, where i also predicted handover of player sessions between nodes not only that: there is no connection between the physical location of the players and in which virtual system they fight. that would only make sense if eve was regionally sharded. and even then, it only helps reduce network lag, not server load.the physics engine is assumed to be deterministic (same input = same output). also, it is not fault tolerant, so real desyncs are unrecoverable (you need to relog). the prioritizing of certain request/data just minimizes the effect of the delay until the client simulation is updated with the authoritative server info, i.e. reduces rubber-banding and the like.that's expected. multiple systems are simulated on each blade (except high load systems like jita or when a system gets reinforced by request). the number of systems on a blade is chose according to their average load. most 0.0 systems are empty most of the time -> many 0.0 systems on one blade. then suddenly a 250+ fleet jumps into one of those systems, bringing the performance of all systems hosted on that blade down."
7/16/2010,"how do you think they are working to fix this issue? is it possible to set up a separate blade server that is dedicated to managing groups around new eden? it can then create dedicated nodes based on groups, and figure out where load will be.i'm only a senior flash dev - so most of the hardcore dev is a little beyond me, but i understand the concepts around the limitations. do you know what ccp is doing to eliminate this problem? as eve grows, it will only get worse....why don't they just create a network of 3000 blade servers? i know that seems nuts, but they aren't that expensive. it would solve the problem right? as technology gets faster, they can be upgraded. a deal can be worked out with ibm to rent each blade, as opposed to purchase - so upgrades to equipment can be quickly made without the financial burden and logistics of reselling the old blade.just a thought... i sometimes look at this issue like the oil spill in the gulf. lots of smart minds are being put on it, but it just doesn't get fixed."
7/16/2010,"so i thought i'd offer some technical insight. i basically make massively scalable server solutions for a living. just adding servers doesn't always make things better. the problem is that there is context information that has to be shared real time that can't be easly shared across blades as suggested. the example of the microsoft game is definitely an ""apples and oranges"" comparison. the data latency that can be tolerated in a ""game show"" game is much greater than a real time 3d space game like eve. just think about what you have to share with every other pilot in your system on a real time basis.1. your ship type that includes its stats as modified by all your skills, implants, mods, fittings and fleet bomus. this includes active changes from items you might have activated. this is all caculated real time to take into account energy consumption, damage, area or targeted effects from other players. this all likely gets calculated server side (to reduce the possibility or hacks that allow you to ""uber"" your ship client side). all this has to be shared to everyone in the system, or at least in your vicinity. if its ""vicinity"" that means what is in your ""vicinity"" has to be calculated real time as well.2. you position, path and velocity.3. weapons actions, this includes missle paths, turret activities which involve complicated calculations, and remember ship have many guns and missles. lots to keep track of! and again, it has to be shared to everyone real time. all this calculations again are dynamic in that they have many elements that can change aspects of the calculations.4. static information that can be shared between pilots like your corp, alliance, your bio, your employment history, your picture.5. elements in the system, this currently includes every ""roid"" and rat. again all these elements are dynamic and can change real time. every npc has the same degree of information you have for a ship.6. drones. all are pathed and have all the same types of data you have to share for a ship.7. random other stuff like calculations of area of effect, scanning and overview data. some of the scanning and overiew could be filtered client side, although this can lead to exploits like the one recently found that allowed instant location of other players using packet sniffing.8. all the input from the clients of the pilots in the system has to be fed into this as well.9. add the overhead of chat, voice, mail, player structures....so start addding this all up for 1000 ships at once and you see you have a huge challenge. ccp has thrown some serious hardware at this problem, they have a huge ram san for example. overall though the challenge is at present sharing this much dynamic data (and updating with at times some complicated ai or calculations) real time is hard with most common server architectures. this is mostly because most applications for massive server deployments don't have the same degree of real time requirements a game like eve does. other game companies just solve the problem by capping a server population at a level that is below the threshold of poor player experience and use game mechanics that eliminate the ""massive sized combat encounters"" eve promises.i have to say this is a very cool problem to get to try and solve. i'd love to be part of the team working on making this better. my customers are happy with a couple of seconds latency so my work challenges are a lot less cutting edge.issler"
7/16/2010,ccp and the csm remind me of an old saying. you can tell when politicians are not telling the truth their lips are moving. or in this case when they are on the forums typing.
7/16/2010,i am currently not telling the truth.
7/16/2010,"players don't care about giving ccp feedback unless ccp acts on it.do you understand what this means?the players have an interest in improving their state of living within the game. for the most part, the players don't give the sweat off of a rat's balls about the individual comfort of the developers and management. some of us do, most of us don't.as far as the players are concerned, if they give ccp feedback and ccp does not visibly adapt accordingly, giving the feedback was a waste of the player's time. if you then tell the players that you are in fact listening, that only serves to further irritate them, because as far as the playerbase is concerned, actions speak louder than words. telling the players that they're being listened to and then acting counter to that is insult to injury. to word it more colourfully, players don't like being p!ssed on and then get told that it's raining.this may not be directly your problem or responsibility. but it is somebody's problem and responsibility.creating the csm created an expectation: that ccp would adapt (to a reasonable extent) to fit the desires of the players.this is the expectation that's been broken here. nothing else."

7/16/2010,"na, we'll get a full line of t3 ships instead."
7/17/2010,"the main problem that i see with them, is that they generally have less damage/tank than their t1 counterparts. while the ability to bridge and move fast'ish under cloak has some value, it still is not enough to make people want to follow the bombers/recons through the looking glass.they need to be worth risking in combat so that they jump with the herd.- give them marauder gun bonus while keeping high-slot # (lots more utility highs for supporting friendlies).- increase base attributes (hull/armour/shields) to t1 level. not as if they have full t2 resist bonuses so will only barely top t1.- increase damage, the more damage the less need for tank so above can be reduced.an/or,- make them gang friendly with partial bonuses borrowed from the various titans or ability to use gang-links.they make great bridge ships, now lets make them great at killing/dying as well!"
7/17/2010,"is suicide ganking really such an amazing game mechanic? i wish there was a better way to add risk to mining without such a lame sequence of events.i think if a system worked similar to how rats work it might be more interesting. rats get tougher as the security status gets lower. if you could allow players to sign on as mercs with the local npc pirate factions and have limits on hull type depending on sec status it would be more fun. you wouldn't be in a hulk facing ganking battleships in a .5 but, you might have to be careful of groups of roaming player mercenary pirate frigs ;). in a .7 maybe the hulls could be limited to tier 1 - 3 frigs or something similar. perhaps limit fleet size as well *shrug*. the pirates of course are freely allowed to attack in belts (anywhere really, but station guns and gate guns would be hostile to them). it will add to the feeling that space gets more and more lawless the farther out you go. regular sec status rules could still apply with the addition maybe of after signing on as a merc, you would be on a timer limiting your access to .8 - 1.0. of course people who are the good guys in high sec have the advantage in being able to field any ship they like. which makes sense since this is their ""turf"" and it's high sec making it difficult for pirates to have access to big ships that draw concords attention ;). short version is introduce a system to make the regular players rats for short periods of time until the heat dies down. remove the insurance payout for suicide ganks and now you have a system that challenges both groups with risks and rewards and it's much more in the spirit of lawless space. insurance for going kamikaze is just lame and boring. if you don't like how i'm going about it then suggest something to make it better. i don't know why anyone would prefer suicide ganks over real skirmishes."
7/17/2010,"1. i was never aiming to change your opinion because once again, u r incapable of adapting. that's why u cry for this change so badly and that's why u will keep your opinion because u r incapable of even the simplest tasks just to survive in eve. if u can't even handle high sec rats, how can u even react against another player?2. suppose that this change actually goes through--we'll just adapt, like we always have. and while we'll still continue playing, u carebears, in your complete ignorance and stupidity, will wonder why eve hasn't adapted to u. it's because u will never adapt to eve and that will never change. 3. once again, exhumer gankers don't profit from ganking exhumers, not that u're capable of understanding in your own little carebear bubble u want to stay in. and i'm well off in isk, tyvm. of course, u'd probably never seen much isk because u're too stupid to keep u and your ships alive. long story short, another fail proposal to turn high sec into low sec. at that point, ganking wouldn't even be suicide anymore and all of eve will be deserted, just like low sec, ******. in other words, u can't understand the concept of a sandbox."
7/17/2010,"this strikes me as a common sense suggestion that should certainly have been added a long time ago.in no situation should insurance be paid out to anyone killed by concord.it would probably also be more 'realistic' to make the insurance premiums based on security status.high sec status = lower premiums, low sec status = higher premiums.it's all common sense and none of it is game-ruining."
7/17/2010,"eve tries so hard to resemble real life (somebody described it very accurately as a ""second job you have to pay for""), why not in this point?somebody said the ""insurance"" in eve is not meant to actually be an ""insurance"":stop calling it that.if it's supposed to be an ""insurance"": stop paying money to criminals.regards, lax"
7/17/2010,agree. no insurance payout to suicide gankers (those who were killed by (conrord). why should they be awarded if they do such things?
7/17/2010,"nice counter argument. it's fail because you say so and all of eve will be deserted because you say so. look, the guys out there who still want insurance for suicide ganking make a good point. mining in high sec isn't risky enough. npc rats are a joke and without suicide ganking .5 - 1.0 doesn't mean anything special except different amounts of ore at belts. you want the sandbox but you don't want there to be risk. in your words you think it will become low sec. with no cruisers, t2 ships, battleships, cap ships and gate camps i fail to see how it's the same as low sec. players would still be safe at gates and stations. you can even up the power/quantity of gate/station guns/patrols to really discourage anyone from trying to make those areas more dangerous than they should. which means travel between high sec becomes a little safer (since i favour removing insurance for suicide ganking).my idea turns .5 - .7 mining into areas where carebears can start to get combat in with a known enemy (frigates). it allows more turn over of ships which in turn makes mining more profitable in the long run. more ideas could be ""pirate threat level alerts"" or something of that sort in .5 - .7. perhaps a warning via local by concord or maybe a new interface screen could show pirate activity in the area between low - high. or at least a system that gives the carebears a little more of an edge in knowing when they should risk it and when they should run back to .8+ or just another system. so suicide ganking = sandbox but the ability to join pirate groups and use small ships in .5 - .7 for pvp is anathema to that??why don't you suggest something that removes the suicide gank (not much risk for the ganker with insurance) and still leaves risk in high sec for miners to worry about (aside from can flippers which are so easily ignored). better yet support something that involves getting people more involved with pvp and gives high sec ""good guys"" an edge over the ""bad guys"" which keeps the game in context with the whole null sec - low sec - high sec idea. just so you know i'm not an avid pvp player. i've been a carebear most my time in eve and can sometimes win in 1v1. i mine all the time. so these changes would make things more dangerous for me. i've never been a pirate and doubt i ever will be. still i'd like to see the pirates have more engaging gameplay and not have to resort to bending the rules all the time to have fun."

7/17/2010,"iceberg you say? new features attract new players and preserve eve's longevity? not necessary. holding back some features in order to preserve longevity are a pretty wise business plan. look at blizzard, they are an excellent example. blizzard wait until everyone is clamouring for more content, then they give it before too many people get fed up. blizzard generally want their products to be popular for a long period of time, not like ccp where new features is only popular immediately after they release a new expansion. ccp use new expansions/features as carot, blizzard use excellence as carot. eve is already a very complex game even for veterans that have played for years. adding another level of complexity to eve with pi and incarna are not a wise buisness plan because it's premature. as example, fw and lowsec was supposed to be a stepping stone to pvp and 0.0 sec that have the potential to vastly increase the player experience for pvp wannabes and lowsec/0.0 sec. residents. it's shocking and dis-encouraging that ccp dont see just a 'slight' problem in prioritizing new feautures over polishing fw/low sec and others half baked features.. delusional you say?yes please get a grip on reality! excellence dictate that quality outweighs quantity. blizzard understand this concept. sorry to say, but in this ballgame ccp are just wannabes who pretend to be something they are not. i love the sci fi concept in eve, but damn ccp suck at prioritizing. it's the loyal eve players that can take alot of credit for preserving eve's longevity. in 2003 when eve went live, many people in the gaming industry thought eve would never succeed. they were wrong, not because of 'eve excellence' but because a loyal core of eve players kept the community alive, ccp tend to forget that. look at eve-uni and many other old corps and veterans that help new players get trained and interated with the eve community. look at the tons of third party programs and resources created to support eve. waiting another 18 months+ to polish old eve features is non-acceptable and show lack of goodwill against the loyal player base that have invested alot of time into eve. on a personal level, im willing to use my financial might with 100b+ isk that can support csm in their campaign against new features and to fix old. in short, im fed up. i love eve but see big icebergs ahead and something must be done by csm and the player base to hopefully change this horrible prioritizing of dev teams that vastly favor new features the next 18+ months.eve is a sandbox game? well then give us some 'excellence tools' and stop producing some half baked chinese crap"

7/17/2010,"ccp - it is clear from the csm minutes that not only will you not devote developer time to fixing fw issues, but there is not a clear team or individual stakeholder for fw issues.another thing that is clear from this thread ( and many others ) is that there needs to be more concensus around _what_ and _how_ to fix before it can be fixed. assigning development talent to work on the issues doesn't have to happen right now, but we _need_ ccp folks to be looking at the issue, making plans, designing fixes _now_! assign devs once they have the time, but to let these issues go unaddressed because you are busy developing products for new revenue is a slap in the face to your existing clients (read your operating income). edit: edited to support the op."

7/17/2010,"i decided fairly recently that i'm finished with faction war until it is fixed...or at least improved. after a year of trying to make the best of tired, ineffective game mechanics, i had to move on to find motivation to keep my account active. so in my opinion, yes--fw needs some fixin' in a very bad way.i would like to point out something about fw that ought make it worth fixing to ccp: the fact that a great many fw players support their play by buying plexes. fw is an isk-sink like no other. people do it because they like to fight, not grind wealth...so lots of militia folk are frequently shelling out the extra thirty bucks to replace their losses. that is something that big alliance pilots and highsec corps don't have to do.i know that since i've left the militia, the likelihood that i'll be paying dollars for any more plexes has become pretty much nonexistant. i simply don't have to pump that much money in to the game anymore.my point is this: i would be incredibly surprised if the profit ccp is making off of pilots per capita involved in fw isn't significantly greater than that which they are making off of those who are not. (yay woot convoluted sentence)more simply, my point is this:crappy fw = less plexes bought with rl cash."
7/17/2010,"i don't know. i'm fairly new and i really want to give fw a try in the near future. the problems i hear people talking about are the metagame being a bit borked and the fw community dieing off. coming from war, i know that capturing objectives can foster cooperation. however, the places to be for the best pvp in eve don't seem to be in fw.if it was better, ccp could retain a lot more players that give the game a try."

7/17/2010,"yes, please remove learning skills!i would be happy with the proposed solution."
7/17/2010,"yes, i am still monitoring the thread. i am also gathering some data related to this proposal.i am of the opinion that this issue is a very important one, and i want to make sure the proposal is as tight and useful as possible. furthermore, after i actually formally raise it on the wiki, i want everyone to have a chance to comment on it.for these reasons, it may not make it onto the docket for the next csm meeting on the 25th.ps: one thing that people who support the proposal could do to help is re-run the npe and make a list of the tweaks that would be needed if either the op's proposal or this counter-proposal was implemented. i plan to do this same this weekend if time permits."
7/17/2010,"what about this one trebor?it seems to me that if the motivation for this change is truly to ""save the noobs"" this proposal 100% addresses the concern of new pilots being put off by the learning skills - because those skills won't be available when someone first starts the game. a person would have time to get addicted to eve before having the option to train them. this is the simplest, least invasive, and most effective fix to the stated problem of new pilots being discouraged by learning skills. this requires no skill re-distribution, no attribute changes, none of the rest of the changes. i would expect this idea to be dismissed by those who simply hate the learning skills and who are using ""protecting the noobs"" as an excuse to advocate having them removed so they can make alts faster. however, this approach satisfies those of us who do believe that the learning skills add something to the game that would be a shame to lose, and it should satisfy those who are concerned about the effect of learning skills on new players."
7/17/2010,"terrible counter proposal, if ccp implemented something like this it would actually **** me off way more than leaving existing learning skills as they are. this proposal of yours isn't about helping newbies at all, it's about keeping the status-quo and making it actually worse for newbies. it also completely ignores that a good many of us believe learning skills are bad game play/design irrespective of its negative impact of new player experience."
7/17/2010,"the immediate problem i see is that it slows down initial noob skill acquisition, which is exactly what you don't want to do, given that noobs are more focused on instant gratification. the more achievements they get, the more they get sucked into the game.ideally, every time a noob logs off, there should be some some training goal that will be achieved by their next session (ie: the next day, so typically within the length of the skill training queue) that will let them try something new -- like a new ship, or a new aspect of eve.of course, the ideal is impossible to achieve, but the closer you can get to it, and the less barriers you put in the way, the better."

7/17/2010,"i fully support this idea! - all of my accounts do (to save spamming this post)mainly for two reasons, lotteries spam the sell orders because they are long term compared to selling other items so they stick around longer and fill up the forums everytime someone buys a ticket or just get lost - then people respam it. having a realistically lower volume forum for them and some posting rules to go with it, will clear up the sell orders more and allow people to find the lottories they want to play. let's face it - people like to gamble in ev e - and no one wants to read all the lottery ads when looking for stuff to buy. when i want to (be taxed - as patri puts it lol) then i can goto the seperate forum to do so (if their was one).goto www.shipsofeve.com - that's one of the best =p"
7/17/2010,thumbs up :)btw: t'amber told me to do it :d
7/17/2010,"easy to implement, has utility, seperates lotteries from sell orders. eve casino - wagers and lotteries. this forum is for in-game transactions only.perhaps a sub forum for wh sales as wellwormhole navigation - investigate, navigate, reveal the unknown. exchange your findings here.t'amber made me do it.@anubis i'm on a horse"

7/17/2010,i would like to propose that the double click to move function become disableable.i suggested just a simple tick box in the general settings.this would be useful for miners mostly for when you are can mining you can occasionally unintentionally double click and not notice untill you are 10 to 20k from your cans.
7/17/2010,"sure, altho this belongs in the bag of control improvements like more customization and remapping of fixed keys."
7/17/2010,similarly if you ctrl-click on overview to lock a bunch ships. if you doubleclick one.. you start flying toward it. not good.

7/17/2010,i think being able to unanchor after a month of off line time is reasonable. i cant tell you the number of times we find cold poses in w-space. things that just sit there for ever because noone wants to invest the 12 hours it would take to kill them for no gain other than a kill mail.
7/17/2010,anybody?
7/17/2010,"bumpand maxim, we've explained several times now why your proposal is rubbish, so until you are willing to accept that (which you clearly are not willing to do) be sure not to stop."
7/17/2010,"and i explained why you were wrong. also, you didn't comment on the counter-proposal to increase lrar pg requirements by 400%."
7/17/2010,"so we now have here one side who is against it because it wont solve anything. since it wont do any harm either i then dont see why they are so against it, but anyway. the other group is against it because it will make shield rr bs gangs op. maybe those groups should first try to find out why exactly it would be such a bad idea to give shield transporters normal fitting requirements.why not do it? even if it wouldnt be used in pvp it would then at least be viable for the harder pve content. you (sok) say that it shoudlnt be done because then they would still lack mids. well i can assure you now that they wont get more mids, and shouldnt get more mids. so why not make it at least a bit more viable by normal fitting requirements."
7/17/2010,"great, you totally went past the point there. if the message was unclear so far, let me repeat it for you: 'i do not believe that the requirements for shield transporters are a limiting factor on the proliferation of rr shield bs gangs. i also do not believe that the actual limiting factor, namely the lack of midslots, should be solved in the easiest possible way because that would lead to a number of other possible problems. hence we are forced to conclude that rr shield bs gangs cannot work as well as rr armour bs gangs under current game mechanics' (assuming rr gangs without a major logistical backbone)however, i would be interested to see a fleet consisting of high-damage ravens and rokhs, supported by appropriate recon ships, scorpions and a load of basilisks. the destructive potential of that particular combination would be quite astonishing."
7/17/2010,70 developers on walking in stations bull**** that has no real impact on the game and 22 on the game itself. something is ****ing wrong here.
7/17/2010,"tl;drbut to answer the question in the title, it would appear so. that being said, eve is still awesome. that being said, please do what you said you would ccp, make everything work and finish unfinished projects. ie 'commit to excellence'."
7/17/2010,"ok, your points are valid. ccp is in fact a company first; a company that apparently wants to grow and become a european version of blizzard and have multiple blockbuster titles with a huge fan base.*stay with me here*do wow fans complain the blizzard has a department developing diablo iii? or do warcraft 3 fans complain that starcraft 2 took all the good rts game developers with them to that project? no, no they dont, for several reasons, the main being that wow fans have no clue who the developers are; blizzard doesnt post dev blogs, and they certainly dont have a csm that flies to blizzard hq to give feedback from the player base.the bottom line is that a company like ccp can successfully walk and chew gum at the same time. multiple projects doesnt mean that developer a works on dust from 0800-1200 and then incarna from 1300-1700. it means they hire more people to scale to multiple projects (the new uk office for example, along with those in china and atlanta). in businessnot on a soap box hereyou either grow or die. stagnation will kill a business slowly from the inside. look at the matrix online or other mmos that were here and now gone. ccp isnt abandoning eve. they are trying to add value and dynamic to it by developing dust for consoles and having mercs blow your eve **** up on planets--for lack of a better term.as long as we have the csm and ccp continues to support us through them we are in good shape. bravo to dierdra vaal for holding ccp accountable; but the long term plans have already been set here people. the budgets have been drafted, the money is allocated, to reverse or change course now will be too costly for ccp. i do believe however, that they will eventually get to our concerns for low sec, fleet lagwhich is being workedui overhaul, pi overhaul, etc. these things take time. to reach their longer term goal of a new game, reaching additional demographics of gamers, and growing eve online itself this is the path they have chosen. is it aggressive? yes. will it work? who knows. thats for the ccp executives to call and be held accountable for. i for one dont think this is a bad path to be on as long as long standing bugs and csm issues are addressed, resolved, and resources are allocated to fix old problems.vod"
7/17/2010,look how naive you are
7/17/2010,excerpt from minutes:that says it all right there... new features over quality and polish... in other words... they don't give a #### what you think. this discussion is a waste of time.they wouldn't give a damn even if you screamed loud enough.and the csm is powerless to stop it.sorry to burst your bubble... protest or not... we're at the mercy of greed.
7/17/2010,"imo eve works deacent, yes there are some poblems with fleet lag, but that is a problemon every single mmo (except for wow but they get rid of lag by capping numbers in a instance) if you get 600 people on 1 grid all doing different things, the server is going to bog down a bit. there is only so much bandwidth available. yes there are bugs, but ccp does spend alot of time fixing them. the ones that do get overlooked for a long time are hardly game killers. the thing is eve stays a active viable game because new stuff keeps coming out. i seriously doubt i would still be playing the game with out the wormholes, and pi has been a god send for those times when i have nothing else to do."
7/17/2010,"i think most people that are concerned are 0.0 players. how long is it ago that we had a decent pvp patch, all i see are bear patches and eve is gettting laggier and laggier for pvp. seems there priorities are wrong. wormhole - bear patchmission thingies - bear patchfw - small bear friendly pvp and farming bear patchsystem upgrades - bear patchnew sov - pvp patchepic arcs - bear patchevegate - uselesspi - bear patchwhere are all the pvp improving content, ie the numerous broken ships? bo's? deimost? lach?"
7/17/2010,"ccp isn't overstretched, they're understaffed."
7/17/2010,absolutely supported!ccp is using the income generated by eve to make world of darkness and a console game.neither of these relates to internet spaceships.so based on available numbers something like 5% of my $15 a month is being used to pay for people to work on the game i play.
7/17/2010,"this is like ultimate luxure that company is so transparent as ccp. they took time explain how they allocated resources in order to achieve selected goals, which is pretty amazing. look at other companies you don't see nothing nowhere like this. besides, i guess thats true that ccp ""fixing"" team is working on a variety of bugs behind the scenes. i'm sure there were a lot exploits, bugs and various other problems with the code, which should be fixed. and if you don't see it, it does not matter that no work is done. to my liking their choice of development is amazing. i think incarna and dust link implementation is exactly the right choice of tasks for now in order to really improve the game."
7/17/2010,"void bombs. now, show me on the doll where the domi/ishtar/curse touched you"
7/17/2010,so you want to make gallente even weaker by giving people a single module to completely nullify the dps of their drone boats?no ****ing way
7/17/2010,this is a pulse which when it hits the drone; it incapacitates the drone. the controller loses all control of the drone.
7/17/2010,"actually i just recently broke 10mil sp in drones. 90% of the time im in sin, ishtar, domi, or thanny. primarily sin."
7/17/2010,then you should realize this would completely shut down every drone ship with a single module. i have 15m sp in drones.
7/17/2010,"sure, as soon as you give us this.emp weapon disable pulsethis is a pulse which when it hits on-board weapons; it incapacitates them. the ship loses all control of the on-board weapons. they'll need to fly to the nearest market, and purchase new weapons to fight."
7/17/2010,terrible proposal and you don't even give a reason.
7/17/2010,my proposal is to have more heavier dungeons in eve. the heaviest dungeon is at the moment a sanctum. i would like to see new dungeons added with atleast a dubble spawn of rats. 12 to 18 bs rats per wave. its way more fun to interact on that way with people and shooting stuffs
7/17/2010,"it's called anomaly. and yes, they are too trivial, therefore supported."
7/17/2010,lfm naxx 25.
7/17/2010,"swing by wormhole space some time. a class 6 anomoly plus capital escalation sounds like what you're after. plus, sleepers are slightly less morose,than empire rats, bit more challenging."
7/17/2010,"there's not much here to explain my argument, because it's self explanatory that this would improve eve in the long run, just spend 30 seconds googling it if you don't know what this standard is about. here, i'll do it for you. hell, even if it doesn't improve eve, it will probably improve ccps profits, they should be all over it.if ccp is already certified: why do i not see that certificate proudly stated on the website?oh, and while we're at it, how about getting iso-20000 certification (this would especially improve the gm department and could help with the cluster management, but then again, it's quite possible the size of ccp does not [yet] justify this.), and iso-27001 certification for improved security?yeah. that'd be cool."
7/17/2010,"supporting my own proposal.also, here are some more standards relevant to what ccp is doing:iso-15504iso-12207cmmior hey, how about: hire a process management guru, if you don't have one already. people complain about ccp focusing on ""shinies"" all the time and getting distracted from issues at hand. so how about doing something about this by bringing some order into chaos?"
7/17/2010,how about you start your own mmo development company and do it better than ccp with your ****ty certificates?
7/17/2010,"having had to endure the 9001:2008 audit just two weeks ago: gtfo !there's nothing more senseless in a company below 100,000 employees than this ****ing shifting of paper mounts! it's gm's brainchild and one should have let them go bust over it."
7/17/2010,"no thanks, busy working myself to death at a service desk that struggles to be compliant. :(how about you go and learn about the importance of process management to ensure cost savings, delivery on time and customer satisfaction, and start your own consulting firm? also, ccp already uses agile since red moon rising, and scrum since apocrypha, so this shows they are on the right track."
7/17/2010,this is truly the dumbest idea i have ever seen... including all my own.
7/17/2010,is it dumb because you don't understand what it is?i personaly think a company with such a client base should have this kind of certification and process in place.
7/17/2010,"so what you are saying is this forum should be removed since ccp is the allmighty and should not be questioned?that said, it is ****ty idea.iso9001 doesnt suddenly make your decission making process good, it only makes it cost alot of paper."
7/17/2010,"forgot your support. :(i agree, it does not make it good or bad, nor does it make the decisions better, but at least it makes the process leading to decisions consistent, which as we all can see, is very much not the case with ccp."
7/17/2010,"complete waste of time and resources they could be using to, you know, do game stuff."
7/17/2010,"please forgive me if this idea has been posted before.anyways, i noticed that there is no way of tracking who puts in what items and what quantities into the corporate hangar arrays (cha). like any other corp in eve, the corp that i'm in employs a multitude of these arrays in our poses, but we have too many members in our corp to keep track as to which items or ores belong to who. back then, it was only a matter of which tabs to put them in for each member or division, but as our numbership grew, this method is proving to be cumbersome. even anchored giant secured containers (gsc) only provide a temporary solution to this problem due to their limited capacity compared to the volumes we put in towards the chas.i think it would be nice to have a feature built into the chas that allows high-ranking corp members (ie: ceo, directors, etc.) to see who has put in which items and how much of it. this could also help miners rest assured that their ores are properly accounted for when they get paid for it."
7/17/2010,it's just surprising that ccp has chosen to take the stand that they do not care about maintaining the quality of their game. all they seem to be interested is in increasing the subscriber base which will lead to higher sales and increased profits. while i understand that is important for every company it seems to be a very short term view.eve has lasted for so many years and been a success because the quality of the game has been maintained along with the addition of new content. both are essential to the success of the game. focusing on one and ignoring the other will just lead to a loss of business in the long run.i doubt any of the players who claim they are going to quit the game will do so. while i am very unhappy about the direction that ccp has gone with this i intend to play this game i love. however as aspects of the game become unplayable players will leave the game.eventually ccp being a company that is interested in profits will come back to this issue and work on maintaining the game.i just hope they realise sooner rather than later. to my knowledge ccp does not lack the financial resources to be able to ensure they add new content while maintaining the game.
7/17/2010,"nope, sorry dude, ccp thinks a 3d chat room is more important."
7/17/2010,it's a simple fix that ccp should be able to slip in there even with their refocused priorities.
7/17/2010,"vengeance and heretic reporting in. also, a 150% bonus to explosion velocity is good but not enough. rockets need at least a 20% buff in base damage in addition to that to even approach the usefulness of 150mm autocannons on the aforementioned ships.in addition, a reduction in fitting requirements to around the same as 125mm/150mm ac's would be very beneficial. rockets just use too much fitting resources on top of being so crappy.ccp will get around to fixing rockets but one thing wont change. disappointment. i've been waiting forever and i've been disappointed time and time again reading the patchnotes and noticing the apparent complete apathy of ccp towards this issue.. when they do 'buff them' the changes made will do very little to make them competitive against other short range weapon systems which in the end is what matters... not arbitrary exclamations of necessary % buffs to damage ect."
7/17/2010,"you're pretty much spot on here.i left the damage increase out of the op because the fundamental problem with rockets lies in the explosion velocity. but the way i see it is that if you can get them to where they are doing full damage to a properly tackled target, then their eft dps should be slightly lower than the other frigate weapons, to account for other systems not doing full dps (tracking/falloff).basically the idea is to put them on par with the other weapons, not make them the new overpowered fotm.another point to consider would be an increased clip size. rockets run out of ammo much faster than other frigate weapons.but i can't stress enough that explosion velocity is the #1 issue."
7/17/2010,there is already a fix rockets thread that's been going for over a year linkagethe discussion about what's worng with rockets is in this thread. there are many more problems with rockets than just the ev.
7/17/2010,"was told all i love would be killed if i didn't support.does need fixing, i just don't see ccp giving a **** about what would really improve the game though."
7/17/2010,"this is actually sensible. considering we have a multitude of options to use for paying for our subscriptions, we should have relatively the same choices for paying for other eve goodies."
7/17/2010,you may take into consideration that in some countries credit cards are alot less commonas for example in the united states. i life in germany. i could get a credit card if i<U+FFFD>d ask my bank for one. but they wouldcharge me a fee for it and i basicly had no use for it. when i shop online i almostexclusivly pay with paypal. in my circle of friends there are just two individuels who do own a credit card.there is no way i could convince them to enter their cc-details into a website likeeve-online. for ccp it should not be a technical or beurocratical difficulty since they alreadyaccept other means of payment for account subscription aswell as for their merchandise shop.
7/17/2010,"occasionally when we log in we have to scroll through the new eula before we can do anything else. i don't know if ccp cares about people reading it but sometimes there are new rules introduced that concern player conduct, and i think it might be best if the bi-monthly eula-scrolling ritual was changed so that the actual differences were highlighted, and the really important changes are explained at the top in plain english and short sentances.did you know that when you sell your character you are required to send a corp e-mail saying so before you send it on its way? neither did i and its been a rule for a while now."
7/17/2010,"there is loads of quirky stuff in the eula that i bet most don't know about, for example, it's against the eula to pretend to be the original owner of a character that you have bought."
7/17/2010,"just make a separate entry, possibly at the character stats (as race, bloodline, etc.) showing the date joined eve. this is what 95% of people looking at employment history are looking for. doing background checks on a new recruit is certainly important enough to warrant those few seconds of loading time to get accurate info."
7/17/2010,"something simple. a patch dedicated soley to pvp. give us some new content. maybe a new range of hacs, maybe a new ship class but something simple and inexpensive. tech iii ship are rubbish and don't satisfy the void since the tier 3 ships were introduced. so please, its time the pvp'ers of eve got some love"
7/17/2010,because nobody good ever uses t3 in pvp amirite?
7/17/2010,supported with additions:-> make the ammatar an allied faction to amaar-> allow minmatar pilots to join ammatar factionwould make derelik a more interesting area. perhaps would also allow jarizza (iirc) to sprout as a more independent trading hub than rens or amaar.
7/17/2010,she made me embarrassed to call myself a carebear. how can i sell my inventions if stuff doesn't get blown up?
7/17/2010,"well i just got around to reading these and i must say it's disappointing...there was a lot of wait 18months fr bug fixes, and no real commitments to fix the issues.i hope that the csm will be able to post the list of issues in the backlog publicly will be good to see whats going on and be able to see its progress to being delivered.but my biggest disappointment is that ccp cant spare a small team of devs to work on the polish of the game, i'm sure even a team of 3 - 5 could make a huge impact working on the little things.... surely they can spare that many to keep people subscribed to the game?"
7/17/2010,monkey island = best game
7/17/2010,i suspect that the upper management of eve would sell their daughters to a renegade klan biker gang before they let the csm get within 30 meters of anything to do with dust. or incarna.
7/17/2010,"in ccp zulu's new blog he basically acts like you guys are crazy for reporting that ccp has all their resources for the next year tied up on incarna, and also suggests that the csm minutes are factually incorrect or incomplete and give people the wrong idea of what the ccp/csm interaction really was likethen in the rest of the blog he pretty much confirms everything you guys have been saying about ccp's general direction and attitudes. also i thought the minutes were reviewed by ccp before being posted?so, regardless of what our opinions are on those directions and attitudes i was just wondering if any of you wanted to comment on the general tone he was taking with the minutes and these ""rumors and half truths"" you guys are spreading around? not trying to start anything i just wondered what your reactions werethanks in advance"
7/17/2010,"i'm not fussed. everyone at an event will come away with a different impression. the csm's job is to report on events in a manner that accurately reflects their opinion and perspective. we did that in the minutes, in blog posts, on twitter and via other social media. ccp zulu's dev blog--and responses in that thread (curiously none from zulu in the first 17 pages) and others--are just ccp doing the same for themselves...if a bit late to the party. the evidence pretty much speaks for itself. p(l)ayers are smart enough to see it and furthermore, to read between the lines.of greater concern to me is csm's lack of any effective, timely communications channel with ccp. i don't see how csm can work productively with ccp on behalf of players if that situation is not addressed in a more satisfactory way by ccp.the role and objectives of the csm going forward is a topic under discussion among csm delegates. if the status quo--particularly with regard to communication and response to csm issues--on ccp's side does not change, it seems to me that the csm will have to evolve in ways that will allow it to work on players' behalf in spite of roadblocks and lack of communication from ccp. to be honest, i think that evolution has already begun. however, where we go from here is not clear yet."
7/17/2010,"you go mynxee!fwiw, have entire confidence in you and the other csm"
7/17/2010,i agree. its great the csm is finding a way through the bureaucratic tangle. is it appropriate for someone on the csm to give us an inkling of what alternative methods might be in the offing? or is that premature at this point in time? delilah
7/17/2010,"we are only just starting to think about it...it's still at a conversation level at this point. i'm sure when/if any strategy changes are determined, you'll see that reflected both in our social media outlets and actions"
7/17/2010,"to the honoured csm team. your understanding of the agile development method whether deliberate or accidental is music to my product management ears!you are absolutely 100% correct in saying that there should be fast small changes instead of large changes once resources become available. if the csm meeting minutes are a true representation of ccps dev processes, i would suggest reading up on the agile development method further and offering this proposal to ccp at your next meeting, suggesting they understand what they are trying to achieve by changing their dev methods."
7/17/2010,agile development. akin to adaptive management in environmental affairs? interesting and helpful concept for this situation. delilah
7/17/2010,hey there delilah...
7/17/2010,"hi captain. how are you doing? i see finnagain is up to his usual antics. for those of you new to this thread, or searching for background information on ankgate, a relatively comprehensive overview and set of links can be found on the friends of eve blog. look under the csm category. since ank is gone, and most people seem to be able to move on, this is primarily of historical interest, but i trust it will come in handy one day. enjoy! delilah"
7/17/2010,"i know your desire to deceive and trick people on behalf of ank is really, really strong, but who do you think you're going to fool with such obvious and laughable lies? seriously? many csm members agreed that ank had indeed chucked a spoon at meissa, those were people who were there, but you're still lying about it?just like during the campaign when we had actual quotes from ank with actual links to the threads that proved not one word was changed, and you lied and claimed that they were ""debunked"". your tactic seems to be the big lie, but as long as people catch you out and point out your transparent dishonesty, you're not going to trick anybody. honestly, do you lie so much due to some sort of damage or are you hoping to accomplish something? shall we add paranoid to the mix? you think that i not only read your blog (hah) but take the time to comment on it, anonymously? you're funny.oh, and a reminder that you lie constantly due to being a partisan shill: surely, since you don't just lie to try to protect ank, even after she's been removed in disgrace, you can link to your (many, certainly) posts where you demanded that she be removed from the csm. right? right?"
7/17/2010,"i've been keeping up, and i have to say, they seem to be trying very hard.i see ccp shutting them out over and over again, and not treating them like (actual) stakeholders, but that's to be understood, because ccp's main interest has to be it's own survival, which unfortunately/honestly can't come before making players happy.ccp is a buisness, after all, not a government agency.tl;dr: i approve! great job, csm!"
7/17/2010,anyone who doesn't see the value in getting ccp to admit that we're getting no new content at all til 2012 is unreachablefor that alone the csm deserves our thanks.
7/17/2010,i support ankh. oh wait...
7/17/2010,"there's not much here to explain my argument, because it's self explanatory that this would improve eve in the long run, just spend 30 seconds googling it if you don't know what those standards are.if ccp is already certified: why do i not see that certificate proudly stated on the website?oh, and while they are at it, how about getting iso-20000 certification (this would especially improve the gm department and could help with the cluster, but then again, it's quite possible the size of ccp does not [yet] justify this.), and iso-27000 certification for improved security?yeah. that'd be cool.edit: ugh, this was supposed to go into the assembly hall, not here. god damn it, firefox."
7/17/2010,they don't have a big sense of humor over at ccp it seems
7/17/2010,"my god, it's as if someone thought of this idea before"
7/17/2010,"my god, it's as if someone thought of this idea beforehmm a crime and punishment forum is for crime and punishment. the main crux of getting a functioning(more people)low sec is how to make evry aspect of it more apealing to as many as possible, so would need input from mission runners,traders,manufactor's,inventers,single player pvp players, and corps, so yea somebody has thought it before.but as you see its all in 5 diffent forums, 1 forum for all parts would make an already near impossible job of collating a little more effeciant."
7/17/2010,clearly you do not read crime and punishment.
7/17/2010,"na i am a mission runner, i read the mission runner forum."
7/17/2010,this explains everything.
7/17/2010,"yea i thought it would, says nothing but does explain the problem."
7/17/2010,"nice trick trying to dilute the impact of the csm message by claiming it is not representative of the player base but no dice (it's not working).please note most of the issues raised by the csm have nothing to do with specific playstyles and social groups and a whole lot more with fundamental, core, gameplay mechanics which are broken and have been for a long time and the fact players want ccp to stop for a short while and focus on fixing these issues instead of allocating most of the resources to chasing after new subscribers interestingly enough, this csm appears to be one of the most united in its purpose ever: make you ccp realise that contrary to all your claims of excellence and wonderful state of the game this is not the case. you cannot ignore your existing playerbase and dedicate everythgin to potential new subscribers, this attitude will kill eve."
7/17/2010,you forgot + 40 new skills to go with the new t3 ships that take 2 years to get to lvl5.
7/18/2010,indeed.
7/18/2010,"guys guys, ccp is too busy working on first person games for the next 18 monthsbut i support for the lulz regardless"
7/18/2010,"i am subbed till fall of 2014, i'll be around to push this at least that long, and who knows, maybe by then, after all this mmofps, and wis, pi, stuff is done they might have room for pos's. either way, i have been pushing this since early 2007, and i see no other threads that are half as well organized, supported, or any other plans by ccp that will improve what we call the junk in space that is the player owned station. until something can replace this, that is equally as good, this will remain on my list of things that ccp needs to do, even if they don't want to mess with pos code, or its to hard."
7/18/2010,"gentlepeople,a question from your friendly neighborhood csm (who btw mentioned the dead horse issue in his platform).assume for a moment that there is no way in hell that ccp is going to totally revamp poss (note: for avoidance of tinfoil hattery, i have no knowledge of ccp's plans to do, or not do, anything about this issue, nor have i had any conversations with them about it).in such a circumstance, what functional changes in the current pos system would you want?"
7/18/2010,"a while ago i'd have asked for copy and invention slots to be made available across the alliance, and the implementation of that fuel pellets idea that was being looked into."
7/18/2010,"better resists, better fitting, better jump range. extra dps would be nice, but better targetting so it can be a rr/support ship for the covert fleet would be nicer i think.but i'd rather you just give it a covops cloak."
7/18/2010,big bump
7/18/2010,"it's fail and all of eve will be deserted because u want to remove high sec and turn it into low sec. is any of this getting through to u?exactly my point.1. u fail to see it because u're too stupid to. ooh limit fleet size...oh wait, who says they need to be in one fleet? u'll still have the blobs and any anti-pirate stupid enough to engage will get baited and blobbed, just like in low sec. way to be an idiot. 2. this proposal is only really aimed to boost afk autopiloting hauling, which is probably what u really want.the only turnover of ships that will happen will be the miners, mission runners, and any anti-pirate stupid enough to engage the multiple-fleet blobs. then missions and mining will still be unprotected (especially with the anti-pirates now dead) against the blobs so belts and mission deadspaces be deserted as a result, just like low sec. great idea... right 'cause pirates never roam huh? with so many pirates roaming, u'll be lucky if u can even stay for 5 minutes in a belt/deadspace, assuming u don't get ganked before then.those options already exist atm. all u want is to extend low sec pirating to de-populate high sec of all producers. 1. because this is a sandbox, not low sec, low sec, and more low sec.2. because this isn't ""good vs evil"", it's everyone vs everyone."
7/18/2010,"u can claim to be whoever u want to be, just like every other carebear. the fact is, your proposal will only boost low sec pirating past low sec with multiple-fleet blobs to get around your ******ed system, clearing high sec of everyone else, just like low sec. furthermore, u want to boost afk autopilot hauling but here's the thing--with no production, what exactly r u gonna haul? and fyi, we r following the rules--u're just too stupid to understand them.nevertheless, if who u claim to be is true, then that does explain your total lack of perspective, your ignorance, and last but not least, your stupidity. but plz continue--i'm really looking forward whatever nonsense u idiots will continue babbling."
7/18/2010,"yes it's getting through. you don't like the idea and you think everyone will quit. i'm not suggesting chopping up .5 - 1.0 into pirate zones. .8 and up will be free of this. hell you could confine my idea to .5 - .6 for all i care. i'm just brainstorming. i like how you have to throw personal insults in every chance you get. anyways i understand there could be blobs of multi fleet pirates. okay fine, i and 3 friends bring battleships outfitted to pop frigates like cheap party balloons. i don't think you're understanding how limiting it is to be restricted to only frigates as a pirate. so i guess it's impossible to fight a few blobs of frigates which are confined out of stations/gates. i had no idea high sec players were so defenseless. exactly, they have to keep roaming. so hopefully any pirates are doing quick hit and runs and moving on. means if i survived an attack or i know they are there i don't have to wait long before risking getting some sweet sweet golden omber i can't get in .8. that's not at all what i want. i am a high sec producer. maybe i want less one man with 3 account corps being as competitive as a small tight knit corp that knows how to defend itself vs frigs.actually i think you're wrong there. maybe it can be anyone vs anyone but good vs bad is all relative. so if you want to knit pick that go right ahead. if you need me to be 100% correct in my definitions then fine it's ""high sec non pirates"" vs ""high sec pirates"". which currently is ""high sec miners/indies"" vs ""suicide gankers"".anyways that's the last i'll really say on this as it's beyond the scope of the op. i do agree with removing the insurance on suicide gankers but that fix alone doesn't fix other problems imho. right now low sec is rewarding if you can use it. it's just no one feels the risk is worth it. however i'm sure we can all agree going from relatively peaceful high sec into low sec is a slap in the face and can be a tall order for most small corps with little pvp experience. i'm just trying to think of ways to introduce players gradually to the enjoyable pvp aspect of the game. maybe the answer is to add a ""mid sec"" instead of my initial proposal. .1 - .3 can remain low, .4 - .6 can be mid with some pirate pvp in frigs and .7 and up can be safe everywhere including belts. maybe i'll post a proposal formally and see if getting the community brainstorming on this can help *shrug*. although if everyone responds like anna maybe i'm wasting my breath"
7/18/2010,seconded for common sense.
7/18/2010,"who would like the idea of more low sec when ppl can't buy any ships 'cause the market's empty? it makes no difference how this is confined--low sec is low sec. u just wanna remove high sec for more low sec, plain and simple, emptying more space and crowding yourself into the highest sec space, as well as the other carebears (assuming u r who u claim to be, which i really doubt). try coming up with a well-thought out proposal. this is the assembly hall, not features and ideas, u half-assing moron.and u're not understanding how battleships can't kill anything they can't lock or track, let alone a blob of them. of course, u r a stupid carebear who knows absolutely nothing about pvp after all. that's why the insults r there. it is for u because news flash: it's not high sec anymore. and conversely, u're confined to gates and stations. u could step outside those areas if u don't mind getting farmed for killmails. great thinking again, moron. right because pirates never roam back? and those will be the only pirates that will ever come through the system? ******... you don't even know how to defend yourself against frigates. were u expecting to give your corpmates fail advice to pad your enemies' killboards? good job on being a fail ceo...just because u're not shooting someone, doesn't mean u're not competing against them, whether it's zapping the same asteroid or market sales. of course, someone like u obviously doesn't have the mental capacity to grasp this concept."
7/18/2010,"alright anna enough. battleships can lock and track frigates if they use the right mods/guns. i'm suprised you didn't know that. i'm happy to have informed you. yes i know you can theory craft a fight where i die horribly to your carefully crafted counter. everything in eve can be countered. so let's not get into that. anyways there is no point arguing any further as you are simply presenting worst case scenarios in which the opposing side can't fight back despite having access to ships with 200x the hp and the ability to field more guns per ship while having the law on their side. if people can't handle this even in high sec a little then i doubt ccp can do anything to entice people further to low sec. since the people you describe fighting the pirates can't organize, fight back, play smart or manage the risk. you must have a very low opinion of most the players in eve. my original post was that i just wanted some constructive criticism to hash the idea out and that includes adding/changing/deleting parts of it. if you can't reply without getting your back up and without name calling then fine. go find someone else to troll.quit wasting my time. - draek"
7/18/2010,"here's an idea--try coming up with a well-thought out proposal instead of a ******ed, half-assed idea that fails so much, u can't even back it up at all. then instead of crying so much to nerf suicide ganking, escape it by going into low sec if u think it's really worth it. actually do something about it for once instead of throwing out stupid, spontaneous ideas in the assembly hall. oh no u're not wasting your breath at all because in retrospect, it's very entertaining watching stupid carebears like u fail repeatedly with your crap that u call proposals. so by all means, continue."
7/18/2010,"oh i'm sry--r u running out of half-assed ideas to throw out or do u have nothing left to defend your current ones? funny how u're already throwing out a proposed counter, yet u supposedly don't want to theorycraft. maybe u just don't want another refute 'cause u can't even handle forums? so go ahead, at the risk of being a ******, go ahead and prove your fit that will counter a frigate blob, unless u affirm that u know absolutely nothing about pvp or eve in general. news flash for your stupid ignorant carebear brain: 1. most of the players in eve r pirates.2. the bolded part describes the stupid carebears (aka yourself) that refuse to learn from their mistakes and adapt and expect ccp to hold their hand. u ppl r the ones *****ing and crying about this. like u said, ccp can't help u if u won't help yourself. for the millionth time, this is the assembly hall, not features and ideas. wow... u brought this on yourself when u gave half-assed ideas in the assembly hall and expected no one to counter your ******ed, half-assed arguments. if anyone's wasting your time, it's u for failing even more than your fail ideas."
7/18/2010,well if ideas and features is the place to put this my apologies for not putting it there sooner. and no it's not like i didn't expect people to counter my idea or even be against it. i just didn't expect them to be asshats about it.you're an asset to the community anna. thank you for your clear concise remarks.

7/18/2010,"a lot of people want things fixed, but no one is explaining how these things are broken.one common example i'm seeing is claims of pi being broken because new players can use it. how is this a bad thing? the market used to seed items automatically. in order to meet demand, players now have the option to produce those very same products.what about the production ui? it's not perfect; there are certainly small changes that i could see working. for example, instead of creating multiple filters for corp, alliance and public, they could be configured with different colours, or giving individual players outside of alliances the ability to rent slots, but those might not fit into the grand scheme ccp has set up. other than that i'd say it's close to perfect as it could be. what bugs are there with factional warfare? once again, i woulden't call it perfect based on the rewards, and perhaps from a story perspective it's not perfect because more players prefer active armor hardeners to faction webs and passive armor hardeners, but the system works.i agree that many of the bones we've been tossed have felt lacking, but i don't think they've necessarily been hollow shells. planetary interaction gets criticized for the ""that's it?"" style of game play it has, but that's not a fault of pi, but more the expectations of the players. on the other hand, incarna has been identified as an eyecandy feature which might earn an expansion of players from the likes of microsoft v-chat, moove or imvu, while evading the issues brought forward by a core group of eve players, among them being lag, or the issues created with the introduction of the new sov warfare system. but ccp can only work at the pace that their research data allows - keep connecting to those sisi test fleets you miserable jackasses!as an aside, i wonder how many 0.0 players, commonly viewed as a minority of players, actually run empire alts. i'd put the number at a third to a half. based on the csm's results where virtual no-names representing nullsec alliances are instantly propelled into the csm superstardom, i'm not sure i'm far off.one area i'd like to see figured out is cosmos agent rewards, and perhaps a re-balancing of faction reward distribution. yes, i know the gallente didn't ""invent"" microwarpdrives, but japan didn't invent automobiles, either."

7/18/2010,"incarna will be introduced with a whole new batch of bugs of it's own. if ccp can't fix the stuff that's broken now due to misplaced priorities. what makes anyone think they will suddenly prioritize these fixes 18 months to 2 years from now after a whole new host of broken features are added.i support this topic not just for fw but low sec in general and to show ccp that they need to focus on the game we have today, not 2 years from now."
7/18/2010,"not supported. i don't engage in fw, and would like wis/incarna. furthermore, wis/incarna in needed for dust which is needed to bring more life in pi."
7/18/2010,"i apologize, i did not realize participation in faction warfare was so widespread. if amends to it could be proven to not only retain players currently involved in it, but grow participation from the rest of the playerbase, as well as attract new players to eve, to a greater extent than incarna and dust 514, then yes, it certainly deserves more developer attention. however, i do not believe that this is the case.i played warhammer online for the first year that it was out, and it was built from the ground up to be based on realm vs realm (faction vs faction?) pvp. it had many great mechanics for people to form ad hoc groups to accomplish both pve and pvp tasks; the progression of the greater pvp war was based on smaller pve objectives, any of which could quickly turn into pvp engagements (sound familiar?). the combat had a nice skirmish feel, and the game got a lot of things right. warhammer online is now also widely considered a massive failure. its subscribership numbers dropped off a cliff. why? in small part due to the normal implementation hiccups that almost all mmos face; bugs, server problems, imbalance issues, etc. but what really killed it was that from the very beginning the concept was flawed.by dictating the players' opponents by an arbitrary choice at the beginning of playing (one more based on roleplay aesthetics, or so and so's side is or isn't the current underdog, etc.), rather than allowing all conflicts to be born out of individual player choices and interactions, the burden of giving pvp conflict any personal meaning went to the developers. so the developers would try to come up with more and better ways to dynamically reward/punish the victors and defeated with various game items/ranks/limitations/perks. these things soon get old, and people soon realize that such a system devolves into gaming the system itself, instead of each other.realms (factions) would occasionally achieve widespread cohesion and accomplish all of the goals dictated by the realm (faction) conflict mechanics, after which rehashing such accomplishment would become trivial faster than the devs could pile more new content or incentives on top of the heap. each side would soon devolve into chaotic sparring against people they might rather be riding(flying) with (but hey, they're part of such and such faction, so we're supposed to kill them!) while wishing they could kill some of their very own realm(faction)-mates, or into cliquey semi-organized groups that effectively gamed the system for maximum profit, and then eventually got bored of it and quit. tl;dr - faction warfare as a larger concept is a dead end; many proposed improvements to it would make it less player driven and more dev driven, and there are way more compelling things for the csm and devs to be spending their time on. (revamping low sec, new features that will for a certainty result in playerbase growth, things that add on to the sandboxyness of eve rather than spoon feeding more of it, etc.)"
7/18/2010,"more people would come into the game through incarna than any fw fix. fw is horrible for new players because it tanks their standings with the opposing factions, and it teaches them the only effective pvp is battleship and up blobs.plus incarna solves a real problem: the game is boring half the time when you are waiting for skills to train. currently its just grinding isk and looking for trouble: this adds more things to do. fixing fw doesn't: it's just to benefit the small number of people doing it.the metagame is as borked as the rest of the game's pvp. plexing isn't much different than playing timezone games to nail a pos, or using spies, station games, and neutral alts/reppers. thing is there is no shortage of pvp opportunities in the game, and the fixes a lot of people mention for fw really wont get new people into it. if it can be fixed at all-metagaming will never be, and that's a large part of what makes fw bad.you wont have a game in 2 years if they waste time trying to fix unfixable things. they have to focus on what will bring in new people, because in 2010-2011 you are going to start seeing population in eve decay even further simply because new aaa games are coming out.lowsec can't be fixed. most of the ""fixes"" are harmful in general and would actually lose players. like lowsec routes only between empires.some things can be fixed and polished, and there is a problem when they don't work on more basic things because of it. but lowsec/fw is impossible to fix imo."
7/18/2010,a troll? a clueless person? a player who's bitter that they invested time in a game they don't like? you decide. now back to your regularly scheduled program.
7/18/2010,"i did fw on the amarr side, and there is no way to fix the thing. most of the problems with fw are metagame ones that wont go away: the militia channel being a refuge for alt spies, and the inability to make fw occupancy matter without it being exploited just like the fw level 4s are (look at navy slicer prices freefalling for an example.) lowsec too: i've soloed in it most of the time that i've played. most of the solutions here to lowsec break the game because for pirates to exist, you have to force hisec bears in there to lose their ships. any other changes already are covered by wormholes better.my point still stands: fixing both wont draw people to the game. eve players have too much tunnel vision about the nature of the game being one way, and don't realize the benefits of incarna bringing people in."
7/18/2010,fix existing game features now plz.
7/18/2010,"yeah i think i trolled myself, that's a weird experience. anyways i agree, and am quite looking forward to incarna, it should make the game a more interesting place and may lead to improvements in many places. far more then any fw fix would manage.low-sec and fw as a subsection of low-sec (though some may not agree with me on that) however have a lot of opportunity to grow and improve. there is a lot of potential for fun game stuff that could be made with those two products. they aren't as hopeless as you make them out to be. obviously not with forcing carebears to low-sec or something like that (and honestly who wants em anyways, let them rot in high-sec if that's their thing) but working with the nature of the area and the people who live there and emphasizing that.anyways i'm for letting them finish incarna so when they actually start to improve the stuff they've already put in game they can actually focus on it properly rather than a bunch of band-aid fixes that bog the game down with nonsense. also its likely that incarna could also give them that ability to gather more resources overall assuming an influx of new sub's."

7/18/2010,"supported, another one for ccp's backlog to be considered when dev time and server performance allows it... write access via api authentication to evegate functions (which apparently has an xml-rpc backend already anyway) would be real nice though as i'm sure any player implementation of those features will be better (and more compatible) than the backwards official one they have so many people working on..."
7/18/2010,this will be dealt with when i can mine ice in hell.
7/18/2010,"i'm a rocket man, here on page 10."
7/18/2010,t'amber made me do it
7/18/2010,"t'amber made a lot of people support, and post without support.t'amber should get some priorities.i think it is a good idea, and some t'amber shaped clouds stare angrily at me until i do it."
7/18/2010,no......
7/18/2010,"could you elaborate on the no?it's a relatively simple change that would help many people, it's also optional so you can either have it on or off. i dont really see any problems with it."
7/18/2010,"what he means his ctrl + space = 0ms /s. easy isn't.btw, that doubleclick feature is very useful and fast in pvp."
7/18/2010,lol somebody has a faulty script i see and no .....
7/18/2010,yes it is very fast in pvp but that's why its optional do you people not get that? -.- leave it on but there are times when it would be nice to have it off
7/18/2010,/agree
7/18/2010,"this is driving me insane and i know i am not the 1st person to complain about it.please fix the non-contrasting colors of the probe ""boxes"" when you are scanning.the colors are too close to the background colors, even worse when you dive ""below"" the plane of space, illustrated by the 2nd picture.1st picture - shows how horrible the colors are below the plane."
7/18/2010,"that's stupid. make them illuminate if put against darck background. simular issue arises when probes are put against a bright background- you can't see the scanning spheres. as an alternative, blur background a bit, and adjust it's brightness so the probes can be easelly seen against it."
7/18/2010,"good idea, supporting."
7/18/2010,"yeah, this is one of the few things about the new scan system that really bugs me."
7/18/2010,"i r agree, cuz lag make me </3"
7/18/2010,"this is s very technical proposal, i will support it,because it is definately worth loocking into, but it raises a number of issues that might stand in the way. for example, how do stacked drones receive damage? can a single drone be hit? the drones have to have the exact same coordinates when firing, otherwise transversal and optimal will be different for each drone, and damage calculations will need to be done separately for them, which makes stacking them useless. will they move as a single entity? will they be inside each-other? will they be made into ""swarms"" where drones are so close to each-other that any difference in transversal and optimal is negligible and an average is used for all of them?"
7/18/2010,what s up with small smart bomb on drones :if they are all nbombed due to proximity they all die... if they are wandering around there is a chance some survive.
7/18/2010,"a good idea that won't work as locking one drone locks the entire flight of drones. while this is not so bad an issue when you're shooting them (where the destruction of the first drone in the stack breaks the lock requiring another locking cycle for the next drone in the stack), it's an easily exploited hole when using remote repair or other support modules on them.but yes, you are right. drone swarms in fleet fights are a part of a big lag beast of their own. methods to limit that do need to be explored."
7/18/2010,this would be very helpful.
7/18/2010,oh yessss !
7/18/2010,"actually they just passed one of my recent suggestions to align to bookmarks so that's not entirely true ;)but living in a wh we constantly have to update bm cans and go to it and drag and drop/refill it etc and if no one replaces and it runs out well we're just sol so i'm with you 150% on this one, definate +1"
7/18/2010,must have feature!
7/18/2010,i could go for this
7/18/2010,"so why then have the time tables of everything that the dev team is to work for the next 18 months at least set in stone and practically none of the concerns eaised to the csm ion that list? no fw fixes at all so in fact it will be 4 years after implimentation that this system is even looked at i know fw players are the red headed step child, but come the hell on, publically admit it at least, or give us a firm date and a dedicatated dev, or just flat out say that you don't want our money, and end fw."
7/18/2010,"wrong. its being followed very well on massively, and they generally don't have a shortage of news to report."
7/18/2010,"idk about increasing difficulty, and max blueprints 3 runs...honestly i think there is too much here for someone to agree on every single thing on, i agree with cosmos recieving a touch up, and on the part boosting meta's, but not everything else 100%"
7/18/2010,"fix:1. yes.2. what exactly does boosting the meta level do?3. don't care.4. yes.5. yes.moar cosmos:1. a lot of work, but would be welcome.2. not sure.3. screw drones. nuke the drone regions please.4. there already are some pirate cosmos (serpentis and bloods come to mind).5. you will never prevent players from creating guides.6. might be asking for a lot here.7. absolutely not.what i really want to see: remove the 1 time only limit. i think this should be changed to 3, 6 or even 12 months."
7/18/2010,"1 - yesminmatar and gallente have too many agents that don't give faction standing increase. they need to be changed to one time mission offer with faction increase.2 - yesright now only a few storyline modules are equal to or a bit better than t2 modules, most are equal to meta lv 3. they should all be equal to or better than t2.3 - noamount of runs can stay the same. more variety of different bpc's is needed instead of getting the same bpc 4 to 6 times.4 - yesalso the area where the skill books drop needs to be more random. once a player finds out where they drop, they farm it and make bank.5 - yesas it is, most of the cosmos rewards are under par compared to regular agents.moar cosmos1 - nothere's already plenty in high sec.2 - yesthis is definitely a must just to keep things balanced.3 - yesi like the idea but it should be limited to 2 constellations. have the drone mind cosmos agent refer players to it after completing it's mission.4 - yesjust to keep balance, the pirate cosmos constellations should only have half as many agents as the main factions.5 - yesinstead of having super high standings to access, players need to first complete all the missions for all the cosmos agents within that faction. 6 - noone for each faction is enough. don't need to put even more stress on the server. 7 - yeslol, this is a great idea. make it only available to players doing cosmos mission. agent x offers players mission to find his friend lost in a recurring w-system in a certain area. the agent inside offers a 3 or 4-part mission with the last mission to find a way out. the entrance/exit would open and close at random times. players could end up being stuck in it for days. most cosmos missions are already way tougher than regular missions. some are great to call on friends or corp mates to help complete it when needed but since faction standings aren't shared, i think they should still be more of a solo option.i agree, cosmos missions are fun with a great story to them. i have currently completed all level 3 and lower cosmos agents for all the empire factions and i plan on completing all the level 4 cosmos agents in the near future.the storyline modules definitely need a boost. after looking over my answers, it seems i agree with 3/4's of the op so i give this thread a thumbs up."
7/18/2010,"fantastic input demichael. also, i am aware that there is alot in this proposal. i am not asking that all of this be implemented, or at least not all of it in one go. i am pretty passionate about cosmos and its potential content-wise. just trying to start dialog. so if you would like to see cosmos paid attention to in any way, give it the thumbs up!"
7/18/2010,"well, i do. and since i've supported my argument with numbers, and you've just blustered, i wonder who has more credibility at the moment?so would i. but it won't happen until lst cpu use is fixed. or rar pg use is fixed, by a 400% increase."
7/18/2010,"now imagine that fleet where the ravens can fit lsts without filling their lows with co-procs. then it suddenly wouldnt be viable anymore?how can the impossibility to fit lsts on almost all battleships without requiring co-procs not be detrimental to the possibility of fitting a shield rr gang? give them all 8 mids and they will still lack the cpu. your argument just doesnt make any sense. armor rr got more mids to play with, shield rr should get more lows but has to use them on co-procs. fix that and they can do more damage than armor rr gangs so got their role."
7/18/2010,"reading this thread has increased my respect for sokratesz rather dramatically. sensible observations and conclusions, good presentation, and comendable patience in the face of the stubborn opposition."
7/18/2010,"erm, no, it would work just fine under current game mechanics because with ample logistics backup, the battleships don't need to fit rr mods. the only reason people haven't tried it before is probably that they are stuck in the old doctrine of 'armour = superior'.now, we may have hit upon a totally unrelated issue here..maybe rr armour mods on bs are too easy to fit? what if rr mods were meant to be difficult to fit on anything but logistics? what if the proliferation of rr armour gangs without logistics is not 'working as intended' ?"
7/18/2010,"lowering the cpu need, will bring both raven and the scrop to the bs line, and value assets to fleets.they have base two free high slots free to use for that kind of purposes.i can inmagen a rr fleet get warped by 10 rs torp ravens and 2 scrops, if i had faced that i would have bailed."
7/18/2010,"i loled.i can't see a reason why you are not comparing the x-large shield booster to the lar.x-lsb: 550 mw / 230 tflar: 2300 mw / 55 tfthere is even a cross symmetry there (factor of 10's).lst: 192 mw / 154 tflrar: 660 mw / 48 tfthe symmetry is not perfect (factors are 4 and 4.28), but still quite obvious. note that i'm using these numbers to show that both modules belong in the same class, not that they are fine as is.obviously your observation is wrong because your assumption was equivocal. the fitting requirements decrease.i agree with this analysis. note that you should use an apoc instead of a mega for comparison as raven/apoc are the extremes in regards to cpu/pg.i am not generally against the re-balancing of rr modules, but this proposal is sloppy. the premise that lst fitting requirements are the reason you don't see many shield rr fleets, the flawed analysis and imprecise change request. the discrepancy i would definitely like to see changed is to bring the cap use of both in line. then maybe lower the cpu requirements of lsts a bit.i'll consider supporting the proposal if you improve it and after you've done some more research on why shield rr setups (or caldari ships for that matter) aren't used that much. oh, and it's not like shield buffer hacs + shield logi support were being used effectively before the fotm armor hacs came up, right?"
7/18/2010,"/me clapsthis issue is extremely relevant. i have outlined that in my very first post. in fact, i have outlined two possible solution, and making armor rr harder to fit was one of them. i am very glad that in the end we came to the same conclusion, even if it took that long. it had an absolutely opposite effect on me, as i have seen him flipping sides, answers and opinions just to preserve his face, which he has not done very well, and engaging in a large number of unreasonable attacks on various members of the community. and i've told you times and times again, that for you to prove my proposal inadequate i demand your words to be backed up by apropriate numbers, which time and time again you have failed to provide. moreover, grater half of you argument is an irrelevant side discussion regarding logistics ships, midslots and whatnot. those things have little, if anything, to do with the topic of the proposal. i would like to see strong evidence if you are to call my words rubbish. ""i don't know wtf you are talking about"" simply does not cut it. by now, i highly doubt there is any. aineko- i don't think we should be comparing x-large shield boosters, because they have the boosting power and capacitor drain about double that or a large armor repairer, so i think that comparison is not appropriate.the symmetry you show looks convincing, but it is not seen in the fitting capabilities of armor tanking and shield tanking ships, and so is a weak reason. raven does not have 4x more cpu then an apoc to compensate for this fitting symmetry and to let it fit modules that require 4x more cpu. percentage comparison done by gypsio iii is far more appropriate, in my opinion."
7/18/2010,"the higher repping power and cap usage of shield systems has always been a defining characteristic (it's even been mentioned ad nausea by at commentators). what doesn't help is that shield boosters have 4 sizes in the same space where armor has only 3 (s to xl vs. s to l). the naming of the 4 shield transporters sizes is imo more fitting (micro to l) and should also have been used for boosters.ofc not, not all modules show extreme bias towards pg or cpu. one could easily argue that the percentages are irrelevant as long as you can still make good fits regardless. or rather, you'd have to prove that fitting a lst to a certain ship has in general (as in not cherry-picking a case that's supportive of your stance) more negative impact on the setup possibilities than fitting a lrar to a comparable ship.also, you still don't acknowledge that there are other reasons for the popularity (or lack thereof) of shield rr fleets."
7/18/2010,"actually, the numbers to prove how wrong you are, and how little you understand the game in which you play, have been provided time and time again.also sok hasn't changed sides or answers anywhere in the thread, time and time again he's telling you your wrong, and time and time again, you argue, so afaik thats a pretty stable stance, not flip floppy.what is actually happening, is that you are selectively picking and choosing points in the thread to argue against, and ignoring anything that flies directly in the face of your position, in essence, you are not arguing, but going ""lalalalalalalalalalallalaimalwaysrightlalalalalallaa"" so nobody really cares anymore.you simply don't understand pvp, or ship fitting, and theres nothing but time, and hope, that can fix that.tl;dr: your still dumb, and fitting has little if nothing to do with the lack of shield rr gangs in eve."
7/18/2010,"i don't really understand why a need is felt for shields to be on the same footing as armour or vise versa. they are different aspects of a ships health, but they are different, and should have different causes and effects and requirements. can some one point out where he explained why shields and armour should be treated in a similar manner. he claims to have done so, but i cant find it. and given that it's an assumed premise upon which his whole proposal rests on i would think it would feature more predominantly in this thread (you know, rather then being completely nonexistent).also please don't confuse ""how"" with ""why"". it baffles me that anyone could confuse the two in the first place, but it seems to occur frequently enough."
7/18/2010,total support. it's not fair to ignore your current player base at the expense of expansion that most pvper (and i dare say a fair few bears as well) don't even care about. we want a pvp/stability fix!!!!!!
7/18/2010,just wanted to say that the rework on level 4 and level 5 agents sending pve players into low sec systems should be considered an upgrade for pvp players.
7/18/2010,"let's take a look at what they actualy said:""once incarna and dust are fully implemented, focus will probably shift far more towards improvement""""fully implemented"", basicly they can keep claiming it's still not fully implemented as long as they want.""probably"", that's right, it's not even a sure thing. more of a 'maybe'.and at last: ""far more"". well, if you do jack **** about it now doubling your efforts is ""far more"" but still crap :d"

7/18/2010,"hello fellow members of the eve community, i am proposing a new module idea that i think will benefit players of all types. module name: gravity field generatorslot: highfitting:cpu-35powergrid-8attributes:volume-13.5 m3mass-10 kgarea of effect-5000mactivation cost-25gjstructure-50ehpvelocity modifier-500m/sactivation/duration-10/sdescription: by manipulating gravity fields around the host ship, cargo and wreck may be pulled into a closer range. max limit of 20 wrecks at once.prerequisites: graviton physics level 1detail on module: may only effect wrecks and cargo containers, the module is active and may be turned on or off at any time by the user. will continue to pull object in until module is turned off.why i think this module will help: salvage and loot will be easier to gather before mass salvaging, which will save players time when attemtping to allocate mass amounts of cargo and/or wreck. i do not believe this will make tractor beams obsolete because they will be useful when a wreck or container is out of reach, while running the gravity field generator. i also believe this will make salvaging and looting more fun, which is what this game is all about [the fun part] [ :"
7/18/2010,"meh, not supported. in it's current form, i don't think it would be useful.however, a scaled (small, medium, large) version, with 10km range, which pulled all ships and such would be fun. larger the ship, less the pull. would be another interesting use anti-frigate work."
7/18/2010,"how could you generate a gravity well that only effects specific structures/objects. gravity acts on mass, and ships have mass the same as cans and wrecks that used to be ships. the proposed module would break the science part of sci-fi.however, a gravity module that effects everything within range, and uses the mass of the objects effected to create the actual effect would be sweet! you could use one on an interceptor to help you orbit a large target faster and closer than you otherwise could. the larger target could launch a jet can, or drones which would get into the field and may actually slow you down or throw you out of orbit. or a larger target could use one combined with a web to pull a smaller target in. perhaps you could script it to be anti-gravity for a push effect as well. this would allow a battleship to push drones out of optimal or a small ship to bounce out of the range of that blaster boat that just landed on top of it.that would be a cool module.you could presumably use the same code to alter the effects of the original tractor beam as well, making it mass based, and allowing it to be used on anything. instead of bouncing, you could tractor people off of station if you had the mass to do it. of course if a cruiser tried to tractor a carrier, the cruiser would be pulled into the carrier.you would also have to make the effect elastic, and it would require ship thrust to be used, and carefully. i'm not a physicist, so i don't know the right words to use, but for instance, the beam could produce a force that will apply a force of max strength of 5000lb (figurative) at a max range of 10km. if ship a, using the beam, is stationary, and target a is stationary, and they are of the same mass, the beam would pull the two together, accelerating both toward each other at a rate corresponding to the relationship of the beam strength and total mass of the pull. if the objects are of differing masses, the smaller of the two would move toward the larger at a proportionately faster rate than the larger would move toward the smaller.if one or both ships applied thrust in one direction or another, it would effect the mass calculations of the ships, and if enough thrust is applied in opposite directions to exceed the strength of beam, the ships would move away from each other, at reduced speeds until the range of the beam was exceeded and both were released from it's hold.having this in game would be good for when they eventually get around to being able to target and destroy specific system on a target ship. you may need to tow your buddy back to station because even though his engines were disabled, he managed to win that fight he was in.but, its not going to happen. your idea breaks immersion in the science element, and mine would require way too much programming and cpu to accomplish on eve. could you imagine someone lighting up the gravity well in the middle of a fleet fight blob, grabbing several hundred ships potentially? worse than that, every ship in the blob lighting one up! ohh, especially the anti-gravity version! :) it would be sweet to see, but the effects would be intensive on clients and servers alike!"
7/18/2010,"how about it being a 'net' which will hold wrecks and cans placed into it with a tractor beam. as long as the 'net' is active, the wrecks and cans wouldn't expire. that would also help make salvaging faster be being able to free up the tractor beam to bring other wrecks and cans into the 'net' which is being pulled along behind the ship."
7/18/2010,in homeworld 2 a gravity well generator prevented capital ships from jumping in within its active range - now that is a mod i could approve of.
7/18/2010,"it's a simple problem, with a simple solution. it is not quite accurate when you have an enemy locked on and your attacking (or repping) them and you can see a vague bar indicating how much shield/armor/hull they have. i propose that we simply have a percentage of how much damage is done. so say (and just to keep it simple) that your target has 800 out of 1000 armor left, so when you hover over their lock on icon, it will tell you the percents (much like it does when you hover over your own) having it set as just percentages will not change the gameplay a tremendous deal, but will provide a bit more accurate reading. my friends and i thought of this as we were sieging a tower, and couldn't figure out how much it had left. so like i said, simple problem and simple solution especially as they already implement this in our own ships functions.343guilty1"
7/18/2010,"agreed, especially for pos bashing. during pos bashing there's a lot of ""are we there yet? how much longer?"" and you reply, ""half a cheeto!"""
7/18/2010,"seems to me, that there shouldn't be a readout at all of how much health your target has. you should have to tell via graphics on the target it's self. knowing exactly, or even relatively how much armor or hull hp's the target has isn't a realistic idea anyhow. the only way you would know is by seeing chunks blown off in the case of armor, or maybe the glow of the shield getting dimmer, but shields don't glow in eve unless they are actively hardened or repping. so why not get rid of the target hp readout all together? it would make pvp so much more risky, stressful, and fun.maybe we could even talk ccp into adding some kind of visual effect on the ship to indicate relative status. like increasing amounts of blue sparks as the shields come down, visual blackening, denting, and blowing off of armor plates (most ships have what appear to be primary armor plates anyhow), and we already have the increasing burning effect as hull goes down.this idea will never happen. but i certainly don't thing there is any need or justification for having more detail on the little bars below your targets."
7/18/2010,lol the exact opposite of the direction i had intended but ccp can't and won't do graphics like that because it would cause a stupid amount of lag (moreso than there already is) and it's a game not real life so we have sensors to detect their health
7/18/2010,why bother when anyone with atleast 2 brain cells can do the same thing without all the fandangled paperwork?
7/18/2010,"great idea, but you must also understand that the iso-standards are not a magic portal to awesomeness, here is why:the iso-standard stickers are just there because everyone has that pile of maps getting dust in their cabinets, nothing more to see there. been in a quite few corporations which have so oh-ever-wonderful-fixes-everything iso-standards and gotta say, while they work in some levels they usually add pain and misery to some more creative (in this case probably would be game design / implementation) areas of work.and even those would be there it doesn't help if people do not commit to follow blindly those 'standards' which ofcourse are made by a person who wanted some profit for oneself.also been in one project lead/management and logistics standardization process a long long time ago, which gotta say was pretty neat and would have worked if the marketing / sales department would have adopted it first, pretty much went down hill when the tech side adopted it and then the sales started calling us with pretty imaginative words for not accepting some random paper as 'a project' and oh lord, stay the heck away from itil if you want working it-environment that actually works. itil prolly works when you got it-network around 20 countries with 20 000+ workers who do have some clue what to do, but in the end the management fails.instead of itil hire a few bored it-artists (db/network/system) and appreciate their works of art, not by money (well, dependant of the person), but imagine that if everything *works* smoothly some extra free time and be open for ideas instead of asking your friends right-out-of-school-mba freshman how the awesomeness in the it work and then forcing people who actually knows the stuff to be a mindless slave and then blame on them for the managements bad choices and what comes to 27001, well, it describes nicely what could be done, however, you need to do compromises (as people are not robots - they need food, drink and cigarettes - some are bold enough to demand love and affection) in the way or otherwise you'd be employing 1 actual worker and rest of the people in the company would be 'security guards' and then only thing you hear here is 'every step you take, every move you make, i'll be watching you' if going by the standard as you cannot trust anyone, probably should lock the corporation's board of management in the cellar too as they might have too much power at their disposal.what comes to network security, there are some much flexible ways to implement the 'best practices' in it-security by allocating services across your network while applying nice and thight security policies in the access which does not hinder the actual work, where some have fallen into the darkest pit where anything you'd need to do actual work is either denied, classified or both which is.. in my opinion pretty dumb.more bureaucracy you bring into work, well, take a good look at goverment offices, sounds neato, huh?"
7/18/2010,"trust me, i do know that. i work in a fortune 500 company with 250k+ employees, i can see the standards failing (and also failing to fix what many people would expect them to) every single day... yes, that is what happens if you hire a bunch of dumbos... iso standards don't guarantee any form of quality in the output, as we probably both know. in my experience, itil only starts to fail (and it fails hard if this happens) when people are employed that have no formal itil training (and aren't given any either, due to cost 'savings'), but are expected to work within the standard. this mostly applies to help/service desk and 1st/2nd line employees. i agree, right-out-of-school-mba freshmen are the worst, but luckily that doesn't seem to be the case with ccp, otherwise we'd see a lot more paid-for services already. also, considering the fact that eve runs one of the biggest clusters on this planet, if the it experts massively disagree, their leverage is too high for them to be forced to do anything. they can't be replaced, because if you try, the cluster goes down before you have a suitable replacement. now as a counter example: if ccp would be using something even close to itil, they'd probably have tracked down a few more causes for the lag by now (i think anyone who works in it knows that there can't be a single cause for the lag by now.), by iterating over recent rfcs and monitoring-incident trends. (of course, ccp most definitely already has a solid monitoring infrastructure by now, otherwise the size of their cluster would be impossible to maintane.)well, i can't disagree there, but it gives you a good guideline, at least. (cont.)"
7/18/2010,"trust me, i know that feeling, recently at work i had to get 3 separate approvals for 3 different things to be allowed to connect to a server, but i do not believe this would happen with ccp as they don't have enough people for it to be worth it to implement such drastic measures. however, the 'threat' of such over-bureaucracy does not warrant not trying to be as secure as is reasonably possible. i am painfully aware of parkinson's law, no need to tell me. i can of course see how all of this could very much go very wrong, so your criticism is excellent in regards to pointing that out, thank you."
7/18/2010,"this. standardization isn't the issue, an active neglect for spending effort on fixing the problems with the game is. iso1234567890001 won't fix that."
7/18/2010,"current situation: notifications are generated automatically, and every player gets all notifications they could possibly get, with no option to turn them off. proposed change: add a settings window for notifications somewhere(in mail settings, its own window, whatever), where we can choose which notifications we get and have the others not how up at all. perhaps add a ""daily digest"" mode(similar to most discussion groups) as a third option, for people who want to see the notifications but not get spammed incessantly. one additional point would be nice to work in at the same time. fuelmails should get an ""x hours remaining"" stat added, and there should be individual checkboxes for each hour. that way, if i want to get mails hourly, i can, but if i want to drop it to say 24h and 6h only to lower spam, i can do that too(obviously, this should have ""toggle all"" functionality, for easy switching). benefits: less clutter and trash in the ui window, especially for directors of larger corporations. god forbid, they may even be able to use their mailbox properly. drawbacks: nil."

7/18/2010,"i certainly support, but do you think ccp has the resources to do such a thing?..."
7/18/2010,"snarky answer: of course they do, in 18 months, assuming nothing shiny comes into their field of view between now than then. serious answer: ccp has just said that all the major slots in expansions are filled, it said nothing about minor stuff being full, and this is pretty clearly in the realm of ""minor stuff"". if they wanted to, this could be put in pretty quickly, and every major patch has perhaps half a dozen fixes this size. i doubt that this is at the top of the priority list, but yes, they have the resources to do it pretty easily, assuming no unforeseen technical bs."

7/18/2010,"when you pin a window in the ui, you have to go into general settings, and check the ""lock windows when pinned"" option to get them to actually not move. i think it would also be a good idea just to have a simple dialogue box appear when you pin a ui option, with the option to disable it from appearing again.i know you guys in the csm already covered ui changes in general last meeting, but maybe you could fold this into the portfolio of changes you planned to make? it's silly to enable pinning without giving the user the idea of how to accomplish its purpose, not getting windows to collapse or move."
7/18/2010,"every time i log in, my chat stacks reset themselves to some stupid order that i don't want, and i usually leave them pinned, and what i really enjoy is when i try to unpin them and drag the windows in the stack into their proper order, but whatever i drag out seems to think it's still pinned so it won't re-stack.so i strongly support getting fixes within the next 2 years, derp."
7/18/2010,i like your idea and would like to add a few of mine to refine it some. first off ccp should remove the current learning skills in game and refund any skill points spent training them. you attributes however should stay the same so if you trained 4/4 or 5/5 or whatever you still have the same attributes. if you are a vet that already trained the skills then this proposal won't affect you. if you are in the midst of training the skills however this will help you out a lot.the next thing that needs done is for ccp to add 6 new skills to the game dealing with learning. these however can't be directly trained like normal skills. they would gain points simultaneously as you train other skills. one skill for each attribute and one skill for learning. each skill would grant a +2 bonus to its attribute per level so the benefit is the same. now as you train a skill in game you earn sps in that skill plus you will earn the same amount of sps in the corresponding primary and secondary attributes. i would make these new learning skills have a high enough rank so it takes about the same amount of sps to get them to level 5 as it does now to get 1 attribute basic and advanced to level 5.so for example you are training engineering to level 5 and are earning 1500 sp/hr. at the same time you will get 1000 sp/hr in intelligence learning and 500 sp/hr in memory learning. (numbers are made up just to illustrate the example) i feel that this system will limit min/max gameplay somewhat in that you get no real benefit to training all int/mem skills in a row or bouncing between skills. you reach the same attributes after the same amount of skill points anyway.*edit* i'm not sure how the skill that gives 10% boost overall (aka learning) should work. how should you get sps for that skill?
7/18/2010,addressed this in the post right above yours. will edit the op.ex. velocity makes rockets broken. the other issues just make them underpowered.
7/18/2010,"excellent idea, i've been wanting to use my vengeance assault ship. it's too shiny to be so useless"
7/18/2010,"with all due respect this is a naive statement, it shows at the very least that you haven't made any attempt to understand the missile formula or read the correct rocket explosion speed thread in the test server feedback forum.the biggest problem is drf (damage reduction factor), it's a constant in the missile formula which determines how steeply damage is reduced by the velocity of the target. thankfully ccp seem to understand that simply increasing the ev (explosion velocity) would be a bad idea:once ccp get round to fixing rockets they won't touch them again for a long time so the fix needs to be right first time, to bring rockets in line with torps you'd be looking at something like this:drf = 1.5ev = 100er = 20damage = + 65%clip size = +200%note that the most significant changes are to the drf, damage and clip size, the base ev only needs a small increase in this scenario.fixing rockets is not as simple as giving a 100% increase in ev, which would leave us with poor damage and we'd still need a web to hit ab jaguars, let alone ceptors or dramiels. the issue has been discussed to death for the last 18 months, we know what needs changed and are just waiting for ccp to pull their finger out and do it."
7/18/2010,"this topic was passed by the csm over a year ago, the most recent word from ccp is this quote from the correct rocket explosion speed thread in the test server feedback forum.if you wish to support this topic please do so in the existing thread that was passed by the csm.it's nice to see this enthusiasm for fixing rockets but lets keep to a single thread rather than having many small threads scattered about the place"
7/18/2010,"i number of variations of this proposal have been suggested by other players in various other threads. my major reason for posting this is that while i agree learning skills need to be addressed, i don't agree that everyone should just be awarded 10 points in each attribute and a 10% skill bonus.proposalreplace learning skills with a sort of attribute acquisition system. players then gain additional attributes based on how many skillpoints they have trained in a given attribute. a skill's primary attribute would be used in determining which attribute to increase. secondary attributes of skills could also increase as long as it's twice as slow as the primary one, though i don't really care if they are. each attribute would cap at 10. the bonus from the learning skill itself could be acquired at an even slower rate than the attributes from simply training any skill. the exact point at which additional attribute points would be awarded could(and should) be adjusted to scale with the approximate payoff times of the current learning skills. this obviously involves a lot of number crunching.implementation of this proposal would fix the pointless tedium that is learning skills without ""giving"" newer players the same attributes as veterans. it would also prevent the massive buff to alt training times which would occur if every character were simply given attributes.-cybernetics would stay the same-remaps would stay the same-the noob training bonus would stay the same-all skillpoints for trained learning skills would be redistributed in the same way they were a few weeks ago.why it's necessarywhile training learning skills isn't technically necessary to play the game, it's necessary for anyone wishing to have competitive and efficient training times. a player who gets a 4/4/4 setup in the attributes of the skills he's training will shave days off the same plan that a player who doesn't train the learning skills will. a person who trains learning skills is literally able to train more skills to level 5 over the course of a year than someone who doesn't."
7/18/2010,"looks like a half-assed, ninja'ed version of ""learning skills replaced with focused training"".it may be my fault, but i couldn't exactly understand what you mean. you want to revamp the attributes system too? o.o"
7/18/2010,"breaking news, eve is broken! apparently ""polish"" is too much to ask for. start canceling your accounts because that's the only feedback they listen to"
7/18/2010,according to ccp zulu(park)'s dev blog ccp are including incarna teams when talking about the number of dev's working on eve. thus if incarna is eve then the csm would in theory have the same input as they do with flying in space (i'll leave that open for a joke about the csm having no real input ).
7/18/2010,"well, the influence of the csm seems to be quite limited... better than no influence at all though and i apreciate the hours you guys put in."

7/18/2010,"thanks for doing such a great job representing our point of view to the developers, and owners of the company. they seem to be focused on other things right now, but i still have hope that there heart is in the right place."
7/18/2010,"being in the business i tend to cut ccp a bit more slack than i think the average customer would, but that was my impression as well. from the outside they appear to simply be doing waterfall with different meeting and reporting requirements.""could we have <small change x>?"" ""no...the right answer is to completely rewrite it and that would take too long."" that's a pretty classic anti-pattern that you don't typically see from shops that have internalized agile.i am not in the gaming industry, but i am a saas veteran and it seems to me that ccp would benefit from smaller more frequent releases, among other agile principles.i suspect part of the problem is economics. they get huge bumps on expansion releases and relatively good retention numbers (despite the bugs eve is a great product).this is all speculation on my part of course. our csm delegates could probably comment with more authority having actually met and interacted with several of the principals."
7/18/2010,edit: posting fail.
7/18/2010,"ccp used to do ""waterfall""and yes ""we'd rather overhaul the entire thing rather than make these changes"" is a pretty common response by ccp to csm issues for broken stuff such as poses and evemaili am not really a management sort of person and don't really know all that fancy lingo, but those are my observations. also i think that overhauling response could be due to the original writers of the system leaving ccp and everyone else being afraid to touch their code. it's no secret that their pay isn't the best and i wouldn't be surprised if their more talented programmers get headhunted."

7/18/2010,"let's assume ccp set up a cluster with one blade (or one cpu core) dedicated to a single system. it is not a good approach for the highly uneven load distribution in eve:a) it would be a waste of resources, as most systems have little loadb) it would not solve the problem of the performance ceiling on the highly loaded nodesyou might have noted that nowadays cpus improve in the number of cores, not so much the speed of a single core. for eve that's unfortunate, as it can't use multiple cores, the code is not multithreaded (the tasklets they use are good for dealing with asynchronous requests, but not equivalent to os threads).to distribute load among multiple cores or even servers, you need to first break down the load into smaller chunks of work. ideally those chunks would be independent from each other so you don't have the issues issler mentioned. but game code is typically highly ""branchy"" and interactive. on multiprocessor systems those dependencies can be bad enough (keywords: locking, bandwidth, cache coherency), which is one of the reasons smp systems usually do not scale linearly in performance. if you distribute the load among multiple systems, you additionally have to deal with latency, which can break your neck. data that can be accesses in nanoseconds locally takes milliseconds over the network. with thousands of accesses per second this quickly becomes a problem.previous dev blogs on the cluster stated that the db and storage backend are handling the load just fine and are not bottlenecks during fleet fights.indeed, ccp burdened themselves with that issue when they designed eve the way it is. i do believe it was naive, but in that context the fact that the subscriber count did not explode extremely fast is a blessing for ccp."
7/19/2010,"while there are a ton of idea's people would love to have, this is my wish list, and i am sure a lot of pos managers would agree.source"
7/19/2010,"agreedalso, though i'm sure this is getting buried in this threadnaught, if ccp wants to give us something shiny and new, why not crank out the faction battlecruisers? the models already exist. in many cases the skins already exist. it wouldn't be difficult to make fleet issues of the prophecy, ferox, brutix, and cyclone, and pirate faction ships of the harbinger, drake, myrmidon, and hurricane. racial bonuses have pretty much become standardized across the board, so really, the hardest part would be deciding where to put those extra slots.if ccp wants to give us two updates a year, only one should focus on game play changes, the other can tweak existing mechanics and add fun stuff like this for the players."

7/19/2010,"i support killing highsec routes between empires. they are currently at war after all. that would be the one improvement to lowsec that is needed most i think. but to make it less likely that supper camps would be everywhere, more lowsec routes/points of entry would need to be established. of course, lowsec systems could be the new expressways, making some lowsec routes more vauable to control and shorter than others. maybe have some storyline introduced where the serpentis or jovians come in and destroy the highsec supper highways, over a multitude of battles players in which highsec players could benefit by particpating in, and potentially delaying what may become the inevitable? (that would be great fun.) of course, you would have to contest concord in those systems... i think it would be great though if concord could be weakend/cutoff in such live-event contested systems, so pirate players could go after them, while highsec corps go after the pirate factions and player factions supporting the pirates... that would owni don't support more than one currency--at least not entirely. according to the fiction, there is already more than one currency in eve, but pod pilots only trade in isk which is a credit more vaulable than all the other currencies available to the npc's. maybe when dust comes out, they could introduce some type of currency/forex exchange mini-game bewteen dust and eve, for traders to work, but i wouldn't want it to be a compulsive thing everyone in eve has to use.

7/19/2010,"shield and armor are different. but different doesnt mean one should be impossible to fit. why not make extenders and plates different by increasing pg of plates by factor 10. then they are also different, makes you more happy?i guess you also think rockets should be nerfed? since they need to be different. yes that is pretty much what sok is doing. he has given a total of one serious argument, and besides that it has been just troll arguments, trolling and screaming lalalalalla. and that serious argument has been explained why it is a problem, but not the end reason why you couldnt do a shield rr bs gang. even if you would give them all 8 mids, you still cant do a shield rr bs gang since barely any ship can fit lsts without co-procs. explain me, sok just said that a raven + some other gang could be extremely powerful. at the same time he also claims a shield rr gang cant work. so now imagine that same raven + some other gang, but with lsts that can be fitted on ravens without co-procs. then you still got that powerful gang, but now they can spider tank. how would that suddenly become a weaker gang for fitting lsts?"
7/19/2010,"probably gets ignored again by the lalalalllalalal crowd, but an attempt anyway.the argument is that shield transporters with reasonable fitting reqs would still be useless due to lack of mids, right?so what do we have for rr:required low: dciirequired mids: mwd+heavy (/med) cap booster.i think we can agree that required for shield tank are dual invuln + lse. sure a second lse would be nice, but cant have everything. and i think we can also agree the lack of second lse doesnt make it a useless principle.so that fills the mids of our 5 mid bs.next normal fitting for rr bs is the sensor booster. i will take the tempest and hyperion here for comparison. both 5 mids, but hype has larger sig radius.shield version for both gets lse + 3 shield rigs with shield rigging 3. i think that is a nice average, with 4 it would be bit better for armor, but honestly differences are small. armor version gets a sensor booster.now the self lock time of the pests is 7 seconds for shield and 4.7s for armor. the hyperion is 5.8 and 3.8. so what we have is 2.3s slower lock for reps in the tempest case, and 2 seconds slower for the hyperion. is a bit over 2 seconds really a reason why it would fail? can you seriously say that?yes you say? okay then armor rr should be useless. in general meta 4 (or for armor even 3) is uses for rr modules. they got a cycle time of 5 seconds, 4.5 seconds for t2. shield reps in beginning of the cycle, armor in the end: the result, shield rr groups without sensor booster will provide logistics 2.5-3 seconds earlier than a comparable gang of armor rr ships.yes it also means enemies are locked slower. still it is indeed a difference, but again, can you really say that it is that significant? if you really think it is a problem, dont fit that mid slots sebo, but a low slot sig amp. then you are still slower locker, but got more targetting range (can be handy when being damped, not that much though), and more important, you got another 2 locked targets. that should easily compensate for slower locking.also remember having a high scan resolution so you can get quickly reps on your friend is important when you do 40 vs 40. but if you got 4 bs + 2 tacklers and are roaming through low sec you can just prelock all your friendlies anyway, and most likely also all opponents. so here the lower scan resolution is really completely irrelevant.so the next point, eccm. these days amount of ecm is not nearly as much as it used to be, still indeed it exists, and mid slot eccm give more sensor strength and can be overloaded. cant deny here that it is a potential problem, luckily there just isnt that much ecm around anymore.offensive e-war then, minus tackling gear. pretty much never used on rr bs, so skipped.then tackling. simple solution 1: take some hictors with you, they should keep some **** tackled, and can be repped when they drop their bubble. solution 2: not all bs will have 5 mids. maels, ravens and rokhs have spare mids, they can be fitted with points, really not everyone needs a point in a rr bs. so which problems do we have with mids? the lack of eccm is there, and no tackle. only true on 5 mid bs, and while definately doesnt make you happy panda, you can work around it. in return you get loads of low slots that you can use.lets say you want to do some roaming through low sec with shield rr bs. you get a couple of ravens. they can all fit a point if you want. but they cant possibly fit lsts without co-procs. how would a rr raven gang (+some support, hic, huginn, etc) be useless?"
7/19/2010,"what would honestly be so bad about lowering the cpu req. of the lst? all it would mean is that ships fitted for rr shield gangs would get is an extra 100 dps as they would be able to fit that 3rd damage mod. they may also be able to fit the t2 lst too which means better tanking ability.if the cpu lowering proposal were to happen: rr shield gangs will still suffer from (in general) slightly lower buffer, slightly lower sensor strength and the need to use cap transfers to manage their cap. they will have one advantage over armour and that is dps. a gang of 10 rr shield tempests will deal 1000 (total) more dps than a gang of 10 rr armour tempests. the shield fits will also struggle to manage their cap. especially when the armour pests can use the second utility high for a large neut."
7/19/2010,"qft. we get that this is what you believe. now show us the numbers demonstrating the rationale behind this belief. leave logistics aside. leave midslot differences aside. show us how the current cpu needs of a lst is not a limiting factor, when compared to the fitting needs of a lrar."
7/19/2010,"again, sok, we're not talking about logistics cruisers. the topic is rr mods on battleships. this is not a ""totally unrelated issue"", nor is it one that has just been ""hit upon"". i brought it up in my first post in this thread. i am happy with the fitting requirements of lrars and their tactical utility - they can be fit without fitting mods on bs and the distribution of rr ability among a fleet, rather than being isolated within whatever logistics/carrier support, adds diversity and tactical options. i see no justification for the prohibitive cpu requirements of lsts. the absence of shield rr bs gangs damages the diversity of the game, making for predictable and one-dimensional fits and tactics. hac gangs are balanced and viable whether shield-tanked or armour-tanked, because their rr source, logistics cruisers, are balanced, and i see no reason for the disparity on the bs scale.you overstate the medslot problem. i showed that what the five medslot bs lose on ehp is more than made for by far superior damage projection. the effectiveness of received rr is similar. the tackle issue can be handled by the six-medslot bs and by non-ecm scorpions. eccm cannot be regarded as essential, and the need for sensor boosters is mitigated by the delivery of shield at the start of the 4.5 s lst cycle. the option of additional ewar, such as damps or tds, on armour bs can be counted against the much superior dps-at-range of shield bs.sure, the armageddon, apocalypse, abaddon, megathron and typhoon would be difficult to fit into a shield rr bs gang (mwd, large injector, invuln, invuln, dc, extender rigs? still not impossible though, a typical shield mega would have 35% less ehp but do 41% more turret dps with 67% better tracking at 20 km). so what? it's no different to the difficulty of fitting up the maelstrom, scorpion, raven and rokh for armour tanks."
7/19/2010,"sigh you dont get it, do you? shields are and should be different from armor. the fact that you compare rr bs fleets only makes me think that you have absoloutely no idea about med/small fleets.while armor rr is best for large scale bs fleets being saved a gazilion times so far, shield rr is great for med/small fleets. no armor tanked fleet can match the speed and agility of a schimitar-cane-mach nanofited fleet. then again a strong dps-well armor tanked harbringer-guardian fleet(but slow....) . or even a drake-basilisk fleet with a strong tank and that not huge but stable dps. my point is different fittings and ships for different use and desired effect. you want to make shield rr same as armor rr but then... no variaty in pvp... not as many overal uses. simple as that btw changing modules fittings requirements will either ***k up all logi pilots (including myself) because now modules need more pg-cpu or the shield rr now has lower pg-cpu requirements and all scimitar-basilisk pilots get a huge boost by fitting better tank other modules they could not fit :/"
7/19/2010,"no. you have this completely wrong. the objective is for shields and armour not to be ""different"", it is for them to be ""different but balanced"". i suggest that you read up on armour-hac gangs. rr bs being armour only = no variety.it's been said a million times that the logistics cruisers' bonuses and fittings would be tweaked to maintain their balanced status quo."
7/19/2010,"reduce the cpu cost of shield remote reps by 20-30% of so, i think that would make it more viable, without breaking stuff. (obviously the logistics bonuses would need to be reduced to compensate for this, so it remains the same across the board)."
7/19/2010,"how is only armor bs spider tanks variaty? you got an interesting definition of variaty there, most people would think that more viable but completely different fittings would be more variaty, you apparently think that only a handful of possible fittings is variaty.one thing is certain here, you do not fly shield logistics cruisers. if you did you would know there isnt any viable fitting where cpu is an issue. so even though it has been mentioned hunderd times now that logistics cruisers simply could have there cpu lowered, even if that didnt happen they wouldnt be boosted in any way since they dont lack cpu now. it doesnt matter if you got 50 or 200 spare cpu. if armor pg reqs would be increased than the bonus of the armor logi cruisers could simply be adapted, so that is also a bs argument. now i think about it, if you would want to adapt shield logis for some reason, just lower their cpu role bonus so they use exactly same amount of cpu on logis when the transporter usage is decreased.but you are obviously part of the lalallalala crowd, since we explained this several times now and every time you just flat out ignore it and a while later you come again with a post that it would make shield logis op and that more different possible fittings is bad for variaty."
7/19/2010,la-lalah crowd is obviously not reading. they brought up logi cruiser argument on the first page.they still keep bringing it up on the 4th page.because a personal insult is the best way to win an argument.

7/19/2010,"ok we understand that there are many many threads about lack of ccps focus on delivering decent upgrades as of late, or the lack of continual development and support.i do feel there is this 'its a free upgrade so stop whining' attitude, correct - but doesnt make it right tho does it..the problem is people actually like the additions but they are so weak, and buggy and shallow that people almost crying out for them to be upgraded. ccp seem to be more interested in bringing in more players rather than looking after their existing ones. trouble is new players see the problems and leave, we know there hasnt been a significant change in ppl online for a few years, despite some of the big 'upgrades' so im not longer rambling..look im sure that alot of people would be happy to pay a one off payment for upgrades if they where substantial and supported fully and constantly developed, the revenue could pay for a team to work on enhancing existing content and bug fixes. its a little annoying as ccp must be make millions per month in subs, but however....i mean alot of mmos do it, yes if ppl dont upgrade theres the different instance problem as they could no longer play, and ccp still insist on having a single world which is fine, and there may a point where ppl say im not paying for upgrades (small i think) but i think the benefits probably outweigh the risks.the problem will be if ccp dont commit to enhancing and fixing if we did pay for upgrades. i dont want to talk about wow but blizzard have got it right, they listen and they create some outstanding updates, you cant deny that, and this isnt about wow the games its about business intelligence.anyway these are my thoughts and ideas.."

7/19/2010,"so, we've got a shield warning, armor warning, and hull warning... but when a curse rolls around, it would be nice to have a capacitor warning too.while we're at it, perhaps make it a bit easier to see when people are targeting you? an additional filter for the overview settings could be added to include a pilot that has you locked. this could even help you know if you've lost friendly rr support, as you'd see that your friendly has lost his lock, even if you're playing without brackets, zoomed out, whatever.lastly, some slightly larger, easier to read incoming ewar indicators would be nice. okay, i have ""miscellaneous"" affecting me... but what is that? although, ensuring locking targets are on overview would help this even in it's current small icon form.tear it apart."
7/19/2010,on the whole good ideas.
7/19/2010,"yeah good ideas, especially the ones about locking, but this thread is in the wrong forum. perhaps a friendly neighborhood mod would move it to the assembly hall?"
7/19/2010,"sure. i also proposed a drone aggro warning (your drones getting damaged) a while ago, but people went meh. why don't you start a thread in ah for more audio warning options so we can support it?"
7/19/2010,i assume that ccp soundwave was referring to issues that have been done or are being worked on for inclusion in the winter expansion. csm doesn't have a clue which ones those are. i asked what those were later in that thread but there has been no response to my question either in the thread or privately. draw your own conclusions from that.
7/19/2010,asking the eve community to draw their own conclusions based on limited information is like asking a dog to lick its own balls.
7/19/2010,and expecting those conclusions to be correct is like asking a human to lick its own elbow.
7/19/2010,please visit your user settings to re-enable images.lol sorry. couldn't help it.
7/19/2010,i know somebody who can do that
7/19/2010,"thanks, that's perfect. i'll edit my google moderator link above to point to your ideascale link."
7/19/2010,typically if i log in on a sunday evening i would expect in excess of 50 000 players online. this sunday there was only 38000 when i logged in. now i didn't look to see what the peak was that day but i noticed that eve was a little quiet. has anyone else noticed the same?
7/20/2010,yes/signed
7/20/2010,"have i supported this topic yet? posting in case i haven't.top two priority items for me, personally:1) anchor+online queue -- also disassemble queue would be sweet. sitting around for 2-3 hours is punitive.2) alliance-level lab access for copy and invent jobs -- i'd use this a lot. or even the ability to rent out lab slots to the general public, while i'm wishing.fuel pellets would be nice, too, though it sort of begs the question of why poses have a dozen different types of things that they consume in the first place. is this supposed to be fun? is annoyance a key balancing aspect? anyway, we have an app that calculates the precise amount of each kind of fuel for a given pos that maximizes uptime per fuel bay space, which is effectively the same thing (just more annoying).relatedly, i think ice should produce less stront on refine, since so much less of it is being used these days. krystallos used to be pretty valuable/important, and now it's just more old crap that doesn't really make sense to bother with, much like mining unless you're a macro/botter."
7/20/2010,mmmm..... how can a good idea get more visibility? is the idea not as good as i think?
7/20/2010,wonderful idea. i agree: the tactical overlay needs some serious updating.+1
7/20/2010,"great idea. you could additionally color code the line based on speed, if you like, with perhaps 3-5 possibilities - red (above 3,000) orange (2-3,000) yellow (1-2,000), blue (500-1000) or black (0-500).or whatever. just the idea of having rough speed communicated by color coding for instantaneous recognition (recognizing line lengths where the line can be in any direction on a sphere would be difficult)."
7/20/2010,"as a programmer, it makes my teeth grind when i see people blithely say, ""this would be an easy fix"". whether the fix is easy or not, i definitely support this idea!"
7/20/2010,sounds like a good idea
7/20/2010,"opposite to this, i would remove concorde from the game. sorry."
7/20/2010,cmon ccp pi blows and you know it. just look at the price of robotics now. +1
7/20/2010,this still deserves to be on top.
7/20/2010,"100% supported.i will say, though, that i think ccp's reasoning is that they want to get other features, that they seem to have their hearts set on, into eve, and then work on what they perceive to be minor problems. their style is that of an artist--roughly sketch in the main parts of the drawing. then after you get the whole layout, you go back in for fine detail. the problem with this particular philosophy is that we are interacting with and existing, albeit virtually, within this world. there needs to be a much higher level of polish to be comfortably habitable by eve's citizens/patrons."
7/20/2010,"supported, but ccp has pretty much proven the csm is irrelevant to their development process. i fear that only if they start getting a lot of bad press, or subscriptions drop substantially will they finally start to ""get it"". you keep using that word. i do not think it means what you think it means."
7/20/2010,make this game great again!
7/20/2010,if it needs a radical change in the way ccp is planning their next 18 months then so be it. i think the player base is fed up with half-finished expansions that never get touched after release. ccp need to seriously consider allocating ongoing significant developer resources to finishing content to an excellent standard.supported.
7/20/2010,seriously.
7/20/2010,i'm really glad that this topic has been addressed!! full support here!
7/20/2010,"the bugs and other issues need to be worked out of the existing game before ccp introduces new bugs . . . er, ""content"" . . ."
7/20/2010,"and put some actual resources into the current game, why don't ya!"
7/20/2010,front page news: blasters snafu
7/20/2010,just a few of these improvements would be a joy.
7/20/2010,supporting this for something getting pushed into the backlog. nothing of priority.
7/20/2010,"when setting up the contract from assets window and it comes to your list of stuff to tick for inclusion, unclick the 40m^3 pile, r click and split stack, then tick the new pile of your required size.hth.also supported"
7/20/2010,good thinking batman.would love the contract filter options :)
7/20/2010,please make it worthwhile for me to do the rp stuff. i use to do the plexes just to farm tags but that got old in a hurry. now i just shoot people and farm lvl 4's to pay for all the ships that blow up from the former (and dumb mistakes in my sb).
7/20/2010,fw is overdue for improvements. incarna can afford to be vaporware for another six months while ccp tries to fix fw.
7/20/2010,"this seems to be the only way a faction can win factional warfare -- the other team quits.stop this madness, ccp.i once hugged your executives in iceland! due me a favor in return :)"

7/20/2010,supported
7/20/2010,supported. it's silly that this is even an issue.
7/20/2010,"i would also like this fixed since i scan on daily basis. it is very irritating, and a fix doesn't seem so hard."
7/20/2010,i just want to see what implants people really have :p
7/20/2010,look here.
7/20/2010,it seems the evelopedia forgot to mention the most important effect this will have. in order to stroke that all important epeen people will start trying to get more pods than ships. (pods will often be worth more than the ships) this shift from concern about killing ships to killing pods will hurt new players who need to have implants in order to try to get decent skills. so new players should not only avoid pvp due to lack of skills but they will suffer larger economic loses in pvp than older players. i think this is one of the many reasons why this proposal is voted down by the players in assembly hall - at least every time i saw it players rejected the idea. it seems a csm (who are mostly veteran players) had a thread they thought supported this idea - although the evelopedia doesn't give a link.
7/20/2010,"what is the game you are playing?op: supported, this will give us better idea of the damage caused to the enemy. another rifter down? meh, whatever. but look, the dude had 1 bil of pirate implants in his head!"
7/20/2010,"i'm playing eve.and your response on this, shows what i predict will likely occur. you will find many many more pods killed with attribute implants than with pirate implants."
7/20/2010,"supported...but i'd just like to confirm that this change will not make me want to kill pods more than ships. that argument is entirely incoherent. you need to kill the ships to get the pods, and why on earth wouldn't you want to kill pods regardless of implant disclosure?kill them all."
7/20/2010,"actually you can kill pods before *all* the enemy ships are killed. right now you would be best served by killing all the enemy ships before you start switching to pods. however, if implants are shown its much more likely that you would try to target pods before you target the next ship."
7/20/2010,"only result is more e-peen + pirates dishonoring ransoms even more often -> less victims go to low sec -> pirates go whining for easier targets -> not in the mood for that, so against.on similar note, remove killmails."
7/20/2010,i spy with my little eye... a concordokken-escape exploit. oh the tears that shalt flow from this one.<.< forum timer for the fail
7/20/2010,this
7/20/2010,makes sense.
7/20/2010,"boma, i did give it a thumbs up. since i enjoy and do a lot of cosmos missions, i'll bump this up."
7/20/2010,supported.also at the general lack of reading comprehension in this thread.
7/20/2010,"that is your opinion, and easily made a spectacle of. 'ghost' was a complete failure, never took off and soaked up a ridiculous amount of revenue that could have gone into other projects.wow itself is mind-bogglingly stale, with the same models released years ago still being recycled and reskinned and many of the encounters little more than remixes or tiny revisions to old ones. it succeeds in spite of itself. their business practices are dubious, scalping players for more money by selling cosmetic features like mounts, or minor services like server changes for double what a month of playtime is worth.ccp is the very model of good game development ethics, and while you will likely not find all of their work appealing what they are doing is excellent. on a final note, this 'incarna' project everyone complains about as a waste of development is very much going to improve eve, bring a fresh wave of players and raise the bar in the industry for character rendering.the lack of a 'human' avatar is the most complained about feature for eve by potential players. it's in every other review by game journalists interested in what this game is about. if that is any indication of the impact that this feature will have to new or potential players, this will cause an explosion of growth in the game. most of whom will increase ccp's ability to staff an even larger development team by contributing their subscriptions. it's a short term pain for a long term pleasure. be patient, it's not your favorite feature's turn for touch up just yet, but that doesn't mean it won't come. now is the time to establish what things you want so that when it is time you get something you like from it."
7/20/2010,"i don't care about vampires and console games.i'm annoyed that the game i'm paying $240 a year for is being cannibalized to develop them.if they want to develop new titles, why don't they raise money in capital markets or sign a deal with a publisher like every other studio? if they want to plow the (healthy) profits from a well-maintained eve into other ventures, that's their business.however, i object when they cut support of eve below maintenance levels to boost their investment in other titles, and i'll vote with my pocketbook."
7/20/2010,"everyone knows and loves overloading.how about 3 new modules; low, mid, highthe module when activated consumes water(ice product) and will negate heat to an extent.for example if i have a crow with 3 launchers overloaded; 4th highslot goes to the watercooled heatsink module.i might get 2mins or so without watercooled. with watercooled i might be able to keep going indefinitely if the the water supply is available. crows can often have lots of room in their cargo.similarly i might be in a megathron with 7 neutrons. without water i might get 2mins. with water i could overload for much longer. except my cargo is full of cap boosters and ammo. i have to give up cap boosters in order to bring water along.give and take."
7/20/2010,"i would suspect ice products might be too bulky.also the idea of using a cargo product is great if your amarr, not so great if your one of the other races and also have to find space for ammo.what i would prefer is a some kind of heat sink (thermal dump) rig module and the ability to link specific modules to it.link to many items to it and you risk destroying it when overloading.if you also wish to use a fuel mechanic for it then i would look at using ""coolant"" pre-loaded in station (or off carriers) to extend its life in the field."
7/20/2010,"witcheri think you misspelled ""ccp"". in your title you ask us to support ""cpp"". but then again maybe you intended to ask us to support ""opp"" and mispelled that. if thats the case, i do give that my full support."
7/20/2010,no.
7/20/2010,"you can say it's being lazy that i want to be able to effectively and efficiently control and program my drones to do what i want them to do, but that's what they are: automated robots. what's wrong with setting them up to have greater functionality and less stress? they're already the most vulnerable weapon type in eve, what's wrong with at least making them do what you want them to do while they're there? would it create more lag? possibly. but so does somebody spamming whatever hotkey they're using to get the drones to engage the correct target, which can avoided using this method. and did i mention less stress? what's wrong with being able to enjoy the game that much more?anyway, the idea gets my full support mainly because the more options there are to counter falcons and other ewar ships, the better"
7/20/2010,"i have been pondering over this for about 4 months now and i believe i have figured something out. at the moment we are unable to create implants, simple find them or buy them. i am proposing a system that would allow us the ability to build them much in the same way we build rigs from ship salvage. imagine being able to scoop a corpse with +5's, docking, and using an in-station module/service to reprocess the corpse for biomass material and implant salvage that could be used to create more implants. if the corpse has no implants you could still get biomass from it and use it to create something else or sell it to the npc's for use in making clones!!!!!i am telling you people this would be genius, we would be bringing in a whole new area of market. bpo for implants and implant salvage plus all the other things like biomass and npc buy orders for them etc. just give me some feedback and let me know if ya'll approve!!!!"
7/20/2010,i like it.
7/20/2010,i think that this would bring a hole new world to eve. if you like this support it !!!!!
7/20/2010,"while the idea is intriguing, i see some major problems with it. first off it would bring about the ganking of pods even in highsec.there would be few if any ransoms and every pod would be destroyed for the salvage.players would use alts to destroy their own alts just for the biomass.not supported."
7/20/2010,"1. there is already high sec ganking for high value items, pods are no different.2. ransom lol3. you can already use your alts to destroy your alt ships for salvage but (unless you are stupid) for cheap ships only, why would you stick imps in an alt pod and destroy it? the same principle applies.supported!"
7/20/2010,enthusiastically supported.people laughed when i said i was collecting corpses... they thought i was creepy and steered clear of me... who's laughing now?!? muahahahahahaha...
7/20/2010,"so you need people podded with implants in to be able to create implants? so to make more someone first needs to lose implants. that would be a bad mechanic imo.not to mention i am against it to protect pirates against themselves, would only decrease the amount of targets they have further."
7/20/2010,title says it all. add an option to align to bookmarks. its a must for fleet combat in wh and is the logical thing to do.
7/20/2010,add an eve time clock to the login screen!!!
7/20/2010,why ?
7/20/2010,so i dont have to log in to c wat the eve time is
7/20/2010,"there are already half a dozen ways you can check what time it is in eve without asking ccp to divert a team of people to waste time working on a clock.because that's what they'll do you know, and we won't see any expansions any more.. and eve will die!"
7/20/2010,this is possibly the best proposal ever (and extremely useful).support 100%.-t'amber
7/20/2010,"nothing against americans, but may i do the guess you are one? who else would need to login to find out the current eve time.for those unable to calculate themselves their local time to utc:"
7/20/2010,"this is ont of the most goddamn simple an usefull proposal around, after moving the goddamn trash it button! do it!"
7/20/2010,"i gladly sacryfice this in exchange for some new ships in eve,infact i would gladly sacryfice it for nothing in return."
7/20/2010,"try c6 w-space ""dungeons"" when you can survive then come back if you are not satisfied."
7/20/2010,"lf raid hogger, 12 gearscore"
7/20/2010,"anomalies aka know by ccp as dungeons. since half of the designers dont play eve, (it looks like that orelse they would have fixed alot of issues allready) i call it dungeons so they get what i mean...8/10 and 10/10 (sansha) are boring and a comlete waste of time. im talking about double or triple sanctum spawns. pve on pvp communication & play style. so u actualy have to interact instead of farming sanctums all day. in return people get more entertained by the 18/25 bs spawns and the killfrenzy."
7/20/2010,only if this new type includes about 20 scrambling frigates so your still there in your carrier when i try to kill you.
7/20/2010,"i dont know if the specific text of the mail falls under the nda or not. regardless, it didnt really say anything special, just that i'm a member of the csm now. it didnt even give me superpowers or anything."
7/20/2010,"that doesn't tend to get any attention....darius tried that many times to no avail. try throwing a spoon at somebody, i hear that carries some weight in the csm.seriously, though, change the records to show mazz in 9th place and ankh with strikethrough script. give her the medal (i'm sure ankh would agree with me there), and the csm delegate badge."
7/20/2010,the csm is really just an internet spaceship fraternity.let the hazing begin!!!! (just don't let sok paddle you...)
7/20/2010,"hurrah for csm slap fight! =)supported because, griefing is fun =d"
7/20/2010,"the title say ""don't give"" so you are supporting giving the badge to mazz or not? seeing that mazz was nominated she has the right to badge et all.i don't like her positions about eve but as she has the role she should have all the perks and responsibilities."
7/20/2010,supporting this to show csm ignores this forum and promotes personal agenda when mazz gets her csm ticker anyway.
7/20/2010,i follow a very strict motto - support everything and ask about the details later.
7/20/2010,"hello, i come after having suffered the dire circustances of logging out in space. my hulk which i saved up for forever to be able to buy and fly was destroyed due to my own ignorance of not knowing a pretty important aspect of the game before i could even use it to earn enough to insure it. i am not some ""newb"" and have been playing the game for a great while, though did not know that logging off while not in combat isn't really removing you from the game. may my hulk rip and save other pilots who do not know the dangers of ""logging"".what i am asking is that some warnings are put into the game to warn both new players and some veterans like myself who just have no idea that there is danger in logging out in space. in particular in the tutorial at the beginning to warn players about the games non-instant logging out. or if a pilot has a pve flag (as the gm's so nicely put it) they recieve a warning message much like the one for using a .4 or below gate, warning of the inherant danger but allowing them to ignore it if they choose."
7/20/2010,veteran... right...
7/20/2010,"wow, yeah i've been playing off and on for like 7 years and have logged out in space many many times......wasn't aware i could die after i logged out, then again i'm pretty carebear"
7/20/2010,"this ways you still need to dock, and undocking is the point where you can be vulnerable to attacks if not handled properly.now if you allow remote mission access, that would remove yet another point for pvp making it even harder to get a fight then it is now."
7/20/2010,"a skill based option to accept/decline/complete missions in space is excellent if the mission doesn't require you to pick up or drop something off with agent.could make the skill level represent the agent level, ie - lv 1 skill for lv 1 agent, lv 2 skill for lv 2 agent, lv 3 skill for lv 3 agent, etc."
7/20/2010,"i would like to have my privacy. so i would like to be able to remove every single log when i sell a character like the wallet transactions, private contracts, killmails, etc. i am not sure how great this would be but worth the proposal"
7/20/2010,"yes, i think this should be done.clearing contract history would be abused by scammers to clean their past transactions, so this feature needs to be outside of player control and be applied automatically on char sale (yes, still leaves an option, but it cost's)."
7/20/2010,not supported. the selling of characters should not be supported. i think ccp feels the same way. althought they have allowed it to keep people from doing it behind their backs it should not be encouraged.
7/20/2010,ccp does not feel the same way.
7/20/2010,"the things i read there seem to be to protect people from getting screwed by friend/corpmate's character having a new owner. not to help out the person selling the character.a person transfering a character and that new owner stealing everything from a corp should be stopped, hence the delay put on characters. but helping people who sell account is different."
7/20/2010,almost every 0.0 alliance has a jump bridge network. the ability to open your map and see not only your current destination but also it's relation to any jump bridge network you have access to. the routes could either be entered by each pilot or by an authorized alliance/corp official. they would be color coded to show who owns said jump bridges and even maybe notifications that would show if any bridges have been reported as being out of fuel. you as a pilot would have the ability to hide or show bridge networks or only specific networks belonging to certain alliances/corps.this would really help fleets in 0.0 when coordinating just about anything be in logistics or roaming while being able to see your eve destination and how the two paths interact with each other.
7/20/2010,"because dropping capitals at gates/stations on subcaps = capital fight? also, just as a counter-argument, there'd be nothing to prevent you from lighting your cyno elsewhere and then warping a capital fleet to the fight and engaging enemy capitals."
7/20/2010,"i understand the op's idea, but as was said, it'd be much more broadly useful to affect any and every thing with mass. i genuinely like the idea, particularly since it's not truly agressing anyone since there's no damage or ew being applied--just forcing a change in their position which can also happen by bumping already.as a side note, i think the range should be much, much wider, but act like gravity truly acts--that it will pull in with a force proportional to the distance from the gravity field. it just makes a lot more sense that way.tractor beams will still have their role as the time it takes for a single object mass to be pulled toward the gravity well, or the gravity well toward the object mass, will be much longer from max tractor beam distance. plus, tractor beams do not alter the operator's flight trajectory, but the gravity well can and will.it would need to be used with care, otherwise the operator of the gravity well may well find themselves being drawn towards stations or other large objects, and thus possibly into less or more advantageous situations.it would create new strategies and open up an entirely different aspect of gameplay, all without directly causing anyone to take any damage or otherwise be affected by electronic warfare, so there isn't even an issue with more concord response, and thus no extra lag from that standpoint. unfortunately, the mechanics of affecting so many objects with mass, at so great a distance, would create more lag--so a limit on the distance would be appropriate (not sure what that distance should be).on another interesting side-note, from a logical standpoint, it would make missiles hit the gravity field operator more precisely :p"
7/20/2010,"i don't know about you, but i am a forum junkie and i hate this bull**** where i have to wait like 5 minutes to make a new post on a thread that isnt even in the same forum. i can understand a 5 min limit on the same thread but the overall forum? nadda. sign this ppul"

7/20/2010,"while i'd also like to own a personal pos, there's a couple of issues:- if you're in an npc corp, the pos is immune to wardecs. possible solution: only allow personal pos while you are in a player corp.- if wardeced, you're alone to defend it, because you won't have the option to assigning roles to other people, knowing ccp won't touch pos and access control code with a ten foot pole.- it's one more feature towards a massively singleplayer online game.so, not supported."
7/20/2010,"i also have posted a version of this.everytime people bring up sandbox, blablablbalbalbalbaah... ccp does it for their tournaments so why not for some player run events. i'm not sure about the 1 vs 1 business as you can do this anyway - but as someone whos had 50+ people can flipping i can tell you this would be nice, and someone who'd regularily like to give away free rare ships i can assure you that this would be a nice feature.-t'amber"
7/20/2010,"if it's good enough for the bitter old veteran community, it should be good enough for the exciting young newbie community."
7/20/2010,"i agree. might as well make it so that ships can not engage each other outside stations in high sec systems unless they have wardec. if they want to fight, they need to go to the arena. that might help relieve some lag or stress on the server."
7/20/2010,"just to clarify: this weekend, our cl.2 wh has been invaded by a 150-160 man fleet,(with about 50 bs's) and there were tons of lag.they just massed-out a wh.then scanned for a new one, and brought in more ppl.rinse and repeat. we had just 8 ppl online,(small gang pvp/pve'rs) but lag was severe enough,to have to activate modules twice,or in some cases,slowed down the ship,down to 0.before you could accellerate again.(during approach) wh is not lag free.not well thought out, imo.wh's are unstable connections,they respawn somewhere else. jumpgates are not. they are essential connections between stable systems/regions.(stable as in:not moving around)not only fleets pass them. traveling ppl,haulers.etc.etc.etc.they need to be open ,all the time.if you apply wh mechanics to 0.0 systems,would you like to scan for jumpgates everytime you jump through 0.0? after each jump?or be denied access,because 5 minutes earlier,a fleet jumped through?(logistics nightmare trained to lvl5?) good luck, with holding sov in just two systems.therefore: not supported"
7/20/2010,"ccps expansions have been exceptionally good except for the last two (dominion and tyrannis) and it seems clear they are sub-par because ccp did not have enough people working on them as they had on previous expansions.i don't see how paying extra for a dedicated eve expansion team would be ""pointless"". they could fix a ton of bugs and give us a better player experience. ccp has made it quite clear that the full eve team will not be back until 18 months when incarna/dust comes back and no amount of whining or ingame ""demonstrations"" is going to change that. the op is asking you to put your money where your mouth is. are you willing to pay a little extra to get eve back or are you just going to sit there and whine about it?"

7/20/2010,"blizzard can charge for its wow expansions because they are extremely polished products which add a tremendous amount of content to the game and take years to develop. essentially, it takes as long to go from 70-80 as it did to go from 1-60, and that doesn't include the massive amount of endgame content it includes. ccp simply would not be justified in charging for two expansions a year, even if they were the best biannual expansions ever made, because biannual expansions will simply never have that much content."
7/20/2010,unsupported. adding such features will just force people to use vent/ts to the exclusion of eve voice.
7/20/2010,"i propose that periodically ccp issues a release that includes 10 smaller items from the backlog (assault frigs, rockets, balancing issues etc...). nothing huge like a fw rewrite or entire new pos system. things that can be reasonably accomplished by a scrum team in < 200-400 man-hours (1-2 full weeks for a 5 person team). next to each item they include a target # of plex. players are then free to donate plex towards whichever item they feel should be fixed. once an item has the required number of plex, it is tasked to a team, and a new backlog item takes it place on the list.in this way, players can directly influence which fixes are being looked at. the extra plex donated to ccp result in an effective transfer of real life money to ccp to compensate for developer time."
7/20/2010,why the #### should i have to bribe ccp do to the job they are already supposed to do for a game i pay to play for already?i'm a paying customer..... screw the donations..... i want my product the way it was advertised as such..... pure and simple...that's like saying pay me 30 usd and ill fix this glitch. i seriously doubt ccp is that hardpressed for funds.
7/20/2010,"400 man-hours can easily run ccp somewhere on the order of $16,000, or around a thousand plex. you might think you can get a dozen guys to chip in 300m each and get rockets fixed, but the price is simply not something that we would be willing to pay if it was over and above our subscription fees. the plex is an appropriate unit of measure for some server bandwidth and the odd petition, but dev time needs to be amortized more broadly. voluntary contributions simply won't cut it, the tragedy of the commons will see to that. the problem is how our subscriptions are being used, not whether there's enough of them."
7/20/2010,not supported.i fail to see why i should pay a subscription and need to bribe ccp to maintain the game i'm already paying for.
7/20/2010,"no it's not on the priority list, but in the future i think it would be a nice touch on the features, especially since they have the code setup to do it on our own ships, i can't imagine it'd be that hard to do the same for other ships your viewing (although i'm by no means a programmer and this could be incredibly difficult for all i know)"
7/20/2010,"eve is already plenty big. plenty of lowsec/highsec/nullsec under exploited. what they should do, as i've supported in another thread is kill the highsec expressways between empires--making lowsec more intergral to crossing the galaxy, as i believe it once was. being able to stay ""safe"" traveling between opposing empires is to put it lightly--a little lame--plus the expressways which are just about everywhere, cut down the travel time significantly from what it used to be to get across the galaxy. but to prevent it from being impossible to cross lowsec, multiple routes, and less chokepoints need to be ensured. 00 has plenty of systems completely unfrequented. it's just that when alliances/coalitions clash they each bring like 2000 players or some such nonsense to contest one system. it seems like the first ones to break up their forces, to hit multiple fronts at the same time, will just loose every battle for having divided their force against a super blob in the first place. but the drawback of a superblob is it can't be everywhere at once, whereas smaller fleets could hit several places at a time confusing intel channels, and disrupting reinforcement chains. eventually, superblobs would have to split their forces to respond to multiple threats. this is the tatics employed against larger forces in rl military excerciess. would it work for eve, i don't know. not many fc's like dividing their forces, so superblobs in single systems are the norm doing the equivilent of a rumble in a parking lot. really though, you should try to flood many systems at once, forcing enemy capships to priortize clashes, as their intel struggles to know where your main attack will be."
7/20/2010,"ccp just added a huge number of systems to eve last year (w-space). that, combined with how little of our current space is being used makes me not support this."
7/20/2010,eve is far to small. we need many many more systems.
7/20/2010,your bad at trolling
7/20/2010,you might be right about that there may well be similarities. since ccp couldnt find a hooker in a ***** house i would be suspicious that ccp stole game design and coding from eva. that would sound like the most realistic scenario.
7/20/2010,"that's right, blow your own trumpet, tell us what you've done. after reading the threadnought about ccp zulu's blog i looked up the wiki which says you've managed to get 6 issues resolved in 5 csm terms.is this accurate?"
7/20/2010,absolutely brilliant thread! i approve! thread of the week!
7/20/2010,"saying ""six issues"" is uninformative.which six issues?how soon after they were proposed were they fixed?how many issues have been put forward that have not yet been dealt with, and how long has it been since those issues were put forward?six issues over five years would be a great track record if they only made six suggestions and each one was fixed within minutes of proposing them."

7/20/2010,the csm can't achieve anything if ccp refuses to ever work on things they bring up.there's a link in the op with details.

7/20/2010,*notes sokratesz official looking forum badge*yes sir. right away. all tags enabled.
7/20/2010,"traditionally you would start building out unit tests for those sections of code so you would have some confidence around going in and changing/refactoring. i suspect, though, that paying down technical debt meets the same objection as feature polishing (or even worse as it is essentially invisible to the paying customers).the other troubling thing i noted from the csm minutes is the constant refrain of ""expectations management"". your typical agile response to this (at least for internal constituencies) would be transparency. you publish the stack ranked list of things you're working on and update that at the end of every sprint. you're always going to have people disappointed but that is mitigated somewhat by over communication.now obviously ccp feels some of the details are market sensitive, but i suspect this could be mitigated somewhat by either only listing polish/bug fix items or simply changing descriptions for external purposes something like ""winter expansion feature 4321""."
7/20/2010,"edit: fixed linkthank you csm, in particular the visible work of teadaze as secretary - i voted for you based on your performance last csm, and now mynxee for chairing and challenging ccp so carefully and competently - i will be voting for you in future csms. however, i'm posting here to recommend that you listen to the recent lost in eve podcast for the interview with both of these fine capsuleer representatives."

7/21/2010,"supported, and agreed to.i wonder if anyone has sent this thread/content to mmorpg.com?perhaps its time we had some outside visibility on what the issues are, and why this is important.it seems to me that ccp wants to add new expansions to gain player base. if the potential new player base understands that ccp is not listening to its current players, and that there are a lot of ""broken features"", perhaps it will make a dent on their strategy to ""gain new players""?just a thought, but i dont think we're going to get a response until outside pressure starts to build too."
7/21/2010,i agree.
7/21/2010,"in software engineering there's a thing called gold-plating (costly polishing the client didn't order). the line between excellence and gold-plating is extremely thin, but it all mounts up to: - release new feature.- fix until client thinks it's good.versus- fix until coder thinks it's good.- release new featureit would seem ccp has mixed up the two. or actually, they've mixed up ""release new feature; ignore results"" with ""excellence""."

7/21/2010,not supported.^^ also this.
7/21/2010,"why is that a problem?i don't agree with your assertion that it will make pilots go after pods over viable combat ships, but i sure hope your assertion is true. if my gang is fighting your gang i'd prefer your gang mates lose their composure and go after pods during the fight rather than focusing your firepower on ships that are still shooting them."
7/21/2010,get jump clones. use a clone without implants when you know you are going into a suicidal fight. pretty standard procedure.
7/21/2010,"i never really know when i will end up in a suicidal fight. if i did i guess jump clones would work well.beside the fact that it will further discourage people from going into pvp, i think the other disadvantage is that killing pods is not really combat. i mean its not like you say wow how did you manage to bring down that pod in your rifter?? the answers will almost always go along the lines of well he was in a pod and pods cant shoot back. really the most common 3 answers wont really demonstrate much in the way of combat skill by the podding party:1) he was in a bubble and couldnt slow boat his pod out of the bubble in time.2) he was in a pod and must have been new so didnt realize he should start hitting warp to a distant celestial once he is in structure.3) he must have experienced lag or some other technical glitch preventing him from warping. hence to the extent killboard stats supposedly are some indication of skill it would further skew them."
7/21/2010,"right older players will think like you. they have many skills already trained up so no need to use expensive attribute implants. go into a jump clone for 24 hours or so with a bare clone. you have no intention of flying a cladari dreadnaught, so caldari dreadnaught 5 can wait. meanwhile newer players are anxiously trying to finish getting t2 guns on that cruiser they are flying and arent too keen to have to wait a day with no implants if they want to pvp. even if veteran players use the attribute implants they have built up resources to replace them when they are lost so its not such a big deal  for them. but for a new player those plus 4s or even plus 3 implants probably cost many times more than their ship and mods. incentives to podding will hurt newer players much harder than veteran players. so to the extent you create additional incentives to go after pods you create disincentives for newer players to pvp. its that simple."
7/21/2010,"edit: this proposal has been changed to support character gender changes only. this thread no longer supports race and/or bloodline changes.(read before posting)i want to propose an idea for incarna when it comes out, and i figured id throw this idea out there now while its still in the development stages. first off, im a guy irl and my character is a gallente female. i made this cause i didnt even care and thought it didnt matter as it was just a sorta passport photo, and i also didnt know about this incarna feature untill months after i started playing. but having read up on it, i absolutly do not want to be wandering around a station in a female avatar. that is just completly wrong in so many ways. it would completly ruin the whole experience and i would not be able to immerse myself into it as i am not a woman. it would completly cut off my ability to immerse myself into the game. and ccp you said you wanted to create the ""ultimate sci-fi simulator."" well i want to be able to create an avatar that looks as much like i do in real life as possible. and a gallente female is not it.i did research on google before posting this and found many other forums with the same idea, (all of which are ""over 90days old and have been closed"")most of them wanting to change their race and bloodline for role-playing purposes or whatever. and seeing as their are no stat differences or different gameplay mechanics whatsoever between different genders, this should be another added account service. sure that would take some coding and other technical work. i dont know exactly how it would be done if ccp actually decided to do this, but i just wanted to throw the idea out there once more. also it would only be a cosmetic change. not stats or anything. main thing is, i dont want to walk around a station as a woman and be one of those nerds that walks around in a half-naked female avatar. anyways i screwed up in the character creation process and have been regretting it since i heard about this incarna feature. and skills take far too long to just start another character. and i know im not the only one.and as for not being able to justify implementing this in-game cause of reasonable roll-playing aspects like was said in a previous post, ccp after making the entire universe of eve and all its coolness, there is no way you can bs me into saying you dont have the creativity to come up with something that works.and one last thing, i do not support the idea of name changes, your name is your reputation, and that is the one thing you absolutely must stick with. we cant have people completely stealing everything from their corp, running off, getting a name change, and then joining the same corp to do it all over again.this proposal no longer supports race/bloodline changes. and has been changed to allow for character gender change only. i figured id say this again cause people still arent reading itsupport for gender change only"
7/21/2010,1) make new character on your account for free2) use said character to rp and run around stations all willy nilly3) ???????????4) profit
7/21/2010,"skyee you know that just completly defeats the purpose...even if you dont care for this, it will be a payable feature. so those who actually give a s*** about something like this can have the option to pay ccp for it. ""more money to ccp = better products from ccp""check this out, blizzard entertainment released an account option for their game world of warcraft which allowed players to buy a virtual flying horse for $25. blizzard made over 1.4 million dollars on that horse the very first day it became available. now i guess you could relate that to ccp selling in-game ships online for real money, which ccp will never do and should never do. but its the same concept. i know a fair amount of people who are unhappy with their characters.so why not let those few pay to make the game better for all of us?"
7/21/2010,but then there will be no more caldari achura left.
7/21/2010,i like my character just the way it is personally but i think hes gota point there. supported
7/21/2010,"hello,i thought of this idea a few days ago, and i've come to find that i really like it. hopefully you guys do also.there comes a time when you must upgrade your implants (unless you have l33t +5's), but to do so with the current mechanics you must destroy the current one. this always feels like a waste. same thing goes with ship rigs -- once you rig a ship, it is destined to follow whatever role you first intended when you rigged it, and deviating from that initial role will more or less gimp it.these game mechanics limits the options of what a player can do. rigging a ship for one thing and then deciding to use it for something completely different latter one is usually not an option. however, i also do not believe saving the rigs should be risk-free. thus, i am proposing a new mechanic based on skills that allow you to have up to a 50% chance to save those implants and those rigs. two skills, one for each: implants and rigs. each level raises the chance to save by 10%; lvl0 (untrained) = 0%, lvl5 = 50%. the rank on the skill shouldn't be too high so that new players (who i think will benefit from this the most, since those with +5 rarely want to change out their implants), but then again shouldn't be too low. i'm thinking 3 or 4. the best possible chance you can get with lvl5 skills is like a coin toss, which i think is fair.tell me what you think!"
7/21/2010,"oh and demichael, the reason for limiting the bpc runs to 3 modules per print was to limit the availability of the items further if indeed the attribute meta level was increased. sort of a balancing act. may be dodgy logic, but it seemed to me that if you were to boost these items significantly, their availability should be limited as well."
7/21/2010,full support to this.
7/21/2010,ccp has made it pretty clear they don't give a rats ass about fixing the game. they would rather spend their time making dust and nice new avatar faces and stations - features none of us players could care less about.supported.
7/21/2010,"if the turrets being exposed to the vacuum of space isn't enough, what will water do? :)plus, we already have heatsink modules that we're ignoring."
7/21/2010,"the vacuum of space has an awfully low specific heat capacity, unlike water."
7/21/2010,"conduction and convection are an awful lot better at cooling than radiation.l2physics.that said, this is a stupid idea."
7/21/2010,when i was reading the back story on the primae i was hoping they'd make a salvaging model too. the model is way to pretty to leave to just one ship. fully supported!
7/21/2010,"sorry, i dont support ccp anymore.the interesting thing op is that you assume we are trying to hurt or damage ccp through this action and through our postings - by criticizing them, and by demanding that they change their direction, and this couldnt be further from the truth.we are attempting to help them.how are we attempting to help them im sure you're asking yourself?if there is a problem amongst the player base, or a significant issue which could jeapordize the game - that being paying subscribers will cancel their accounts and move on to another mmo, then we have a duty as people who enjoy and care about this game to bring it to ccp's attention.the fact is:large portions of the game are broken. the number of broken 'features' in the game keep increasing. the list of broken features has been well documented by the csm, and presented to ccp.the player base has used the available channels, and processes to present these issues to ccp, and express the player's concern regarding these issues. those concerns have been ignored in favour of creating yet more new shiny's (and really imo trying to make something so new and cutting edge in order to give themselves a pat on the back, and be industry ground-breakers; ie; ego).imo - this could very well be the death of eve if it continues moving along this path.i dont know what the corporate culture is like within ccp, but im getting the feeling it is truly one of arrogance and ""we know better than you"", and one of indulgence as well. this, i cannot support."
7/21/2010,i support ccp every month with my subscription payment.and that's all they are getting atm.
7/21/2010,"tl;dr: don't like the game? quit playing. either that, or stfu.i truly support what the op is trying to get across. and no, i'm not trolling.let me first start by saying that i understand everyone's argument -- it does seem silly that little things like rockets or glitchy timers aren't being fixed in a timely manner. if i was a developer, i would take a quick minute to fix many of the bugs. but what a lot of people don't understand is that this is a company in which all decision, big or small, need to be thought out and run by everyone before their implemented. they can't say... ""hmm, i think i'm just going to ninja this fix in"" -- it needs to go through the proper channels just like everything else. ccp is a -company- first and foremost, and will do what they think is right for the company. just because you pay them doesn't mean you tell them what to do. for all those ""i pay them, so i demand they listen to me"" -- no, you payed them to access this wonderful game. what they do for expansions and patches is up to them, even moreso since the patches are 100% free. if you don't like playing the game that they have offered, then -quit playing-. it's quite as simple as that. if you truly think that the game is so bugged and that ccp doesn't give a damn about it's playerbase, then wtf are you still doing here?it's disgraceful when you have idiots shouting fix the lag whenever a dev blog appears, even when the dev blog isn't relevant to anything of that nature, when everyone knows that lag is probably the hardest technical problem ccp comes across (and will probably never fully solve due to the nature of it).yes, i'm also a little peeved that they are devoting most of their resources to new projects rather than taking a week to fix and balance rockets and the small stuff. but i also understand that they are a company trying to make a profit, and to do that they need something to sell. they can't release an expansion -a free goddamn expansion- and try to sell it with ""eve online: the bug fix expansion"". they need new content that will draw new players into the game. at the moment, that new content is incarna and the dust interaction, which are both major releases up to the scale of the trinity patch (i wasn't around back then, but i don't know of anyone who has ever said ""damn, i wished they fixed the damn rockets instead of adding new shiny models to the game. i loved my blocky thrasher, it didn't need an upgrade"").be thankful that this company is as transparent as it is. had this game been made by blizzard, you would have to pay for the expansions, in between of which you'll get almost no insight into the company or the game, and there would be exclusive betas and not the freely accessible test server. ccp does a lot for us.i'm disgusted by all the people frothing at the mouth. yes, the game has problems that really -need- to be addressed. yes, ccp has been a little too enthusiastic with it's vision for the future. but i do not believe that ccp is telling it's playerbase to stfu like so many on these forums claim they do.i support ccp and the work they have done so far, even though i may not be entirely thrilled with some of the decisions that have made. like the saying goes ""you can't win 'em all"". to those complaining: stfu or quit the game. whatever you're complaining about is obviously not enough to get you to quite since you're still here. ccp is aware of all the problems, they don't need it's playerbase to jump at them at every chance."
7/21/2010,"/signed.oh, and op, please tell me where you fly your primae. i'd like to, uhm, come and tickle it with my lolkets."
7/21/2010,dear god yes please. drone ui is terribad....
7/21/2010,"yes, but ccp has not been recording what implants were in those corpse's heads. therefore, all old corpses would have to be treated as un-implanted.as it is, you destroy an implant by removing it. if you could somehow get it out when the persons capsule has been blown into little shards, i would think that you could simply unplug one while alive.too much to change, not supported."
7/21/2010,already passed by the csm.
7/21/2010,cool im glad to see the simplist things get noticed for once
7/21/2010,or just use evemon. this sounds more like a waste of time for the dev's.
7/21/2010,"anybody who does a significant amout of missioning or involves themselves in factional warfare will sooner or later become kill on sight to one of the empire factions. there is currently no way to avoid systems belonging to hostile factions on routes generated by the autopilot. this can lead to the possibility of embarrasing accidents, as well as restrict the general utility of the autopilot for long journeys.my proposal is to include an option in the autopilot preferences menu to choose to avoid systems belonging to one or more of the empire factions, or alternately to be allowed to avoid all those where the faction navy would have issues with your presence. this would be a convenient change which would improve ease of gameplay."
7/21/2010,should have done this to begin with.
7/21/2010,"i'm using systems avoidance list for that, just add there the entrance systems of a hostile region."
7/21/2010,and what if you miss one? you warp into a hostile faction's space and lose whatever your flying when you afk.
7/21/2010,just pointing this outall t2 ships that are just a diffrent colour ti tech 1 version is because like all t2 its just a overhaul and improvemetn on that hull some of them like ishkur and enyo have slightly diffrent parts than the incurses and to each other simply because they are redesigned better varientsthis is why when you show info and go to varient it shows u all the same hulled t2/faction so no they dnt need to diffrent hulls and no we do not need new ships only over the past 7 years allso learn 2 fly the current ships properly then ask for new ships
7/21/2010,"please request new ships only when you can already fly and own all of the ones available now. otherwise, stfu and train for what we have now."
7/21/2010,"since i started playing, i can remember these being added, in no order:eas frigatesmaraudersblack opsstrategic cruisers^navy omenfleet scythenavy ospreynavy exequrornavy armageddonfleet typhoonnavy scorpionnavy dominixrorqual^orca^freki*mimir*zephyr*^apotheosis*^primae*^utu*adrestia*interbus shuttle** limited numbers^ new ship modelas much as i'd like to see eom faction ships (blue shield-tanking rail-using amarr hulls ftw!) i think we're pretty good on ships for a while."
7/21/2010,i wouldn't mind seeing tech 3 frigates :)
7/21/2010,"can we just do a run through, in one word please post what you want to be the main focus of eve development in the future, just keep it plain and simple. one word, no discussion, no flame, no arguing, just one little word for ccp.my word is lag."
7/21/2010,threadlock
7/21/2010,lag
7/21/2010,"didnt tought about that, maybe a gate to it than that doesnt allow carriers in"
7/21/2010,"hahaha, this guy plays alliance. no. carriers is the only thing that makes them worthwile as it is. the loot sucks, the bounties are lower than ratting and there are no faction spawns. really, the rate is lower than in the belts."
7/21/2010,there are rules there and plenty of people choose not to follow them and clutter the caod forum with useless crap or nonsense replies to serious topics.i'd like to see some type of ban or suspension for these offenders. simply locking threads is a pathetic excuse for moderation.
7/21/2010,"i would like to see the ""sort by"" function in the assets windown that is used to pick sort by name,number of jumps, number of items, to be fixed or extended to work in the the string search results. -tyrannis build"
7/21/2010,i am not new to the csm you cant haze me :( :(
7/21/2010,real hazing never stops after you join
7/21/2010,i learn it after 2 years when login off on a safe in 0.0 and then login on next day on my medical clone... i supose lots of people here will say the same ^^
7/21/2010,if you don't know you can die after logging out in space you are not a veteranend of thread.
7/21/2010,"what a ****ing stupid thread. if anything, logging out should carry even heavier penalties."
7/21/2010,"no more discussion, please. ed ended the thread. whoever he is."
7/21/2010,"nice idea, also add there smt like you can decline more mishs not just one per 4 hrs...."
7/21/2010,"the idea of bringing pirate, anti-pirate and neutral players together in low sec is an idea of under appreciated merit. alongside a general principle of excellence (ala dierdra vaal), the csm has set forth several ideas that might also serve as principles for thinking about a low sec expansion, e.g., a space of small gang (not blob) combat, and a space for small holder (not alliance) influence. i'd love to see a general low sec buff in terms of mining, scannable sites, missioning, smuggling routes that bypass regular gates, and so on. yet we also need to ensure that low sec doesn't become any more of a pirate ghetto than it already is. genghis' suggestion might serve as a general principle to better integrate low sec into the rest of eve. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/21/2010,"i am happy you have spent the time thinking of a way to introduce players who normally wouldnt venture into low sec. this however is forcing them. you cant force people into low sec, they wont go."
7/21/2010,"oh so true. nicely said amber. fun aside.... yani i mean no disrespect, but i think we all need to be more fair in our expectations of the csm. we aren't talking about simple technical changes, as if anything in eve was simply technical, or as if technical issues were themselves simple. rather we are talking about policy issues with a technical dimension. policy issues are much harder to change as they are based on values and culture, in this case the values and culture of ccp and its player base. please, give the csm your support and a reasonable period of time to try and effect such change. it may not work, i acknowledge that. yet it may, and we will all be better off if it does. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/21/2010,"i think we should start improving eve by ending sexism.all those in favor of podding delilah and amber, say aye. all those not in favor, go post moar qq about hulkageddon and lowsec."
7/21/2010,wait till we tell what we'd do if only we were really limber.
7/21/2010,csm has not exicted for 5 years. it is more like 2 years.
7/21/2010,"this is a very good point, should have said terms . possibly should have been iterations as ccp seem to like that word.indeed i wasn't getting at the csm, quite the opposite. the current pandemic of nerdrage is getting out of hand, for that reason i was looking for concise information that might be used as a form of medicine to help treat all these poor nerds in their hour of need."
7/21/2010,"ah. thanks for clarifying this, and apologies for misunderstanding your intent."
7/21/2010,"i would like to point out that the page in question is a wiki page. as a wiki page, it only is updated when someone updates it. as it was last updated 12:58, 16 july 2009 by erik finnegan, i propose that this is more a case of a wiki page that hasn't been updated and less an issue of csm's ability to get issues resolved.in fact, the page was only worked on by erik, a csm 3 delegate, so those are probably only issues resolved during csm 3. issues that he remembered to move on the wiki to resolved.i think the problem is that issues are often resolved outside the term of the csm who passed the proposal, so there is less impetus to finalize the work of someone else, simply to ""blow their horn"" as you elegantly put it."
7/21/2010,"ccp needs to disband the csm.i'd rather see all that money go into more development than see it squandered on the joke that is the csm.the fact that nearly their entire presentation at fanfest 2009 consisted of them trying to justify their very existence to the attendees illustrates how useless they are. that broad from pl who showed up late, hung over, and simply stated ""thanks for the free trip to iceland"" really sealed the deal for me too.disband this joke asap."
7/21/2010,here's some low-hanging fruit that i'd like to raise for discussion:
7/21/2010,"this csm is doing a fantastic job advocating players views. i really don't think ccp was ready for this at all. mynxee has really shined in this role. you can tell she is familiar with professional atmospheres and knows how to get things done in those committee settings where less experienced people would get bamboozled. she put her tenacity, logic, and tact to good use forcing ccp to face what players want.the interview posted above is very good. both teadaze and mynxee represent themselves and the players very well. what happened with the minutes was brilliant. mynxee claims she was shocked that ccp let the minutes be published without anyone trying to do some damage control. but something in her voice (inner glee?) leads me to think she knew they weren't going to bother with them and it was going to blow up. i think ccp has learned that they have to deal with this csm somehow. because if they continue refuse to take any actions other than offering sincere looks and firm handshakes this csm is gonna call them on it. nice job guys and gals."
7/21/2010,"my god, you killboard bois will complain about anything."
7/21/2010,not true. you will never hear them complain about mining not being profitable enough.
7/21/2010,i would hire ank if i read her cv. but then again that is a complete and utter lie because i actually play eve.
7/21/2010,"aeron, i'm not in a technical field, so i looked up iso 9001 via google. i may be quite off, but i assume you are posting it here because it provides an alternative to ccp's 'waterfall' style of producing code? would you be so kind as to say more about the standard, and why you think it would be of help to eve? thanks in advance. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/21/2010,"over the last few days i've been reading the many posts regarding csm and ccp.my own personal feelings are that ccp have created a no win situation for the csm.also the reaction of many people on the forum have also added to this.all the csm can do is put forward our own feelings about eve. they can not force ccp to do anything.i will admit that are some things i feel the csm could do better, things which have already been mentioned in various others threads, however on whole i feel they are doing their best with the tools they have at their disposal.for those people who are complaining about the csm i have a question for you, do you think you could do any better? i can not see how much more the csm can do.if ccp do not act on the advice given to them that is not the fault of the csm.at the moment the reaction of the many people is that csm suck because ccp is not acting on their advice. if they do then people accuse the csm of only proposing changes for their own interests.one thing i would like to know is, is there any ccp member of staff who is in charge or has been delegated the task of communicating and liaising with the csm or is it very adhoc?"
7/21/2010,"to me the csm is a rather problematic entity and if there were a public voting to stop the whole thing, i'd vote for it.first: they are not needed. ccp has known for years what players want and care about by simply reading the forums. and all the csm's do is basicly present threads from the assembly hall forum to ccp. ccp could as easily just watch for theese threads themselves. all the discussions and meetings with ccp is just void. if there is something that players badly want, ccp will recognise it anyways.imho the only reason ccp holds onto the concept is so their marketing can advertise how eve online is the first mmo with ""a real democracy"" ...second is the issue of misconduct. you can not tell me that the information passed onto the csm members is not subject of misconduct. ccp can not control what they tell their ceo's over teamspeak or what they do with accounts ""hidden"" behind a proxy or a vpn. people are generally not so *lacking of intelligence* as larkonis. for anyone with just a little bit of it knowledge it is very easy to set up an account that ccp can not track back to them. and again even if they could all it takes is a friend and a small teamspeak session. if you really believe this is not happening just now then you are really rather naive.tl;dr: csm is uneeded and provide issues of misconduct."
7/21/2010,"ccp needs to disband the csm. i'd rather see all that money go into more development than see it squandered on the joke that is the csm. the fact that nearly their entire presentation at fanfest 2009 consisted of them trying to justify their very existence to the attendees illustrates how useless they are. that broad from pl who showed up late, hung over, and simply stated ""thanks for the free trip to iceland"" really sealed the deal for me too. disband this joke asap."

7/22/2010,"do they honestly believe incarna is going bring new people to eve when once they leave the ""dress-up chat room"" they're going to run into a lot of gameplay that needs a lot of work?they might well get given a frigate with rockets, they may wonder why faction war isn't more fun, they may well wonder why a stagnant 0.0 means a lot of corporations see no reason to recruit and train new players (aggravated by the lack of treaties). they might wonder why a 6 year old game has so few pve missions that they're seeing repeats in their first couple of days? they might wonder why the epic quest leaves people with a ""why did i bother?"" feeling. perhaps they'll look at the idea of spending 25 million isk and days of gaming time to master learning skills and wonder how that counts as fun?there's no point in adding ""bags on the side"" if the core isn't healthy, fun and evolving. /supported."

7/22/2010,after 85 pages and over 2000 support - whats the betting that ccp totally ignore this and dont listen? - as usualassembly hall and csm waste of time...sorry i speak the truth
7/22/2010,indeed... the saad sad truth
7/22/2010,"supported. i doubt it makes any difference, as lately ccp seems to 'know better' what's currently going on in the game and what the playerbase wants, so they ignore the community voice at large, but one has the right to hope."

7/22/2010,please read up my previous comments i hate explaining it twice to people who don't read.
7/22/2010,ccp can at least have 2 or 3 of their 200 devs fix minor fw bugs instead of ignoring it altogether.do not want new stuffs until old stuffs is not completely borken.
7/22/2010,fw is currently choking on a number of well documented problems and a general lack of new content. it needs an investment of time and resources.
7/22/2010,hmm clear skies is in my mind ..fw is beyond fixing
7/22/2010,yes...fix the issues that you already know are there please
7/22/2010,"right click on an item, and have an option to view contracts. we can view market details on most items except those that are contract only. why not in addition to the 'view market details' option we would have an option to 'view contracts' which would bring the contracts for that item up. seems pretty logical to have."
7/22/2010,"good work mr laforge. number one, get on that."

7/22/2010,"not supported. i don't want ppl in fleet to go after useless pods to stroke their epeen instead of following orders and helping us win. you've got to be kidding me. enough ppl bringing crappy ksing rokh fits as is. those infantile killmail humpers happily add up to our losing so long as they get a few kills out of it. it'll make them even less disciplined. if you want epeen, go play a fps twitch shooter or something."

7/22/2010,"i support the ability to change your gender (for the reasons outlined by the op) when we redesign the avatars for the incarna release. race, no. bloodline, no. those are tied to player attributes and should not be able to be changed."
7/22/2010,"this is for cosmetic purposes only, no stat changes seeing as your race and bloodline don't offer any difference in stats anymorealso i've heard that you will one day be able to jump clone yourself into a jovian. so maybe this is how it will be done. like buy an in-game item like a jovian clone or minmatar clone, kinda like you buy a plex. i think it should be a payable feature tho, so those who don't care about this feature will also profit from it in the long run. more money for more development"
7/22/2010,"given the function and description of eccm this seems more like a bug than a feature; and it seems more likely that it persists because ccp are incapable of fixing it at this point. the ability to make a sc unprobable is ridiculous.there are already valid mechanics in the game to accomplish this stuff, they're called cloaks.until we see some blue text on this saying its an intended mechanic its a bug and users are exploiting. you want to make t3 unprobable, make a subsystem that explicitly states that it grants this ability, and make it impossible for non-specialty ships.disappointing, but not unexpected, lack of response from ccp."
7/22/2010,"*prepares for countless 'rig skill whatever is broken' threads.eve is about planning and risk, you can risk losing implants and the reward is faster skill training. you can avoid the risk and the penalty is slower skill training."
7/22/2010,no
7/22/2010,"regarding implants: most people i know simply get a new jumpclone (any decent missionrunner shoud have access, as well as anyone in 0.0 sov) and plug the better implants into it. that way you don't waste your old implants and have a nice backup clone in case you get podded.rigs: why not simply get a new ship? with cheap ships it shouldn't really be a problem (of course what cheap is depends on your wallet) and in case your rigs for your pimpmobil need to be replaced, well t1 don't cost that much anymore. and t2? i'm all in favor of having choices with consequences in game (and they are getting fewer and fewer).so: no."
7/22/2010,"if you are throwing 100m isk into +4 implants, you are hardly going to be worried about the 20m you burn breaking the +3 implants. if you are throwing 500m into +5 implants, you shouldn't be worrying about the 100m you burn if you had +4 implants in already. besides, if you were rash and put in +4 implants for the what, 20 days it takes to reach lvl 5 to put in +5 implants, you definitely shouldn't be worrying about the 100m isk that you knew was going to die."
7/22/2010,nnnnnnnnnno
7/22/2010,"takes quite a while to gather up all the skills and 'special' materials needed to produce most storyline modules and as it is now, most of those modules aren't worth the effort or the time to manufacture. i agree that the 2 run bpc's should be raised to 3 runs but any other bpc's with 3 or more runs should stay the same.myself, i'd rather see the attributes of all storyline modules increased to be better than tech 2 modules. short version: storyline modules should have equal or above attributes and lower fitting requirements compared to tech 2 modules."
7/22/2010,"i have run all minmatar, gallente, concord, soe, thukker cosmos missions (and those ore missions i could, standing wise). i really like cosmos missions :)the fixesyesi'd like to see soryline items equal (but different) to meta 4 or maybe t2. sureif it's necessary for balancing, ok. i don't think it is.yesi won't go into your additional ideas. because cosmos needs fixing first and i don't see new stuff anytime soon. for me the most important things are: make the storyline items worthwhile, fix the agents that are broken, and add a few more ore high or lowsec agents so that you can actually run the current ore agents."
7/22/2010,storyline items should be better than t2. i have two storyline bpcs in my hanger that i never put the effort into building because they are worth less than manufacturing effort. that makes those worse than getting a civilian gun/miner drop if you think about it.everything else sounds like a good idea as well.
7/22/2010,"""i don't see new stuff anytime soon"" is part of the reason i posted this thread. adding some agents, some new constellations with agents, and tossing some more crap into the item database can't be that hard. i would love to see ccp prove me wrong on that front. just because we don't see new epic arcs and new cosmos like content often doesn't mean we should lower our expectations. unlike *cough* some recent content additions and some in the pipe that haven't exactly had the *cough* best reactions from the playerbase, i have never heard of anyone whining about cosmos.it is the sort of content that adds just the right flavor to this game, especially for those that can't stand most bland pve grindfests. which means it makes things more attractive to new and existing subscribers. from my standpoint, when it comes to the development of content, promote from within and focus on areas where you can't go wrong. i see cosmos fitting the bill.eta for the ""priorities priorities fix this fix that"" crowd: i could pick a constellation, name 10 agents, write 10 5-part storylines, and add 50 balanced rewards to the database in one working day easily. if 1 guy can't pull that off, he is doing it wrong."
7/22/2010,i think you are completly missing the fact that shield's have a big advantage over armor in the fact they recharge. armor does not......evan a buffer tanked drake has a respectable recharge on its shield that any buffer armor tanker does not have. i dont particulerly want rr drakes to dominate the battlefield and myself as a pure armor tanker pilot think that the current set up for the rr's is fine. not supported
7/22/2010,lol. if you don't use the modules how would you know if there is a fitting issue or not?
7/22/2010,"armor has higher base resists, nerf armor...if you would ever fly in any pvp rr fleet you would know the self recharge of shields is irrelevant.still it stays confusing, one side is still arguing shield rr should be impossible to fit on most bs because otherwise they would be overpowered, while the other ones argue it should be impossible to fit it since otherwise it is still useless."
7/22/2010,"because my girlfriend flys caldari and i use her account a lot so i can and do fly caldari and shield tankers on her account, just not mine :)"
7/22/2010,"so how often did you use her account to fly in a shield tanked ship in a non-nano gang of serious size, so something where you would want shield spider tank? did you ever happen to get shot? if yes, how come you missed that your self recharge was completely irrelevant?btw protip: admitting to eula violation on the official forums is not that bright. (i personally dont have problems with people doing that, but it just isnt really smart to admit it here)."
7/22/2010,"agreeing with sok. yes the two modules are a bit weirdly balanced, but the problem (from my experience, in spider shield gangs..) is the slot requirements for the tank, not the rr module itself.not supported."
7/22/2010,"you could lower the cpu needs to 0, and people still would fly rr armor gangs instead.if you can't understand why, then you should probably stop posting till you do."
7/22/2010,"losing skills for dieing in your t3 ship is completely unnecessary. isn't losing half a billion isk enough of a penalty?some of people may say, ""lol nub, eject it's not that hard"".well there are plenty of reasons why one would die while still on-board a t3 ship like:-lag!-alphad-lag-forgetting while in the mist of an adrenaline pumping good battle.-more lag-emergency need to leave pc-server crash-did i mention lag?maybe have an option of some type of insurance thing one needs to pay before they board t3 ship (like we do with our clones)? a module that negates losing skill?"
7/22/2010,you know the risks prior to boarding the ship.its a great unique factor to t3. and its not like its a long retrain
7/22/2010,"i see nothing great in losing skills. and them being, ""not long to train"", doesn't negate the fact that it's just completely unnecessary.supporting my own thread"
7/22/2010,"op might nog agree with the second point ( k, matter of opinion ), but first reason still stands.so not supported."
7/22/2010,"given how powerful t3 ships are, i think the penalty is fine.not supported."
7/22/2010,"no penalty is not fine, read carefully, they are powerfull but also expensive compared to other equal sized ships, im for removing this penalty. or make it change, not loosing some skill but lets say you will be not able to pilot another t3 for 2 days or so"
7/22/2010,"*invalid: completely voluntary. just don't take t3 to lag-fests.*invalid: how the hell does a cruiser with 150-200k buffer get alpha'ed?*invalid: his doesn't even make sense. why should ccp base their designs on peoples doorbells, pizza deliveries, incontinence? *invalid: pretty damn rare. node crashes are far more frequent, refer to first line.all in all a pretty damn bad suggestion with even worse argumentation."
7/22/2010,"they used to be expensive. nowadays they are cheap imho. and comparing t3 cruiser with hacs or recons is kind of lol. take a proteus with the armor amount subsystem and you get what? 300k ehp + 700ish dps?you get close to bs performance out it. so your comparison with t2 cruisers is weak.uhm ... it takes about 3-4 days to train the subsystem skill back to 5. and you dont want to fly a t3 without the subsystem skills to 5 anyway. so there is your ""few days period where you cant fly t3""(proud owner of 4 t3 ships atm and soon to be 5 or 6 (anyone got a good gang link legion fit? ideally with 2-3 gang links))"
7/22/2010,"the reason why you are still in the ship when it is destroyed has no bearing on the discussion.losing a t3 ship is the only way to lose skill point that don't involve losing the pod and forgetting, before entering combat, to upgrade the clone. skill point is the only ""currency"" in game that you can't replace with some effort but only with the passage of time, so losing them should be limited to the pod destruction. /supported"
7/22/2010,"recons are not only powerfull but also expensive compared to other equal sized t1 ships. i agree with you. the penalty for losing a recon (losing a lot of isk) should be significantly reduced or eliminated). after all, a curse is 40x more expensive than an arbitrator, but i might lose a curse to lag, or a server crash, or it might get alpha'd.or you could just accept that there are risks to flying t3 ships just like there are risks to flying t2. the risks for t3 are much steeper than t2, but that matches their incredible increase in power."
7/22/2010,"here is a thought, if you cant handle loosing t3 ships dont fly them"
7/22/2010,i heard a rumour that losing a t4 ship will require one to commit suicide irl.
7/22/2010,...i still think it's a cool feature. wouldn't stop me flying one.not supported.
7/22/2010,no
7/22/2010,"no its not, lag can strike at anytime, ive tested pvping with t3s on the test server, although you can escape most of the time sometimes you can spam eject all you want, but you still don't leave your dam ship. so buffer is the only valid way to tank your t3 ship now? because lost skill time is the only thing in this game your not getting back.it still happens.maybe they can change the skill loss penalty with some other penalty? (not being able to use your t3 for a certain amount of time like someone else suggested?)i just think ccp shouldn't involve skill loss as a penalty for anything. and if they do it should be easily avoidable (like updating your clone)"
7/22/2010,it's about as easy as not flying your t3 ship.don't want to lose sp? don't fly a ship that makes it so you lose sp if it dies.ta-****ing-da.
7/22/2010,yes but is it really necessary? plus removing this penalty will encourage more people to fly t3s.
7/22/2010,i dont mind it.infact they should make the addition of all the rank 1 skills are in the mix also. balanced against perhaps not losing all the sp from a skill necessarily. it's just an amount of sp.so you drop lvl 5 to like 4.5 or 4 to 2.75
7/22/2010,"spoiler inbound:don't fly the ships if you don't want to risk your skillpoints.i'm in one a lot, it makes the fights more exciting, of course, you'd know that if you liked to fight, however, you don't, you like to play this game, and it has fighting in it, which is ok, because you avoid that like the plague, however, this one ship that you really really really like to fly, also has this terribly scary penalty that might occur.so you made a thread about it."
7/22/2010,thanks for your support guys. anyone else got any thoughts?
7/22/2010,actually vacuum is one of the best heat insulators there is in existence(or not)we are talking about however is something which can supplement overloading far more actively then offlined modules.moreover they could implement a graphic for the watercooling of steam coming from the ship.
7/22/2010,"yes please1.) for god sakes yes..... i just recently moved to drone space and you have to pick, destroyer with many high slots but no cargo or industrial with next to no high slots and high ammounts of cargo. seeing as drones drop nothing but alloys picking between or using only 1 is a huge pain2.) decent cargo space too please, iv been struggling with a myrmidon or another bc just to fit the 5 harvesters and i can only use it in a fleet op unless i wanna jet can mine which isnt smart to began with no matter who you are or where you are.3.) i dont agree to much with this last one sence unless you increase the cargo size to over 38k m3's my mark 5 no matter what you do is gonna hold more unless it can compress planet materials."
7/22/2010,"supporting this so hard. d:i love the primae model, but the stats are so meh. d:"
7/22/2010,"i agree. the primae is a junker. the only thing it's actually good for is being a better shuttle. in fact, it's almost like the t2 version of a typical shuttle only that it has better cargo and a couple of slots. that's all it's good for at the moment.i would recommend setting the ship up for its original purpose before ore tried to scrap. make it a more formidable salvage ship. something that can out-salvage a catalyst."
7/22/2010,"i like our second suggestion, at least the ship could be used for something. now it'll omly collect dust."
7/22/2010,this. in a huge way. cool ship. definitely idea #1.
7/22/2010,idea #1 rules
7/22/2010,"i guess that's worse then an insta-locking, remote sensor boosted, remote repaired lachesis."
7/22/2010,"not supported. we don't need frigate gate camps in low sec, travel is dangerous enough as it is. in regards to no one going there to pvp because they don't want to bring a bs/bc, well that's bull. go to a populated system with your frigate gang and warp to the top belt, you'll get some action. the top belt in amamake isn't called ""the glory belt"" for nothing.edit: rr'd, remote sensor boosted lachesis is really specialized though, i've only seen that once in nearly 2 years of living in low sec. it's cool as **** though."
7/22/2010,"some of the more mentioned topics in si and gd, but i didn't see them on the first 6 pages so i figured i'd bring them up...1. increase brightness/contrast of mineral scan overlay. - presently if a material is in low concentrations it is very possible for its hotspots to fade into the background or be impossible to pick out against the planet image. especially problematic on plasma planets.2. allow grouping of extractors and mass-selecting cycle time. - this would vastly reduce the carpal-tunnel inducing clickfest.3. reduce storage facility cpu/grid - right now they are absolute hogs and not worth the fitting cost. a reduction would make them viable and even attractive for long-term pi storage."
7/22/2010,"was searching for a thread about pi clickfest on the hall, and seems it's the only one on the 1st ten pages... strange.1 - not really bothered by that, we can adjust colors.2 - oh yeah baby. i finally stopped clickfesting 2 days ago. even if it take me less than 30mn for all alts, it was so boring having to do this much clicking for the current pi price.the problem about having to click a new link each day was corrected on beta, meaning they care about this.but nothing about having to click extractor each day. we at least need a csm to ask if dev' are willing to do something about this.if they are working on it, but didn't find a solution, or if they won't change it at all. never.3 - true. for sure launchpad cost a lot of cpu, and for processor-only planets we can have a use for storage, as not enough cpu left on some case. but with the current value on storage cargo, and the time between each move, these have really small utility. like silo coupling array...some tweaking on the numbers will be a good thing."
7/22/2010,bumping this here.
7/22/2010,this is covered under commit to excellence proposal i believe.
7/22/2010,yah well i don't really have faith in ccp not ignoring one proposal because it insults their ego.
7/22/2010,supported. logistics range on t3s needs an increase to make it practical.
7/22/2010,i love the idear of scanning wrecks with combat probes.the issue i have is people scanning wrecks to get to the mission runners insidenote: im not a mission runneri think that wrecks should become scannable after the site witch they are in has despawned they would have a low sig radious to ensure that they are not insta scanned. on top of that the sig radious could increas with the number of wrecks with in a 500km radious of the sentral most wreck. thus making abandoned mission sites easyer to scan than lone wrecks
7/22/2010,"i agree, wrecks in an active deadspace should remain unscannable until the deadspace area is completed and despawns. if the mission runner wants to lay claim to the wrecks for salvage, they need to keep the mission area active.as for increased signature per amount of wrecks in the area or separate signal strengths for different class wrecks, no way. that's where the random aspect is. area could have 1 frigate wreck or 50 battleship wrecks."
7/22/2010,"pods are different. currently, podding across a few systems to pick up a new ship for example is relatively safe in highsec since there isn't really any benefit to shooting one of those pods simply because there is nothing of any value in one. with this suggestion, the corpse would become a high value item and system jumping in your pod would nearly equate to a suicide mission.have you ever pirated? personally, my pirate account (not this one) makes a decent living using ransoms and i know quite a few others who do too. your 'lol' is just plain childish.how many players do you know who destroy their own ships, cheap or not, for salvage? it isn't worth it. and where in my post do you see me saying anything about putting imps in an alt to destroy it (although installing the free cheap ones given in the tutorials would be a viable use)? the op suggested using the biomass to sell for cloning even if there are no implants so every corpse would be profitable whether they had implants or not."
7/22/2010,"wow, so you would buy a set of +5 implants and then pod yourself? its like a ship. the salvage from a ship dosnt in anyway even come close to the value of ur ship. i doubt ppul will pod for fun in highsec. i mean i have podded ppul with +7 implants for fun but thats just for lolz :p .wow and the biomass would be very minmal. like the cost of oxygen and you wouldnt get more then a few units so you would need tons of corpses just to get enuff biomass to make a new clone"
7/22/2010,"killing pods is pretty good fun anyway. i think the idea of looting the corpse afterwards is amusing in a macabre way, although how much of a body is going to be left after it has been hit by a 720mm artillery shell is open to question.the main argument against salvaging corpses is that it would significantly increase the implant supply. whilst i'm not against that in principle, the effects should be considered first."
7/22/2010,"supported, with the provision that harvesting implants is a criminal activity and that partaking in this industry will likely make you an outlaw.i made a similar proposal a while back where harvesting implants were used to make learning booster drugs"
7/22/2010,"dude, there is no need for such a thing, though it is admittedly convenient. just simply create a safe spot near (but not too close to) a celestial. if you're somewhere else in the system, align to that celestial and wha-la!! insta-warp. as for whs, that's different."
7/22/2010,"have you ever found yourself turning on the television, or loading up another game while you are playing eve? i have. it seems that every time i play eve, i must load up something else on the background to entertain myself during the long and unnecessary waiting times.therefore, i propose that the following should be implemented:a) reduce session change timer to 10 seconds or less,b) increase warp acceleration speed and possibly increase warp speedthese small changes will not impact the balance of the game very much and they would increase player enjoyment by quite a bit.edit: /me anticipates getting flak about the increasing warp speed (as it will ""kill solo pvp"" ) if you are with the ""faster warp kills solo pvp"" crowd, please indicate if you agree with a), at least."
7/22/2010,"i'm all in favour of shorter session change timers - i cant imagine there is anyone who wouldn't be, and i'd support your proposal if it were only for this change.faster warp speeds have significant gameplay implications, and i think you'd be better off putting that as a seperate proposal."
7/22/2010,"changing gameplay is a necessity no matter what the proposal is.as benign as the ""reduce session change timer"" suggestion is, it is still going to be a significant change to the station campers crowd. if it is reduced to 10 seconds, or even 5 seconds, reshipping will only take 10-20 seconds instead of the full minute as it was before (which was enough time to deaggress and gtfo.)the point here is not whether or not it changes gameplay for some, but rather, would it benefit the game as a whole. i think it will. who really wants to spend 30 seconds to wait for the session change timer? who really wants to spend 30 seconds in warp, doing nothing? right now, it makes for a bad game experience as most people just do something else during these boring transition phases.when we were new, these transitions are easier to accept, since there were a feeling of ""wow, i'm in a spaceship"" feeling when we just started the game. we tend to inspect our ship and the environment and be impressed by the graphics. but these things have became stale now that we've done them a thousand times. imagine what would happen if incarna comes out and you have to sit through the transition scene (approx 30 seconds) every time you exit your ship. everyone would be up in arms about it. also, supporting my own topic"
7/22/2010,i could code it all in about 5 minutes. i mean just copy paste the script from the actual game clock then done!
7/22/2010,"i unsubscribed with 23 days or so left to play. it told me it will unsub me when my natural playtime has finished. this is ridiculous. why cant they unsub me now and freeze my account with 23 days ""saved"" until i sub again. what's happening is ccp effectively robbing me of my subscription money that i do not use. mine is a simple case. what shall happen when someone with 11 months left on his subscription decide to quit? that's a good 165 bucks, enough to feed a third world family for half a year.i have already unsubscribed. the fact that i can still sit here and write this thread prove that it doesnt actually unsub me. i do no wish a refund, but i would like to have my remaining play time saved, and the game immediately unsubscribe me by the next down time. when i sub back, i can use that playtime again."
7/22/2010,"i suspect it has something to do with the fact that you could use those 23 days to train instead of the old and dearly missed ""ghost training""why not just set a 23+day skill? (and really...does anyone use the 12-month sub if they don't plan on using it? the correct answer is no"
7/22/2010,"no, that was the contract you agreed upon.no, that is effectively allowing you to rob yourself of said playtime. that is not ccp's issue. if you want to, you can rob yourself of all the playtime you like.which player is stupid enough to make a contract for 12 months, unless he really wants to play for that time? doesn't matter anyway. he is still able to keep skilling, even if he doesn't play.also enough to buy drugs for one weekend, to feed yourself in a 2 star restaurant with a single dinner and a bottle of wine for one evening, enough for putting your hands on the boobs an expensive prostitute for one minute. your point being?unfortunately for you, that is not the contract you agreed on."
7/22/2010,"i actually agree with the op, but he/she said it in a very assy and ""i want my way wahhhh"" tone.technically, when you signed up you also signed a contract, like the above poster said. a non refundable subscription payment. i don't see what's so hard to understand about that, so no need to get all angsty about it.on a lighter note, i do somewhat support changing the system so that you're able to freeze your account to save game time in case you're going away on holiday or something. maybe have the option to freeze for at least 30 days to prevent abuse. though, the fact that you could always have a skill training in that time thanks to the passive training, that kinda defeats the purpose."
7/22/2010,"then you die for your own stupidity. darwin and so on.i am with korvin here, the tools exist. use them."
7/22/2010,"^thisand for missions, you should be running missions for opposing factions alternately, and turning down faction kill missions like every other missioner is doing.for fw, you joined it, you're kos. should be more worried about opposing fw ppl instead of npc faction police anyway."
7/22/2010,"it already does, you can add whole regions to the avoid list"
7/22/2010,"yes please, as you get on in experance and ""years"" you find the selection a bit slim when buying/building/prepairing ships for what ever.theres more then 1 ship in the t1 catagory but destroyers. you think expecialy for caldari they would have a missile destroyer instead of just 90% gun one.battle cruiser wise.... meh i donno i cant think of a reason why youd need more.t3 i agree.... you introduced it and if we discovered something like this in rl we'd make every class including mining class t3 ships.more faction? sure wheres the faction mining ships other then the ""ore"" orca and rorqual which cant even mine unless using drones. as far as other ships id like to see faction destroyers and battle cruisersnot sure what jove is but why not?personal suggection, new race + whole line of ships, maybe one that uses weapons like microwave or radio guns. hey its not the best idea but at least im trying."

7/22/2010,yulai - ***this is a breaking news story*** scope news has learned that an armada of unknown origin has jumped into the yulai system. concord and ded warships have been scrambled to intercept. we will continue to provide coverage of these events as they unfold.what do u think of scope news not meaning anything ingame for the most part?yes its a good read but in the end its for noyhing than ur imagination which sucks.bs i say.could have been made a ingame mission; like i said before.ty ccp
7/22/2010,"you must be joking, these events resulted in an entire concord station being crushed, and the war between the empires to start (ever heard of faction war??)please do your research, and don't use the article by the scope that's had one of the biggest impacts on the game to this date, as an example of how little impact they have... seriously...edit:check out this trailer which is actually about this exact event:"
7/22/2010,"i saw that vid. so ur saying that a station got blown up? also tell me one person involved in a battle with concord. did u see or engage the amada of onknown origin? were npcs battleing it out or was it players in their respective factions fighting as usual.""concord and ded warships have been scrambled to intercept."" did any1 see this happen? its all make believe and worthless. faction warfare is always happening ingame this scope bs doesnt. just like that gallente supercarrier crashing into that station. or the amarr empress havein that big meeting... it never happened ingame."
7/22/2010,"that stuff happened back during a downtime. yes, several stations were ""incapacitated"" and to this day still show the physical signs of an attack. more recently, sansha fleets have been engaging players (yes, actual ingame events players can join).scope news is a good thing; keeps the game...moving."
7/22/2010,"i was never in favor of creating the csm to begin with. ""player councils"" in mmos end up being nothing but pr tools to make players think they have input.as csm5 proves, we have no input, our csm representatives have no input, there isn't anything ccp is doing that either we or the csm can change, they are out to do dust514 and incarna.ccp's 2010-2011 development strategy can be called ""damn the bugs, full speed ahead!""."
7/22/2010,"exactly. the money ccp spends on expenses flying the csm to iceland and providing them room and board twice a year probably could get us another developer.if that developer does nothing but read bug reports and gets them into the queue to be fixed, he or she would be achieving more than the csm does.now, this isn't a knock on csm5. i think for the first time, a csm went to iceland and actually tried to do something good. the fact that ccp basically told them to suck wind and wait until never proved that it doesn't matter who we elect, or what they say, if what we want doesn't match what ccp plans to do, we lose, we have no influence.it will probably take subscriber cancellations on the level that matches the swg nge debacle to get ccp to move teams from incarna and dust to fixing bugs in the stuff they released in the last two expansions..."
7/22/2010,"you guys. thanks for the kind words. tbh, i'm not really ""gleeful"" about ccp being put in a tough position, but the csm is pleased to see the problems and challenges faced by csm well and truly out in the open. hopefully good changes will come out of it...both in the game and in the process...there are glimmers of hope."
7/22/2010,"regardless of how well any sitting csm has performed, the system itself does not work and is a waste of resources. it needs to be disbanded asap."
7/22/2010,"csm is there to get answers for the players. they clearly have. so they have been doing their job. ccp's job is to provide a game people enjoy playing. players, armed with the knowledge obtained by the csm, can make informed choices."
7/22/2010,"i was expecting great things from mynxee and as usual she has delivered.a special thanks to all the sitting csm members, great job in pressing the issues. i dont know about the rest of you but i was amazed when i read the minutes, especially the summeries.again great job!ps - no word on towels?tribe"
7/22/2010,"as a person who has driven efforts to bring two large software organizations into iso and other quality framework compliance i can say from direct experience it would be a waste of resources. it would require allocation of substantial resources to meet compliance requirements and would distract ccp from focusing on getting eve improved. even if they did manage to find a way to get certified there is nothing that would change what they choose to focus on going forward. lots of companies that embrace iso still make horrible products.what ccp needs to do is make some hard choices and create a plan that addresses the horrible problems their legacy code creates. even if that means essentially creating what amounts to eve ii.in the end, as long as enough folks are playing to keep eve in the black we can expect ccp to keep doing what they've done till now, which is work on whatever they are most interested in at the moment, even if that means leaving a lot of existing stuff unfinished or broken. no reason to expect that to change since other than some forum griping that has been a successful business model so far.issler"
7/22/2010,ccp does no longer work under the waterfall modell. they are using scrum now.
7/22/2010,"you know that's how new games get made right? you take the profits from the old ones and pay devs with it? jesus, don't be stupidi don't really agree with ccps plans for eve atm but suggesting that you're some sort of shareholder and have a say in how they spend the dough is ridiculous"
7/22/2010,"broken and bugged as eve may be, there still isn't any better mmo that i can find. so the op can make his loud ""i'm leaving"" claim and i will dutifully ask can i has your stuff?"
7/22/2010,"congrats to all the csm. great attempt at it. i hope like all the the other players hope that ccp takes a step back, looks at the issues and thinks about what they are doing and where the game is going. mynxee, your doing great! keep it up! sokratesz i know you get alot of hate, but keep it up! at least you, mynxee and now mazzilliu are doing your best ""to keep us in the loop"" thanks for the hard work and keep it up!"
7/23/2010,excellent idea.
7/23/2010,"concord has it's place - leave it in thereinsurence payouts for all has its place - leave it theresuicide ganking has it's place - leave it there.make kill rights sellable! that will fix the problem and i am pretty much sure all parties will be happy.bounty hunters get to hunt down players in high sec, miners get their revenge by selling kill rights to get money back and see the offending party killed. pirates get to pirate.imagine hulkageddon 4 with sellable kill rights. ohh the carnage and the fun.and by bounty hunters i mean vigilantes who don't do it for the money, they do it for the justice."
7/23/2010,"this. we need a workable bounty system, and god knows they've been proposed enough times. the current system badly distorts the balance in high sec."

7/23/2010,signed
7/23/2010,total agreement. you can't expand if what u have doesn't work. stop the sidelines (ambulation/consol fps) and instead of trying to recruit new gamers fix the game for those who actually spend money to play it now. apart from anything else- what is going to happen if all these new things have their desired effect and suddenly we have peaks of 75k or even 100k. eve lag happens now at 50kccp fix your first game before you start loosing your core player base!!!
7/23/2010,"bumping this incredibly important proposal. come on ccp, work with us! please!"
7/23/2010,"yes, it is always fail when ccp announces something, then it comes time to deliver and we get some watered down pos that does crap half of what it was supposed to do and has lots of problems/bugs. ps: 5 minute time delay is so overdue to be gone, gee ccp still couldn't get anyone to tackle that eh?"

7/23/2010,"supported!capital ships should be exactly that.. capital.make them at least twice as big as the biggest battleship, or 3 times as big.i've yet to see a titan around.. but if i'm flying a frigate, i want to be able to have to take the time to fly from the stern to the prow.( as an added funny note, can we have a sticker ont he back of titans saying: 'we brake for nobody'? )"
7/23/2010,"this. capitals and supercaps need to be imposing presences on the battlefield, not 'ooh, look at the slightly-larger battleship and its stupid little dromaigawdgetemoffme!!!' though the latter situation *is* pretty funny."
7/23/2010,booya
7/23/2010,"i for one support this thread with the power ccp vested in me through the small little thumb below my portrait.the scale is off the whack, not only are motherships not dockable whilst they are not larger than dreadnoughts we are supposed to believe that battleships with the size of a carrier are supposed to fit into it and that hundreds of carriers are able to fit into such small stations.the only ships which are to scale at this time are the capital industrials and titans."
7/23/2010,"supported, you dont put 9-10 bill into a ship that is still the size of a battleship.it is another ridiculous problem that can be fixed in this game without little effort."
7/23/2010,this is a good idea. i am support it.
7/23/2010,this is a good idea. i am also support.
7/23/2010,umpa bumpa
7/23/2010,i agree with most of the points - i'll have to make it into an issue one of these days :)
7/23/2010,t'amber told me to do it
7/23/2010,yes +1
7/23/2010,"proposing this again.previous thread:linkagecurrently you can change your character's face. i would like the option to change the character name. could charge a fee, could be part of buying a character, could be free.i feel it would be nice for someone who bought a character to change the characters identity thus remove former associations which could be positive or negative.someone who wanted a specific character name, that wasn't available at the time of creation is now available (biomass processing).anyone who would change the picture of their character would surely be interested in changing the name.an argument:let's say for instance i infiltrate your corporation then gain your trust and you give me access to something that is valuable. i steal it. now you want revenge you hire mercs, post tearful threads about how you were wronged, and try to make things difficult for me. now with this proposal i change my name. without this proposal i can create a new character on my account, sell the evil (get it?) character and buy a new character, or wait a few week before i try to do it again.so as you can see, it isn't difficult for me to do right now today. sure this will be another option, but if this is the reason for not supporting this proposal you need to find a new game anyway because it will happen to you, or someone you know, or your entire alliance. was the buddy list an intended intel tool, like local?if this was tied to the character name rather than some other value associated with the character, it could be a problem. easy fix would be require that the character doesn't have any kill rights.surely characters are tracked using some type of unique character identifier, not the character name. anything character specific that must be tracked, employment, kill rights, ect... could be tied to that rather than the name of the character."
7/23/2010,"whoever lives on poses should understand me.to submit\mark the owner of the tab in the corp.hangar ppl are using bookmars.which making this tab to open tremendously slow (especially when there are bunch of them in there).partial solution - is to use conts... but first of all, conts have different purpose, second they have similar pictures and are easy to missmatch.bookmarks have to be reworked, so will take lots of time.so this proposal will be a good contr-solution for at least one aspect of use.proposal:add an item, call it label or note or whatever-- volume 0.0 m3 or 0.001 m3-- with property allowing to change ist's label/name-- with ability to be generated via right-click menu.thanks."
7/23/2010,supporting my own post
7/23/2010,"bookmarks can sort of be used badly for this purpose, but bookmarks are all kinds of laggy. i should hope something less bad can be created instead. supported."
7/23/2010,imagine you are a small alliance; you're right nearby empire. you want to pay a very large fee for concord to come to your space and secure it to a 0.5 level. perhaps for 10bil/month/system you can secure it to be as good as highsec. everyone is welcome to come and play.this would make roamers focus more on the non-secured systems. more fights this way; in addition to people who treking to and from the secured systems.
7/23/2010,"i just spoke to a concord representative about your proposal. while he expressed interest in the idea of securing all known space under concord jurisdiction, he claimed that with the sansha invasions, hulkageddon's aftermath, and the spate of suicide-gankings, concord is simply too busy to consider your proposal. they would be far more interested in securing systems that are already under an empire's control, as it is their stated mission to protect empire assets and space. they do however welcome donations from concerned pod pilots such as yourself, so if you are interested please send money to your local d.e.d. office. thank you."
7/23/2010,"different face, same emo tj"
7/23/2010,great for pricing faction ships and modules. i approve.
7/23/2010,only for contract only items.

7/23/2010,make it so.

7/23/2010,"you can save your implants, just get a jump clone(either naturally or with estel arador's help) and preserve your old ones. i still have my ancient +3 clone. you can save your rigs - just sell the ship and buy a new one with the rigs you want. this is completely unnecessary."

7/23/2010,"please note. as of this post i have changed the title of this thread for clarity. my point is still the same so i have not put a new topic up, i just changed the title so my issue was more apparent."
7/23/2010,agreed i don't want internet spaceships second life and if we were to have dust it should have been for storming stations.so avatar worth having no - but what might be worth knowing is what will avatars bring to game play and game play seems to be getting lost at the moment.
7/23/2010,i dont think we realy have a choise here. none of us need avatars or fps becouse we are already eve players.i can see ccp's needs to do this things though. they are doing ground braking work in something that has never before been done.i am willing to sacrifice a few years for that. besides they are still working on eve at the same time too.
7/23/2010,thisto much whining about ccp
7/23/2010,supporting because i want the game fixed and don't think a stupid console game should hold up fixing a game that is out already.that is all.
7/23/2010,more games = more pennies.incarna is a pretty huge feature to add to eve and will attract more subscriptions. people who don't want it won't use it.incarna and dust are both related to eve. if anything see it as a sign they want to continue development of eve for a long time.
7/23/2010,"i had the idea when changing moduals on my ship.planet collens suffer some huge issues with power grid and cpu when their fully set up and its difficult with out deleting pieces and buying new ones to get them to balance out in production/output.so heres my idea.... allow people to turn structures or links off and on like we can moduals with out removing them from the planet. when offline they draw say 99% less pg and cpu and cannot be used for anything, if a building is offline you cannot route resources though it, if a link is offline same story."
7/23/2010,water??? why not liquid nitrogen insted...
7/23/2010,"liquid nitrogen while it is very cold, it's ability to absorb heat is pretty limited.in addition it also makes metals very brittle and makes them break easily."
7/23/2010,i dont like people in militia who just do missions and do not shoot enemies.i propose you to change loyalty points reward of fw missions by adding pvp multiplier based on yours pvp success.how it works. kill more enemies and grow your multiplier. the higher multiplier means that an agent will give you more loyalty points. if you dont like pvp the reward will be lower.
7/23/2010,"come on, seriously? there's a much easier five-step solution to this 'problem' that you can implement yourself, right now!1) join fw2) find mission-runners since their missions appear on the overview3) pvp4) ???5) profit!"
7/23/2010,are you offering me to kill my militia members?it is unacceptable.
7/23/2010,"on the other hand, they'll never see it coming, making your job easier."
7/23/2010,"this is not a bad idea. militia should be an army, not a bunch of carebears."
7/23/2010,"i fully support this idea.. the primae's looks are just too cool not to have it around more.all three ideas are good ones, since there's not ships that really fill that 'nice' that each idea adresses."
7/23/2010,"the primae looks really cool, yet it is completely and absolutely useless. not even a total 0 day noob character could make any real use of it, as even the worst industrial is much better, more flexible and even included for free in the tutorials. there is no reason whatsoever to fly the primae. what a waste.whatever is done to this ship to make it better and a more regular sight in space is a good thing.not doing anything would be a waste of good modelling and texture work.the ship's background story dictates that there has to be a regular built salvage variant of it. seed it."
7/23/2010,"i am totally on board with making the ship useful, its a one of the best looking ships in the game.another idea is have a variant that allows you to have a more direct connection with the base planet side, maybe you can do a direct link to it if you are in orbit and it would allow materials to go straight from the command center to the ship itself. also moar cargo space please!but other than that i like the idea of making it a dedicated salvage or gas ship"
7/23/2010,"yes this, and having a dedicated gas harvster would be nice. somthing that rips through gas clouds like a hulk rips through rocks."
7/23/2010,"ccp have made a great game and put a lot of work into keeping it interesting for the vets and so that the n00bs can start all the while keeping it as balanced as they can, you must have enjoyed it once or you are just complaining for no reason.if you dont think ccp is working hard enought to fix the problems vote with your feet it is easy to do, if your f***ed idea of fun is playing a game you dont enjoy go play and whine about wow dont constantly complain about the hard work of the people who make a game i love.there are issues but i am sure ccp is working hard to fix them and not just because it is their job i belive that the people at ccp want us to enjoy eve and not just so we keep subscibing.good job ccp keep up the hard work.tl:dr stfu ccp are great!!!(yes its an alt dont feel like being podded for supporting ccp again!)"
7/23/2010,"personally i think that ccp does a bad job with community interaction. thats why im not supporting this thread.to many half finished features- faction warfare (territority has no meaning)- certificates (how about inner corp access?)to many well known bugs- using logistics in higsec on foreign player is suicide- hangar access is beyond fixing(it would be easy to add 100 issues, but thats not relevant for the current topic.)maybe i should open a ""tumb down"" proposal thread.actually im close to cancel my annual sub, because the last 2 expansions where a waste of time in my opinion and projects like dust are not in my interest (i dont intend to buy a console).i am well aware that some players are unable to respect my opinion. but that is their problem and not mine."
7/23/2010,"maybe it's just me, but i find the time restriction for posting extremely annoying.couldn't we lower it to something like 2 min and still achieve the same goal?"
7/23/2010,"we have ccp employees and csms who have the time to go through and clean up the forums. we have ccp employees who have time to make bets with the players,.why don't you have time to respond to some of our proposals, questions and concerns?a little feedback in your own forums would be nice. at the moment i feel, as many players do that putting forth our ideas, proposals and raising issues is a waste of time. even the ones that get massive approval get no comment from you own customer service people.i'm not asking for some person to sit and comment on the forums 24/7 but it would be a good idea from a customer relationship standpoint to have someone from ccp go through the forums once a day and comment, ask for more info, and acknowledge our input."
7/23/2010,because that goes against what the csm is: player run

7/23/2010,gate guns ought to be removed and replaced with a concord faction navy which spawns and comes after you with similar dps as the gateguns and similar ewar as ud expect.that way the entire system gets some minimal protection. the increased freedom on ship choice and such comes into it also.
7/23/2010,"contrary to what some people say, this would reduce the number of ships in camps. for a good camp you need a rapier, a lach and a hic. this can be done with 1 scimitar as backup, but if the scimi took sentry guns and got shot at the same time by a target it could go critiacal, hence the need for a nother scimitar. apart from that you can put in a keres to lock shuttles coming through, however this requires another logistic ship only focusing on keeping that one frigate up.if all this could be changed into a dramiel, it would definately reduce the numbers in camps. of course you would just see more small effective camps than normally.i dont really care if its one way or another, just throwing my opinion out there."
7/23/2010,"if anything the gate guns need to be boosted, scramming camps is for 0.0, lowsec should at least be enterable, barring the snipers, who don't really have the ability to tackle at gates.if you want people in low-sec, camping every gate 0.0 style is a bad idea. it should be fairly easy to enter, with the risk of being attacked while performing actions in system. the security status penalty is completely ineffectual, as most lowsec gankers live there solely, and there's no npc intervention for them entering hisec."
7/23/2010,"qft, with some remarks tho;in order to catch the smaller stuff, in addition to the ships mentioned above, you will need some (serious) remote sensor boosting (=ship #4). additionally, anything larger then a bc would pose a significant threat(without logistics, ship #8 and 9)to both the huginn/rapier aswell as the lachesis. in that context, you will need some (bs or bc) dps (ship #5,6,7)added to that to make sure you are able to kill a bc or bs in a timely manner (or try to ransom it, whatever floats your boat).(in order for this not to become an how-to gatecamp lecture)on topic: you guys really don't want frigs able to tank sentries in low sec, travel would become much, much more dangerous. in testing we've been able to get an inty to have a scan res of over 6000 (wanted over 9000, but hey), and keep it alive with the help of logistics. (kinda ironic, this coming from me, of all ppl)in closing: not supported"
7/23/2010,"hi guys i just thought it might be a kewl idea if the full api could show the remainder of time left on your accounts subscription. this way a program like eve mon could give you a message saying ""blah blah has 2 days left of playtime"" just so instead of spending my last few $$$ on nachos i can spend it on game time.its fine if you only have 1 account but when you run 2x 3x or 4x you kind of loose track of when you last payed.foxz"
7/23/2010,"there are sometimes legitimate reasons to give a full api key to another player, to give information that is currently part of the full api. some people might not want billing information to be part of the full api (and knowing the subscription interval and expiration date is part of the billing information).so, while this would be a useful feature for one's own information, i'll have to say ""not supported"" for the above reason."

7/23/2010,"i think dust514 will be ccp's nge.they are completely wasting their efforts on it. for one thing, the concept of a console mmo has never been proven (it is silly to not at least offer a pc client), and it is clearly taking effort away from the existing and successful eve game. i am not against incarna as it is an expansion of eve, but i think that dust514, unless conceptually changed into an addition to the pc based game should go.besides, console kidz who want to play mmos probably have a pc and play wow anyway."
7/23/2010,"aww sometimes i wish my alliance dev'd the game cause ccp is getting much more emo tears than we are recently :-)i didn't see in the notes that ccp said they were going to do nothing to eve in the next 18 months, this seemed to be only related to losec.on the contrary, they also said that some things were coming in the winter expansion, now i know that iceland has freaky day and night cycles, but i am sure their winter isn't another 18 months ago either, so we will still be seeing things coming upa lot of people like to complain like silly little spoilt brats, however you can't make everything better for everyone and what they want.i have had some ups and downs recently but even with that and nearly quitting eve myself, i have found myself coming back to the same things in here that i have always loved this game for, and that is to do what i want, and as long as i have that freedom in the game i will embrace changes rather than cry about things i never had.if i would buy a new tv after considering it, i would be someone who would write a crappy letter to the manufacturer to give me new stuff what i think i should have had with it, you pay for what you get.if you don't like what you get or see it is still your right to cancel and leave the game.i would even like to see any other game developer who brings such a commitment to their game and especially to their players as ccp does, and yes i have been to two fanfests in the past and also had the pleasure of meeting some of the guys while there.ccp also needs to consider how to expand their business, and i think it is great of them to do this within a universe they have created instead of completely ignoring this world they built and do something completely different, this alone is a sign of loyalty to eve and its future.if more devs are needed to do it, then fair play, and that their decision, i highly doubt they are going to start ignoring what they have made and achieved so far and also completely ignore the fact that they need to expand their business cause a minute few seem to not understand that.i could go on, but tbh i cant be bothered because i am now going to leave the office, go home and logon to eve and enjoy some time with friends in a game i like and love"
7/23/2010,ccp will only be allowed to support dust 514 for 18 months for xbox live due to their software agreement.
7/23/2010,"i would not want to be a csm member. they are in a position with the current mechanics of how it really works vs. how they are told by ccp and the player base on how it should work are vastly different.no matter how ambitious or hopeful you are when you take a csm seat you quickly realize have little say you have in anything. stake holder? ha! the definition of what it is vs. how ccp uses it is very different.ccp basically says that csm has a say, but the actions from ccp speak for themselves. the csm has zero power over anything.so what do the csm members do then? if they have no say in anything, then what? do a song and dance and try to make it look like they are making a difference. that or use information and to use it for personal gain breaking the dna. thus over-shadowing and tarnishing all effort on the song and dance that the rest of the csm was doing.all in all, it is still 100% whatever ccp wants. even though they say that is not the case. i wonder if incarna and dust 514 will have a csm too."
7/23/2010,"i'm a poor poor csm member and i dont know how i got into this predicamentcsm was always an advisory position anyways. we aren't game designers. ccp can take our word or not, and it looks like they're increasingly taking our input on things which is pretty cool in my opinion. anyways if they intended it to be a sham in the first place they wouldn't give us any more perks than they give isd volunteers, and they wouldn't spend all that money flying us around to places(9 people x 9 plane tickets x 9 separate hotel rooms x 8 days x time spent by at least 2 ccp employees to manage the csm).even if ccp never listens to a word we say we still win because we get free trips to iceland and a year of gametime. if it werent for the csm i will probably never go to fanfest.now mynxee is gonna all get on my case because i said free trips to iceland... i'm gonna run from this thread now"
7/23/2010,"bottom line is ccp will say all they can to make the csm sound like it is more than what it really is. that it is a pr move after the t20 incident.csm will make it sound like they are making a huge difference when they really don't matter at all. this is to have the feeling of elitism and to try and justify all the perks like free trips, free game time, etc that come with being a csm.i for one would rather see all that money spent on the csm spent on hiring more devs to work on the broken parts of this game. even if it means only one dev working part time, it would be infinitely better for the game that what little csm has accomplished."
7/23/2010,"obviously they are in a no-win situation. for the first time, imho, a csm went to iceland and actually tried to do something constructive rather than engaging in power bloc politics or narcissistic e-peen stroking contests and tried to use their alleged new ""stakeholder"" status to ask ccp to fix what we have before adding more broken stuff to the game.ccp's answer was: go get stuffed.so, yes, we now know the csm can do absolutely nothing, it is a complete farce, and frankly, the whole of csm5 should resign in protest. this will create a firestorm in the gaming press that will probably also spill over into the mainstream media.obviously ccp isn't going to listen to either the csm or common players, so if anything is to happen external pressure will have to be employed.what happened in iceland proves all of us who believed the csm was nothing more (to ccp) than a cheap pr move in the wake of the t20/band of brothers corruption scandal were correct in saying so. if ccp is serious, they need to readjust their priorities and dedicate at least one team to working on the csm's top 2 or 3 priorities."
7/23/2010,"i wouldn't expect it to see more than a paragraph about it in any gaming publication, such an event stands 0 chance of squeaking onto the mainstream, especially with darth vader turning to bank robbery."
7/23/2010,all the money spent on the csm could not hire one full time dev(do the math on that... well they could hire them if the dev worked for what passes for minimum wage in some poorer us states)also ccp cant convince someone to move to iceland so they can work part time thats silly
7/24/2010,"this thread belongs on page one, not page 2."
7/24/2010,bumpagei sure hope ccp is listening and the chutzpah to follow through on some badly needed polish work.

7/24/2010,+1new system was poorly thought out and obviously not user tested...
7/24/2010,"this seems like a very interesting concept. eve is rife with corruption, scams, and realism to a degree and to say that being able to change your name is not feasible, which realistically it is, would be absurd. ccp has done an excellent job at allowing real world scenarios to pollute new eden adding to the realism of the very serious internet spaceship realm. allowing the ability to change a capsuleer's name adds more dynamic to the game and provides more options for pilots in general. as evil put it, people buy new characters... not everyone wants to drag the associates and issues of the previous owner. yes, it makes hijacking easier, provides more difficulties with intel and tracking, creates issues with kill rights(which i believe evil pointed out an excellent method for addressing this issue), but overall just adds to the depth of the game. eve is not the easiest online game to begin with, being complex in nature, realistic. why not add more to the realism?fly safe,proclus diadochuruke coordinatorvarion galacticown alliance"
7/24/2010,"why this new topic, especially since older ones were better proposals? yes to ability to change character name, but you lack a very important part in your proposal that would make most counter arguments useless: you should be able to track characters by their old name, and searching on their new name should also give which name(s) the char used to have."
7/24/2010,"only if it leaves a permanent link in the characters bio about how the character was formerly called. without that, it would be a much too easy way to avoid consequence."
7/24/2010,"no. if you can't do what you want to do, which is take advantage of people trusting you by other means, a few you've listed, i don't see any reason to make it easier for you. the vast majority of requests to change a character name is to escape their past, the minority being 'changes' for aesthetic reasons or ""i didn't spend any time thinking about my name"", or ""i don't like my name anymore"" which also works as an excuse to hide the ""i want to take advantage of people"" crowd. it is your character, you made the face, you picked the name, if you didn't like/want it 'forever' you should have chosen something else or just sell it and get another character.the revolving door of alts and characters for sale is a problem in this game not something that needs boosting."
7/24/2010,imo a name change should be allowed for 1 time only per char per account. and what i'm thinking about here is people who buy characters off the forum and want the change it to something they like. now if that person sells that char to someone else then the new owner has the option to also change the name to something they want.

7/24/2010,"the problem with having a forum with this topic is there are so many players on eve that could care less about the forums. imo, there should be some kind of poll at the home page of eve.anyway, i think a name change, maybe only able to change it once during a specified amount of time after incarna, after which you cannot change it, would be a good idea. there are soooooo many people who would love a name change, myself included (didn't know fleet commanders call out names alphabetically at the time ) and perhaps it would be even more effective for ccp if it was a paid option? like $10 to change your name?and why not have a past names part of the show info? if you care enough to set standings or look at standings, then you wouldn't be lazy enough to not press show info on someone you are trying to view, now would you?besides, if it was a paid option ccp would make a nice buck or two off of this supported."

7/24/2010,"i had this idea and posted it when i was in the csm. ideally, it would help for pi, allowing small bonuses based on scientists, etc available. the happier they were (the more they were fed long-limb roes, entertained by exotic dancers, et al), the more they would produce. this would give purpose to the 'human cattle' and allow us to train our own citizens to serve our needs.the way ccp implemented pi, i'm not when or even if we'll ever see this come to light, especially with the new plans of ccp outlined at the latest meeting minutes. so even though it's probably way on the back burner, if even in the queue, i support this measure."
7/24/2010,"so we have one group thatying that:and another group telling me thatthat is very interesting indeed.obviously both sides completely ingnore 4 pages woth of facts and numbers. both sides demonstrate horrible lack of comprehention. both sides give arguments like slot layhout and passive recharge, which have nothing to do with the topick of fitting reqs. sinse in five pages of discussion no comprehencive counter-argument was produced, this topick should be supported."

7/24/2010,irrelevant. sp loss is a bad mechanic since it so strongly discourages pvp.
7/24/2010,"probably the single biggest reason why i won't support this proposal.don't get me wrong, i love my proteus... i just don't want to see it become the ""standard"" for ""rich-man pvp."" when i get into it, i fully accept the risk that i might die and have to retrain one of my t3 skills up a level.not supported."

7/24/2010,"it seems like just yesterday that the forums were chock full of people whining and complaining that ambulation (as we called it back then) was never going to happen and people wanted to walk in stations and what the heck was ccp thinking why weren't they doing this? now that they are doing it, we get a forum chock full of whining and complaining that fixes are never going to happen and people want fixes and what the heck is ccp thinking why aren't they doing this?just goes to show you can't make everyone happy."
7/24/2010,"while i can see definately see your point, and owuld love at least half of the ""compilation of minor ui improvements"" proposal implemented, so in battle i don't have to zoom in on the enmy ship and stare at it trying to figure out if it's uswing energy vamps on me, these features have been promiced for a loooooooooong time by now, and i can deinately see ccp whanting to finally get them done, delivered, and over with, so they are no longer hanging on ccp's back. i personally will probably never play dust, i simply will not by a console because of one game, i just don't like consoles and how limited they are compared to a pc. infact still whant the dust to be realeased and see how it wrks out, and i will probably still enjoy hiring mercenaries to brow up pi installations of that ninja salvager that jacked my ""damsiel in distress""i might toy around with walking in stations for a few weeks and forget about it, but i can understand why ccp is doing this, and so i will not support this proposal. ps: ccp, listen to csm, they are really speaking the truth."

7/24/2010,add a coolant bay to all ships if cargo is a concern or just realize you need to balance ammo/coolant material/nanite pastei like this. ideas to improve the dynamics of solo/small gang combat are generally welcome in my book
7/24/2010,"use water, a direct export from the pi materials. don't add a coolant bay, you have to balance it like cap boosters and ammo. make the module use something like 1 unit of water per module per cycle (for a crow with 3 launchers it would use 3 water every cycle). make the module just keep heat from absorbing into the other modules (and itself) but the ship still gathers heat."
7/24/2010,"right now the preview screen for all ships and their respective race is the basic caldari background you get on the thumbnail pictures. my proposal is simple, minmatar ships have minmatar backgrouns, amarr have the amarr backgrounds etc."

7/24/2010,"make moon mining in w-space possible.although this could make w-corps more profitable than they are now. this change would allow small corps to harvest some of the most exotic materials out there. rather than the ebil 0.0 blob alliances.this would shift some of the power and market monopolies of the powerbloc alliances that now hold the profitable moons which can heavily effect the moon mineral supply market.this gives 'the small guy' a greater chance of stumbling onto a valuable moon and making him into a moon mining tycoon.obviously the moon minerals that can be found should scale with the class of the resident wormhole. for example only the r64's can be found in class 5-6 and the crappier moon minerals are found in class 4,3,2 and 1 (if at all).it gives the smaller w-corps more of a chance because if you attack a valuable moon you won't _likely_ have multiple titans and lag wars when it comes out of reinforced. also the logistics of keeping a c5-6 pos up and running is far more involved than a 0.0 r64 within alliance controlled space.edit: this is somewhat of a way to manage moon mineral prices as well, as when prices for a certain moon mineral spike, more people head to w-space in order to find a moon bearing that mineral."
7/24/2010,"in a way, i do kind of like this idea.i don't know how it'd work for balance, and if anything were implemented it had better be after the economy fluctuations from pi settle down, but w-space /is/ uniquely at an advantage in this area for the simple reason it's almost impossible to hold multiple systems.that said.. it's already a difficult, if not impossible proposition for more than one corporation to have a presence in a system. between this and pi making it easier to refuel w-space pos's, i think that situation might be clinched utterly."
7/24/2010,"i sort of think this would bring back 'true exploration'. as nearly all of the eve universe is mapped and catalogued, whereas w-space is so shifting and changing, even if there was a database similar to the moon map project for w-space, getting to the systems with the good moons is gonna be a mission."
7/24/2010,"why it would be nice, i sure as hell don't whant to see null-sec allliences filling up all valuable moons in wh space wiht their towers in near absolute safety (for them)what i would like instead, is for the resources to shift and change, true to the nature of unknown space, every resource would only last so long (a week? two weeks?) before it is depleted, and another random resource would spawn on a random moon int he same system, could be useless gas, could be tecnetioum. a system of such unpredictable natuere wouldprevent null-sec alliences from setting up shops there, too muc organisational hassle, but would reward small entities. something of spawn-farm- wait for next one nature."
7/24/2010,no it wouldn't. it would just draw the mega alliances into w-space. and i really don't care to see them there.
7/24/2010,pi in w-space makes only with moonmining any sence.its just wrong that you can have a whole colony with all extra stuff but not some mining on a single moon with a station from space. both or nothing should be allowed.
7/24/2010,"i wonder why they didn't revamp moon mining to be more like pi, not exactly the same of course but still something more dynamic."
7/24/2010,"no, he is simply suggesting you to go and take the pvp to the enemy mission runners.or your only way to be happy is to remove options from other players?"
7/24/2010,i want to involve more people in pvp. the higher missions reward is a good stimulus.
7/24/2010,"while i agree it would be nice if we could get better rewards for pvp, due to exploits i don't think they can boost it much.many people appearently have alts in different militias. they will just put them in insured t1 ships and blow them up for the lp."
7/24/2010,how would you measure pvp success? do the people who have thousands of kills but got most of them in a logi or ewar ship count as being successful in pvp or are you going to do it by top damage dealer on the km in which case you push militia into using larger more expensive ships and unfairly penalize new people or those who can't afford to fly faction or t2 ships.

7/24/2010,not suported :(you have compleatly missed the t2 rig market . . . .they are the equivilent of ur proposal
7/24/2010,supported. never has a ship model been so wasted by being only a single-run design.specifically in favour of option 3.
7/24/2010,"eh, i'll support this one, and strongly.while the thread's a bit on the extreme side, and i recognise there are issues, i've had it up to here with all the shrieking about the developer's current plan (especially the erroneous claims all space-bound content, fixing, and optimisation is completely and utterly on hold for 18 months), and hope to god they continue to ignore it.not that they can pull back on it, if you ask me. incarna is too far along for it to be anything but a financial disaster to abort it, and putting it on hold would only create more problems, including at least one largely wasted development cycle from reassigning staff and resources.for one, i do not want an eve where everything was fixed early because of screaming children, instead of being a proper development focus as they plan on it being, only for a mass-pile of expansions from incarna, dust, and the rest of planetary interaction to break everything all over again, and possibly take another few years to get fixed due to resources already having been burned in a previous, redundant fix-scramble. that might even do serious damage to eve, way more than a year or so's continuation of the current state (complete with the usual continuous, tertiary-priority fixing along the way) could do."
7/24/2010,i was looking for a list of csm's and found this:
7/24/2010,new and or inexperienced players typically take less of an interest in the community and everything else that surrounds eve - so how are you going to get them to vote?
7/24/2010,i just think it would make the player representation more balanced if there was a younger representative in the csm - like a reserved employee chair in corporate boards.edit: not sure how it could be implemented - perhaps the departing csm and ccp agree on 3 nominations
7/24/2010,"new players do not know about the csm. veteran players do. i work with new people all the time in eve. this is from my candidate page for the last election.i have started a video training program to go along with this. saves me the time of doing classes and people can re watch at leisure.i actually got about 40-60% fewer votes then i had expected this last election while presuing the ""newbie"" vote.an actual new player on the csm would be difficult.- eve is a deep game and new players have not waded far enough to know enough about the broader aspects.- a new player will not have enough reputation in eve to gain enough votes. the csm is largely a popularity contest. qualified people do make it in for the most part but good people are left out because they are not ""a crowd"" enough.- as stated, the main constituency is unaware of the election so do not/can not vote for the newbie.there are some other points but i forgot them while typing (just woke up and eating breakfast while typing this).while i am more focused on entry level pvp it exposes me to the newbie experience. equally important is that i hear and have to come up with answers to what the newbies are dealing with. you don't hand a 2 week old pilot a t2 fitted hac and say ""fly this"". you give them a meta 1 fitted cruiser or frig instead.i do think the csm and ccp is missing an important element without having me there (any worthy csm candidate could say the same). there are many people with the same agenda both at ccp and in the csm and my views are defiantly outliers. that is a good thing to shake up the group think but, group think is what gets people elected in the first place."
7/24/2010,"absolutely not. eve is one of the deepest games short of something like chess or go. it's got a famously steep learning curve and people can and do spend years learning about small subsets of the entire game. experts in, say, fleet pvp aren't generally experts in market manipulation, and they aren't generally experts in lowsec ganking and they aren't generally experts in running a lvl 4 high mission running corp and they... what benefit would it be to have a bunch of green players giving input directly to ccp? we generally want people who are knowledgeable and experienced. new players simply aren't."
7/24/2010,"by ""we"" i assume that you mean ""you""? just because you have many years experience in the game does not neccessarily make you better at it. i have met quite a few veteran noobs in this game, who has absolutely no clue about some of the newer features.furthermore, having a csm ""representing"" the new generation capsuleers will not cut it - it's like asking your grandmother to show up for a focus group in college. i would like to see a 6 month - 1 year old capsuleer on the csm - just my humble opinionedit: check ccp zulu's last paragraph in the dev blog - we obviously need to improve things on our side as well - it takes two to tango"
7/24/2010,no. the eve community and/or people who want quality representatives want to make sure that their reps are both knowledgeable and experienced. of course it will. experienced players know what tools a new player needs and what areas can use improvement. new players don't even know what those areas are.
7/24/2010,re 1: i do believe i'm part of the community and i disagree on experience. reminds me of the peter principle: promoted to incompetencere 2: strongly disagree - what tools did you use x years ago? what tools do new generation players need? there is a related topic here:
7/24/2010,"i said ""we in general"". you're allowed to want someone who can't possibly speak as an authority on any part of eve other than not knowing what they're doing, but that doesn't make them a good person to suggest anything to ccp. and no, new players today don't need anything all that specific. you seem to have missed the point that now they even have a wiki. when i started, we only had the dramatically incomplete tutorial, and we still learned how to play the game. we don't need csm delegates whose contribution will be to talk about all the things they don't understand."
7/24/2010,"i started this thread just because i was curious if it had been suggested and discussed before. the responses i have seen confirms to me that we really need a couple of younger pilots on the csm.btw: i rest my case, the tutorials and career missions are excellent. they give a good introduction to the general features in eve. you should try the new advanced combat or exploration - just hit f12"
7/24/2010,"there is slight chance i will not be able to participate on the meeting due to rl commitments. i will give my best to attend the meeting, but i want to apologize in advance if i dont make it."
7/24/2010,"its interesting that people think my observation that ""ccp is abandoning eve"" = ""i am going to rage quit."" logic is not easily taught so i won't try, other than to say that is a non sequitur. as to the poster who said they are working on eve i think i quoted the part about the one small bit they are going to throw us. i don't know what to make of it. the subsequent dev blog by zulu basically verified that the vast majority if ccp resources will be spent on things other than spaceships. i have heard the number of people they listed for dust only includes those interfacing with eve.(accordinly there are many more employees than what was listed working on dust) moreover i thought there was some other games ccp was working on beside dust incarna and eve. (again proving that the percentage of resources spent on eve spaceships is even tinier.) so i think the headline of this post is fairly well substantiated and no longer even controversial. does that mean i will quit? no they aren't changing eve for the worse. (although i thought tyranis did indeed make the game slightly worse with cost of battlships and would prefer they ""untyranis"" eve. that is relatively minor) they just aren't making it better either. eve spaceships aint gonna change much in the next 2 years."
7/24/2010,"if that is the case (assuming what you say is true) then spending even one dollar more on it's development is asinine.this does bring up a salient point with respect to console vs pc... when you develop for console, you are at the mercy and whim of the console's manufacturer. the pc is open to everyone. so is the mac."
7/24/2010,"if i understood correctly, combat expansion is a combat ui update, where ccp will improve the way battle-related information is displayed, so, perhaps csm should get right on with what they whant to see included in that expansion, how interface should be changed, (overloading? direction dectors?). i would consider that important."
7/24/2010,"yes what you suggest would be nice, i agree. since they didn't mention any ui changes in the discussion specifically about ui i'm thinking they meant something else. that is why i ask what could they mean by that.i'm thinking it they might mean the maps will better indicate where ships are being blown up in surrounding areas. which would be not so great. but it could also mean they will revamp the tactical overlay - which could be very good. whatever ""it"" is ""it"" is the only thing that seems to involve eve and unfortunately we don't know what i""t"" is. i'm assuming its covered under the nda so csm can't talk about it."
7/24/2010,"this is extremely unfair and biased statement. as someone who was part of csm 2, 3, 5 and had close friend and ingame mate in csm 4 i can say that there was never any power bloc bull**** involved, nor e-peen crap. i cant talk about csm 1, but it was never the case after."
7/25/2010,"man, i'm not sure if you guys at ccp are paying attention, but it looks like your players don't care about incarna and dust as much as you hoped, or do...it almost...almost looks like they want your attention spent on other issues..i don't know, i've been wrong before...but i have a feeling about this.but hey, its your paycheck, ruin it anyway you want."
7/25/2010,"should it be pointed out that dust isn't being made for eve players. i mean, if eve players want to play with dust great, if not, fine. it's targeting a different demo on a different plateform. incarna, also, will likely bring back old players that left eve because they anticpated wis much sooner, and left eve in protest. also, if incaran is done right, i think they are hoping to appeal more to a female audience which might increase their subscription base. wod whenever it comes out, won't be targeting anyone who is currently playing eve or dust at the time, though it will be open to them, it will be focused on creating a new market/player base for ccp.. if those products are successful, dust, and wod could double/tripple ccp's revenue. no game company can expect to survive off a single game forever. the fact that ccp has survived on eve alone for so long is remarkable. and ccp is smart to diversify while eve still has a robust subscriber base. hopefully, eve as at least as many years ahead as it does behind it. but, you don't hang your hat up on hope in business. instead, you make plans, and create you own opportunities for growth, and ccp's best way to reach brand new customers is to develop new games. to retain old customers, of course they should continue balancing, and they should fix bugs, and keep interest in eve high by adding new content to it and tweaking current in game features. and they do that, as those things become available. every patch is all about that, and every major expansion has some patch like adjustments. just because there is no major emphasis on it, doesn't mean there isn't a team or two taksed with working on performance/debugging/exploit/balance issues. someone at ccp is always working on those issues. i think the whole csm minutes thing was miscommunicated, and was misunderstood very badly. and while the fallout might be a good kick in the ass for ccp to bump up some issues they've qued up forever ago; but a lot of bull**** is getting thrown in for good measure. it would be bad for everyone if every bad idea that appears on these forums stuck to this issue as needed ""improvements"" to lowsec/nullsec, etc. ps: if you want to know what dev's are saying, and paying attention to, use the dev finder featuer on this website, and you will get shortcut links to all of their forum posts."
7/25/2010,"that's a very reasonable point but it should also be remembered that dust isn't making them any money. investing income from eve to develop other eve-related games is fine, it's a good basic strategy and i think ccp are smart to do it.but neglecting the source of their income - and tarnishing the core game on which these others depend* - yeah, not so smart. mmos are about investment, the player invests his time, effort and emotional energy in to the game, because mmos reward that. threaten that investment by neglecting bugs that compromise gameplay and leave players with the perception that things will only get worse, and what do you have? a ui that makes us all nostalgic for windows for workgroups, and a rts miningame with npc ai that would make the guys who programmed doom go ""meh"".* make no mistake, dust's success absolutely depends on eve continuing to thrive. if ccp refocus on polishing eve, then i'm mildly optimistic about dust. i don't think it will ever really challenge halo or the other top-tier games, but it could give ccp a steady second income without cannibalizing their existing players. i know ccp said that dust can work without eve, but take away the eve connection and what do you have left? just another late to the party console shooter that has to compete against the likes of halokind, which has an annual advertising budget equal to about 3 years of ccp's turnover, and a huge established player-base."
7/25/2010,"a post of excellence right there.is ccp striving to become like blizzard? make games for cash and not for players. but wait ... blizz doesn't release half baked stuff.i have many concerns about the game and currently the only thing that keeps me playing are awesome people i've met in the game.my main concern is the ui as this is where the interaction with the game starts. it is trurly dreadful ... worst ui of all games of all time. you should get a award for the dreadful ui of yours ccp.first of all the dreaded clicking. redesign it so that more than half of the commands can be issued from the keyboard. do you want mass rsi epidemic? who's gonna play the game then ...ergonomy is on its ass and crying. lack of customization whatsoever. why cannot we place whatever we want wherever we want? its like using windows 1.0 while the current standard is linux with compiz or the like. why can't i remove the toolbar from the left or place it on top, bottom, or the left side. why cannot you implement a feature that displays everyone who's jamming me and what kind of stuff is coming at me. why can't i place my targets like on the sides or totally redesign module placement.i mean cmoooooooooooooooon, there is so much wrong with the ui only that i don't know where to start.ccp, no sweet pr bull**** nor honey glazed marketing talk will blind your players. your playersbase is not stupid and you will start losing them if you don't stop fake sugar icing and start fixing the game according to our feedback.more to come ...dierdra vaal, i salute you.full support."

7/25/2010,supported 100%!
7/25/2010,"if you're talking about pi clicking, you may have a point that it could use some hotkeys, etc., but the game i play lets me avoid clicking in terms of activitating mods on my ship. you can even set some drone commands onto hotkeys, though this part could be improved. you can even control ship speed using hotkeys. (though i don't think you can change directions using them currently.) and i get to see ""what's coming after me"" on my overview, because i see if they are using a scam, or disruptor, or ecm, or dampner, or vamp, or nuet.... it's there in the overview. if you're not seeing that, your playing eve wrong! :-d i do wish they'd allow camera control for the dir keys, this would be great for precise directional scanning, and a method to hit the scan without clicking. and they could use secondary number keys for changing direction by artificially double clicking the related corner of the screen for you. so, your point is not without merit. but, eve has such a massively open interface, that you can't absoultely hotkey everything and allow ppl to still talk trash in local. i've actually done some work on control mapping before to suit my own expectations for other games with ****ty controls. and from that hobby-level learning experience, i'm pretty sure you would have to instance the market, and assets, and all that other crap, instead of intergrating them ontop of the primary ui if players want a hot key for absolutely every possible command in the game. and i'm not sure players would like that option any better than the current one since multi-tasking is a regularity in eve."

7/25/2010,"ccp need to absolutely take a step back and look at things. dominion was a flop - there has been very little 00 space changing hands since dominion was released.there has been no alliance sprawl reduction, which was a key goal.treaties were not introduced, which are a critical component.the promised ""continuous improvements to the system"" are not happening. that isn't excellence to me, regardless of the number of resources allocated. faction warfare, lowsec, and fixing the problems in 00 once and for all should be 3 high priorities of ccp, yet we don't see them prioritized at all."

7/25/2010,"let me re-write the possible rules that could be implemented : - it can be done only once per account, (to help those who realy need it, that way it cant be farmed)- you can buy back up to 1 year worth of game time maximum, (so an old character woudnt be a possible monster)- the number of sp available is based on the average sp per month the character chosen has trained, (if an old toon just played 2 months, the average sp he did in those 2 first months are quite low, so even if he decide to buy a year back, it wont mean alot of sp)and i could add a new rule :- the process cant be done on a transfered character. (characters have to be created from scratch in the account to be eligible)with all these rules and ccp could add even more, it will target those who realy need it and with the features already available in eve, this is just another one in the same league.resum<U+FFFD> : whats the difference between paying now or paying the same later ? p.s : to those that post after this, if you dont support this idea, be sure to read everything that was said before posting. thx"
7/25/2010,"hey, your first thread went wrong, you should defintiely have reposted the idea, so you can get the same response.sollution that doesn't take any more of the extremely poorly spent dev time:don't buy alts with dumb names, don't make alts with dumb names."
7/25/2010,"actually the first one went 9 pages. other than all of the moaning from player's who've been scammed and seem to think their vendetta against the player actually affects his/her game play, it was successful.there have been topics voted on by the csm that had many fewer supporters, and much more moaning.how many of you are the same players who desire 'realism' in your internet spaceship game? well, it isn't that difficult to do in the us. illegal yes, but difficult not as hard as some would have you believe. if you want 'realism' allow only outlaws to change their name. if you don't want people to change their name everyday, set a timer to allow players to change their name every 6 months. the potential revenue for ccp, it makes me wonder why they've not done this already.really, i don't think we should be deciding what restrictions or how it should be implemented. i'm just requesting that it get some dev time. proposing the idea of changing your character name. let them decide the proper way and restrictions, that's what they get paid to do."
7/25/2010,i click on threads posted by jason edwards because i know it's a troll. this particular thread is so bad it's actually pretty funny.
7/25/2010,i say if that's a good idea then corps should be able to buy empire space or take it.
7/25/2010,that actually sounds very impractical. 0.0 alliances have much more important things to do with their isk than waste it on help for concord.
7/25/2010,"there are plenty of mercenary corporations (noir, for example) who would be happy to provide this service for you.the troll is dead."
7/25/2010,infact that's another idea i have posted. we should start moving highsec stations toward being player owned; and thusly system owned.
7/25/2010,"imagine a ship which is able to set a hologram on itself which makes you look 100% like a rat. it's just that you do show up on local, but not directionals. at any time you can drop the hologram and start to attack the person.while you are transformed however. if you are only a frig, your ship is as weak as what you pretend to be.chain ratters beware."
7/25/2010,"had this idea years ago, but you see how far it went.essentially a modified cloak that uses a script to make the ship using it look like the scripted ship while it's active. the scripts are blank when purchased off of the market and the target vessel has to be 'scanned' to imprint on the loaded script blank... whereupon it's used and can't be re-sold.the vessel using the script still has all of its passive traits; all the holo-cloak does is change what it looks like on overview (transponder & em signature) until it deactivates the cloak to attack.so... if you can scan a faction rat, say, like a dark blood raider, it'll be all the easier to sucker in the ratters. :)"
7/25/2010,"and what happens should a ratter eventually lock and shoot your ship while you're ""cloaked""? should concord come to kill him or should he have the right to finish killing you?regards, lax"

7/25/2010,"ccp stubbornly refuses to stop breaking our beloved game. they ignore a vastly popular and supported proposal to focus on excellence. they devote the vast majority of their development resources to making eve into an avatar-based game, seemingly oblivious of the fact that those of us who have played this game for years had lots of first-class avatar-based games to choose from and we instead chose to play internet spaceships. they give less weight to csm proposals than they do to the most harebrained scheme of their newest hire. now they're launching ccp-sanctioned events. ccp, end your anti-sandbox, unethical mentality. you get paid to keep new eden running smoothly. the game is for the players, not for ccp. the players overwhelmingly want you to focus on excellence. focus on excellence. events in new eden should be player-driven, not ccp driven. it's not all about you. in fact, it's not about you at all.if i were making a videogame, i would be tempted (for a moment, at least) to give myself uber-characteristics (or indestructible spaceships with massive dps.) i would be tempted to name the annual gathering of players 'fanfest' as though my customers were somehow nothing more than a bunch of clueless fanbois. i would be tempted to take advantage of moon goo exploits. i would be tempted to invent t2 bpo lotteries so that i could have an ez mode passive income. i would be tempted to give my alliance mates their titans back after they blow up or let them keep their accounts after they use hacks to gain decisive tactical advantage in combat. i would be tempted to make the game all about me by hosting officially sanctioned 'stickied' events instead of trying to promote the same event on my (anonymous) toon. i would be tempted to copy other successful mmo's instead of staying true to the spirit of the game that the current playerbase loves.then i'd stop being a ****er and realize i'm getting paid to make eve, a dark, complex, unforgiving, sandbox game, better for the players who (directly or indirectly) pay my salary and i'd get back to work fixing the game i've been busy breaking for the last few years."
7/25/2010,"these ccp whines are starting to get old. i think ccp has heard us by now, we already have one massive thread-naught whine and i think that's enough, they will ether listen or not. so ether stop whining or put your money where your mouth is and stop paying?"

7/25/2010,"so stacking weapons reduces lag. how about we stack ships? we all know commandships are pretty useless relative to their training time. so how about a fleet fuser ability that cs have that will fuse ships. so i'm flying an eos and i fuse together say 5 megathrons to form uberthron. they act as a single identity. in terms of hp and ability to move around and such. movement and such gets controlled by the eos. firing of weapons and local mods get controlled by the individual ships.to the enemy it's a single entity to shoot. it has an eos for a head, megathron body, megathron arms and megathron legs.limitations:-you cannot use jumpgates while stacked.-your disco users will stay in space until they normally would disappear if they had been scrambled. when they disco you lose the equivalent hp and everything.-your speed is the weakest link's speed and no propulsion mods allowed.-no rr possible.-you take damage evenly and cant disassemble quickly.-only bs/cs allowed-increased mass somewhat-shared cap could be a negative if most are newbs-huge sig, everything whoops u. except titan dd if you're big enough.pros:-local tanks and local buffers benefit everyone.-lag go bye bye.-fleet leaders in cs get to control movement and warping.-100 megathrons are awesome cakes-immune to certain types of ewar; essentially a supercap.-increased mass makes bumping supercaps fun and easy.-shared cap could be a positive in that it makes neuting very hard. essentially you're trying to neut the entire fleet at once."
7/25/2010,"i think it would be op as when you did enough damg to kill one ship it would still be there in your plan but i ma new to the game so not sure if i am right , i mean if it was a 5 ship stack and i did 1/5 damg to his hp it should lose 1/5 of its dps or module output or what ever"
7/25/2010,"posting in a jason edwards troll.needless to say, bad idea is bad."
7/25/2010,"lol @ unkillable blob, who need titans?"
7/25/2010,"good point. how about an equivalent weapon hp pool. so while overloading is possible. your modules all take damage also while being attacked; not evenly across all ships and thusly people would lose modules at random. thusly if 20% of the armor is gone. so is 20% the module's hp and 20% of the modules. perhaps that would make overloading of modules on the stacked ships not very plausible in most circumstances?sounds very interesting.well 100 bs vs titan wouldnt be all that manageable as it is. titan is a different beast. moreover, we are talking about the blobs anyhow. if the 100bs wasnt killable... then ur not trying hard enough."

7/25/2010,"a 30 day cycle on a moon would look like this:for the first five days, the ratio of the original mineral vs the new mineral goes down by 20% per day. so, if for example we mine a cadmium moon, on day 1 it would be 80% cad and 20% tech. then, on day 2 the ratio goes down to 60% cad and 40% tech. until on day 6 it reaches a 100% tech ratio. the 100% tech would then last for 20 days. on day 26 we would start to see a new mineral that was depleted somewhere else in the universe. so, for example, your moon could produce 80% tech and 20% cobalt.however, if at any point no mining is being done on the moon, the cycle halts. the moon has to be mined in order to get to the next element. once a mineral is mined out, it would respawn randomly to a new moon somewhere else. so, to summarize:example moon:day 0: 100% cadmiumday 1: 80% cadmium 20% technetiumday 2: 60% cadmium 40% technetiumday 3: 40% cadmium 60% technetiumday 4: 20% cadmium 80% technetiumday 5-25: 100% technetiumday 26: 80% technetium 20% cobaltday 27: 60% technetium 40% cobaltday 28: 40% technetium 60% cobaltday 29: 20% technetium 80% cobaltday 30: 100% cobalt -cycle starts again-a form of dynamic moon mining like this would bring back moon probing as a profession and provide incentive to go after moons that show evidence of going from a so so element to the flavor of the month in demand element. this would also give low sec dwellers a shot at having some decent income without having to challenge the larger moon holding groups.some of you will scream that the logistics of having to have a small low end moon mining operation to strip the crap away only to build a large death star to protect the high end stuff is too much work. well, no one said you had to put up a massive death star for that high end minerals and no one said you had to put up a small defenseless tower either. how you go about trying to get out the resources is up to you. you could go with a medium as a middle ground or maybe because it is at your home system a large death star is not needed because your fleet is the defense. having small and medium size towers also helps give small to medium sized gangs something to pew at in case the defenders decide to run and hide from your roaming gang.the duration of cycles and such is debatable but ultimatly it is a balancing thing that is best left the the devs. it does not seem to be terribly hard to implement. please leave constructive feedback and help polish this idea into something that is best for the game."
7/25/2010,what? everyone is content with how static moons are? my proposal would promote conflict and get rid of the static isk facets that is the current moon situation. it would not be bias to regions or subject to critisim of favoritism in case ccp decides to change what is fotm moon goo.comments?
7/25/2010,"actually, its a design flaw in the game mechanics that the op and his supporters are failing to take into account.none of the vital ewar mods are low slots, thus seriously threatening your tank if you were to properly fit them, plus the cpu intensive mods of shields in general get in the way of the cpu intensive mods that are all ewar mods, coupled with the fact that shield tanks have overall higher sigs, and thus take higher damage from incoming fire, means that no matter what you do, the shield tanks will stay inferior, and armor tanks will be used.why shield tank when you can armor tank and use up 6 mids for tackle and ewar? why shield tank when you can speed/sig tank with armor? the list goes on, and the arguments from the ""your dumb"" side are based on a larger view of game mechanics than the ""i want shield rr gangs naow damnit"" gang. to really see shield tanked rr gangs around, your going to need to see more changes than just some cpu issues, but people seem to be ignoring this, so w/e, lower the cpu cost, i'll fit some extra **** somewhere on my scimitar.oh, also, for the scrub crowd thats crying about the lack of shield rr gangs, they happen, a lot, if you took some time out of your rage posting, and trolled some killboards, you'd see shield rr gangs, just not battleships.""well thats the problem, we want bs shield rr gangs"", cool, field one, and then sit and watch your huge siged bs gang get insta nuked by a load of bombers (pro tip: bombs are also sig dependent)."
7/25/2010,"5 mids is insufficient. rrbs need a point, and/or sensorbooster, and/or eccm, and or web/scram. that puts us at 7-8 mids. i will just repeat here that the problem is not the fitting requirements of the modules, but the ships.you're an idiot skor. and you don't listen. look at the cpu requirements. it's like you won't even take a second and think about what you are saying. and you're a big headed ***. you won't consider anything. people like you ruin the game, and any confidence in the csm. next time we all might as well vote all goons.edit: spelling"
7/25/2010,"has no one ever heard of tacklers? who honestly uses a bs to catch anything when you can have people flying t1 frigs and intys and do the job better. fyi there are eccm low slot mods as well they just aren't as good. if changing cpu need to 0 won't increase the frequency of shield rr gangs what is the harm in lowering the fitting requirements by 50% or so (obviously if 0% of current makes no difference then 50% of current will also make no difference)?the reason of ""we shouldn't change something that is obviously broken because it won't make a difference in our fotm fleets"" isn't really viable. warfare in eve changes from one fad to the next so often it baffles me as to why an option should be gimped because the mod to make it work takes up 20% of the available cpu on a bs meant to shield tank.yet again shield recharge rate in the current call primary -> melt -> repeat style of combat is trivial. when a fleet can literally alpha bc's your passive recharge means nothing i know of no bs passive shield tank that can sustain 2,000+ dps.do i think shield tanking will ever become more powerful than armor tanking? no, the ships meant to shield tank have more issues then just fitting ability but that doesn't mean we shouldn't make the option available for those who want to try."
7/25/2010,"excellent idea. it's been bugging me too. oh, and whoever states that bs will get too high signatures from fielding shield tanks should think again. they are goddamn battleships. they take full damage already.and sokratetz, a perfectly good idea that was clarified extremely well on page one. and you're trolling your own boards with completely irrelevant arguments that have nothing to do with rr, like ""buhu buhu battleships use xl boosters"". goddamn illitirate git. you shoudln't sit on the council."
7/25/2010,"imagine you're a small gang. you the parasite jump into a system you tackle a guy in a belt. you the parasite come to 0m and you attach onto the ship. this gives your enemy extra shields, extra armor, extra structure. you then share your collective hp and cap. you become 1 ship. you cant shoot each other; you can shoot others. any damage you take is taken collectively.furthermore, so now your buddies are coming in hot. his buddies are coming in hot. you can use your collective cap and such to shoot at his friends. your host can shoot your friends. the key will be that you can jump off anytime you want. the method of de-parasiting can be using pos shields or docking."

7/25/2010,"the multitude of this kinds of posts astound me. and other dev blogs already address this issue. (you don't want all the artist/graphic standard programmer guys they hired to be working on the lag issues... it's not what they do. you want the even more ubber smart genuis level programers that specialize in lag issue working on it. if they put everyone on this ""issue"" including the interns and janitor there is a lot they wouldn't get done as a company--and the entire eve-code would be corrupted by unspecialized inaptitude. the best thing you can do is put the the best people for this job on it, and let the people who do other things better do what they do best. and this about timescales too much too fast? they've spent what like five or six years developing the incarna thing beyond closed doors? been adapting it to consolebased fps called dust for the past 3 years and putting at least another year of polish on it before releasing it? and are only doing conceptual level work on wod, which may not come out for another 4 or 5 years from now. all the while they have relentlessly added to eve twice a year since it began? when i look back at what they've done. i see that they have paced themselves considerably on other projects while keeping eve their primary focus, and their frequent comments (direct responses) to the community should show their level of commitment to this mmo remains strong. personally, i haven't had much dissapointment with eve's performance over the past 18 months, so i don't know what all the groaning is about. i live mostly in lowsec, because i don't enjoy the tatics used in 00 to blob blobs with bigger blobs... been there, and done that. my take away from that is, once they make 5000 man fleets stable and lag free, all you guys will be massing 6000 man fleets up just to keep it unstable and push the envelope of what's possible because many fc's in 00 seem to want to use lag as tatic especially when defending. eventually, iff ccp weeds out all server-side lag, there is still going to be isp lag, and as isp's get better, the bottlenecks aren't in the server at all, or the isp, or even the client's code, but in how many of your pilots actually have high performance pc rigs, as opposed to low end compatiable ones. lag is a multi-issue problem, and not just one thing, and will never go away completely. eve will always have it's performance limitations no matter how many resrouces ccp devotes to it. and i'm still amazed it works at all, because if you haven't noticed, a lot of mmo's or games with moo features, don't let you group together at nearly the scales that ccp's eve has always tried to allow. they push the envelope of performance just by letting us share one universe. you may protest and say you're the guy with the solo vaga on some isolated 00 gate, but from what i've read, that doesn't matter much if those giant fleets are nearby on the same node as you. and i personally thought dominion changes would reduce the need for blobs and that alliances would spread out their attack fleets because they no longer have to knock down 20 pos's to gain sov in a system, but from the sound of things it's the same old same ol' stuff. ps: ccp has repeatedly asked for mass particpation in fleet flights on sisi to diagnose and treat the problems. i'm sure it would be benificial if the ppl who experienced this issue the most, were part of that testing each time they announce a fleet-test date."

7/25/2010,"the whole point of the csm is to elect experienced pilots because they know what the hell is going on, therefore making them able to render good decisions, therefore enabling them to communicate ideas and suggestions to ccp more effectively."
7/25/2010,"not correct - this is the point of the csm: ""the council of stellar management (csm) is a player-elected council to represent the views of the players to ccp"" ("
7/25/2010,"if an able, articulate and insightful new player successfully runs for csm, than that's excellent. more power to him or her, i say.but a csm seat specifically reserved for one interest group? not so excellent. should we also have a seat reserved for female players? miners? pirates?"
7/25/2010,"no objections to a new player being on the csm, the new player experience has changed a lot and many of us jaded oldtimers may not have experienced it in the current form. however, i'm strongly opposed to reserved seats for any group. a new player getting elected by demonstrasting strong communication skills and informed opinions will have earned his place, someone getting in just because a slot has to be filled won't.alternatively, i'll settle for a reserved seat for 30-somethings currently having their morning coffee while watching the warmup show for today's f1 race and posting jaded stuff on the internet."
7/25/2010,"hey, look at me. i'm relatively new (2.5 years), and until i ran for csm i had near-zero forum presence. supporting newbies is definitely something on my radar because it's clearly a retention issue (and more players = more iskies for ccp = more resources = hopefully, more time spent polishing). in fact, it and the ui are slowly becoming two major themes i am working on during this session.one thing i would like to see is for some of the players to get together and develop a really good ""clueless newbie's guide to new eden"" that picks up where the npe leaves off (and the npe should point to it). there's a lot of good content in the wiki at present, but it is a bit scattered and needs to be organized in a better way.ashina, your videos (and other people's) would fit in quite nicely there.ps: technically speaking, i do represent the younger generation of eve players, since my 17 year old son plays eve. which means every week or so he slouches up to me with some sob story (""dad, my bs got blown up"") and mooches 100m off me. eve really is a sandbox game..."
7/25/2010,"do or should the csm members take an interest in new player experience/issues of course. should some 6 month to 12 month new player be on the csm, depends on the player. the main drawback for a newbie is they don't understand or have any real idea about loads of the game so when those issues come up they have much more work to do, assuming 'work' will cut it to contribute or otherwise be unengaged in the discussion, ie an empty seat. most of csm issues are things that players have been dealing with for quite a while, *if* the new player isn't interested in the game they probably haven't tried out various things or played in varying ways this is a handicap for being a valued member of the csm. only when a fresh view of a new player, which boils down to not knowing things, could their voice be useful. i don't see how veterans, some only a couple years old are so disconnected they can't grasp a new players view by simply trying. there is also ccp looking at the new player experience as they do want new players and would like to keep them. i'd say first more new players should get involved, voting would help, on the forums reading and participating before some call for a new player, any new player is championed to represent them. absolutely a new player could do well but it depends on how active/interested in the game they are. just having a new player on to represent new players is a bad idea, what the csm doesn't need is someone who's views are based on not knowing things or being inexperienced. csm is a new experience for most players, not all of them have been involved in this sort of software development situation."

7/26/2010,"what exactly would prevent me as a bounty hunter from contacting the target of the mission and splitting the rewards? this seems like the first thing to do, since you get the full bounty from podding and additional npc rewards. this system would make the exploiting harder, but it doesn't prevent it and the npc rewards will encourage people to create ways to exploit the reward mechanism. people will go for the most efficient ways over intended ways of playing in all systems, so it needs to be considered.issues with the payments should also be considered. a pod is worthless to the target and you still get full rewards and some extra juicy npc rewards, that presumably you can't get from other sources. this seems like an open invitation for exploitation of the feature. i would also like to see the percentage of the reward be tied to in some way to the ship type you destroy. killing a nood ship or a shuttle should not you get high rewards, since the purpose of a bounty system in eve is to inflict pain on the target. if the system can't guarantee that pain, there really isn't much point in using it from the point of view of the victim. killing a worthless vessel wouldn't achieve this and would allow another way to pump the rewards artificially again, so this should not be allowed.this idea has some good things in it as it makes the exploiting harder, but it doesn't prevent it and encourages it by offering aditional npc rewards as a bonus. the current system is useless, but i don't want to see it replaced by a system, that has the same basic issues and can additionally be used to farm npc rewards by only using basic communication between players. if the npc rewards are useless, there is no reason to put them in in the first place. if they are lucrative enough, most users of the system might very well be people seeking to farm those rewards. this isn't to say all these issues can't be solved or mitigated to the point they become non-issues, but they need to be addressed before devs waste any of their time on this especially since it seems to require extensive work to achieve."
7/26/2010,"in answer to your first question: nothing... nothing stops anybody from contracting the outlaw and spliting the money with him. but what, in your opinion, would someone do who promised you to split the money while he suffers from no consequences if he doesnt keep his word? i'm calling this the ""scumbag-factor"", sounds neat, doesn't it? ^^now, the payment and the lp store are to be balanced i agree. the ratio of payment from kill to podkill however, is a single variable easy to be changed. (the same goes for fixing rockets so i guess my argumentation suffers from ccps lack of enthusiasm )on a more general view: by creating a system of any kind, be it a computergame or the ""law of taxation"" you will always have loopholes and you will always have people who will search and, eventually, find them. the only thing you can do is to make explotation less worthwhile.the proposed system if far less susceptible to exploitation than the current one which is, in my opinion, absolutely worthless. if you set a bounty on someones head you can be sure that he will be the one who gets this money. that's not how this is supposed to work.i think ccp should focus on these ""little"" things to make eve more immersive and to give the game more depth in places where a single player might end up playing a few hours per day (don't worry, the alliance politics etc. have more than enough depth if you ask me)regards, lax+1 still supported =)edited for spelling... and i didn't have to add a shiny picture of my new outpost to make reading the text more worthwhile *wink wink*"
7/26/2010,"i like the idea.as for the bounty-hunter contacting the target and making an arraignment to split reward for easy kill, this can easily be avoided by placing a 'gag' order on the bounty-hunter while the mission is active which should drastically reduce the chance of exploitation. quite basically the bounty-hunter is 'blocked' or 'censored'. i'm sure vent or team speak could be used to overcome this but it would take a lot of time and effort to find someone that knows someone who knows someone that can get a message to the target. now about fleet/corp members involved..........?*demichael crimson hands that off to someone else*"
7/26/2010,"i'm on the fence about that, it works for eve possible scams but as someone else put it who is going to trust that:a) the rewards are justifiable b) the rewards existc) the bounty hunter will honor the dealoverall this idea for revamping the system is a good one. i'd like there to be some more to it but ccp isn't going to do it and certainly won't do all the things we'd like to see so i won't bother with much more than saying i support this."
7/26/2010,"i think this would be a great element.i just wonder how one could integrate the kill value. lets say i got popped in an iteron with 20 misk value. if the attacker gets killed in a thorax (value 5 misk) the value of the ""revenge"" is hardly achieved. maybe by copying the killmail to the agent it would be possible to calculate a certain value. one mission, maybe as lvl 3 or 4 should consider prices as well. mission is done when the attacker has lost an equal value like he took."
7/26/2010,"if the payout was determined by the ship value of the target, that could help stop exploitation.i also think a gank and trade aka kill rights market would be a great idea. got kill rights as a noob? can't use them? sell 'em"

7/26/2010,"who will ignore it, just as they ignored virtually all of the other issues passed unanimously by the csm."
7/26/2010,"this fix has been on the back burner for far too long. it is high time that ccp be pushed on this matter. in fact, the lack of outcry on these forums about this is disheartening to say the least.i propose specifically that ccp do something to fix the fact that members of an alliance can not use copy or invention slots owned by a member of the alliance. i would also like to see it made possible for a corporation to make research slots available for public use. i realize that may open up an entirely new can of worms, but it would be a worth wile use of development time imho.pi has already increased operation costs of towers. opportunities for players to gather their resources in order to compete in the market would be a natural progression to counter this. however this faulty mechanic makes that less worthwhile.please join me in sending a notice to the csm that those of us who care about this issue wants some damned representation!"
7/26/2010,"supported, although the chances of ccp touching pos and access control code are minimal."

7/26/2010,"if they will never hear you, are you just shouting to annoy people?"
7/26/2010,i like events.
7/26/2010,"which events? the 'gank-a-miner' (hulkageddon) one or the latest, 'gank-a-primea' one? guess it doesn't matter since both are aimed at the mining community.these type of 'events' are just plain 'griefing' with prejudice towards a specific player group which should not be allowed to happen, according to ccp's rules of conduct.if you're referring to the 'sansha invasion', i haven't seen any of those. i've heard from a couple of friends that those are usually over and done with almost as soon as they start due to massive amounts of players waiting for it thanks to the live event chat channel. that kind of 'event' should not be advertised before it happens.heh, i'll give this thread a thumbs up and as for the rest of you, everyone has the right to voice their own opinion about this game, including the original poster."
7/26/2010,op is referring to events organised by ccp. neither of these count but are cool event none the less.maybe he's talking about this. it doesn't victimise industrial characters... unless there was lots of ganking... which there probably was.
7/26/2010,"that would help with looting and sorting.i think deadspace, faction and officer modules should also be included."
7/26/2010,a very similar proposal was voted on by the csm
7/26/2010,a carrier module that projects an aoe bubble which uses em to create cap recharge bonus on the ships within. the range/effect should act like falloff as that's how em works.similarly the module should be expensive and uses little cap or the module is cheap and uses much cap; like irl.this is useful because often in cases where you have triage carrier or such situations. your subcap ships are often capinjected or pseudostable. these ships would benefit greatly.
7/26/2010,that would be a awesome idea for a module used on the new mother ship

7/26/2010,"support to upgrading and expanding the cosmos missions.specifics can be argued a lot, but it would be a good addition to the game.as a side note, expand the racial missions too (the arue mission chain for the gallente; the recovery of the missing reliquies for the achura and so on)."

7/26/2010,"ok, i would not go as far as to ask ccp for an almost ""expansion"" based on personel. that would take a lot of thinking.all i am proposing/asking is that a feature which is already coded ingame be put back on. (turn slaves into homeless existed when rewards wherent by lp store. rewards were offered by the agent when a player reached a certain number of lp's)an lp option would be to pay for the transformation the same way that faction ammo costs lp and a batch of regular ammo.simple, already coded and i believe, easy to execute.i would love to see the ammar version of personel to slaves but i dont know if this existed before and so if it is already coded.anyway, i think its a great roleplay oportunity with a very easy manpower implementation."
7/26/2010,"i won't vote for anyonee who uses the word isk faucet without having any idea what it means. also, this proposal would completely ruin any strategic value of moons and make any territory just as valuable as another, therefore eliminating the point of warfare. small corps in lowsec would no longer be allowed to live just because they are sitting on a useless moon. alliances would just capture every single moon to get a bigger share of the expensive materials.tl;dr: no."

7/26/2010,"no. there is one server, pvp is enabled everywhere in that server as long as you're undocked. that it happens also to be a sandbox doesn't mean it's not a pvp game."
7/26/2010,"despite this bit of drama, csm5 will lay the groundwork for an organized system to track the playerbase's wants/needs and establish a transparent ccp accountability. it is ccp's game and if they don't want to do something they don't have to, but they will have to tell us they are not going to do something and what is the reason. i have high hopes for this current council. granted there are a couple slugs on it but that's about the right percentage for a group this size. disagree with them but do support them. it can only make our game better. as a side i really get tired of this annoying pvp chant that keeps popping up. it is a sandbox. if you want to pvp - fine, if you want to mine - fine, if you want to explore - fine, if you want to build - fine, if you want to do all - fine, etc., etc.. i realize that there are players whose ability/mentality/desire dictate they pvp. that's wonderful - good for you, but please stop whining about the players that make the things and do the things that allows you to pvp. we have a great game that encompasses many and varied career paths. why it even allows the concerted pvp'er to whine about the non-pvp'er. there is plenty of troll meat out there, let's leave the csm off the menu. if you have a concern with them or one of their actions send the chairman or one of the members a direct message. bet you get a reply and an anwser, that is if your really interested in being concerned in making our game better.be well"
7/26/2010,"it's rather silly to play a pvp sandbox game and then get upset because someone points out that it's a pvp sandbox game. and while you're mining someone can shoot you, because there's one server and it's a pvp server. and while you're building people can shoot your pos and compete with you for markets and wardec you to make it harder for you to get goods to market, because there's only one server and it's a pvp sever. and if you want to run missions someone can probe you down and shoot you, because there's only one server and it's a pvp sever. because there's only one server and it's a pvp sever. the fact that it's a pvp game does not mean everybody has to pvp all the time. team fortress 2 is a pvp game, and you're perfectly welcome to run around with a medic every single game you play."

7/26/2010,"nopeunfortunately, the wiki is incomplete. we have asked ccp to give us a full overview of all csm issues in their development pipeline/backlog/etc, once we have that it will be a more accurate view.when i did my presentation for csm3 at fanfest 2009, 18% of the csm issues (csm1-3) had already been finished. at the time, 184 issues had been submitted to ccp.see:"

7/26/2010,the travel expenses for the csm are so miniscule that they probably don't even get registered in the budget.
7/26/2010,that's the only important question for csm now but no one from them dares to think about it.funny thing is if csm ever had a chance to influence eve in meaningful way - it is now. we can't expect ccp to change their development plans or players to cancel their accounts en masse but possible csm resign could have a positive effect... but csm prefer to look like nothing happend and continue to earn their fanfest tickets.

7/27/2010,"while the trails would help somewhat, they suffer two problems that my proposal avoids altogether:- lag. a single vector per ship requires a lot less than particle trails. i also believe that trails provoked some server side lag, that my proposal avoids altogether (it uses only the information already gathered by the table overview)- zoom. if you zoomed out completely, also in the old days with trails, you wouldn't be able to understand what was going on after a certain level of zoom just with trails. vectors must not be zoom dependant: they can easily be fixed, so that you'll be able to quickly evaluate the speed of a ship at any level of zoom you're using."

7/27/2010,"i am raising the proposal for several reasons:* it has received significant support (as well as passionate dissent).* it has significant consequences for the health of the game.* the csm represents all players -- including clueless noobs.* the issue deserves attention by the full csm. they may well vote it down, or pass it in modified form. but no matter what the outcome...* ...i think it is important to get some sort of position on this issue on the record, for the simple reason that at some point ccp may decide to make changes for retention reasons, and if they do, i think it's important to have a template out there that suggests how to do it in a manner that is as favorable as possible to the people who've already trained learning skills.think of this proposal as a condom whose purpose is to *prevent* a screwing."
7/27/2010,"i think that you are full of it. do you have a position on this, or are you a true politician? i think your wiki article makes it obvious where you stand on this with this one line:the wiki article is a mess, including unsubstantiated ""facts"" that are likely fallacies. if we are allowed to edit your proposals, i would have done it directly.consensus: n. 1. an opinion or position reached by a group as a wholethis is probably an outright lie, based on the definition of consensus (above):i would like to see the actual post-account-cancellation surveys that are for truly ""new"" players (not players creating alt accounts) that cite having to train learning skills as a cause for their cancellation.i angrily hate this proposal - not necessarily the removal of learning skills but the ""give me stats or give me basic learning skills"" - either the learning skills are a problem, or they are not. either they should exist (as is) or not.i firmly believe that the learning skills should stay as is. however, if there were to be a change, it should be to remove learning skills and refund the actual sp that players have put into said skills. all attributes are reduced to non-learning skill levels. refunding skillbooks has to be based on npc sell price (and still has issues). period. anything else is a wolf in sheep's clothing, whining entitlement babies who don't like that it takes days(weeks/months) to train for the big shiny.i take this position from a player with 3 accounts and 7 characters, all with basic learning skills to v and advanced skills to at least iii, (some iv and 1 with all learning skills at v). if they are going away, make everything about them go away - don't institute fake attribute boosts and additional remaps.a more accurate statement about pros: simplifies the skill training decision tree for players removes psychological barrier to undocking without learning skillsa more accurate statement about cons: simplifies the skill training decision tree for players increases overall training time for all skills by removing learning bonuses"
7/27/2010,"if the cms's and ccp manage to get this passed, there will undoubtedly be a new proposal to re-add learning skills which will receive much much more support then this thread received.. for that reason alone i would much rather the csm's and ccp devote their time to an issue which isn't going to result in a proposal to reverse the changes..p.s. no supported."
7/27/2010,156 supports and *zero* disapprovals! plus not all supporters add a thumbs up to every post they make in the thread (voting multiple times is rude.) it's a good day to be a politician when you can vote on an issue and not anger anyone.

7/27/2010,this topic is about making a list for ccp about what exacly is broken at this time. post what u think is broken in here and i will combine a list. from time to time i will update this list and mark the things that are being fixed ect.i will start of with a few things first:-fleet warfare (lag)-lachesis-deimos-eos-astarte-black ops-planetary interaction-
7/27/2010,"wrong forum, jita speaks would be better and you could do this by looking at all the csm issues ever raised or just checking this forum for popular threads.if you just look at what people post in reply to this you are going to get conflicting views on issues.i want more attention to 00.00 is played by the minority, add more pve content."
7/27/2010,"meh fair enough your rite anyway, who cares anyway about all those 0.0 people with on avarage 2 accounts wich 3/4 makes isk in emp"
7/27/2010,"i like it! ofc there r more important issues than owr ships loock like in eve,so it was wen i was in army, and all my ships had my paintjob in it, and im still arround...and moast of the other thingys to be resolved, with or without tigermouths painted, war going on or not, so, at the very least, some simple ""tatoos"" and corp/aly insignia should be incremented !!! this its very simple to do.it should also be payed for."
7/27/2010,"ok this is a bit of a niche thing, that will only affect a small number of people. for those people it does affect though, its a pain in the ass and frankly i can't think of any logical reason why it shouldn't be changed. currently there is no way to move a station container. suggest size of packaged station container be changed to 750,000m3"
7/27/2010,"supported, if optional"
7/27/2010,"no war decs in empire space , its annoying to the veterans and super fustrating to new pilots getting war deced (griefed) by these griefing corps in empire . if there is a war make a mutual requirement. let the flaming commence."
7/27/2010,...no its not
7/27/2010,"while we're at it, let's go ahead and make all ships in high-sec immune to weapons fire, and if a rat attacks you, concord comes in and kills it.i'm one of the fluffiest carebears you'll meet and i still think this is a stupid idea."
7/27/2010,i've seen some awful stuff before but this is quite possibly the worst idea i've seen all year. congrats on being #1.
7/27/2010,"""hi, i live in high. please give me everything for free, without any risk."" and you wonder why things events like hulkaggedon and other outright attacks on high sec dwellers occur. everyone else who puts in effort and works to avoid risks is fed up with these posts."
7/27/2010,"issue: the current system makes conquering outposts a means to an end. instead, conquering outposts should be both a means to an end and an end in its self. currently, the conquering of an outpost is not a fair balance between risk/reward that should be associated to 0.0 warfare.the current system needs to be changed so that the risks and rewards are in line with other levels of risk and reward that are associated with 0.0 warfare. proposal: once an outpost is conquered, have a destroyed shell (much like how destroyed capital ships are depicted in space) where the outpost once was. detailed mechanics:~give this destroyed outpost docking rights to everyone with limited functionality to pilots once inside. (destroyed outpost should have a volume limit so that you can't hide a fleet in a destroyed outpost)~once docked, the interior will have a destroyed look to it. also, the cargo and ship hanger will be shared with all who are dock in the outpost. any item or ship that was inside the outpost when it was conquered will be subject to drop tables (much like destroyed ships are in pvp) and the dropped items will be placed in this shared hanger. (this makes conquering outposts a means in its self instead of a means to an end for solv.) ~in space: the destroyed shell will have cargo space where a ""reclamation egg"" (lack of a better term) can be placed. this egg will have space to put required items in it for the reclamation process. (much like the outpost platform egg has when building a outpost from scratch)~item requirements for reclamation will be lower then that of a regular outpost building platform egg.~outpost reclamation will follow the same game mechanics during down time that newly built outposts currently use; however, anything that remains in conquered outpost that is being reclamed will be destroyed. (pods, ships, items everything)~pilots logged off in outpost will be poded and sent back to their medical clone location. jump clones should be destroyed once the outpost is conquered. (medical clone game mechanics will need to be changed so that npc's will be the only ones to offer medical clones)~if the outpost is not reclaimed, the destroyed outpost shell will remain in orbit and be dock-able to anyone until reclaimed.edit: sp errors pointed out by omara otawan"
7/27/2010,"result: nobody will leave anything significant in an outpost ever again, just in case some catastrophe hits them and makes every asset in their possession up for grabs whilst they're asleep/at work/on holiday. congratulations, you just destroyed the concept of the 0.0 market hub and forced everyone who wants a new ship into making jita shopping trips. (this is a horrible idea)"
7/27/2010,"no csm love for this... this is why you need csm's that are more industrial then pvp. something like this would greatly help improve quality of experience to eve.a lot of people i talk to about eve have similar reasons why they didn't like it or why they don't play it any more. one of those reasons is ""it's a click fest!"" eve really is a very clicky game. so many functions in the game require a lot of clicking. when something new is added ccp should be focused on reduction of clicking not adding features that require an excessive amounts of clicking to achieve.it is clear pi is not a main part of the game, and maybe this thread would have been best posted six months from now when pi is pretty much required by most. we shouldn't let it get to that point though, fix it now, while it's fresh and new and up for changes with little impact.csm's and ccp do not let planetary interaction get too entrenched before making some simple changes to reduce clicking.."
7/27/2010,1
7/27/2010,very similar to my idea of a master / slave system where the slaves would always perform the actions of the master pin.

7/27/2010,"terrible idea. rorqual doesn't just haul, it compresses. hulks mine enough.plus anything bigger or tougher would be too hard to suicide gank, then how would we make our money?"
7/27/2010,not supported.i will tell you my resons why.1.) i already hate losing skill on tech 3 cruisers even though i payed for a clone. so i will never support more skill lose ideals.2.) hulks mine very well and go into high sec. i would support a tech 3 with the ablty to swap out 1 of 3 stripers for cover-opt cloking. but not with inc mining ablitys in high sec or skill lose.3.) i would love to see a capital mining ship but this one here is over the top i belive.edit: on the capital mining ship no capital stripers. i'm thinking that ship is the ship to set up with 5 to 6 stripers that would be worth it right there.
7/27/2010,"dont know if t3 is really the way to go, but yes industrial does need more love. god only knows why theres never been a dedicated gas harvesting ship. that primae model would have been perfect for it."
7/27/2010,"the thing im trying to pus is advancement, i agree rorqual is pritty nice but it cant mine on its own, and a carrier with 15 harvester drones cant even outmine a hulk with perfect skills. but lets face it... hulk is **** for tank/armor, it cant even stand up agenst cruiser rats, i want something that will actualy have a decent tank for null sec rats. the part your forgetting t3 ships would be very expensive, when the cruisers came out the hull alone with no subsystems was over a billion, do you think high sec care bear no bodys would be willing to buy let alone lose something like that?if youd look closely at the subsystems i designed youd see they'd have to pick between cargo and tank, and most macro miners would chose cargo so that makes them still easy suicide ganks.as far as you go rip, in order to advance you must pay the price in some way, i honestly feel a high price tag and risk of losing skill points in the skills requiered to fly that ship is a fair trade for being more powerful then a t2 ship or have the versitility of 5 ships in one with the ability to change in seconds. as far as the capital strip lasers go, unless you give it 8 high slots and more laser slots so it could fit 4+ strip lasers youd need to make capitals, which would also limit the people useing them cause youd need to train up for new lasers just like you do xl weapons when training for a dreadnaught."
7/27/2010,"was just thinking and putting it straight out there, why not have a t3 subsystem for cruiser or bs when it gets made to make a bubble (like a hic basicly) but it would be for t3 so you could make more fits and diffrent fits for it wouldnt take place of hics because most people would still like to fly the hicbut for some and most people i think they might like the t3 bubble subsystem if not for cruiser maybe the t3 bs (when it is made) this way we have cruiser bubbler destroyer/frig bubbler and a bs bubbler for ultimate bait ^^imagine it for a t3 bs bubble subsystem you warp your t3 bs into middle of a camp or sit it somewhere for ultimate baiting and bubble up :d would let you have all meds for tank/cap for caldari/minmatar and yet would be able to hold everyone on the field (unless they leave bubble that is)thoughts and flames please :p"
7/27/2010,so you want 1m ehp bait ships with bubble?that sounds slightly op to me.maybe make it a defensive subsystem so you cant get the hp amount subsystem and the bubble subsystem at the same time.
7/27/2010,seems aa good idea tbh does bring it all inlign me like ^^
7/27/2010,this would be useful for lots of things. especially if the note could be opened to reveal a much longer user customized message.
7/27/2010,worth supporting
7/27/2010,supporting a good idea.
7/27/2010,"its a nice idea but any ""small weak alliance"" which lives ""close to high sec"" is not going to have the rediculus 10b a month to pay concord for protection unless they are buying and selling tons of plex's/gtc's or have such a high tax the players in said alliance couldnt make any money for them selfs. so it is realisticly impossible.most 0.0 alliances including my own are 1-10 jump frieghter jumps from high sec, the only ""pipe running"" we do is when someone new needs to come in or an old pilot quitting the alliance is leaving. if you are to scared to run a pipe pick up a scanner, find a wormhole in your system that leads to highsec or low sec 1 jump away from high sec and use that for your needs. if you dont have many or any wormholes buy a ihub upgrade for it, they made it for a reason.0.0 is ""made"" for pvp, if you cant handle the ""heat"" get out of the ""kitchen"" its that simple, i flew a orca 50 jumps though 0.0 with nothing but a scouting frigate, time to grow a pair buddy."
7/27/2010,"there exists no game mechanic to enforce such a thing, nor one that allows a corporation/alliance to effectively police and punish their own people besides ""hunt 'em down pa"" and we aren't likely to see such changes in our lifetime or eve's."
7/27/2010,give it a 5 minute cycle like a cyno where you can't warp and can't shut it off then i might think about it.
7/27/2010,obvious goodness is obvious.
7/27/2010,yes plox.
7/27/2010,nice
7/27/2010,good idea. you get a day off with full holodeck privileges.
7/27/2010,i support
7/27/2010,"never used them, but i know they are broken. fix them please.edit: forgot thumbs up :p"
7/27/2010,"considering most other t2 missiles are horribly underpowered, precedent suggests that t2 fofs will fix nothing.a dev (soundwave?) recently said missiles as a whole were getting reviewed over the summer so hopefully fofs and defenders will get included in that."
7/27/2010,bump
7/27/2010,"1. player a gets ganked in low sec by pirate x. he trades kill rights to player b. player b finds pirate x. pirate x, thinking of the possibility of a less than 100% winnable fight, runs and docks, regardless of having no knowledge of kill rights being transferred. upon being camped, pirate x stays logged on and also logs on macro mining alt y, while wasting player b's time. rinse and repeat day after day and player b gives up, rather than waste any more of his own subscription time and loses standings for having no chance to complete the mission. system broken.2. meanwhile, pirate x's macro mining alt y, in the usual exhumer, gets suicide ganked by player c. pirate x transfers kill rights to player d. player d ganks player c but now player c adapts by creating throwaway alts to suicide gank with. macro mining alt y gets suicide ganked by player c's alts. pirate x's alt y transfers kill rights to player e. player e cannot find player c's alts because they've already been recycled. system broken.3. player f hauls expensive cargo through high sec in a t1 hauler and gets suicide ganked by throwaway alts. player f transfers kill rights to player g. player g cannot find the throwaway alts because they've already been recycled. system broken.this is only an attempted stealth nerf to suicide ganking because it does nothing against low sec pirates, since this system does not change anything about the low sec they're in. in fact, it tries to protect them by helping to safeguard their macro mining alts to exploit and hide behind when things aren't going their way. by pushing ppl to use alts, which they do already, this proposal doesn't do anything at all but annoy everyone and waste their time. not supported."
7/27/2010,"this is actually a pretty good proposal, the only issue would be, as the op said, populating the system. but if people are able to generate enough kill rights on themselves then it would be a great, maybe make it closer to the current system.players with -1.0 or lower sec status (or players will killrights) are able to have bounties placed on their heads.bounty cost is initially 1mil, cost rises exponentially for multiple bounties.it would certainly make things more interesting, and give the system some function."
7/27/2010,"so pirates never lose ships? don't be so pessimistic, people do fly when there is threat, it's called having fun. possible, how about changing the already broken alt rules, say, only being able to biomass/create every so many weeks?see previous, you ""recycled"" the same point.right, so it won't work cos people will dock up, or recycle suicide gankers, but its still a ""stealth nerf"" to suicide ganking. apart from the fact that makes no sense, check my kill record.this is not an attempt to nerf anything apart from the universally acknowledged broken existing bounty system."
7/27/2010,"i like this idea for the most part, but would add the following solution to the alt-use problem...when a bounty is placed on a character, that bounty is automatically applied to that player's entire account. the bounty mission received from the agent only shows the character who had the original bounty placed on them. after the bounty hunter has located and locked that character, any alts on that account, if and when they become active, are listed with the original and are flagged red. the pilot info would show that alt's info with the added text - alt of 'bounty x' and that alt would be a legitimate target but the mission is not completed until the original character that the bounty was placed on is killed. any alt used by that player would indicate the same for as long as that mission was active, but only to the hunter with the mission. upon completion of the mission, the flags and associated alt info would disappear."
7/27/2010,"they don't when they fly in their usual blobs, like u do. after all, pirates like u don't consider it ""fun"" when risk applies to u as well. funny how your proposal won't affect u at all... so ppl don't have 5+ accounts like they do now? what exactly is ""broken"" about these rules that u have to implement a broken system that's easily circumvented to ""fix"" it? is it ""broken"" because it can be used to actually apply risk to u when u're in your alt and not behind the comfort and safety of your blob?no ****, moron 'cause i was applying it to suicide ganking haulers.1. oh it makes perfect sense, now that u asked to look at your killboard. almost all of your low sec kills r with the blobs u hide behind, besides the pod kills. therefore, your proposal conveniently won't affect u at all.2. as for the high sec kills/losses, most of them were your corpmates killing each other. if anything makes no sense, it's that, especially since they went ahead and posted them. comparing that to the 5 mining ship kills (2 of which are not exhumers), then comparing the high sec kills to low sec kills simply boils down to u hating suicide ganking just because u've taken more frequent losses than u did in low sec. maybe that's why u had your own corpmates kill u so that u don't get tagged by someone outside your corp? like i said before, pirates like u don't like it when risk or in this case, consequences, applies to u as well. poor baby... bottom line is, your proposal does nothing since u're just under the disguise of ""fixing"" a broken system with another broken system that has no effect on low sec and only attempts to nerf suicide ganking, a play style u hate because u can't handle a loss.but plz, continue--i'd like to hear it."
7/27/2010,"out of all the bounty ideas i've seen this one is probably the best. it also doesn't reward the person placing the bounty which is good. while i understood the ""sell kill rights"" part of other proposals, i never liked the idea that i could sit out in low-sec in a n00b character collecting kill rights which i turn around and sell. seems like too easy money. this proposal doesn't reward or create an exploitable situation for neither the pirate or the victim, so it gets my support.best replacement bounty system idea to date."
7/27/2010,good idea to replace the broken bounty system
7/27/2010,"everything except graphics (resolution/shader/texture detail) should be stored server side. configuration affecting a specific piece of hardware will only beak things. my imac can handle eve with all settings low, eve doesn't even start if all settings are high.bookmark folders, chat windows, overview settings, bracket settings, overview tabs, filters, priority of bracket label colours, voice font per character, all should be server side. the server already remembers which character i last logged in with on that account."

7/27/2010,"/signed x 1000.some small additions: would be a massive boost to pvp:1. add a player defined pop-up list of orbit and keep-at distances. keep your mouse on the orbit or keep-at icon and a list with values that you entered pops up. it would nullify the current terrible right click fest.2. make windows controls bigger (title bar, close window, contextual menus). i have a lot of difficulty in always hitting the correct right click menu item in pvp when i'm in a hurry, and i know a lot of other peop<U+FFFD>le have this problem too.edit: and i will add this to the main ccp zulu disaster thread as well: i see in your wiki post you mention that the ui team has been reinforced. i think this is in direct response to the massive amount of player complaints and mass quits that went down there. so for all of those who were saying our voices count for nothing, perhaps if they are indeed loud enough (and we vote with our wallets) they do count."
7/27/2010,many thanks for bringing this up
7/27/2010,"please, but that doesnt help much without ability to organise people in the watch list. preferably some kind of folders + ability to drag people on the watch list. so if i am in a logistics i can have a folder with all other logistics ships, one with the primaries, euhm i mean ecm ships, etc."

7/27/2010,my bad and thanks.
7/27/2010,"i support this whole-heartedly but would add two more...update the font. whether this would entail improving the current one, changing to a different one, allowing a personal font, or a combination of the three, it is needed desperately. i'm not sure if this would be a fan fav or a low hanging fruit though.add a sort option to the corporate assets (especially the deliveries) just as the personal assets has which allows sorting by jumps (with region/constellation/system filter as i sostoned points out below), number of items, and name. that deliveries list can be extremely long at times from corporation buy orders and can, of course, span the entire map but there is no way to sort it so setting a route for pickups can be unbelievably tedious, tiresome, and usually never quite right.as for prioritizing the lists, how do you prioritize those low hanging fruits? some are more important to one group of players than another while others may never be needed by some but would be a top priority to someone else. they are all important! put them in some sort of alphabetical list or sort them from perceived easiest to hardest and give ccp the entire list!on the two big wins, i support them both as long as the shortcuts are an option that can be toggled on and off in the options window."
7/27/2010,"no mention of inventory handling ui, specifically corporate.market deliveries hangar needs sorting functions identical to personal assets (by range, filterable by region/constellation/system)."
7/27/2010,"my favorites (in no particular order):contextual menus should have keyboard navigation shortcuts.ui show info button with chat invite (csm)targeting from broadcast history (csm)permit smaller or no character icons in chat windows so that more players can fit in the available space.new contextual menu options for items: ""find on contracts"" and ""find in my assets"".add meta column in item detail list view (csm)static entities in the overview (stations, stargates, belts, etc) should be in a unique color to help distinguish them.use speed bar color to indicate mwd/ab status______________thoughts regarding the context-menu proposal:make it like windows menus:pick the first suitable character, underline it, and that is the shortcut.example: sell order context menu______________________c_ancel order_m_odify order______________________s_how info_v_iew market details______________________l_ocation >_____________________the shortcuts would be c, m, s, v and lanother example: character context menu: _s_how info, start _c_onversation, _i_nvite to..., send _m_essage and so onreasons:this is a proven concept, windows does that since at least version 2.users should be familliar with it.and if you go over the top, please let us open e.g. the overview-menu (the one you get by clicking on the triangle) by a shortcut e.g. alt+o.solarsystem menu (the triangle on the left top when in space) with alt+sand so on.and if you want to go absolutely over the top, let us configure these shortcuts."
7/27/2010,"yes. to all. any single change is good, all of them would be fantastic."
7/27/2010,"with respect to the question of how to do the prioritization, what i was planning on doing was waiting a few days for the list to stabilize, then number them and have people submit their priority rankings (for as many items as they want to rate). this should give a decent priority order, and also ensure that this thread reaches the coveted ""threadnaught"" status. it may be more difficult than it appears, but if there is significant support for it in the thread, i'll add it to ""fan favorites""can you expand on exactly what you mean by this, t'amber?added.this is edging into design rather than ui, and pi is still evolving, so i would prefer to hold off on this for the time being. it annoys me too as well (as do the customs office delays). personally, i think the delays should be more dynamic.added, also on-grid bookmarks in space, though that again is edging into design-space. otoh, i really want it personally.added.autopilot items - not sure if they make the cut, can you suggest particular menus/mechanisms?colorblind issues - thanks for reminding me. have added a hud black-background low-hanging fruit and a ""standard eve colors"" fan favorite to address these issues.useful, added.this happened before the june summit, actually; if you read the summit minutes there is a mention of it.added this, and a ""ship type"" column request for the watchlist.i can neither confirm nor deny the confirmation or denial of any such communications.this would be handled by the general ui menu suggestions. if it turns out ccp is going to do a pass on these, i'll crowdsource a big list for them.from the summit minutes:""csm asked about the status of the eve font, pointing out that a change has been requested for two years. ccp stated it is currently designing a new font. there have also been tech issues regarding the font (80% of the font re-design is finished and will hopefully be integrated late this year). csm questioned the rationale behind designing a font from scratch rather than licensing an existing one; potential licensing costs and the desire to be able to exercise control and consistency over the font design were cited as reasons.""not unreasonable, added."
7/27/2010,"my reason for suggesting the numeric/alpha system as opposed to the windows system was as follows:* it's a plug-in system that can be applied to all menus globally, thus much easier to implement.* many of the menus that are hardest to navigate (multi-level, for example) are dynamic in nature; consider the in-space menu, that lists planets, belts, etc. a windows-like system doesn't do well with those kind of menus.* a big reason for doing this isn't to have shortcut mnemonics, it's to have a faster and more reliable way of navigating deeply nested menus. for example, you jump into that big gatecamp - a one-pixel mis-mouse when trying to warp to a belt at 100 can get you podded."
7/27/2010,everything in low hanging fruit and anything else you have time to do from the others.not sure if its there (didn't see it but i have issues so it could be there) but a larger overload button (or it slightly separated)? the number of times i have turned off my hardners instead of starting/stopping them overloading is just silly.
7/27/2010,loving all the ideas. would be awesome if they were all implemented.
7/27/2010,"*love the fan/favorite of bpo and bpc differentiation.*would like to see a faction and officer corner tab on said items like the current t2 and t3 tags.

7/27/2010,how could anyone let this fall by the wayside?!? :distress:this idea is awesome. make it so. :support:
7/27/2010,great idea
7/27/2010,not a bad idea. it would be better to have a popup showing the modifier when you hover over an implant.
7/27/2010,"my idea is to have small deployable shielded structures that can be placed next to other structures in orbit around planets in low sec. these structures can be placed down by solo players for research, possibly ship fitting, and a small hanger bay for storage. they could be either solar powered or fueled like poses. but the only fuel i would think is worth putting in them is a few hours of strontium. this will allow groups of solo players and small corps to get a foothold in low sec systems. it will provide the needed copy and research slots for industrialist even if it is only one. as a group people who live around a planet, the only way to protect themselves would be grouping together to fend off pirates.corporations or alliances can also sponsor and protect these as a means to recruiting new members or just to try to keep them running. but let the players decide, like most of eve's features. i think these should be relatively fragile and cheep way of surviving in low sec where hopefully enough people will band together to keep a shanty town together. make the structure's shield accept passwords form any players so they can be shared or used as drug drop off spots. maybe limit the ship enter size to bc since stations and poses are still a usable for anything larger. they wont work everywhere but it would be cool to see them popping up over time. a pos works in a similar way, but with the pos you need a corp and to cover the fuel cost before it can be profitable.i am not very good with the whole game balancing things but i thought this idea was good enough to share.death nova"
7/27/2010,pos for the people? i can dig that.
7/27/2010,"sure, why not. make it reasonably worse than pos modules and reasonably better than nothing and it might work out nicely. especially since the models for such things are already in the game.it would also add targets appropriate for small roaming gangs, yet not interesting enough for armadas."
7/27/2010,"this seems like a very fun idea. to add to this idea and give it more of a shanty""town"" feel maybe have these structure be able to link up with each other or have them be able to be in the same grid to each other (will need some type of treaties to prevent enemies from setting up shop aswell). that way solo players/corps/alliances may have a centralized spot to conduct operations.to further the suggestion even more maybe ccp can release a new region for these towns to thrive in. the region should have some type of abundant black-market item to collect and a very low station count (maybe 1 or 2 stations for the entire region). the region can also give a boost to these structures. the region should also be mostly low-sec with a few high-sec systems around to conduct trade.maybe have the structures be able to get into reinforced mode for a day or two to give smaller corps a fighting chance."
7/27/2010,"i like the general idea, but it needs some reasons to exist that lowsec stations and pos's dont give.maybe these shanties could house 'habitation modules' like you see in npc areas, that possibly anyone can add a habitation module to an existing shanty? maybe they can only be started at a vacant panet with no station? maybe they could house the black market as discussed in my thread about making lowsec better...so, possibly, a shanty township may start like this:only 1 or 2 per system, only lowsec. possibly only in non station systems?the black market is only accessible in these towns.the module of brothel is placeable here along with hab modules, maybe shipyards, that people can charge for repairs etc.drug manufacturing possible.its a good idea that could be built on.. maybe giving lowsec an extra unique feature where people can have thier own little slice of action in lowsec, owning brothels, ship repair facilities etc...would the op mind if i add this to my main thread outlaw?"
7/27/2010,"funny idea. however you need a way to defend them 24/7, as people like me would go look for cities to kill when there are no players around. so if you make them as weak as pos structures, they would not last for more than a few minutes in low sec."
7/27/2010,"this is true, however, if tied in with an alliance or coalition who would defend their structures, since if you are going to invest in something like this it ouwl almost certainly be in or very close to where you amass your guys, it would be another reason for warfare, which is good.also, you could make it so that each module could be killed relatively quickly, but to destroy the whole thing could litterally take days if it had enough modules built onto it, all owned by individuals and goups.so if a module took 10 minutes of pounding by 10 bss, and the whole shanty had 200 modules... add to that the options of better defences and more expensive shielding etc and you get a truly large sprawling structure. it becomes a destroyable minor outpost, but any respectable alliance would defend their sponsored township with all their might..."
7/27/2010,"the structures could have an upgrade feature for stuff like defense (maybe turrets) and storage for more ratting loot. they could also be upgradeable as a entire town. like in dominion, give each town the ability to have strategic levels that will allow for defensive and more structures. strategic levels should upgrade base on the time the shanty town has survived. the greater purpose would be a forward base for pvp and ratting and a copy slots/research slot for industrialist in low sec.it would also bring more life to unoccupied parts of space.thanks for the good feed back."

7/27/2010,"i went through all csm minutes (up to fanfest 2009) and compared the issues that were accepted by ccp to the features/fixes/etc that were added to the game since the start of the csm. it was a lot of work, but to improve that in the future we're working with ccp to get csm issues tagged as such in the backlog, as well as improve ccp-csm communication when the status of such an issue is changed. that will allow us to keep track of the state our issues are in."
7/27/2010,"you are probably right. but a new coffee machine for the ccp devs, increasing productivity on monday mornings, would be a better allocation of funds than the csm."
7/27/2010,"i can assure you that mass resignation would accomplish nothing. staying the course and using every grain of progress (and yes, there has been some) to gain traction to build further momentum is the right thing to do at this juncture. we'll keep working issues as we always have and will make sure our priorities list is in front of people at the right time and with the right message to get proper attention at dev planning sessions. in addition to that, we'll continue to push for better collaboration and communication with ccp--which might not be measurable in a tangible sense but is critical to the process. in fact, our efforts in this regard are already getting results. hopefully that translates over time into getting attention on the things that so many of us believe should have priority from ccp. if we all resign, that will never happen--or we'll just be replaced with others and valuable momentum will be lost.all i can say is, this is a process. it's not easy, it's not fun, but it is evolving in the right direction. i think the minutes from the june summit showed that this csm means business like never before. just have a little faith and see if we can leverage the progress we've made so far into something that will earn your support for our efforts."
7/27/2010,"i absolutely agree that a mass resignation of the csm would be counterproductive and that it would be far better to see how ccp responds over the next few months - the csm and the playerbase (or at least, the forum-dwelling rabble) have made their dissatisfaction known and the ball is now in ccp's court (ugh, cliche).as an aside, among the deliverables is a list of outstanding balance issues to be prioritised by the csm and then sent to ccp for evaluation. will this list be made available to the general playerbase?"

7/28/2010,"funny when people come here pretending to know stuff and posting strong opinions like this. are you in marketing? do you know what any of those words mean?scrum is an agile software process. that means, that unlike the waterfall model, which was used before, it aligns fast. in scrum (and agile in general) you work with small teams, frequent releases of small fixes so that you and the client, together work for a product that meets the clients' needs instead of a go-ahead model where you plan the stuff, then code, package and sell it, then ask the client ""didn't you order walking-in-stations?"".you claim an agile process is hard to turn around. it's not. ccp claims to use scrum, but is still not listening to their clients, the very core of the scrum process. so there you have it. you don't know what you're talking about.ccp is a pompous pile of manure that's openly boasting about a software engineering process they apparently aren't even using.edit: as for the original topic, i don't give a rats ass. people in big nullsec alliances can't participate. it's just another failed minigame half the clientbase can't even try."
7/28/2010,i'd support but only if ccp implemented learning skills replaced with focused training instead.
7/28/2010,"/supportedlearning skills are a flawed mechanic. while no fix would be popular with everyone, that isn't a good reason to keep a poor gameplay design."
7/28/2010,"not supported.learning skills are part of the game from the beginning.thats why i learned the learning skills first to get the benefit of it.if you dont do it, its your mistake.i have all learning up on all my chars, so now i want have the longterm benefits of this game mechanic.because if ccp removes them now, this would really suck to me because then i will loose my trust to the game and i will never make any longterm plans anymore."
7/28/2010,"[not supported]eve has bigger issues than ""learning is evil"" complains!learning skills are good for:- increases the time all the isk-selling characters are flying covertors or bigger;- increases the time all the isk-selling characters are flying nighmare/paladin/golem s;- increases the number of rtards that are complaining about eve's game design - i wonder if everybody who sign the petitions so far ever worked in game-developing industry or if have knowledge about game-design;- increases the number of rtards that are complaining about ammar ships;- increases the number of rtards that are complaining about caldari ships;- increases the number of rtards that are complaining about gallente ships;- increases the number of rtards that are complaining about minmatar ships;- increases rate for the griefers/carebears/*******s are spawning in game [i.e. everyone will have 5 alts with bs that will pop everything at 1.0 gates ... and nobody -> ccp employee <- will check 100 bilions lines of logs to apply the proper punishment];- decreases the time all the ******s leaves and plays wow;- makes a good difference between an industrial pilot and a pew-pew pilot ... otherwise everybody will know everything [super-bad];- older people will feel bad about choosing eve when all pvp fights will be with 14.year.old.blobs in 1.0 [holy**** i will ask for refunds ... all of them ];- friends of friends of friends will have so many isk in day 1 ... why i'm even bodering- they are 50000 players in weekends, at the moment ... if friends of friends of friends will play ... every system will be jita;so:- you don't have to bring your moronic friends to have fun!..- all games should be played by everyone is silly and childish;- ""**** sleipnir has +1 slot!.. i'm so ****ing sad ... let's remove learning!"" is based on your alcoholic unconscious brain;- if you say: ""i have to stay 2 months in eve docked and i'm losing time saving money for my titan"", you should play wow;- yeah wow is better! go play it!- eve is dying and losing player because of the bugs/griefers/10000 isk/second carebears;- eve is dying because some ships are not even used(that's bad game design) and only 4-5 ships/per race are frequently used;- eve is dying because ccp introduces new planetary-**** features instead of new ships and jovian empire!- eve is dying because everything is redundant, and with or without learning, your moronic friend will still get bored!true stories dude:i'm doing missions ... and omfg my tank breaks!.. but that's ok, i'm aligned and at full spead ... waiting for my drones! waiting for my drones! where are you drones ... heeeey i'm in half armor ... let me warp out ... press warp to button ... your-ending: yes your ship has warped out!..one second later: omfg i'm in capsule!..gate camp ... oh goddie!.. pew pew peeeeew ship blows!one second later: omfg i'm in station!..morale:i have broadband connection and an quad-core intel processor!.. and my ships gets destroyed from time to time and i'm lagging ... and i still have fun with my in-game/rl friends!.. but you are telling me you cannot because of the learning skills... just **** off!!"
7/28/2010,"times sinks are bad.i am currently in at about 1.3 million in learnings, 4/5 everything, mostly 4. i'd support removing of the learning skills even if only 5 points are added to the attributes and no sp refunded.less points added and the higher rank skills are going to make my bite my desk.so, thumbs up"
7/28/2010,"i substantially agree with the contents of the proposal. you should note that i raised it knowing that it would be controversial and probably get me at least lightly toasted in this thread. i did so because i feel it is a topic that needs debate at the csm level, because i view it as an overall ""long-term health of the game"" issue.i am open to evidence that there are errors in the presentation. also note that all csm proposals are drafts, subject to debate and modification during the actual meetings. even if it is passed, certain aspects of it may be strengthened or weakened after discussion by delegates.so would i. unfortunately, this information has not been made available to csm. getting more info out of ccp has been an enduring csm theme.alas, ""the perfect is the enemy of the good"". there is no solution to this issue that will satisfy all the players. the point of the elimination proposal was to address the perceived retention issue while not affecting the training rate of existing players (except for the people who have trained advanced skills to v).while as a purist (from a game-design standpoint) i would say ""dump the learning skills and adjust training times so that the average rates are the same as they currently are"", the realist in me is tending towards the other proposal (3's in everything as default) as easier to do while getting most of the benefits (and not affecting people with advanced v skills).the bottom line is, if ccp doesn't think there is a retention issue associated with learning skills, they will simply dump this into the backlog to rot. if they do, better we have some input (and public debate) than for them to present you with a fait-accompi that will cause you to ragequit.politics is, indeed, ""the art of the possible."""
7/28/2010,"well, to begin with there is no consensus in the csm that the learning skills are a problem - since you haven't had the meeting to discuss them.then, the claims that new player retention is affected by the learning skills.then the claim that changing them would improve new player retentionthen the claim that the only negative impact is ""bitter old vets""with no facts and a biased presentation, i turn this back upon you. present facts that any of these are true before stating them as facts. you are the one making claims. where is your evidence?i am merely accusing you of making claims without facts to support them."
7/28/2010,i support this. although i would like fine tuning of the implementation. probably just allow players to immediately distribute the sp from learning skills rather then giving a time bonus.
7/28/2010,supported.
7/28/2010,"hey there,not sure if this has been mentioned before, however i beleive that dictor pilots should have more ability over the bubbles they deploy. it would be nice to have an option on the bubble or scanner area where probes (which is what interdictor bubbles come under - warp disruption probes) can be destroyed at the dictor pilots discretion. currently you have to wait 2 minutes before the bubble goes down which can be annoying to your fleets, so it would be nice, considering you can decide when it goes up, you should also be able to decide when it comes down or gets destroyed by selecting the probes in the scanner area and clicking destroy.erad"
7/28/2010,"nope, i think its best that you commit to using a bubble, not just spam em and drop em as you please. i think it is a good, and balanced, feature that you must pay attention or risk being caught in your own bubble."
7/28/2010,er... no.interdictors can poop out as many probe bubbles as they want to so long as they have enough... and those bubbles cannot be destroyed by enemies... and interdictors can run away while the bubble is up provided that they are not within the bubble themselves.interdictor bubbles are small anyways (relatively speaking). you can burn out of one if you really need to be somewhere else.not supported.
7/28/2010,"i lol'd.terrible idea, though having all services disabled until a conquered outpost is repaired isnt that bad."
7/28/2010,honestly... because outposts can't be destroyed... this issue/problem is going to get increasingly worse as alliances continue to build them.i get the reasons why they won't allow them to be destroyed... but if this isn't sorted out soon... its just going to get worse.biggest reason for allowing them to be destroyed - makes them much more valuable than they are.as to how they are destroyed... that's up to you to sort out.
7/28/2010,"you've obviously never mined in a properly fit hulk in 0.0. it can not only tank multi-bs and cruiser spawns, but kill them pretty quickly if they are in targetting range or your drones auto lock on them. handy hint for free > do not fit two mining upgrades and a roid scanner.hulk is fine, no need for another ore mining vessel."
7/28/2010,"then tell me your fitting? cause the only hulk fit iv seen capable of tanking 3 bs spawns is nothing but phiti b type moduals with the exception of the lasers and 5 medium drones have 1/4-1/2 the dps of a drake which depending on your skills struggles to kill tripple bs spawns in under 5 minutes. oh and if you fitting if that phiti b type fitting, id rather spend the money on a asome t3 ship and use t2 moduals then spend half a billion on moduals to put on a ship that can easily be ganked by players."
7/28/2010,"i support a ship for mining with more lasers/cargohold than hulk. i find the hulk to be to small for solo mining ops, even with cargo rigs. i shouldn't need an orca for decent high sec mining.90% carebear for life"
7/28/2010,thats the fit he is talking about surger cakes. just want you were asking for. you have to give something up in order to gain something. and as a side note you should not care what kind of dps a mining ship has just be happy it has any at all.
7/28/2010,"excuse me! oh, hi, thank you... no ships that can mine more than a hulk, please. if it happens, here's what will happen:1) you'll be out in your pwnmobileuberhulk, mining ore. woot mining actually makes money!2) after about a month, there will be so many minerals on the market (because everyone's mining in pwnmobileuberhulks), that the prices will crash.3) eventually it'll even out so that mining in a pwnmobileuberhulk will be just as profitable as mining in a hulk now, with mining in hulks being worth less, and using a retriever almost pointless. the mineral market will crash, thus you get less for your ore, so you have to mine more to get the same amount of isk you got before."
7/28/2010,"you missed a part out, ie the bit where reprocessing mission loot suddenly becomes less lucrative. count me in. ;)"
7/28/2010,"firstly it is near impossible to lose a hulk in 0.0 if you are paying attention to local. if you afk mine out there you are going to lose it and deservedly so.a hulk with a pithi-b is what, 300m these days? that's well short of 500m ""just for modules"". but you would rather spend more than the cost of a well-fit hulk on a 500m+ t3 ship to mine with that will be just as easily be ganked by players if you are still afk mining?"
7/28/2010,"k first of all, i dont afk mine, doing that period high sec or not is stupid, i have corp mates, friends and what not i talk to while mining and also listen to roam pvp ops on vent.second, the fitting im talking about has 4 complex grade moduals, 4 x 300m = 1.2b in moduals. second of all hear of a interceptor? a interceptor can warp from the gate to the ice belt before i can get in full warp and we have tested this its why we put up bubbles between the gate and at least 5 differnt belts.and 3rdly like all t3 ships or capital ships you dont see them every day, high sec care bear ***s wont fly them cause when they get ganked they have to retrain and 90% of every one i meet in 0.0 is combat and doesnt even fly a retreaver so the number of ships wouldnt be exploded in number. besides i sell my ore to the alliance to fund their capital ship constructions so we can crush some one when they come looking for a fight so even if i had 6 alts all running rorquals and capital mining bardges it wouldnt affect your stupid high sec markets anyway.now can we stay on topic please -.- proving you trolls wrong every time you post is rather boring."
7/28/2010,"i cannot support the constant flood of requests for t3 industrials. i just cannot see the need for such ships.also, i do not see the need for a new mining ship beyond the hulk. do people not understand that it will have absolutely no effect on the mining profession? minerals are not worth anything but the time it takes to extract them. once everyone upgrades to a new mining ship, everyone will be extracting at the same speed, and overall the minerals will drop in price so that miners are making pretty much the exact same amount of isk as before. not supported"
7/28/2010,"im tired of seeing posts like this.... i understand you dont support the t3 industrials or mining ship but your not even recongizing the other ships that have been listed here. and magnus like i said in my last post not every one will use them, care bares wont cause it would make them bigger targets, more expensive ship = higher gank risk, getting ganked more often = less profit for them."
7/28/2010,"i am all for supporting the industrial aspects of eve. i have a r&d alt that i love to play, even more than my main since fleet lag came in after dominion. but the ships that i think industry really needs are ships that actually have a separate role. ships that do something completely different.ships like a dedicated science vessel, perhaps with a single me research slot on it, plus role bonuses to analyzers and code breakers.ships like a dedicated salvage boat (perhaps on a destroyer hull for the lulz) with bonuses to tractor range, and salvaging. i don't see a need for modular haulers, or capital sized mining ships. sorry."
7/28/2010,"firstly, what in satans perineum is a 1.2bn hulk fit and more pertinently, why?second, ever hear of istabs? hulk gets to warp in around 10-12s. no way can an interceptor get from gate to an ice belt, target and get in point range in that time. oh, and you have bubbles up? hang on, ice belt? so you are actually talking about mackinaws then and not ore mining? i mean, no real miner is going to mine ice in a hulk are they? being smaller, pair of istabs, get to warp in 8-9s. the only possible way a prepared and vigilant miner will get ganked in 0.0 in hulk or mack is if the ganker logged at the belt. in which case, your 500m t3 ship with 1.2bn in modules will also die.thirdly, commas, colons and semicolons: they are your friends. relax, breathe.fourthly, you were one who brought up the subject of exhumers having a ****** tank, and incorrectly so. their tank is fine. you ot'd your own thread there; plus highlighting why we do not need more ore/ice mining vessels is not trolling or off-topic.finally, to go back to your original proposal... it's way overpowered. +1 warp strength per level? 6 t2 strips? you want more ore for less work and less risk? the op sounds like a macro-miners wet dream. the only thing your proposal is missing is the kleenex subsystem: 10% more tissues per level."
7/28/2010,"i read your entire post, but didn't register anything you said."
7/28/2010,overpowered.
7/28/2010,supporting this
7/28/2010,would be nice
7/28/2010,"when i started playing, i thought the game was developed logically. it was cleverly derived into 3 global areas, where every kind of people can have their fun:1. high security - for cowards (like myself).2. low security - for maniacs and pirates.3. null - for the great gang wars.and it appears that the high security zone has no security at all. pirates just sacrifice their ships gladly, getting the insurance which compensates their loss from concord almost completely and grabbing the loot from the wreck of a legal citizen who was flying right in the heart of empire!something should be done to allow normal people fly safe in the high security (sic!) areas.1. all insurance should be void for any ship killed by concord. no sane insurance company would ever insure criminals from being busted by police forces.2. the wreck of the ship killed in pvp (that considers high security areas only) should be immediately sealed by concord so no one else can take the loot except the legal owner. or at least make the ship completely destroyed with all its parts and loot, if that ship had been pvp attacked and killed in hi-secs. so the piracy in hi-secs will become unprofitable, and everyone will be able to play normally."
7/28/2010,"there are 12376129438646 other games out there that are just like you describe. how about you start to play one of these, instead of trying to ruin this one game so many people liked for more than a few weeks/months. remember you choose what game you play, so stop trying to ruin it for the people that actually enjoys the game as it is."
7/28/2010,"what's ruining the game? if you want to be a pirate - low secs are a real paradise for you. cowards choose high secs for safety, risc kills fun for us. everyone goes where it suits him. what's wrong with it?"
7/28/2010,you assuming high sec is supposed to be 100% safe.newsflash! it isn't
7/28/2010,"then it isn't really high security, just a glorified version of low security."
7/28/2010,"doesn't it make sense that a pirate will go where it's prey is ? hardly anything worth looting ventures into lowsec, so u can hardly call it ""paradise"" for pirates."
7/28/2010,"messenger,in highsec, by design, you are 'safer' not 'safe'. the game is design to punish carelessness even in 'safer' areas, so you either need to be diligent or you need to come to grips with the price of being lazy.you are operating from the presumption that hisec is supposed to be safe. it's a fundamental misunderstanding on your part."
7/28/2010,"what's the point in game if your ship got locked and ripped when you're doing mission in hi-secs? where is 'laziness' and 'misunderstanding' here? i've never ever did a risky things. never taken a possibly dangerous mission, never responded on pvp provocations, and never ever will go lowsecs. and still there's a risk to die for nothing.it's just a game's bug's exploiting getting insured from cops. the biggest nonsence one can hardly imagine. more absurd thing than insurance from suicide even.and if there is a high security area it's really presumed to have some security at all. now it's got nothing like that. pirates can kill everyone they wish, get an insane profit, and receive no real punishment for that."
7/28/2010,"i want to play this game by jumping my ships into a ""secure"" area where people are completely disillusioned to how the game actually works. i then want to quickly and easily kill these people, take the very expensive loot from their ships, and drink their tears. i want to do this whenever i want, with little to no penalty, besides not being able to move goods in high-sec, not being able to buy things in high-sec, not being able to survive gate gun agression in fun ships while fighting in low-sec, having to make alts to make money in highsec to fuel my pvp obsessions. no penalties. none there.who are you to tell me i can't play this game the way i want to?welcome to the sandbox."
7/28/2010,"it sounds like: 'i want to come into your house whenever i wish, r##e your wife, kill your children and force you to eat their meat. and there should be no penalty for that. no penalty at all!!! who are you to tell me how to enjoy myself?!!'every one [censored] like you ruins game for at least ten normal people a day. hope the developers would take that in mind."
7/28/2010,"no, it sounds like you take the game (look up the definition) way to seriously, and probably need to take a break from your internet spaceship pixels for a while. the fact that you can even compare a game to **** and murder indicates just how twisted and warped your sense of reality is.alternatively, you're a troll. in which case, +1 internets to you for getting people to believe that load of horsecrap in the op."
7/28/2010,"my desire to do those things has nothing to do with my desire to gank your mission ship. please keep on topic. we get our penalites for suicide ganking, and believe it or not it does make the game more difficult to be sitting at -10 security status. on top of it all, we have to read dozens and dozens of whiney ""why isn't carebear land perfectly safe all the time baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwww!!!"" posts every day. please, think of the pirates."
7/28/2010,"the game takes real time, real effort and real money. and i'd gladly, without any scent of remorse, murder anyone who'd ruined my real effort. but there is 1(one) thing why i'll never do anything like that. know what? the penalties. if i murder someone - i'll met the direst consequences, go to jail and ruin my own life. well, that's just what i'm talking about: crimes should be punished harshly. at least, in the civilized part of the world."
7/28/2010,"those penalties are the results of your own crimes exclusively. people doesnt force you to be a pirate, so why should they suffer for your enjoyment?"
7/28/2010,"and still, all i hear is:baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww!i will concede that, even though i love suicide ganking, insurance payout on concord kills is a little ****ed up. everything else is positively silly. just because you don't understand game mechanics doesn't mean you get to be safe and cuddly. every time you press ""connect"" on your login screen, you're consenting to at least some form of pvp. when you press ""undock"" that form of pvp is getting your ship blown up. ccp knows this happens. ccp likes that this happens. ccp endorses these actions. the reason it works this way is because *it's the way ccp wants it to work*. don't like it?hello kitty online is that way ----->harden the **** up"
7/28/2010,"you consent to pvp when you log in. if you don't like that, or agree with it, i'd suggest you find a new game to play. your tears will not change this."
7/28/2010,"at least some sence from you! unexpected, really.please, explain me silly one thing about game mechanics i dont understand at all. how can i prevent being suicide ganked right in the middle of the mission? or everyone should fly exclusively in tengu with a full antiscan fit?there is a hell lot of pvp areas. and a big red warning in front of them. when a player jumps there - he seals his own death sentence, and that is his own choise for pvp. if ccp greatly desires to sacrifice tons of normal people to a handful of maniacal perverts - that's the best way."
7/28/2010,where there is reward there is risk that is what ccp go by if not rats killing you then a player will eventually kill youeve is not safe no where in eve is safe everyone is a target everyone is prey
7/28/2010,"confirming i'm a maniacal pervert who ****s wives, burns houses and eats babies.nomnomnom.it's like this forum isn't even moderated. you can't even get threads locked for trolling anymore!"
7/28/2010,"piracy is piracy, even in low sec, which is also insured.surviving/avoiding a suicide gank in a missioning ship requires u to not be mentally slow or fail fitted (no eccm subsystem t3 required), both of which apparently fits u.this is not world of warcraft, where u have battlegrounds and sanctuaries. u want that, go back to wow.step back from the keyboard, look around u, then take a deep breath. try it."
7/28/2010,"so you're willing to kill the guy who beats you out of a promotion at work, but you won't because you might get caught and go to jail.and yet you say the pirates in eve are the ones with the problems. i'm not sure there's a pill to cure what ails you.also, i'm now convinced you're trolling, because that's too damned crazy to be true."
7/28/2010,"just to add to what de'veldrin said:you're claiming that this ruins your fun, when you're suggesting that you'd kill someone for ruining your fun? doesn't just perhaps cross your mind as ruining their fun just a little?and also, eve isn't a civilised part of the world. so in conclusion:gtfobtwow troll."
7/28/2010,"no way. if he beats me in work - it just mean's he's better in work. honest and simple. but if he'd, say, stolen my wallet - that's way another story... for that i could kill with no doubt. but wont. i'm a very law-abiding citizen.no one irl or anywhere i've been in games couldnt say i treated him unfairly.it's all about rules. if a person follows certain rules (say, dont fly in low secs, dont respond on pvp provocations, etc) he shouldnt possibly got killed. now the game has no rules and no one nowhere in no way can prevent himself from being suicide ganked. by the way, i've never been ganked on mis (although been provoked many times - but that doesnt count), but know many of such an instances. if i'd lose my ship - i'll have to quit, it's too expensive. and i dont want to quit."
7/28/2010,"not even for a little bit. the guilt is entirely on initial agressor, and the harder he'd been punished for that - the better."
7/28/2010,bingo. next topic please.
7/28/2010,"correct, that's a pretty good description.hi-sec isn't meant to be safe. it just has more rigorous rules of engagement. in practice, this means that it's significantly safer than lo-sec, but by no means absolutely safe. and it was never intended to be completely safe. ever."
7/28/2010,it's safe inside the station
7/28/2010,"if you don't want people to suicide you, don't fly ships that are easy or worthwhile to suicide. no faction mods, no expensive cargo, good tank"
7/28/2010,"eve online is unique in a sense that piracy, griefing, smacktalking, is allowed even encouraged.sometimes it creates highly dramatic situations that provides the other side endless entertainment.i have no doubt, that when ccp would revamp this game in some kind of world of warcraft carebear heaven, they might get more subscriptions.however, ccp is clear that they want eve online to be a unique sandbox, where everything (or close to everything) is controlled by players, with as much freedom as possible.these discussions about making this another carebear heaven game are endless, there lots of people wanting that, with always the same answer, it won't happen.while i have respect in your point of view, i suggest you accept eve online how it is in it's own unique way or try find another game.or to say it ccp's words, ""htfu""."
7/28/2010,"messenger... you must understand something... one of the basic tenants of eve is ""non-consensual pvp."" if someone wants to engage you, they will find a way... be it through war-decs, suicide ganking, market pvp, resource wars, etc. in this way, eve is very similar to real life. but that's also where the similarities end.i vaguely recall the devs saying some years ago on how they wanted to see how people would behave in an environment where the rules were not so clear cut... where people could make choices on their own without the game mechanics interfering too much.to this effect, you have a ""wild west"" scenario in space. cities (high-sec) are safer than towns. towns (low-sec) are safer than the wilderness (null-sec). i put emphasis on ""safer"" because even cities are not safe. people will still commit crimes in general because they have usually accepted the consequences of their actions and are fine with it (risk to reward ratio). raising the penalties will not change that... it will just make people more ""selective"" of their ""targets.""to answer you question... the one about how you are supposed to avoid conflict... i can answer in one sentence: to avoid pvp you must discourage people from seeing you as a target (or an easy one at least). some good advice i can give to this effect are:- become part of a ""badass"" corp/alliance... one who has people that will have no qualms retaliating for you.- build up a killboard. go out into faction war, a pirate group, or something and kill some things. having a decent killboard can usually discourage most lame war-decs and such.- fly ""cheap""... no faction mods, no fancy ships... generally nothing too horribly expensive or wouldn't be too painful to lose/replace (t2 stuff is okay).- fly ""smart."" want to avoid that suicide gate camp? get a friend to scout you. or you can make the gank unprofitable by not carrying too expensive of cargo. hell, try doing that mwd-cloak trick... it works pretty well.getting back on track here:not supported."

7/28/2010,"and their pvp role, which is antifrigate support. apart from the cormorant which is admittedly a bit lacking they fill that role just fine if fitted properly.even the cormorant can be used to some effect, but that'd be stretching it i guess since you can train up the catalyst in a few hours and use pretty much the same support skills.imo the ""issue"" with destroyers is pretty much the same as with assault frigates, people expect them to do things they are simply not meant to do.just take a look at fw, they are used a lot and to great effect there, and not just by rookie pilots but by seasoned veterans as well."

7/28/2010,op sounds cute in fleets.supported
7/28/2010,"probably not the best support reason, but i'll take it. so now i support both my post and my cuteness.assault frigates had an incredibly awesome fix when they got an ab boost on sisi... no clue why ccp didn't end up implementing it. destroyers are not fine. currently, i can fit out a punisher with reasonable dps, similar or better tank, with 2x the speed and half the sig radius of a cormorant. and the same is pretty much true of every race destroyer. destroyers are supposed to have awesome volley power, but the best t2 range volley of any comes from a thrasher, and it's only 1100ish.... a punisher can absorb about 7-8 of those hits if it's not already breaking the tracking. not to mention, it takes nearly 9.3 seconds per fire, so that's nearly 1 minute of fire required just to kill a t1 frigate. that's not filling the intended role at all. destroyers are supposed to be high range, high volley ships, and they cannot even fit range guns without totally gimping themselves. they need more fitting so they can actually fit the best frigate class guns. they need more slots so they can actually fit a tank that can be better than most t1 frigates. not to mention the above other helpful buffs. there's not one thing listed above that going to tell everyone and their brother, ""omg destroyers are op, lets all go fly them."" but those buffs will help actually make the ships worthy of use and add a bit more interest and diversity to the game.the only reason the thrasher is a useful destroyer is because it has solid close range dps using the very easy to fit auto cannons and an ability to fit a few shield buffs. no other race can even achieve close to the same dps and tank, similar sig or speed. most of them struggle to even look competently fit when using the lowest teir of guns, because their fittings are so borked, it's just rough to do anything useful."

7/28/2010,"ok ok, first of all this isn't a rant about skills taking too long or anything like that, completely different in fact. regardless i'm sure some people still aren't going to like it.miningpirattingmissions (to some extent)what do these four things have in common? well, they all make isk, and they're all trivially easy to do. in order from quite possibly the worst offenders to not-quite-the-worst. all of these gameplay elements promote macro usage, and why? because computers are great at repetitive tasks that humans have no real desire to do. but why then should these tasks be in a game? it's my belief at least that any kind of gameplay that promotes macros, is one that needs to be looked at.as far as suggestions to fix it, i don't have a whole lot beyond ""something needs to fill the void"", but i've got a bit of one for mining at least, probably one of the most heavily macroed tasks until the pi powergamers get theirs writtenfor mining at least, i would propose that all asteroids contain more than one type of ore that can be extracted (similar to ""real"" mining) and depending on what type of ore you're looking for, you would scan for concentrations of that ore and play a little minigame to get that kind of ore out. not doing it correctly would yield less ore, but it would require semi-constant attention to do it right, and would hopefully take some skill to do instead of more mindless clicking. yields would probably need to be boosted somewhat to make up for the increased effort and inevitable decline of miners who can no longer run 8 boxes or macro the thing.rare ore concentrations are much lower (or nonexistent) inside of hi-sec, and mining crystals give a bonus to that ore type only (for example, it might be possible to grab some of the ore you don't want if you don't focus the laser correctly, and the crystal would only bonus one type.)"
7/28/2010,"the fleet finder introduced in dominion is a very conveniento tool for quickly assembling a fleet. no need for x'ing up, no need to post adverts in chat. with the fix to the standings-based fleet in tyrannis, it also became much easier to use.in my corp, we find it useful to keep a fleet advert up all the time, so people who log on can join fleet inmediately and so help each other if required.however, its behaviour is still somewhat annoying in several situations where it should not be: when limiting the fleet by standings, the finder uses the higher value of the standings range. so if you set the fleet to let in people with excellent (deep blue) standings, the game will only let in people with +10 standings, and keep out +8. same with light blue standings. solution: make the fleet finder's cut-off standings 0.1 and 5.1 respectively. every time you change your standings to anyone, your advert is removed and you are prompted for a new one . the problem is that, in tyrannis, adding someone to your address book or removing them counts as a standings change. this makes no sense from the player's point of view (and can become very annoying if you add someone to the book for intel reasons). solution: do not reset the advert when the fleet boss' standings change when you are left as the last person in the fleet, the fleet finder automatically removes your advert and asks for a new one. since the system allows a 1-man fleet with an advert, i don't see the need for this. sometimes the fleet boss goes afk, everyone else logs off, and when the boss comes back there is no advert and a new fleet has been started. solution: do not reset the advert when there is just one person left in the fleet."

7/28/2010,"zso and habaticus have the right of it. eve is better thought of as a sandbox with pvp, not a pvp-sandbox. a few thoughts. some have referred to this sandbox with pvp as a space simulator, a space-based virtual world, or a cosmos. whatever one calls it, the point is to distinguish between divergent understandings of what eve is or should be. to be fair, from what i gather from old players and past documentation, the balance between pvp-sandbox and a sandbox with pvp has been evolving over time. this admits for legitimate disagreement as to the exact role of pvp in eve. even so, eve is increasingly rich in non-pvp possibilities and players.whether eve is a cosmos (or not) is the root presupposition that drives much of what people have to say here, and how we interpret the views of others. for example, it help explains much of the drama over ank -- ""she is anti-pvp and anti-eve"". it helps explain the self-privileging claim that some of us ""get eve"" while others do not. and it help explains the responses to various proposals in assembly hall. in the end, the view taken by ccp is a policy decision that will drive the development and refinement of eve over time. player outlooks may help shape this policy via the csm, ccp's monitoring of the forums, and eventually, competition from alternative, space-based virtual worlds. and therein lies the importance of the distinction.the pvp-sandbox is a narrow vision that constrains the development of eve. the sandbox with pvp is an expansive vision with far greater possibilities. i'd prefer ccp pursue the expansive vision in a way that keeps its pvp edge, as well as generates the fixes and enhancements to eve we all know are required. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"

7/28/2010,yes indeed - support - their effectiveness will increase in proportion to increased player support.
7/28/2010,i'd like to second habaticus' emphasis on player support.
7/28/2010,"first off, i understand the whole sabotage aspect of the game and think it should remain. however, with the recent disbanding of uk i find myself asking ""why do they instantly lose sov?""why should an alliance instantly lose control of a solar system just because they no longer have an alliance ticker next to their name? it's not like all of uk just vanished once the spy clicked the button. so why isn't there some type of failsafe for things like this? i just have a really hard time understanding how an alliance can be completely lost and lose all control, when all they really lost was a label.from a different pov:if someone were to steal my identity, it doesn't mean my only option is to roll over and die. i am still me and there are options to regain what was taken from me. chiefly, the person who stole my identity can't just come into my home and call it his home without getting stabbed or shot in the face, allowing me to regain my identity or at least maintain control of my home.on a side note, you can't tell me that these sudden freak alliance disbandings are completely motivated by in-game politics. i'm willing to be all i have that most of them are done by pricks in real life who simply don't like the other players because they are in a different alliance. these are considered out of game factors and adversely affect the proper game politics imo."
7/28/2010,so you're saying that if i disband your alliance because i think in real life that you have a terrible alliance i should be banned but if i disband your alliance because my in game character doesn't like your alliance then everything is kosher.
7/29/2010,"thanks guys, keep it coming!ha now that's asking too much kiddin that would be great!"
7/29/2010,"i'm going to go out on a limb here.while i do agree that the black ops need some kind of buff, i don't think it should be the ability to use a covert cloak.imho the role of the black ops is primary the ability to move covert ships around via jump portals. however the issue there is the low risk associated with a covert ops ""hotdrop"", the aggressor has the initiative to pick that low risk moment to spring a hot drop on a target. the inability of a black ops to warp around cloaked means that there is a risk associated with using them. an example being to rescue stranded covert ships in a camped system. the buffs i would be looking at is fuel consumption/fuel capacity and jump ranges. the jump portal is a blackops one unique feature and it is there you should be looking to buff it."
7/29/2010,yes please to ccp taking some notice of the way the players have wanted them to develop the game all along.
7/29/2010,100%
7/29/2010,"you do better than before ccp, that is sure, but here a little of still broken/forgotten thing:1. cosmos2. this post: release notes for fiction changes promised update every few week ? 1.2 year without new after the first post.3.interbus station and lp store, these people have been waiting long enough for you to fufill your promise4. once upon a time, french people had a traducted tutorial. then someday ccp decided to change the tutorial and pomised a traduction soon... yeah, right5. alliance/public acces to hangar, production line and laboratory.i support this thread and im proud of it"
7/29/2010,"new features are getting old when everything else is breaking downif only ccp realise how much balance and polishing improve their game way more than new feature, like the bomber upgrade or the titan change ... compared to half baked, half served, half working dominion sov system or the half useless pi and there is so many proposal about modifying the ""current"" eve in term of balancing and mechanic that would be a lot more usefull than anything incarna will release as ""new feature""supported"

7/29/2010,"added to the ""low hanging fruit"" list."
7/29/2010,"the proposal is merely that, a proposed statement by the csm. if the other members of the csm do not agree with the wording, it will be changed after debate during the meeting.i have come to a considered conclusion on this issue, based on all the evidence available to me at this time. if you provide additional evidence, i will reconsider my conclusions in light of the new information.ps: the mention of ""bitter old vets"" in the proposal is an example of an extremely advanced concept that you are clearly unfamiliar with. here is a wikipedia link that may be helpful."
7/29/2010,i would like to see the following added to the cons list to correctly represent much of the feedback that has been given: removes a level of depth/choice/consequence from character development that many feel are a feature/benefit and not a problem.
7/29/2010,"i did not realize that a proposal going before the csm was the place for a satirical comment. i thought it was ""serious spaceship business"" - my bad. guess my belief that csm is supposed to be doing ""serious spaceship business"" for the playerbase is incorrect then..."
7/29/2010,"problem is, both sides are doing that in either case...the biggest problem still lies in the nearly mandatory need to skill at least a bit into the learning skills.yes, there are strategical thoughts about it, but those only come into play a lot later. i haven't skilled the learnings fully nad now my current skill plan would take 2 month longer than if i had skilled them further. but to be honest, after more than 40 million sp, there isn't that much importance in squeezing out the last drop of sp/hour. at least to me.heh, i lost far more training time when i went away from eve while still paying for my account.and just a few more thoughts to ponder:if learnings get removed (as certain / uncertain you feel it is) and no attribute change would compensate this, the efective value of imps is going to rise a lot. getting +5 attribute on top of 15 is a very nice bonus, but getting it on top of 5 doubles it. an attribute compensation seems to me necessary so the gap between those being able to pay for +5s and those not being able wouldn't widen too much.my alt chars (two of them, both on hiatus due to financial status atm) have by far better leranings than my main. reason is, i could more easily plan those skills and wasn't in any hurry or need to get anything. i could actually play eve with my main while my alts slowly got their learning skills. and that is to me the biggest pro for removing the learnings. alt chars have it by far easier to actually gain those learnings than first chars ever will. they are the only ones that can really spend the time in the beginning to maximize the learnings, because the play is happening on another account."
7/29/2010,worst idea ever.
7/29/2010,"just remember guys, 89% of statistics are made up and the 6 studies i got that data from agree. and no i can't link you to the studies./not approved in the least."
7/29/2010,i would like to suggest a slightly different solution to this problem. it's essentially no different that the original posters however old vets with all 5's in learning skills would suffer no loss. wipe all the learning skills. kill the points gained in each attribute from the learning skills. kill that 10% learning modifier from learning. then change the skill points per hour formula.currently the skill points per hour are calculated as follows:skill points = 60*primary attribute + 30*secondary attributechange it to the following:skill points = 990 + 66*primary + 33*secondaryif you are a veteran and managed to max out your learning skills you would see no slow down to learning new skills. if you have any less you would be upgraded to veteran status. the other advantage to this comes when you plug in cyber or play with your attributes in the restat screen. if you plug in a level 5 cyber you will not see your skill jump by 5.5. when you add and subtract a point from your attribute in the restat screen you will see your ending attribute gain and lose a single point. the original posters suggestion would have this effect.-------------cryptic math follows--------------sp = 60*p' + 30*s'p' = (p+10)*1.1 primaryskill+10 points from learning + 10% for the learning skills' = (s+10)*1.1 sp = 60*(p+10)*1.1 + 30*(s+10)*1.1sp = 66*(p+10) + 33*(s+10)sp = 66*p + 660 + 33*s + 330sp = 990 + 66*p + 33*s

7/29/2010,strongly support!!!
7/29/2010,"i do appologise if there is already a thread for this.i was thinking that eve gate could have personal/corp/ally killboards incorperated into it.it seems like the perfect place for it, it would also get people using eve gate alot more because at the minute it seems like its not used to its full potential...just a thought... would be awesome if it can be done though. :)"
7/29/2010,"this is a good idea and i support it. unfortunately, ccp has stated previously that they have no intention of hosting any official killboards, so i doubt this will ever happen. also, this sort of feature doesn't really attract new players like incarna or dust or pi will so it would never make it onto ccps new agenda."
7/29/2010,"if ccp doesn't want to host kbs, for whatever reason(bit silly imo), they could easyly work with someone else like battle clinic for one, who would host killboards. considering eve gate is basicaly a copy of facebook. it would be just like creating an app that players who wanted to use would install on there own gate. ccp then wouldnt need to host anything they just need to make it work.i'm no expert but it can't be that complicated."
7/29/2010,not supporting anything that improves spacebook.it's a total waste of developer time and they should be focusing on fixing/polishing the game and not there bloody spacebook that no one really uses.as for why ccp won't do the kb.... one of those reasons i'm willing to bet good isk is the fact they consume an obscene amount of hard drive space in just functionality alone.my forum boards don't even consume that much for crying out loud... my host provider has a 100mb cap on db storage... the kb's i tried to host consumed half of that space in just the first week alone. (it was for an alliance and they we're busy busy indeed)*and for people who don't understand what goes into web-hosting... that's an considerable amount of storage space to take up. my forum boards have many many posts and they hover around 5 to 10mb after 2 to 3 years of service... just to give you a rough idea.*now i didn't look into what took that space up.... it never made sense... but i have a feeling that would be one of those reasons.but yeah... spacebook has some nice features... but i can live without them and safely say its a security risk waiting to go off.
7/29/2010,"seeing as they are fragile enough as it is, i think it would make sense to at least give them the interdiction nullifier as a role bonus."
7/29/2010,"for those of us who don't have 50 inch wide monitors playing at 9001x9001 resolution, we can't afford to have the ship type column on our overviews a mile wide. this often causes problems with the stabber and stabber fleet issue as the stabber fleet issue will only show up as ""stabber"", causing people (ie me) to attack them thinking it's just some ****ty little stabber only to see it pop 5 drones and instapop them with 40k ehp. thanks"
7/29/2010,"make it a little bigger so you can see ""stabber f"" or you could show info before you start attacking"

7/29/2010,"we talked about this awhile ago, and after living in 0.0 for awhile now, i would have to say no.it's just that much more of a risk to lose all your stuff, and that could completely bankrupt people very fast.imagine having 50b worth of bpo's in an outpost. you go on vacation and are away for a week thinking everything is all good.. then you come back to find out that the outpost all your stuff was in, got blown up and all of those bpo's are gone.sure you could leave expensive things like that in an npc station, but when you live in deep 0.0, you dont have any npc stations, and you need stations to leave your ships, fuel, moon goo, etc..i think the ability to conquer the station and deny docking rights to people is more than enough. atleast that way you still technically own your items, you just cant really get em out of the station.."
7/29/2010,"out of pure interest and a sudden idea....how would you stay to the point of having 1 main outpost per constelation that is indestructuable, while every other outpost in the constellation can be treated as suggested by zendoren?this way you can keep the more unique stuff safe and stil have the ability to keep your capitals split between several constellation to not end in a lockdown by the enemy camping a single station.as for the medical clone thing. i dont like the npc only option. exspecial in deepspace its a pain to get there. i would rather prefer an option that sends you to the closest indestructable outpost your alliance owns / if none is there to empire. however, you would stil have cloning bay issues if you are on a low sp clone and the safe outpost gets taking over while your on holiday -> you cant use the medical bay. a free jumpclone in empire could fix that.as for the last idea. i would like something like a capital salvaging system, just so that an attacker can do continously damage by removing the station fully (say after a timer of xx days) when they leave the station behind their own battlelines."
7/29/2010,a outpost cost around 20 - 40 bil to create. losing a asset like that and a way to control the area (docking = contolling) is a big loss on its selve. i like the out of the box idea but its a little bit to much.
7/29/2010,"well let me try to bring arguments against that:motherships + decent fitting cost 20b+ yet a lot people not in spaceholding alliances have them and their number is continously increasing. sure unlike a station they can be hidden but see the positive side. people acctualy would commit in groups for this asset which means there would be more fights.if half your alliance were afk, would it be fair to hold those outposts against equal strike forces just because if they take something you will take it again the next time you have a bigger fleet as disposal with less possible losses?sure you can bring timezones as an argument but ccp inventeded several timer in the new sovereign system, if a station could be put in this miserable state after the first timer it would surely force the attacker to show up on more occasions than its now.but to come back on the cost factor, zendoren said himself:so the cost will allready be less anyway when the outpost is just in a burned out state. (i would prefer total anhilation through aslong as theres a reasonable safe hub per constelation as described above :p)sure it hurts to loose something, but eve was never ment to be a save haven, so given more opportunity for people to fight (exspecial with the current state of 0.0) as this idea does would be a decent thing.on a sidenode also have a look at newer eve alliances. people wanna accomplish something and building an outpost if you arent a long time spaceholder is something! if you make them destructable sure people will be hurt, but other people also will have joy in reconstructing their own fortune again.as for your docking controlling point smelly bait, i am not sure if you mean docking as a mean to control the local space or as controlling the docking. but...1) if its the earlier, i would say you simple have the same chances as the attacker and can just as him use pos to keep your fleet close by. evening chances is not a bad thing.2) if its the later, zendoren also said that everyone is able to dock, so dominating the space arround the station would be a mean in itself and just another mean for combat.i am starting to become all for it :)"
7/29/2010,"agreed.... with last post that is.i find the excuse of losing valuables is no different (and rather carebearishly pathetic) then getting a jf blown up by a gank fleet carrying goods. people lose that kind of crap all the time every day.that is the cost/risk for the privilege of holding 0.0 territory. as it should be! this is eve online people... why stop it the inevitable doom.if your going to go afk for a long period of time... have the brains enough to store these goods someplace where they can be retrieved... and that's just the top of a long list of solutions to make sure your ""stuff"" is safe.the whole point of 0.0 is its conquerable space... it's not supposed to be safe... i think the danger of 0.0 to alliances who hold outposts is not high enough.outposts that are built and become permanent fixtures will continue to grow in numbers and litter dozens if not soon hundreds of systems in the not too distant future.it's rather easy to make isk down there if you know what your doing... and i do mean a crapload of isk mind you.i don't mind the idea of an single outpost in a region being flagged as an hq but there should be a cost to that.... and it should be ""un-flaggable"" if its conquered."
7/29/2010,"this gets a bump every couple of days and every time it gets bumped more people give it a thumbs up.only one person has not given it a thumbs up and the claim that npc stocks reduce the need to click excessively. also uses the clicking as an excuse to keep the market from getting swamped. the odd thing about the comments, people are doing pi, the npc items only make a fraction of the pi items that need to be made, not to mention when those stockpiles run out people will have to be clicking a thousand times a day. the second point out ""keeped the market scarce by introducing a human bottleneck."" is... weak in my opinion. you still have logistics to content with which should be the only human bottleneck.having a function in game that is targeted toward ""low entry, low cost"" is all well and good. it should bring in more people, but having that function the mega click fest that pi is, is just extremely poor example being set for new players.""hey, i tried that eve game, when i started playing i had to do...1) hunt rats in 0.8-1.0 system getting me between 5k and 10k a rat.2) sit out at a belt for hours on end in my mining n00b ship mining veldspar3) when i finally got enough isk to buy some skills for industry, i trained skills for three weeks getting up planetary interaction.4) i then clicked my mouse over a thousand times to setup a couple of planets to give me some passive income while i mine and rat.""conclusion... eve is a click or wait fest, you either have to wait for everything to get done, or click things hundreds of times to get anywhere..is that the example ccp wants to set for new players... as old players say to new players that ask ""what's a good way to make some passive isk?"" the old players say ""planetary interaction has a low capital and skill requirements, and can make some passive isk.""don't force new subscribers to click hundreds of time, it sets a bad example and for those of us that love eve, it just one more thing to hate...."
7/29/2010,"to be honest, i really hope they prenerved pi, as they did with so many other things.the possible upgrades are pretty awesome (which amarr player wouldn't want their own temperate planet making slaves?). i just need to wait for them... oh and hope...in the mean time reducing the amount of micromanagement so we can focus on the fun parts of micromanagement would be a very nice move.i have already given my thumbs up, so i won't add another one. but i want to underline the issue of removing ui blocks of the pi. for a bot it doesn't matter if it clicks one time or a hundred times. to me it does.perhaps another possible upgrade would be to be able to drop an existing command center over an old one, thus replacing the old one with the new while keeping the rest of the infrastructure the same. not to save any isk, but to remove another ui block that keeps me from the fun parts of micro management."

7/29/2010,humm im confused. what is this place you call safe? i know of not one place in the whole universe(irl) that is 100% safe.you do realise that even in the real world nothing is safe right?
7/29/2010,"yes, exactly. like rl, if they really want to get you - they will get you anyway. i've just been talking about something closer to realistic consequences about such an actions. it would be really ridiculous if you'd murder someone in the middle of the city, caught by the cops... and immediately repayed by insurance company out of any punishment, set free and even allowed to keep all robbed possessions. it would be a real criminal paradise, like we do see it now in eve.plain and simple: no insurance company irl would pay for suicide, nor they'd insure you against punishment for the crimes you'd commit. and all the stolen wealth is a subject of confiscation and return to its legal owner.pure realistic, no sign of any kind of 'synthetic' rules."

7/29/2010,what? are you ******ed?high != 100%99% is pretty high wouldn't you say? doesn't mean its 100%
7/29/2010,"and this is where we come full circle in this discussion: eve is a game and not real life. ergo, the rules will not be the same. what you are experiencing are mechanics designed by the developers to ensure that there is no safe place in the game (i.e. everything has risks involved in it, either through npcs or by players) while at the same time giving you enough of a chance to play the odds and risk in your favor (if you are smart enough).the pirates who suicide gank... they are allowed to do so because they are willing to accept the penalties involved in their criminal acts (and they plan accordingly). the people who are the targets of pirates, they also have the means to mitigate risk and stay out of harms way... ""means"" which i explained in my previous post (which i feel you didn't read in its entirety).so to you i pose a question: your playstyle is your playstyle. the same can be said for the pirates or the people in the null-sec alliances. why should your playstyle be safer than others?"
7/29/2010,"no.any credibility you might have had, which wasn't that much, you blew away with your responses to topic's replies."
7/29/2010,"actually, eve is even harsher on criminal than real life.you know, in real life even if is hard in some place, you can actually avoid the police/repercussion without being banned by god"
7/29/2010,"i hear there is this game called ""second life"" which imitates real. if you want realistic, i suggest you play a game like that as flying around in space behind a collapsed wormhole from earth in space with waterworld gravity and physics is not at all realistic.also, you keep talking about losing your mission ship in a mission in high sec. i know a lot of mission runners and only 1 ever lost a ship to suicide ganking, which was at a gate on autopilot. you are either using stupidly expensive fits to compensate for your inability to fit ships, or you are just lying, because there are a bazillion working t2 fits that are not even remotely worth suicide ganking."
7/29/2010,"that'd be fine, as long as we have more realistic cops as well.you know, ones that arrive within 1-4 hours (if they come at all) and leave you feeling like you're the one at fault. then they tell you that there's less than a 5% chance they'll ever catch the perp.two weeks later, they arrest the closest minmatar hoping to find a quarter dose of mindflood on him, and he gets a 3 month suspended sentence. meanwhile you've been robbed twice more and the police never do anything about those two because hey, they already warned you, right?"
7/29/2010,"i don't support this, but if it were reversed we'd see the lowsec and 0.0 people cry just as bad. that is if lowsec or null would have rats that would explode and destroy your ship if they got near you, and shooting them first would cause superrats to spawn and vaporize your ship for doing so.i'm not a fan of gaming security rules like the current suicide ganking does. it's disproportionately penalizing industrial ships because it prevents them from fighting back in any way through escorts. it also prevents retribution through using alts: kill rights are meaningless if all you use are dessie gank alts, or cheap bs fits.so i don't support the op, but i would like to see it balanced a little better."
7/29/2010,"[not supported]history lesson: safe, cozy and warm = countries with brainless people such as america[1] or switzerland[2] :p ... the result will be:- either an aggressive + stupid race(1) that will lie, protect only his own interest(as we all know the oil reserves are for 10 years max ... and iraq's for 150) and cultivate stupidity and mediocrity among the generations to come;- either a well developed country (based on some irrelevant measurement) that doesn't want to go further and only the, so called, reputation will safe it (what did you hear about (2) in the past 10-20 ... 100 years ... research, social models, economic/ecological advancements or just politics, ""money"" and mountains?!);if the game hurts you or the stress is to much, petition this to your government to declare war on iceland!p.s.i see you're amarr ... how ironic ... god will protect you!"

7/29/2010,"this is an interesting topic because messenger001 is trying to get ccp to fix an issue. your issue is that high sec is not safe enough and you don't want to lose that pretty pve ship of yours.points to make you aware and reiterate since some of these fine pvpers have already pinged on some of these items:-pirates and criminals will gank you. the mechanic is high sec is safer, not ""safe"". criminals aren't restricted to back alleys and ghettos, they will come into your house and kill you. this is internet spaceships, it's serious and realistic.-there are consequences to criminal acts, just like with most anything. you commit a crime and you lose privileges.-insurance has been changed and blows now for gankers. that is a poor justification for a dev to focus on your issue.-this is a sandbox, you can play in the corner of it with your toys, but eventually a bigger kid might come over, beat you up and take it. watch the trailers, that is what ccp sales you.-the major powerblocks and 0.0 have been trying to get devs to focus on more important things like... game performance. don't cloud focus with this trivial nonsense. instead of viewing new eden by high security, low security, null security with standardized threat levels and protective measures, look at it like this:high security: kinda like the burbs or major city main street in some instances. threat is minimal in comparison to a ghetto or back alley, but you can still get mugged, assaulted, or killed.low security: more like the ghettos and back alleys. small time crooks and gangs will ravage you if you aren't careful and aware. null security: wild wild west! no holds barred!! outlaws run rampant, and personal governments are formed with their own rules and regulations. no control by big brother and major gang wars are alive and kicking, except when it lags... which ccp may eventually acknowledge.if you look at it that way and take the proper precautions, you'll be fine.proclus diadochuruke coordinatorvarion galacticown alliance, ncnc nation, best nation and posting in a widot thread!"
7/29/2010,"if you've been ganked in a mission in high sec it's because you were trying to do it afk, or you weren't paying attention to your scanner or grid (this is the lazy aspect), or you were flying in a very expensive/faction/officer fit missioning ship. if you don't want to be suicided in your missioning ship you need to be diligent or run your missions in a less expensive ship. there are many ways you can go about staying safe when running missions in high sec, you just have to be smart and not lazy about it. i run plexes on occassion in null sec and haven't been killed because i take care not to get caught, i pay attention to my on board scanner, i stay aligned.if you want a game that affords you places where you are completely safe, you need to find another game. eve was never intended to be that kind of game. there is risk and reward everywhere in new eden and that is how it is supposed to be.it's not a bug or an exploit. this is how the game was intended.they die and take a sec hit. they have to be smart and patient, often waiting hours and hours to find the right target. they have to contend with other people trying to snatch their targets and the wrecks out from under them.suiciding can be fun but it's also not instant gratification.also, lets not forget that ccp did just make it less profitable with the insurance nerf."
7/29/2010,"i like the suicide mechanic (ianasb). maybe keep insurance as is, but repeat offenders would be blacklisted by pend. no. no. no. might as well redo the graphics to be elves and wizards.it's not always for profit. mostly for lulz, killmails, tears, etc. overall, these ideas are not in line with the eve gestalt. no support."
7/29/2010,"very interesting idea. i'm working on some tweaks to the system as proposed, mainly due to the fact i only really thought about the essence of the idea rather than the actual meat, and several good points have been raised. i'm going to see if i can include this with it, more later :)"
7/29/2010,"very clever idea. i quite like it.slight tweak perhaps...i don't think there would be as many bounty hunters if the agents didn't stick to giving out contracts on pilots within a certain limit if jumps, like 25.if there are no targets with bounties within 25 jumps, there simply aren't any misions available. out of courtesy the agent may refer you to the nearest agent that does have a target.also, i hope that several bounty hunters would be hunting for the same target...you would get a frustrating message like ""altaen has cashed in on this bounty, you were too slow...i've got another target for you...see me when you get a chance.""this would make the profession more competitive, would create rivalries, reputations, infamy, etc."
7/29/2010,"i thought about this being a potential issue as well, but then i figured that it actually should be an integral part of the bounty hunting profession. with the ability to add anyone to your contact book (thus knowing when they are online) you can easily monitor a marks playing habits. and with locator agents, you can pinpoint any player in the galaxy. i also think it might be technically quite difficult, as players can be highly mobile across the galaxy."
7/29/2010,"not a bad idea at all. another would be to have all killright-generating-kills create the lowest tier of bounty mission, regardless of whether the victim files it with an agent or not. if a bounty hunter collects on this, you lose killrights immediately. so, killrights would more or less be a bounty mission that every victim would recieve, unless they chose to up the ante and put it on the bounty market for more than the base-bounty. also, to populate the system in the begining...you simply convert all existing bounties into bounty missions."
7/29/2010,"fair enough, maybe distance shouldn't be a factor...i fly almost every (night for me) day from 01:00-05:00. i almost never, ever see entire corporations' worth of my alliance mates, because their active shift is wholly comprised of the time that i am at work.if i wanted to hunt a bounty that was asleep for 100% of my available flying time, i would be quite frustrated if there was any negative impact of cancelling an assigment once i discovered i would never be able to complete it.solutions? maybe only give an assigment for a target that is active when you request the assigment.i don't think you should make it easy to cancel an assigment, that would promote cherry-picking convenient, easy, or low-skilled targets.i suppose this issue would make it more important to send multiple hunters after each target, and have no penalty if someone simply completes the assigment before you do."
7/29/2010,"thanks, additionally it has the benefit of offering the mark (the person who has a bounty on their head) a legitimate way of working off their bounty (by grinding sec status). as far as auto-transferring kill rights, while i do agree there needs to be a way to auto populate the system to keep it full of bounties across the galaxy, i hesitate to support this simply because you are taking something away from a player (the kill rights). there are probably plenty of players out there who enjoy those kill rights and would prefer to use them themselves. i would not want to take that way from them. i do agree with transferring all existing bounties over to any new system if it were to be implemented though."
7/29/2010,"i can see the problem, but at the same time having an easy route to dropping targets could lead to more abuse of the system...remember that the idea is to actually make a bounty worth something to the victim, rather than the target itself.maybe timezone's could be considered in some way, but that sounds an awful lot of work and in itself could lead to the same abuse as above.alternately, the missions could time out after x period of time, and having x missions active should mean you find a target...."
7/29/2010,"i really don't think it should be the onus of the system to make it easy for the bounty hunter.do you think boba fett would turn down a contract because han solo lived in a different time zone? i think bounty hunting should be a strenuous, and tasking profession for anyone to take up. i mean, look at that dogg buy on tv, he's not your normal dude amirite?if the mark is really worth it to you, you should be willing to alarm clock it (people in 0.0 alarm clock all the time for reinforcement timers) i'm not trying to shoot down ideas. i'm trying to work constructively with you guys because i would love to see a system work for bounty hunting, but i want to caution against making it too accessible and easy for them.edit: i guess the op needs to ask himself whether he sees bounty hunting as a profession that any casual player can take up, or if it might need to be reserved for more dedicated players."
7/29/2010,"anything is better than bounties at the moment - supported.however, there is a simpler way of getting the system at the moment to approach something resembling a fully thought out piece of game design:1. make kill rights able to be traded.2. make it so the maximum bounty you can claim is the cost of the bounty target's clone at the time of podding.simple, easy, and should make it a lot harder to exploit the bounty system to make a profit when you're the one with a bounty on your head."
7/29/2010,"i like this idea. a lot. there are portions of it i would quibble with (reward size for one) but by and large it has a lot in common with my own thoughts on the subject.that's one of the most ridiculous statements i've ever read. why should any profession be reserved for ""more dedicated players""? we all pay the same fee each month in order to play this game, why should people who have a job, wife and children be excluded from some part of the game simply because they cannot be online at odd hours of the day?you want something special for being online all day? you've got it: you can run missions until your eyes burn out, explore sites immediately after downtime and spin your ship for hours on end."
7/29/2010,"i completely disagree with you. i don't think this is ridiculous or even unprecedented. can a casual player run an alliance? can a casual player even manage a network of poses for an alliance?have you actually flipped through the eve online career guide?there are many within that are obviously reserved for players with more time to play the game than others.not everything in the game needs to be designed with the lowest common denominator in mind.bounty hunting is one of those things i'd like to see avoid the blizzard m.o. edit: i read your blog thingy and your ideas seem very much inline with this thread. i think you are highly overreacting about my statement, and perhaps even taking it out of context. the point i'm trying to make is that the bounty mission system should not hold the bounty hunter's hand and only give them missions that are in the bhers region, playtime, and timezone. a bounty hunter needs to be willing to cross vast amounts of space, and perhaps be prepared to log in on off hours if they want to hunt a decent bounty."
7/29/2010,"overreacting, perhaps. but these are the eve-o forums and they feed off drama and overreaction, right? maybe there is a precedent for ""reserving professions for dedicated players"" (you know, like grinding up experience in wow or something) but does that really make it fun? in the end, isn't it about fun? eve is not, nor should it be, a second job. my two tag lines are ""pvp is fun and it should be encouraged wherever possible"" and ""eve is a game and it should be fun, not a second job""; you'll see this theme wherever i write anything.edited for clarity: i disagree with magnus, and not the ops suggestion.and, i still disagree with you, magnus. in my opinion bounty hunting serves two purposes: content and retribution. the content is for the bounty hunter. when you log in, you should be able to do something. so ask for an assignment and you should get one within a reasonable distance and the guy should be online. the primary worries for the bounty hunter should be: is the target docked and not doing anything? is the target flying a ship i can't handle? do i have to circumnavigate dangerous space that may be blocked by the target's acquaintances? it's not worth it to expend days worth of effort moving two regions away from your normal base of operations with a ship only to find out the target has changed professions and is a permanently docked marketing alt. this should be content, which makes the game fun.the second reason behind bounty hunting is retribution; revenge for the guy who got killed. this can only really be served if the target is likely to be killed. if we do no hand holding at all (target could be anywhere including 0.0 and may be a completely different time zone from the hunter) then the target is not likely to be killed. we have to add that likelihood."
7/29/2010,"bear in mind that a target mission can be given to multiple people at the same time, increasing the chances of retribution considerably.good point on the profession change to daytrader, or hell even titan prisoner. i will give that some more thought."

7/29/2010,"so your idea is that in space vast empires with their own police/navy/and a unified security force, concord, allow the borders to be controlled by pirates? sounds like the empires and concord thought that through really well, if they wanted isolationism which would go against concord's mission and own interests in collecting trade fees, etc. i'm sure the economic interests of the empires and their member corporations would also be suffering too cause cutting off highsec routes would be the way to do that. different currency, what is the deal with trying to go backwards in time? will we have to physically carry our precious metals to trade at stations or can we keep using the electronic credits and other futuristic methods of buying and selling?not supported."
7/29/2010,"the reason why isk was created in the back story is because they're is to much currency, they needed one for interstellar trade. so in rp it's make no sense to go back. in a gameplay sense, for most people multiple currency fluctuation, economic news, saving in multiple currency, changing a currency for another, ect are boring if not downright irritating and unlike other aspect of eve, you can't simply ignore it, it's will be shoved down your throat every time you will use money.well some ganker gonna cry to see their nice bottleneck disappear. but i love the idea, i alway found isolated high-sec like solitude really interesting. most people live only in one nation/region anyway. what population? most player live around trade hub already. your idea, i love it, but it's will actually make it harder for people to move in less populated area. worse, there is a risk that people abandon more costly nation for the one with better price!"

7/29/2010,"woah , supported"
7/29/2010,i hope it is appropriate to plug my own proposal in here. it received enthusiast and nearly unanimous support. i estimate the implementation time to be under 5 minutes. no kidding:

7/29/2010,"here is a bit of low hanging fruit: (1) when arranging scan probes in the system map, let us have a black background!the funky luminous nebulae often hide the probes, celestials, etc. when you are trying to scan something or someone. especially in the latter case time is of the essence, and it sucks to not be able to even see your probe handles or the celestials in the system.(2) when displaying the 0.0 regional market, ffs give the system as well as the name of the station - don't make us do 3-4 clicks to find out where every single item for sale is."
7/29/2010,yes!!
7/29/2010,"move that ""drag and drop of bookmarks into chat windows and email."" to number 1. this is too long overdue. we're supposed to be x.. years into the future and we can't relay universal positions to each other apart from writing them on paper and dropping them in a can? whats the back story of how we lost that ability?"

7/29/2010,very cool idea. i think it should have been like that at the start. it will make lowsec less barren and boring too
7/29/2010,"interesting idea.with the talk of ""objectives for small gangs"" going around lately, i think this could qualify. if a structure is under attack, perhaps it could send an sos in local as a beacon in space or something so people could come defend it watch it get blown up.also, i know it's not the forums and it's not ""eve official"", but one of our csm representatives (mynxee) has set up a web site for presenting and voting on ideas to improve low-security space."
7/29/2010,very cool concept.
7/29/2010,"instead of having a big, pos-like force field it would be cool if the shanty towns looked more like the collection of structures you see in agent missions. seed a blueprint for the reactor structure (which already has a model) and use that to provide powergrid and cpu, but no force field. other starbase structures (including gun/ewar batteries) could then be linked to the reactor structure. any structure could be attacked at any time without having to bash down a shield first. multiple reactors could be used for larger shanty towns.also, it would be cool if we could anchor these anywhere in space, and not just next to moons. a criminal shanty town cranking out boosters seems like it ought take more effort to find than just checking out a bunch of moons."

7/29/2010,"i love it when neckbeard man-children feel threatened by good ideas, so have nothing but ad hominems to attack said good ideas"
7/29/2010,"a lot of people simple have the dysprosium of the early days in mind. it was bottlenecked so hard that the alliances which controled it had massive income and huge capital fleets before others while constantly selling it in jita for ridicolous prices.sure it gave opportunity for freighter suiciding but in the end all people had to do was control the moons. so it would certainly be helpful if you were writing in which form ressource x would be spawned. exspecial if you consider the use of ""ninja operations"".also keep in mind that people will continously ***** about prices and ccp will do the same as with high end moonminerals and invent something like alchemy for ressource x to eventualy construct it with y amount of ressource z.personaly i however think that making regions more unique is a great idea and would even go so far to give different kinds of space different attributes that effect ships, like wormholes allready do. that way every nullsec entity would also be more unique by maybe specializing their people in certain ships that have more use in the space they own.yet to really change 0.0 first of all the lag needs to be fixed. nothing makes people want to pvp less than constantly staring at a black screen or warping in onto the enemy just to not see him due to overview not loading and being shot by invisible enemys.after that we can discuss the sense of grinding 4 times as attacker while the defender has to show up only a single time to ruin your day.an overhaul of sovereign mechanics should be done again. the thinking of breaking sovereign into different states was very good by ccp as an attacker would surely be willing to ""bring it"" when he saw progress. staring at timers however is not any different from training skills and no exciting content at all.(since you are so much into graphics ccp why not give the different structures in system unique stuff. like plasmaclouds leaking from them if they are heavy damaged or from tcu if sovereign is about to break? i mean its not like the lag could get any worse than it is now...)but to come back on your basic idea...trade can also be bad. right now we allready have ingame coalitions that by themself own 7 regions or more and in addition have friends on a case to case basis. those would surely trade with each other but it seems a bit missing the idea of conflict. surely 1 entity would like to control ressource x but if this entity can trade a certain amount of ressource x against ressource y held by a buddy there would be no conflict either.so rather than simply adding ressources region depending there should also be some sense of conflict. i very much like your...and i think if ccp would introduce different kinds of space that effect certain ships it could be very valueable. this way you for example couldnt just get the special t2 mod that works anywhere in providence, no you could get that t2 mod in providence that works super awesome in tenal.basicly it would be stretching things apart and you could ballance it by close to empire regions producing less valueable or less minerals which are needed in a deepspace region, and deepspace maybe producing things that can be used in empire too to have the risk vs reward thinking.trade would be there non the less but the stretching would hopefully work against the constant forming of spacebuddy ( hes in my neighbouring region i have to like him ) coalitions.yet also the other people in this thread are right. if something is rare and unique, people will simply as it is sell it on jita market to make an easy coin. so what matters a lot is supply and demand.but all in all change is needed to make things move again which definatly is a thumbs up."
7/29/2010,"sounds a lot like what you want is the same way moons are setup now in eve. technetium which 90% of it is owned by nc because it's in their space. they've monopolized the price. they make 1/3 of the isk cost of any t2 ship if not more. hell they make so much isk right now that they can afford to have pandemic legion wage war for them. now honestly you do the same to ore in this game and alliances will make ore so expensive the economy would collapse. what economy we have now. what we need to do is shuffle the moons, give every region a mix. the result would be a more realistic balance of assets, resulting in the game being more balanced."
7/29/2010,"ok, your opinion is the opposite of correct. shuffling up everything would make the game even more stagnant. see, we want things to be less stagnant. lag notwithstanding, people should take space from the nc if they want to change the prince of technetium."
7/29/2010,"your implying trade is a major part of whether this game is stagnant or not. i'm saying it is little to no relevance on if the game is stagnant. what people are doing in the game, and i'm not talking the day to day events, but the major events that keep the game in motion. you know what keeps sov the way it is? alliances having such large fleets that they can't be crushed in a realistic time. nc and sc could literally be in a war for a year and never be at stress for lack of capital ships of any size. you think trade is going to somehow put 0.0 back in motion?"
7/29/2010,"what about dispersing trade by limiting the number of transactions that a single station can handle in one day? or limit the transaction rate of a single station (eg: purchases per minute).add a sovereignty structure which boosts the transaction rate of stations in the system affected by the structure, or add a station module to add more transactions per minute to that station?this would directly compete for a ""slot"" with other sov structures. npc stations would have transaction upgrades if they are logistics stations (so eg: assembly plants would not have transaction upgrades). pull the 'cap and trade' trick: cap transactions at some incredibly high value such as double all current jita trade, start ramping it down from there.the short term effect might simply be that trade moves to other stations in jita, or to perimeter.there need to be other restrictions to easy rapid trasport of goods 30 jumps from point of production to jita 4-4. perhaps transaction limits on gates, so border gates have higher throughput than region gates, which have higher throughput than system gates. the effect would be similar to the 1000-pilot-limit in jita some time back, but the impact would be on number of ships per minute, as opposed to absolute volume of pilots in space. i'd start off with border gates handling as many ships per hour as is seen for all gates in jita combined during that system's busiest times, with regional and system gates providing 1/3 and 1/9th that figure respectively.we can't solve transit problems by removing bookmarks around gates and removing wtz, so we have to find other creative ways of simulating the ""tyranny of distance""."
7/29/2010,"so, because powerblocs have such large fleets, there should never be a reason to fight gamewise? you sir are truly a visionary. pack your bags, i suspect ccp will need you in iceland full time as the head of their genius creative person division."
7/29/2010,so instead of trying out an idea that might changes things you prefer keeping the things they are? please if you detest an idea give a better on or change it slightly and give it a try. sure it can end either way. quiet good as invention or horrible aweful like the new sovereign grind.yet keep in mind that being non constructive in a suggestion thread is not the answer either :).
7/29/2010,bumping until someone provides a substantial argument against it
7/29/2010,"i think this topic segueways into another concern of mine: if devs (who didn't already have accounts) were expected to maintain an account in eve online (as mentioned in the op), i don't think they should have any access to special benefits such as fastracked character creation (boosting skillpoints etc) or extra isk because i think that one of the harshest and most broken parts of the game is the initial beginning of your career in eve.if devs cannot play the game on their own credit card from the beginning of their career, with a character that does not need to buy isk, which can play enjoyably without additional accounts, and can eventually take part in 0.0 battles, then they should look at the game in its entirety instead of relying on the csm to point out problems from which they can cherry pick the parts that ""sound"" like they should be fixed.ccp staff should be personally affected by problems in game. if they can't play the game and enjoy it, all the way from character creation to alliance warfare, they should take those issues personally.there is a clear design of pushing multiple accounts, character buying, and timecarding behaviour tied to a vast isk sink (broken sov warfare) in the game which would make a real life casino blush. at least when you go there, there are signs on the walls which warn you about gambling addiction.would you go to a casino where the tables are obviously rigged, the elevators don't work and you can't sell your chips back to the house?"
7/29/2010,"wow. i agree with mazzilliu on something. but yea, i agree. there was a post somewhere on these boards recently that polled the devs on how much they played, and what aspects they played. the ones that came forward primarily said they were carebears that lived and played in high sec. maybe one in the whole thread said they played in low sec as a pirate, and i cannot recall any admitting to living in 0.0. that saddened me, because that is the area i feel the devs need to experience first hand to understand how the lag and issues affect the players."
7/29/2010,"totally supported. you shouldn't have to accidentally kill your mate's carrier just to find out how much damage your fighter bombers do, right? :)"
7/29/2010,"sure, just make sure you can check a box to turn it off on ships that are not drone based and you don't really care about them. either put the setting in the log settings or in the drone settings."
7/29/2010,"you can steal pos's in highsec now. here's how: 1) find a sweet pos. do intel to see if you can handle the owners if things get lively. 2) dec the corp. 3) add all known members into address book. 4) when any of them are online, watch the pos closely and cloaked even before the war goes live. (some corps try to take their pos's down before a war rather than risk a forced removal.)5) if they start taking it down, have a cloaky transport get in position to scoop it. also have other allies on hand to bump away their scooping-ships. (if they do it this way, you can get the tower.) highsec pos owners are suprisingly likely to do this because most are unaware of how vunerable they are to theft while unanchoring a pos under the false belief they are ""safe"" till the war dec goes live.6) be prepared to remove the pos by force, if they are smart enough to keep it up and online. if they do you get the other stuff after blowing the tower up. (if they force you to do it this way, you get the stuff the tower leaves behind.) for dead pos's of dead corps, just dec the corp and drone/lazer them to death. (cheapest way) if you want the spot. it'd be nice to take the tower, of course, so i offer tenative support for this. but, don't overlook fun ways you can already relieve someone of their pos toys in empire."
7/29/2010,"i'll be honest, having dozens of offlined towers all over eve is annoying at times. however i don't think stealing them is the answer. i think towers that are not kept online should start to receive damaged at an exponential rate till they are destroyed. more exact, something that would emulate the degradation of a structure in space without the proper defense to keep it structurally intact. it would give people a chance to recover or repair and online a tower that was mistakenly left without fuel and the such. it would as far as i understand also help with decreasing trash left over the years by players/corps no longer active. maybe even adding a positive effect to the servers performance."
7/29/2010,"no need to allow stealing them, abandoned control towers should just be garbage collected (i.e. destroyed) just like abandonded secure containers after 30 days."
7/29/2010,"if its solely the tower (no labs, guns, hardners, ecm or anything) i would support this.personally i think it would be far better to have a 'cool down' timer (i mean we love timers in eve right?) that runs for say 7 days.a 7 day timer allows players with busy lives to plonk their tower down then return and fuel it etc.if after this time the tower has still not been activated it would become unanchorable by anyone with the required anchoring skills.this has the added bonus that it gives a time when the tower will become a free for all. this gives us all new places to fight. win - win.so, supported in some implementation."
7/29/2010,"hint - if you don't keep enough fuel in your pos, you deserve to lose it"
7/29/2010,indeed i support this
7/29/2010,i like this.
7/29/2010,about time that missions involved some thought instead of just 'fly to xxxx and shoot the **** out of everything there' !
7/29/2010,"t27bb-wmmtp-kyqwk-y8mbv-94drtdefinitely supported.. and as stated somewhere before, this could also be applied to faction warface.have 'npc commanders' set up raids into enemy territory, creating temporary missions like:ie:minmatar fw 'random event' agent:'fleet command has decided to hit system x, we're sending troops there now, we want you to go there and support them, kill any amari scum you find, and help make sure that that base we've established there becomes operational.'and on the amari scum side:'our spies have discovered that the minmatar are building a base in system x, it's currently not yet operational, but if it becomes operational, it could become a serious threat to us, we want you to gather as many pilots loyal to the empire, and go there, and destroy that base. oh, and see if you can capture some of their non-combat personel from the colonies while you're at it, we can use some extra slave labor.'to 'deploy' these missions, a new kind of agent could be added, the 'random event' agent, that will offer pilots a missionif an event that is in his scope is happening nearby. the scope could start out as just the random event agents in a system where the event is occurring, if it escalates, the agents in the constellation, then neighboring constellations, etc.something would have to be implemented too, that such an agent could offer more than one missin at the same time, listing all the things he 'knows' are happening around him.for instance, in system x, an event has just spawned, so only the agents in this system know about it.however, in the same constellation, another event has spawned a while ago, and has escalated, this agent would know about both these events, and should inform people about this.random event missions should probably also be listed under a different tab in the journal than the usual mission tab, dissapearing when the event is gone, and if the event is handled, automaticly award everyone in the fleet or at the location that is involved with the mission a 'mission completed'. or just the fleet responsible for finishing it, depending on the conditions of the mission.in the above example, if the minmatar base would be destroyed, all amari fw players who were there gain 'mission completed', while the event would just be removed from the minmatar players, since their mission failed.in case of a single sided event, where it's just npcs vs pcs, the fleet that made the kill etc. gets the reward."

7/29/2010,"this is a proposal to try and improve salvaging as a profession. with this change, wrecks would automatically become abandoned and easily scannable after they are two hours old (and they last another two hours or so). optional: in return, salvaging wrecks while they are still yellow would give aggression rights.this means:ninja salvagers can still have their fun in the first two hourssalvaging as a carebear profession is made more viableoptional: mrs who like salvaging wrecks have a chance to keep them"
7/29/2010,"yes, if the person doesn't come back after two hour they auto abandon, and abandoned wreaks are able to be probed out. one of the best ""compromises"" i've seen for salvage professionals. i'd even go so far as to say, they auto-abandon after an hour and only last one more hour. this is so there is no additional utilization on the server to keep the wreaks active for another two hours."
7/29/2010,"these threads keep happening, so i'm just going to link to my other responses."
7/29/2010,not supported.
7/29/2010,"i'm sorry, i don't understand your reasoning. why?"
7/29/2010,"don't read so good?i'm not supporting because of the clause i quoted. your ""compromise"" still insinuates that the salvage ""belongs"" to the mission runner or whomever killed the wreck.salvage does not belong to anyone until it is in your hold. ccp has been very clear on that.thus no compromise needs to be made.sure, make wrecks auto abandon after anytime period for all i care, but the right to salvage any wreck is first come first serve, and i do not see any legitimate reason to change that."
7/29/2010,"hmm, that's a fair point. my intention was, given the nature of a salvaging profession, to make it easier for salvagers to find wrecks that have actually been abandoned, rather than ones a mission runner is going to come back to later. but that's not really necessary; the idea should still work without that clause.thanks for the feedback :)"
7/29/2010,"not supported.automatically abandoning wrecks and making them easily scannable kills salvaging as a profession as anyone and their dog can go salvaging. it is bad enough the entry level to salvage is as easy as it is now, your change worsens the situation.aggression rights from salvaging is a bad idea, ccp has stated salvage isn't owned until you extract it from a wreck. i'd rather make it harder or less ideal to locate an active mission runner for salvagers to interlope, your whole idea goes against this. rather i'd have the following:1) wrecks can only be scanned down outside of deadspace areas, inside they are not. wrecks from a deadspace area/turned in mission get their countdown timer reset so upon completion of the mission they persist for another 1-2hours whatever is more prudent with resource management. you can still scan down a mission runner's ship and drones but the wrecks are protected from being probed out regardless of your probe/scanning skills.2) wrecks outside of deadspace areas can be scanned down with a deep space scanner probe (ie astrometrics v required to find wrecks in space-there could even be a special probe to locate wrecks that requires astrometrics v)this makes salvaging a 'real' profession by forcing salvagers to have real skills.3) ideally i'd like an additional skill rank 4-5 to validate a salvager's profession in narrowing down wrecks but i don't see it happening w/o a special probe for this as mentioned above which i'd support.again to make salvaging a 'real' profession. scanning down space salvage should be a more specialized profession and the rewards should have more hurdles to overcome not less when we make more wrecks available to the public via scanning them down. making it harder for everyone and anyone to scan out the wrecks as i suggest actually distinguishes the professional salvager from the opportunist who happens to stumble upon someone, which they can still do as so called 'ninja salvagers' do now.understand that once completed missions are turned in more salvage and loot will be readily available to anyone who trained to find it, so more modules/reprocessed minerals and salvage on the market. i think that should come with a cost of an extra skill or two to use a specialized probe in order to access this new bounty in space."
7/29/2010,"i think the barrier to entry for professional salvaging is more related to the probing mechanic than any particular ingame skill. as you say, it's easy for everyone to go salvaging already; if the situation is so bad, why don't people go for it now?that said, i think your idea is pretty neat; it would certainly add more depth to salvaging. i think the proposal achieves many of the same goals with much simpler changes to the game, though."

7/29/2010,"you're right to some extend, but you're also so very wrong.as you know you're already on my **** list and i am out to get you, but i'm replying just to prevent others who might read this to fall in the same perceptual trap you have.first and foremost it's a video game, which has certain game rules.the gamemechanics allow players (notice players, as in players of video games, not rl people) to destroy game assets of other players anywhere in the game world.the gamemechanics also allow to some extend roleplaying. but here is the crux. if you're going to get emotional about people's behaviour in eve it is in fact you who are crossing the line between rl and a stupid spaceshipgame, not the so called griefers.i could be very nasty and ask you why you want this game 'cosmos' to be so morally just, but that would be cruel indeed."
7/29/2010,"from the csm 5 summing meeting minutes: ""a presentation and discussion about the eve economy was postponed when this session dragged into the evening and it was decided to adjourn for the day.""from the following sections of the minutes the presentation and discussion on the eve economy was never done during the meeting.i think that ccp should send to the csm for review at least the presentation that was prepared for that meeting. there are several questions about the tools and the informations ccp use to evaluate the situation of eve economy with some serious doubt about an inadequate information gathering system.i, at least, would like to see some information on what ccp know and how they gather and elaborate the data."
7/29/2010,supported. correctly balancing the eve economy is of the utmost importance.
7/29/2010,"don't agree. at this point i think csm may need to turn into a one-issue broken record on the issue of game development priorities and all the ""we'll just push out the framework of the feature and then finish it later"" features in the game. if ccp continues to stonewall on this problem until after dust and incarna, there may not be an economy to balance."
7/29/2010,that's a depressingly good point.
7/29/2010,"mynxee, i agree wholeheartedly that mass resignation would be exactly the wrong thing to do; the csm is doing as much as can be hoped for a group of volunteers with limited time, limited access, and near-zero formal power. you guys rock in my opinion.that said, i'm impressed that you're still willing to say there's been ""some"" progress. you have been professional but frank about your disappointments after your visit to iceland; but any progress you saw there would seem to me to have been, if not negated, then at least seriously diminished by the ""baghdad bob"" performance by ccp in the recent threadnaught. (some of you reading this may be too young to remember the iraqi minister of defense standing in a press conference as american tanks closed in on bagdad: ""american tanks? what american tanks? there are no american tanks!"" that was baghdad bob.)anyway, myxnee, i respect your view that there was ""some"" progress in iceland, even though the csm minutes don't really show it in my view. but if that was two steps forward, zulu's blog detailing exactly how many devs are not available to work on any legacy game features was six or eight steps backwards. and the complete failure of ccp to respond in any meaningful way to the player outrage over that revelation in the subsequent week or so has left me feeling that, no, there has not been and will not be any progress on the development priority / player priority issues.but i continue to value your opinion. is there a puzzle piece i'm missing, or am i just looking at the same pieces with a more pessimistic and juandiced eye?"
7/29/2010,"that.ccp never said that they were abandoning working on legacy content for 18 months. that is what the players heard.too tired to go looking for the info but somewhere in the dev blog or summit minutes ccp stated that 20% of the development time is spent on correcting legacy issues. now, some of those issues are going to be in the background. cleaning up code and such. we as players may not see tangible changes there. that does not meant that they did not happen.pi (hahahahah... sorry) still has a development team. they intend to tweak and improve it. the larger issue is that the players want what they want and they want it now. that can not always happen. fix lag. well, hey are working on it. if you want it fixed then get on the test server and help with the mass testing. fix low sec. well, i have come to realize that i am in the end anti low sec. there is no fix for low sec, ever it is broken by design. lowsec is not for the solo/small corp to pvp in. npc 0.0 fits that bill. no changes to low sec will fix the main problem which is that there are 10 wolves for every sheep. the sheep don't last long, so your stuck with wolves. get rid of the wolves, nurf pirates to oblivian, and you get sheep. otherwise any changes will have no discernible effect.fix faction warfare. gotta say this is reasonable. people do forget they have made changes, not all popular, to fw since it was introduced. at a basic level they need get rid of the ""play after dt"" bonus that affects fw as well as every other mechanic that using ""random"" spawning.fix the font. huge issue. here is where ccp does things wrong. people have been begging for a new font for ages. they have had someone in house working on the font for over a year. they just announced this at the summit. what??? why not say, ""this is a problem, we are in the process of getting it fixed. current eta is unknown."" now the truth is there is a good reason for ccp to keep quiet. tell a kid your going to go get some ice cream and they ***** scream and yell ""when am i going to get icecream!!!"". drop the ice cream in their lap and they are surprised and happy. if ccp says something is coming then the players log in the next day and expect to see it there. and complain if it is not. that is a player problem that forces ccp to keep quiet instead of being more open.tbh there are a lot of other things to mention and one of these days i will spend the time writing up ""the big post"" on this topic but npc 0.0 is calling. got stuff to get done before i head to work."
7/29/2010,"well, unless the csm minutes are inaccurate, ccp did say they weren't working on low sec or fw within that time frame, which are the two biggest legacy-content elephants. and i don't consider the bug-fixing 20% to be pertinent to the discussion. we're talking specifically about all of the neglected features, stuff that needs game-design attention to fix, stuff that's been on the table for years. these are not bugs, these are features that need iterating.i also think it's disingenuous for anybody to point at the team working on pi as proof that ccp is working on legacy content. we were promised before pi ever came out that it would have a team dedicated to iterating it; that team was supposed to be ""built in"" to the feature. which leaves exactly nobody working on the long-neglected legacy content, and csm minutes reflecting that nobody will be working on it for at least 18 months, with no commitments after that date, either. i love this game. i want there to be progress. but i can't see any in the public stuff right now."
7/29/2010,i also think the csm is doing well.
7/29/2010,"no i'm not saying you should be banned for doing either one. what i'm saying is that the alliance that gets disbanded should be able to have some sort of period where they can counter the disbanding. i'm not sure how it would work but i don't think it makes sense that a single person can click a button and an entire alliance is gone forever.my latter comment refers to the players that do stuff in game for out of game reasons ie: ""i'm going to disband an alliance in eve because i really like ****ing people off."" we've seen it plenty of times where an alliance infiltrates another alliance, disbands with a single click and doesn't even occupy that space.note: i have never agreed with the fact that a single person can disband an alliance."
7/29/2010,"what you don't understand is that uk as an institution didn't lose sovereignty. only three systems (of about twenty four) dropped out because the corporations holding them and contributing were kicked from the organization. the actual institution of uk itself still had the majority of the sovereignty held systems intact, even if the members who'd contributed to things were gone from uk.the former members of uk have had ample opportunity to buy back their organization and regain their sovereignty, stations and stuff practically overnight, but can't seem to swallow their pride.sorry about your broserfs."
7/29/2010,"i think this hits the nail on the head in a roundabout sort of way. the frequency and content of ccp's devblogs and news posts have been seriously lacking. as said by most of the devs when going about posting blogs, they go through multiple revision cycles and even need approval before posting. while i am all for a polished and efficient official statement, you'd think that's not what a devblog is supposed to be for. its supposed to be for explaining what the neat things ccp is working on. its all smoke and mirrors unless there is constant dialogue.i guess that is what the csm was supposed to be: increased dialogue between ccp and the player base. unfortunately, this still does not resolve the communication issue. we often treat the csm representatives more like politicians than what it seems that they really are: individuals that we (the player base) have selected to dive into ccps inner sanctums to hopefully procure more information about what they are doing. often times we suggest things just to see what the devs are thinking and pray for a response and when none comes, we remain lost and clueless.what ever happened to the ""in development"" and ""on the drawing board"" sections? in the last devblog, zulu was kind enough to offer an insight into their team structures and the rather vague goals they are working towards. what about reviving the drawing board? why not offer a running tally on what they are doing? a (shivers) twitter feed? even if we might not like what they are doing, its better than nothing. even the occasional ccp mspaint scribbles are nice.then again, maybe we are just spoiled. rarely do other game companies offer the consistent updates ccp does. all you get from the others are occasional screen shots to bait interest or simple press releases. we only clamor for more because we get more. we are addicts of a drug named ""eve""."

7/30/2010,"i currently own and operate both the redeemer and widow. the redeemer is one hell of a ship to use for 0.0 jump bridge freighter ganking, and the jump-in-and-insta-perma-jam on the widow can be nice in lowsec. however, they (like all bobs) were nerfed pre-release, and are excruciatingly underpowered, even compared to an eos.sin needs to be a gun platformdrones are simply not a damage platform suitable for the black ops intended role. in fact, the kronos is much better suited to a drone boat than the sin, and vice versa. now i don't fly the sin and i don't plan to (because i'm not rtarded), but this is all common sense.black ops need, at the very least, old mothership jump range (4.0ly base)there are some gate-to-gate jumps you can't make. their entire purpose can be negated by such a ridiculous situation. however, bobs were meant to have a very high barrier of entry, so having a covert cynosural navigation skill (requiring bobs 4 and jdc 5) extend bobs range would also be sufficient. not only all of what i mentioned about this, but i had jdc 5 before even injecting (or at that time no inject option so training for 2 seconds) any skill for jump-capable ships so i know what max range is like and how insufficient it is.massive bridge fuel reduction, nowto bridge a bobs can take 60x the fuel it would have taken to jump it. do you know what one's fuel bay (at the time cargo bay) feels like after having to bridge all your fellow bobs because only you have jdc5? not only that, but the fuel use per ly is completely out of whack, being 27x the fuel used if a titan bridged the same ship the same distance.fuel bay inproportionate to fuel consumptionbecause of the bridging fuel use (see above), one may have to refuel two or three times just to bridge a bomber fleet through a single jump. however if bridge fuel use was lowered (set to 1/25 of current should suffice), this issue would no longer be problematicinadequate cloakyes yes we all know how cloaking is now, but this ship really needs the covert cloak. unlike the stealth bomber which only helped (somewhat), the blackops actually needs the covert cloak. it has little to no real combat capabilities comapared to any pvp ship in eve (and jump mechanics make them their only practical target save for unescorted haulers who have to be idiots to be doing that to begin with) and as such a covert cloak would be far from op.ship maintenance bayi'm not asking for some huge bay, just enough to store two frigates or a single cruiser. in addition, the maintenance bay would behave like the rorqual's, in that the bobs bay would only be able to store ships capable of using it's portal. some may consider this op, and i'll admit it may be a bit excessive in addition to the covert cloak, but this change (in addition to standard t2 bonuses) would give it a support role which would not necessitate the covert cloak, sort of like the 2008 mothership. obviously i am not pushing for a corporate hangar, that would be overly excessive even in a wet dream.tl;dr the black ops really needsincreased range, 4.0ly base (9.0ly @ jdc5) should sufficebridge fuel coefficient changed to at least a humane levelfuel bay proportional to bridge fuel use (fuel bay should hold enough isos to bridge bobs and 25 manticores 4.5ly @ bridge 4 jfc 5)very small jh2-only ship maintenance baymy 2<U+FFFD>edit: **** forgot to support lol"

7/30/2010,"i've taken a long and in depth look at the problem of blasters.1. tracking. the biggest problem blasters have is that they have the worst relative tracking out of all the guns out there. at the same time, guns by and large, and especially long range weapons, actually have way too much tracking. as a solution, nerf the tracking of all weapon systems other than blasters. this will seriously screw up mission runners however, whose missions usually involve long range weapons and many small targets. then again, the most successful mission boats never used hybrids as their primary armament.2. blaster platforms. a ""lightning bruiser"" platform that is depending on controlling distance more than any other ship requires speed and agility as well as substantial ehp to make up for the complete lack of range inherent to the combination of blasters and drones, which are the gallentean doctrine. it is too easy to defeat blaster platforms of the same class by simply staying outside their range. heavy armor plating is a must for a blaster platform, just to survive the time it takes to get into blaster range when attacking a ship of a bigger, slower class. heavy armor plating however massively reduces effective speed and agility. solution: increase both speed and agility of blaster platforms.the only alternative is to fundamentally change the gallente, without a huge agility and speed, blasters don't work, which means they'd be better off being shield tankers.rangespeedpowertoughnesspick three."

7/30/2010,"here's the point i'm trying to make that i think you are missing: i expect that even when the bounty hunter reaches the target, after taking the time to jump 10 or 15 jumps and reorienting to go another 5 or 10 jumps and finally catching up, it's still as good a bet as not that the bounty hunter will fail because he cannot kill the target -- and that likely means he will lose his ship.i think you're neglecting the fact that people who have bounties are generally capable of taking care of themselves, and quite often don't travel alone; that is, if they're traveling at all. finding the target is not guarantee of collecting the bounty.in short, i expect that even with the hand holding of picking a target that is on at the appropriate time and nearby (within the region) that the failure rate will still be very high. one further note is that i expect the number of bounties to be higher than it is now if the system is changed to something that works. it's not like every bounty hunter is going to get the same target.in my view, the point is not to make bounty hunters successful; it's to try as hard as possible to ensure there is the possibility of an engagement. it's what people who have bounties want. it's what people who are looking to collect bounties want. let's give it to them.i do not have a vendetta against people who are likely to end up with bounties; i think this would increase pvp with no bias toward either side of the conflict.commitment to fighting another player is commitment enough; don't make them jump half way across new eden and pull an alarm clock op to do it."
7/30/2010,"fyi, your ""reality"" is composed of a ""paradise"" where other players funnel into your blob to be farmed, while your alt operates in high sec with impunity when things aren't going your way. i suggest u wake up sometime, lest u start thinking reality should cater to your own fluffy fantasies... 1. yes it is because if u're over -5 sec and u get attacked, that's what happens?2. yet your proposal will only affect high sec piracy and does nothing against low sec pirates... 3. ...because with the blob u hide behind, no bounty hunter would be able to touch u. and even without your blob, u can just dock up and log in an alt, who u want to be 100% safe. all reward, no risk--how convenient for u...keep dreaming... 1. actually, u and your corp just posts all the kills...even if it's against other corpmates... it's no problem at all, just hilarious. 2. refer back to #1.3. i understand it perfectly. what u don't understand is that replacing the system with another broken one isn't the answer. no different than ""boosting"" low sec with better asteroids, better lp, when it doesn't change the risks at all, which is certain death. then again, u already had this in mind when u created this proposal i'll bet... 4. u're not supposed to lose anything in a blob unless u got outblobbednews flash--ain't gonna happen so keep on dreaming in your own little ""reality"". why? because like i said before, it just boils down to another attempted suicide gank nerf with a weak low sec ""boost"" that will only backfire when none of the bounty hunters can even touch one pirate because they'll always be afkdocked/blobbing/macrominingalt. if anyone can't cope with their own personal ""concerns"", it's u for not being able to understand the concept of risk vs reward. trolling removed. zymurgist"
7/30/2010,"third time lucky.i really do wish you would quit it with the ""your doing this because you fail/suits you"" etc. it's boring, and to anyone actually reading the idea properly, obviously untrue.i really do not see how this is a ""direct"" suicide ganking nerf. it does not stop it occurring does it? it does add a potential penalty, i can see that, but the existing system provides the same mechanism, albeit without real teeth in most cases.i say again, not every pirate in the game blobs, yeah some do, some do in large gangs, some do in small. the idea is not for this to be an easy mission to accomplish, but to address 2 major points.1) most kill rights go to waste.2) most bountys go back to the target of the bounty, that just is'nt right at all - can you at least agree with this, or will no longer being able to collect your own bounty hit your bottom line too much?risk vs reward...well, the rewards could be very high if someone really wants someone dead and yeah i would expect there to be high risk with it. your simply stating your desire to keep the status quo with suicide ganking, it's quite understandable if that is your primary means of having fun.rest assured this is not done out of a desire to nerf it (i enjoy it as much as the next man). the idea is to fix the busted bounty system, that is what the topic is, so kindly stick to it. nice to see you can finally write a civilized (all be it misguided) response. rest assured, if you go back to your previous antics i will keep reporting it and getting it removed."
7/30/2010,"confirming that u have nothing to back up your false claims so now u're doing everything u can to try and silence the opposition because u can't even refute most of my posts. removing insurance isn't a direct suicide ganking nerf either and it wouldn't stop it, yet ppl suggest that as well simply because they cannot push for a direct one without the opposition crushing them. what u fail to see is that the only difference your proposal has is nothing more than an ""incentive"", no different than trying to boost low sec and failing at it. the only impact this would remotely have is in high sec, where pirates can exploit alts to hide behind to help themselves out of being hunted. and u obviously want to make it safer for their alts. there's still the matter of afkdocking and hiding behind alts, which u still have yet to address.1. many things go to waste in eve, such as the 0.0 resources that the major alliances hold over their many systems, hell even the low sec resources that pirates could use but instead simply patrol to in search of prey. does that mean u should force ppl to use or lose them just because it's ""wasteful""? no.2. here's the thing--suppose that your proposal does go through somehow and u get an extremely high bounty on a notorious low sec pirate. turns out he's also friendly to some major 0.0 alliances. guess how many players in that alliance can take up these bounty missions and one of them will inevitably be able to collect on it and split it with the target? thx for your isk. refer back to #2. 1. and what u don't realize is that your proposal does nothing but offer an incentive, which can still be exploited with allies and end up backfiring on u.2. your intentions r irrelevant--what is relevant r the consequences and how ppl will react and adapt to it.was it ""misguided"" because the truth hurts? or was it ""misguided"" because u can't refute it? it's clearly both. and as such, i'll bet u'll try to report this one as well because now it's becoming clear what your true intentions r in continuing to try and push this through. more easy ganks and a safer high sec to hide behind--not gonna happen. so what's your next ""last"" reply gonna be?"
7/30/2010,"i suppose this may be where our ideas for bounty hunting diverge. i don't really see bounty hunting as a system for players to sign up for quick on the fly pvp. i feel that faction warfare should be more suited to that role (and i envision a low sec revamp expansion to include enhancements to both faction war and bounty hunting. i also think it should be called nemesis, but that's another matter heh).i feel that the bounty hunter profession should be tailored more towards the patient, hunter style player. the type of player that will cruise through low sec, stalking a potential victim, taking note of their play habits, and setting a trap before finally engaging his prey. to that type of player, that one successful trap that may have taken a week of planning and waiting and observations, is much more savory than 10 quick n dirty engagements."
7/30/2010,that's precisely how i want to see it
7/30/2010,"while i applaud the vision, i think that's a set up for disappointment. first, imagine that you've got a predictable target that spends 4 hours a day in game; but it happens to be the exact opposite of your schedule. so he starts playing at 1 a.m. your time and quits about 5 a.m. (for the sake of the argument, you work a normal 8 to 5 job). to figure out his play hours, you've got to first log on during the middle of the night. assuming you get lucky and he's on when you are, you've got to figure out rough bounds for the timeframe he plays. and then you have to move to where he is, log in when he's on, and hope that he undocks. and, you'd better hope that he undocks where he can't immediately redock. and in something that can't kill you or simply warp away -- people with a low security status who you are likely to find a bounty on fly in low-security space and are expecting to be attacked when they undock.imagine for a minute that i am the target. i have a job, a wife and a 3-year-old. i'll probably log in 5 out of 7 days in the week and one or two of those times i might not even leave the station. when i decide i'm bored with a particular region i clone jump to another or, worse for you, pack up my junk and move; this happens quite often.so you manage to track me down, but you have absolutely no idea when i'm going to log in next. and when you finally manage to find me in both space and temporal locales, i decide i'm going to clone jump and you have to start all over again.now i don't imagine that my play style is the majority, but i do imagine there are quite a few others out there like me.imagine again that you're even unluckier and manage to score a contract on kane rizzel. well, he just unusbscribed -- so you're going to be waiting a long time. you spend a week looking for him before you realize he just isn't logging in anymore. and before you say that you can just filter out people who aren't paying, often times people will go on vacation and may only log in once a week to check skills or other boring tasks.not to mention that if you're spending a week on a kill, it had better be worth it. i wouldn't spend that long on a task which required me to move halfway around new eden and alarm clock to take out a target for less than 500 million isk. that kind of a reward is ripe for the same kind of exploitation that's popular with the current bounty system (albeit much less likely). the only way to truly rule out exploitation like that is to make the bounty worth no more than the hull value.might i suggest that if this is the intent, it should be phrased as killrights trading via some sort of assassination contract rather than a replacement for the bounty system? why bother to get agents involved with it at all? just have some sort of support for people advertising that they are for hire, choose one that you trust based on his record, and create an assassination contract (requiring killrights, lots of isk, and a willing assassin). if the contract fails, the original victim gets the killrights back to try again.i think there's room for both ideas, i'll stop polluting your thread with my ideas which seem to be about a fundamentally different system."

7/30/2010,small pos's are cheap and getting cheaper. why do we need a minipos that doesn't need fuel so the same people who would put up the small pos would instead anchor several minipos's and make it harder for people to get a pos up in low sec as the people who have pos's out there now would be taking up more space by anchoring to more objects. currently if you share the password it lets anyone who uses it in. this idea is just riddled with redundancy to current features.

7/30/2010,"heavy support! this is excellent for pirates who are highly mobile. with faction war needing a fix. this is excellent for guys who are just getting into pvp. it needs to be capturable. you play all those other space games with mini pirate complexes for resupplying this is exactly what im thinking of.and we can ""anchor"" acceleration gates to limit the types of ships that can come in like the pirate who colonize the dead space complexes. quiet good for small plex war. actuall profit involved."

7/30/2010,"last night i was in a 4 man fleet of bs one running a eccm t2 and the other 3 running duel eccm t2's now the problem we had was one scorpion perma jammed 3 of the 4 ships and the 3 ships where the duel eccm's witch is 75 points each, i'm still a little fuzzy on ecm but that just dose not seem right a little over powered my thoughts.so its ether boost eccm more or nurf ecmps:: also they should get a stacking penaltyhugs and kisses fraggle"
7/30/2010,yes i totally agree. ecm is way to over powered. it always seems to roll in favour of the jammer and not the person being jammed. dont get rid of it just make it a little more even.
7/30/2010,"from what i understand, ecm is chance based.in order to have a good chance of getting a jam off an ecm ship must have their modules' sensor strength exceed the sensor strength of the receiving ship. if the receiving ship's sensor strength is higher, then the odds of resisting a jam are stacked in its favor, but it by no means eliminates the chance that might be jammed.sounds to me that you either got a few bad ""dice rolls"" or the scorpion was loaded with ecm buffing modules (to overcome eccm).not supported."
7/30/2010,"ecm is horse****. 1x rifter + 1 x ecm ship can beat anything that isnt a titan/mothership. its garbage. make eccm make you immune to it or something, with a drawback.so many times i've lost a ship whilst just being slowly killed off, without being able to target anything. i dont usualy care about losing a ship (trust me, i've lost loads) but whenever i'm perma jammed to death it makes me wonder why i bother."
7/30/2010,"you got 2 thumbs up from me ecm seams like another over powered thing to come out of a cal ship :p , all e-war gets stacking penalty why not ecm, i would love to see ecm nurfed or revamped."
7/30/2010,fix this s*** item its got to much juice i could see one or 2 ships around there own class but 'ive seen a balckbird jam up 2 bs and a bc so i think its way op give us more sen strength and better eccm. or just nurf ecm like you did sen damping
7/30/2010,"ecm isnt the problem, it's the specialized ships15% or 30% per level is just too much, no other ship gets those numbers on anythingthat's 150% bonus on a falcon with lv5s, and also ecm has modules and rigs wich improve performance.(other ewar dosent)the ships need to be toned down a bit, imho"
7/30/2010,i think you hit the nail on the head with that one drop there ridicules bonus on the ecm ships and give the ecm itmes a stacking penalty like all other e-war itmes. all so why are cal the othe race that get a e-war bs ?? kind regards
7/30/2010,what he said.

7/30/2010,/opposed.you're whining about a ship with no tank and possible limited weapons ability. put your drones on it and watch them melt. otherwise quit swinging the banhammer at stuff you don't necessarily like :)
7/30/2010,"it is almost a statistical impossibility you were perma jammed long with those ships, so i assume you are being creative with the truth. also nerfing ecm ships isnt the solution, they are in principle reasonably balanced now.however the entire ecm mechanics need an overhaul imo, they just arent fun. they pretty much completely incapacitate your ship during a fight when they work. it should obviously hurt the target ship, but not as strong as it does now. (to compensate they should then have higher chance to succeed)."
7/30/2010,"the only time drones are a viable defense is when the ewar pilot messes up his warp. all ecm boats can and almost always do operate well outside drone control range.ecm is so broken on the small scale (ships/gangs) that it isn't even funny, a brokenness that is further amplified by the relatively minor effect of eccm except in extremes where you fit on recons or 2-3 at a time.we need eccm rigs, ecm jam mechanic needs to change, eccm needs a general boost and ec-xxx drones need to be removed/changed."
7/30/2010,"i would post a reasoned critique, but instead i'm just gonna say ""f*** ecm"" and leave it at that."
7/30/2010,"this and:also, no stacking penalty on eccmand split the unscannability mechanic to use just the base sensor strength."
7/30/2010,"[not supported]sorry man, you got unlucky on the rolls. it's hard enough to jam a non eccm'ed ship without stacking multiple jammers. eccm'ed ships can get jammed, but the jam chance is so low that it basically means the jamming ship is doing almost nothing.since it's chance based you may get unlucky from time to time and since the jam is a ""on or off"" effect, there's really no way to mitigate this (one way would be only reducing the max number of targets lockable, but in pvp you need only one target active really, except perhaps logistics and ewar ships). the jam chance is already low enough. even on skilled ships it's not as high as it may seem from that ""huge"" 30% bonus per level.edit: also, they already have stacking penalties. if you have 25% chance to jam with one jammer, adding a second jammer won't raise your jamming chance to 50%. you will just have another shot at the 25% chance, which means your final chance after 2 jammers is about 43.75% (which is 25% of 100 plus 25% of 75)."
7/30/2010,"that is not a stacking penalty, obvoisly two 50% jammers will not give you a 100% jamm, as two 60% webbers will not make a ship go backwards with 20% of it's speed (i wouldm have loled). instead, every next works with the ""left over"" jamming chanse. so, two 50% webbers will reduce speed to 75% (a bit more because of penalty, but let's us ignore that for now).first reduces it to 50%, the second one reduces what's left- 50% by half- that's how you get 25%. same thing with jammers. this is not stacking penalty. stacking penalty would be, when 4th and onwards jammers would be next to useless, and have no effect. stacking more then four webbers does next to nothing. same should hapopen with jammers.if i sacrafice two slots to protect myself from one out of four types of e-war, it should be a significant amount of protection, but instead a falcon can still jamm 1-2 eccmed battleships quite well. that shall not be."
7/30/2010,"people who hate ecm and think eccm is underpowered can't do math worth squat.a scorpion takes months of training to properly use and requires a huge amount of pilot skill because its ehp is extremely low for a battleship. good at ecm, bad at virtually everything else. balanced."
7/30/2010,"your comparison falls pretty short ... because the only 1 of those ships has to dedicate almost all of its slots (and especially all of its primary tanking slots) to its *chance* based ewar.and guess what it is not the curse, arazu or rapier. and you also kindly ignore that all the other ships got 2 types of bonuses ewar. and for that it is 20% warp scrambler/disruptor range bonus for the arazu, 60% bonus to web range, and for the curse you have ""40% bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer range and 20% bonus to energy vampire and energy neutralizer transfer amount per level"".i am not sure the 30% bonus of the falcon are that much out of line, but i guess using a proper comparison would have made your argument a noop to begin with."
7/30/2010,"you think thats bad, i was in a 6 man rr bs gang, all of us had dual eccm's. one yes one guy in a scorp managed to perma jam all of us, and wiped out the enite fleet. i think there's a bug with ecm's that he's exploiting.the guy's name was c.n0rr1s"
7/30/2010,a solo scorpion managed to kill 6 bs on its own?and people say caldari ships suck for pvp.
7/30/2010,"thanks, i know math. and, it is a kind of stacking penalty as in: you get reduced returns from using multiple instances of the same effect. yes it's less severe than the usual stacking penalties formula used in eve (since well, it's not a formula at all, it's just the way independent probability works).it's also the only, and i want to stress this, the only module which works based on pure chance. yes you might get better chance (though you have to devote multiple slots for it), but even with 99% chance, there's nothing that says your enemy will not just be lucky and avoid being jammed for all the time it takes to kill you. otoh, the jammer may get lucky and jam you even with double eccms.most ewar ships have almost no tank, often poor range and even in those cases where the range is good, a dampener works wonders against ecm users. and, dampener is not chance based and can be used quite effectively even on unbonused ships.so i'd say that ecm is good as it is. perhaps the ecm platforms (scorpion mostly) should be buffed a little since they are paper thin (again, scorpion in particular... i get way more tank with a cookie cutter drake or hell, even less tanked bcs)"
7/30/2010,see your talking about the only e-war bs in the game ecm ships are not meant to be close range they are and ecm sips are indeed op i fit ecm to a meg and i would maybe jam one ship but thats it. change the flipping ships
7/30/2010,"1) because most of what you're saying is already implemented. if you actually took the time to look anything up, you'd know that resources in belts/systems is wholly dependant on what area of the universe you're in. that is 100% true also for 0.0: belts spawn different resources in different regions.2) 0.0 markets are far from stagnant. it may not be as wild and crazy as jita, but i 100% finance all my worthless pvp on playing the market in 0.0 and i do damn well for by it. you stick your neck out, you reap the rewards.3) your idea would have no impact on 0.0 warfare or holdings as they currently are. the 0.0 powerblocs are all well entrentched and more than happy to keep their systems and just simply throw smaller gangs at each other for funzies. changing how belts/moons work won't do a damn thing to mineral trade; everyone will just simply do what they've always done by going to jita, buying it, then hauling it.4) markets actually do fluctuate during current conflicts...if you took the time to actually look at any market data, you'd see that. example: war down in providence ealier this year, i made a lucrative killing off of modules common in pvp. i bought them in jita, hauled them, put them back up at a mark-up, bam made billions. economics 101arguement in short: you have thought none of this through...at all. your purposal has little to no value, does nothing to actually redistibuted resources or conquerable territory, and is beyond friggin' pointless.[/mad]"
7/30/2010,"lol... i don't mean ""when huge wars happen, combat mods increase in demand"" when i say the geopolitical situation should affect market prices. are you trying to be dense?why shouldn't players have an impetus to invade beyond ""we are bored lol""? the more you give, the better. and my point is, to build almost anything you want, you could just use the local resources in your region. alliances can't project their power to get monopolies and fuel a dynamic nullsec. it used to be possible (not to the extent i am suggesting thought) but not really any more."
7/30/2010,"if you acctualy took the time to get into the new 0.0 mechanics you would understand that you can now find hidden ore sites anywhere with every kind of ore, not to mention wormhole space anyone can access and you can even have at increased chance with system upgrades. -edit- with the exception of npc space... but wormhole argument is stil valid ;)that however also aquires a lot of effort on your side. exspecial in regions were you can only bring stuff into any station when you have docking rights you need to get a charackter in place beforehand + constant hauling. sure you can fluctuate a bit but certain alliances have regulations to your market. if they catch you, you are out and can try to bring the next charackter minus resale of course ;). i contradict that statement. exspecial the changing moons part. the change of moonminerals and their wealth was always an issue for combat and would ever be. as example would i bring the technethium spike followed by the atlas invasion of geminate. sure people will try to make their pretty coin in jita, but if it got really low supply it would be handled by corp first.which than means trying to get your shiney new thing before anyone else, however you were right to say that it dont matters after a certain time. because the inflation will just go up as with any other product.indeed, yet what was a suggested was an addition of valueable market goods to make it lucrative to invade. and if the invasion had a drop in supply, lets say you had to keep the moon 7 days before it would start harvesting again, than i could surely see means to keep the supply low and prices up. than again only theory crafting.while i admit the topic is up for advancement, anything that makes people want to conquer space as in this case new materials seems not at all pointless to me. if it would redistribute older ressources, as you seem to imply with your last statement, it would change far too much and had to be thought about for month to ballance it out. so i can understand not going into detail there as any number giving would just be jumped on by forumtrolls."
7/30/2010,bump to make nullsec strictly better and more interesting
7/30/2010,"because it ended up making strong afs stronger and did nothing for the bad afs.also, while i support the idea of pimping up a little destroyers, i don't agree with the changes proposed. the cormorant isn' a fair comparison tbh...[thrasher, artyparty]gyrostabilizer iimicro auxiliary power core icatalyzed cold-gas i arcjet thrusterssensor booster ii, scan resolutiontracking computer ii, tracking speed280mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor s[empty high slot]280mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor s280mm howitzer artillery ii, tremor ssmall ionic field projector ismall ionic field projector ismall auxiliary thrusters iwith just a little of efting, probably there are better fits out there. this thing pops most frigates in one volley at 40 km range. for assault frigs only a couple more are needed. if you use the shorter range ammo you get even higher alpha.the caldari/gallente destroyers suffer mostly from the fact that hybrids are meh. fix them and you probably fix the destroyers as well. the amarr destroyer has the advantage of fast ammo switching and iirc, higher tracking as well.yes they do this. they're also t1 ships. don't ask too much from them."
7/30/2010,"not supporting, as this was rased numerous times, and was passed to ccp a number of times already. but yes, desties are underpowered, and no, they do not excell at killing frigates. it took a while for my cormorant even to kill a stealth bomber. not good enough."
7/30/2010,"tbh you are also using the worst of the bunch to say that they all need buffing... that's like saying that since the diemost (deimos) is nerfed, every hac should be buffed, even the zealot... like i said, cormorant has issues of its own which are aside the issues of the destroyers as a group."
7/30/2010,i've tried to schedule several events in the new calendar and one problem many of the players have is converting that time to their local time. not only that but sometimes eve time will show a different date for most usa players in the evening. please show the player's local time for each event. just add a simple character setting for timezone and then convert it on the client side when viewing the event.
7/30/2010,step 1: look at the current eve time + datestep 2: look at your clock and local date.step 3: figure out what the difference is.step 4: ???step 5: profit!
7/30/2010,most ops for most corps are based on eve time anyway... :) so no need to change.. just need people who can do math...
7/30/2010,"while converting eve time to your local time should not be much of a problem, i cannot see why this simple change would do any harm, it would make life easier for everybody if anything.sure i can do the math, but why should i do it myself if i have a computer, a machine whose sole purpose is to compute, can do it for me?"
7/30/2010,"actually, it would result in people starting to also use their local tz outside the calendar. way easier if everyone just use eve time."
7/30/2010,"i also would like to have local time display inside eve.i don't mean to replace eve time, but additional clock on the side bar. so both local time and eve time are displayed, and clearly indicated which is which.or it can be done with the tool tips of the eve time clock, when you mouse over, local time will show in the tool tip bubble."
7/30/2010,"supported, devs need to know some of the issues players have first hand."
7/30/2010,"good idea because it's simplei dont agree with most of the posts hereyou people are trying to make collecting trash more complicated than taking a 0.0 systemoffline pos is trash, cloging up the server-(saving a good moon by anchoring stuff is an exploit)but!i like the idea of ""stealing"" poses because someone can make isk of someone elses lazynessso just plain and simple, after 30 days the pos can be unanchored by anyone with the normal anchor timer and anchoring skills-maybe after 20 days the owning corp recives mail about their tower permanently being lost within 10 days, because, maybe, just maybe it's possible that someone actualy forgets a tower"
7/30/2010,"totally agree we need some mechanism to get rid of offline pos towers. w-space is littered with those buggers.not maintaining your assets should cause them to deteriorate and eventually be destroyed/stolen.i'd favor the latter, at least that way somebody profits from it."
7/30/2010,"i am a pirate, fight for the gallente, and do combat plex's as my main source of income.with ccp clearly stating that they won't do much anytime soon, i offer a small proposal that i think is easy to implement and can help lowsec.move 6/10 combat plex's to lowsec only, and increase their spawn rate in lowsec to offset the lack of 0.0 spawns. (maybe not completely, don't want to flood it too much)this helps in 2 ways; 1. increase profitability of lowsec in general. and bring more pve centric players (hopefully) for us pirates to shoot at. and as far as i can tell, should be a really easy change.do it ccp!"
7/30/2010,"everyone knows lowsec missions are a joke. that means that the primary pve allure of lowsec is exploration combat sites and plexes. simple concept, but it is dramaically undermined by the fact that the most valuable plexes (being 6/10's) that can appear in lowsec appear more often (in my limited experience) in 0.0. the isk making opportunities of lowsec are already a butt of countless jokes, but i think this solution would do alot to shift a little bit of the resources away from 0.0 (where there are plenty) into anemic lowsec where they are desperately needed."
7/30/2010,[supported]but the orca pilot should be warned before he helps your little red dot!else more petitions and logs will be handle by ccp ... and they don't want that!
7/30/2010,"maybe, not allow agressed players to swap ships, i can't see why they should be able to do that."
7/30/2010,yes dynamic - details left to ccp
7/30/2010,"i propose that we delete and ban all accounts that are older than 2006, they don't enjoy the game anyway."
7/30/2010,ban all old people
7/30/2010,"1st - delete characters that were made 7 years ago and never touched again. all they did was tie up the cool names like james kirk or george washington.2nd - how about a slow sp loss, we'll call it t'alzheimer's."

7/30/2010,"you have a lot of angry posts, in the post by messenger, you even offered to 1 v 1 any supposed pvp expert.i'd like to think i'm pretty good, so i'll accept your offer anywhere you want, just hit me up in game.any chance to get your spewing rage like this can't possibly be passed up.oh, and crossposting threads like that is against the rules, it gets the thread locked, so not only do you not understand game mechanics, you also don't understand the forum mechanics.awaiting your mail."
7/30/2010,"tl;dr so other players don't have to read that hellacious thread, you would like the game to include an option for a corporation to post a 'help wanted' for other corporations to defend them. that's a good enough idea, but i think it falls fundamentally into the 'treaty' proposal made in the past and would be at best a component of that system.i'm behind treaties, so in a sense i support your idea. you really don't need an in game system for this at the moment, though. use the forums, your local chat and eve gate."
7/30/2010,"i also took it to mean that a corp could ask for help, and individual pilots could offer assistance, without implicating their corp or alliance for it.kinda like hiring mercs... only without having all the mercs employed by the same company."
7/30/2010,"this was never actually working in the first place, so i think 'build' would be the operative term.it will probably not be possible to do until ccp completely rewrites most of the existing pos code. i'm supporting this, but people shouldn't get their hopes up."
7/30/2010,"sensor strength is an intended game mechanic. it's used in the formula for calculating whether you can get a warp-able hit on a target as designed by ccp. the sensor strength boosting is not an exploit. at most, you're giving up 4-5 slots in order to add the eccm as opposed to 1 high slot for a cloak. quit whining and learn how to camp or to pvp. that is all."
7/30/2010,i see this **** all the time in fw. its almost impossible to get a good 2v2 anymore in frigates cause they being gang link boosted by a loki. its golf sierra
7/30/2010,"ccp's been very clear on that, have they?linkapparently ccp's own employees can't agree whether wrecks and salvage should belong to everyone, or to the person who did the killing."
7/30/2010,"quoting for truth. this is really all this boils down to in the end and watching the reaction of some members of the playerbase quite frankly makes me ****ing ashamed to be associated with you. we love to think of ourselves as more mature and intelligent than other mmo players but unless theres been a sudden outbreak of 'pants-on-head ******' syndrome i guess thats just as much of a fallacy as the idea that ccp would deliberately lie to people when they just ****ing handed them the information 2 days before.is there more than a hint of spin on ccps response...of course there is, its what companies ****ing do when they get critical press coverage and cant take time for a more detailed response because people are screaming for an answer.does it justify the level of vitriol which has lead amongst other things to this utterly idiotic proposal, ****ing hell no!! i guess we should be happy that we've proven once and for all that we're really no better than people who play wow after all, congratu-****ing-lations."
7/30/2010,"now...who's getting emotional here? the threats.... what fun! but...who's confusing real and virtual life in eve? lol. here is what you should do. post with your main, and make a warranted claim. include in that argument your own presuppositions about eve, discuss how these inform your view of eve's sandbox, and then discuss what that has to do with ethics. hint: you'll want to pay special attention to the consequential nature of eve, and then consider whether this makes eve somewhat different from other games, e.g. solitaire versus craps. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
7/30/2010,"don't sweat it, it's just sophomoric word-gaming. you'd see the same crap in almost any 2nd year college english class. ""cosmos blah blah emerging possibilities from the interaction of different post-structural narratives blah blah privileged class holding onto hegemonic dominance by self-serving claims of understanding blah blah..."" eve is, always has been and always will be a pvp game. it's possible to play team fortress ii with 15 other guys who are all playing medics. it's still a pvp game. it's possible to mine in eve. eve is still a pvp game. some people simply don't understand what eve is all about. they come to the game after trying wow, or whatever, and don't understand that while wow has pvp and pve servers, eve is one big pvp server and there are no options for a 100% pvp-free game. they also don't understand that ccp deliberately made eve so that it's cruel, harsh and dark and advertised piracy as part of the draw of the game. in their new player faq ccp states that darwinian competition is the very essence of the game. so rather than adapt they whine. like deliliah, they pile dishonesty onto their lack of basic comprehension while they suggest that, for instance, nerfing the already disadvantaged lowsec pvpers is really in ""everybody's best interest"". they're people who would be much happier on a pve server or in a single-player game. instead they join a pvp game and begin whining that people are allowed to pvp with them. a bit like joining a tf ii match and complaining that guys keep shooting your medic."
7/30/2010,"i see it as part of the game development priorities.if you don't know what is happening in the game developing and fixing it become a guesswork and every change you make make it even more of a guessing game. look the insurance/mission loot changes. the original dev blog stated something on the tune of ""the loss in revenue for the mission runners will be partially compensated by an increase in the value of the minerals in the remaining loot"".something should have convinced ccp that the mission loot plus the drone alloys where inputting a lot of minerals in the game, a quantity so large that removing part of the mission loot and reworking the drone alloys would cause a shortage and increase minerals prices even with the insurance changes.that didn't happened. so somewhere they failed in the data gathering. it could be that they underestimated the number of ships self-destructed for the insurance, overestimated the reprocessed minerals including in the count the modules used for mineral compression or overestimated the effect of the drone alloys changes.what is important is that ccp made a change to the game using unreliable data and conclusions. now we have pi and ccp will be tweaking it on some data gathered in some way. there is a large risk of false informations and conclusions as the effect of the stockpiles and reprocessing exploits is far from finished. i think now that you see why i feel that for the csm and the eve players it will be important to know the non-exploitable part of how the data are gathered and elaborated, to eventually suggest better tools and corrections for the development of the game."
7/30/2010,"ah, i guess i wasn't being clear...the progress has come more recently, after the minutes furor. whether coincidentally, due to continued csm pressure, or due to responses to the minutes, our dialog with devs has increased on a few different topics and ccp has also indicated that there are some csm issues that have gotten love. as i stated over at shc, no great leaps for eve-kind on the issues, but every step forward is progress and for that i am happy to give credit where it is due.having to constantly push for even incremental changes to process with ccp is frustrating and exhausting tbh, but as long as there is even minimal progress i'll happily keep leading the charge. i'm nothing if not determined when i have my sights set on a goal."
7/30/2010,"well said - i agree. the ""backlog"" can either be the product backlog or the more detailed sprint backlog. you'll not get anything into the sprint backlog if there is no master entry in the product backlog, so the first thing that needs to be done is getting ""ui changes"" into the product backlog. however, as suggested by krans, there are more important issues to push for imho."
7/30/2010,"2 bigger legacy content elephants are rockets and afs. they have been around longer then fw. they effect more ships and players then fw and low sec. hell, the damn font is more of a problem then fw or low sec to be frank. the font affects everyone, ships that can use rockets are nurfing themselves. i love the ishkur but feel like a moron flying one since i can do the same job but better and cheaper and be more likely to survive in a vexor. go af, go!no one said that pi is legacy content. it is new content. i don't consider it to be part of that 20% that ccp is talking about. if it was they would not be dealing with any other topic at all.there is progress. lets see the low sec luv. bs rats in belts. there will be more ratters. l5 missions no longer spawning in high sec. now everyone will move to do them in low sec.... oh... wait... no one cares abotu the rats in the belts and people who did l5 missions in high sec just stopped doing them. low sec is a trashy wasteland. as i stated in my above post. you can not buff enough to make pveers go there until you nurf the hell out of pirates to the point where they cry a new ocean over it. no one wants to be the sheep to be fleeced.going back to the beginning, font, af, rockets. all more important then low sec. they affect everyone. low sec helps a very small group of people, the smalls in eve sec status wise. fw is a subset of low sec. they would be wasting development cycles to work on low sec and fw. ccp has bigger fish to fry. stop being a small fish."
7/30/2010,"ah, excellent, thanks for the clarification, and (as always) for your efforts. of course i'm still baffled why ccp would leave the ""csm issues getting no love"" threads out there like turds steaming in a punchbowl if they had progress they could be reporting, but that's ccp for ya i guess."

7/31/2010,"if anything just tweak the build cost; they are much more palatable now that you can pick them up for under 400m - perhaps tweak it downwards further. the short range is an annoyance and could possibly be increased, but lots of the ideas here are barking.as far as the sin goes i quite like it as is (aligns and warps almost as fast as vagabonds when used correctly) and is all round very versatile - it doesn't need changing into a carbon copy of the other black ops. but, if the damage were to be beefed up: change the 5% bonus to a 7.5% bonus instead of crazy ideas involving changing models and adding extra turrets (never going to happen)."

7/31/2010,quote failyou might be onto something here. has this been suggested before?
7/31/2010,"that's what i'm saying; i think the way you've phrased your suggestion it's closer to what i'd think of as an assassination contract than a replacement for the bounty system.it requires killrights, which the current bounty system does not. you don't mention security status, which is a requirement in the current bounty system. it's not clear if multiple bounties can be placed into the same pool or if multiple bounty placements would be multiple bounties. this isn't how i would think of a bounty system, but it's probably just me being backward."
7/31/2010,"a way to auto populate the system could be for people who suicide gank to recieve an automatic bounty from concord as another ""punishment"" for pirate activity in hi sec space (their turf)"
7/31/2010,"this is not a ""bash the suicide gankers"" idea. suicide victims can use the system as anyone else can.population can be accomplished by ranking the existing bounty's to set a framework for the divisions. yes, a lot of people will deliberatly get podded to avoid this, but with the amount of kills that happen every day it will not take long for it to become re-established."
7/31/2010,"only the idea is far from perfect. and as such, u still have not answered how alliance-connected bounty targets would be viable, since allied players can roll a bounty mission with their alliance mates as targets and work with the target to collect more isk and wipe their slate clean, just like in this current bounty system.hell, it can even be exploited as a new method to farm killmails off of bounty hunters. alt a kills alt b in low sec. ""victim"" transfers kill rights to bounty agent. bounty hunter goes into low sec/0.0 and gets blown up by the blob the alts set for him.in both cases, your broken bounty system is exploited--first one for the bounty itself, similar to the current system, the second one is to lure the bounty hunter into being farmed, just like in the current system. in both cases, they're exploited in low sec/0.0, leaving the targets there invalid/untouchable, while only the high sec targets remain viable, which goes back to an attempted suicide gank nerf. u can scream ""troll"" some more if u want and spam that ""report"" button in an effort to remain blissfully ignorant, since it's obvious (and hilarious) u're unwilling to acknowledge, let alone, refute the arguments presented to u, but don't be surprised when your broken idea doesn't go through."
7/31/2010,"point 1 - you cannot pick up targets that are members of your alliance or corppoint 2 - your never told of the targets name, just a code number and region, some kind of scanning / locator does the rest.point 3 - the target is random within your current available division, you do not get to pick and choose. yes i am aware that someone could get a buddy that hands them half the bounty, or pull alongside them when they finally see who the target is - maybe tie this in with total isk lost minus insurance as part of the reward? the idea is to make it a lot harder to abuse the system, but with any pvp system, you can't account for all people.point 4 - your posts were reported because you were trolling, coming up with decent arguments is the way forward, not shouting ""your a suicide gank victim"" ""you hate all suicide gankers"" etc etc - its is simply, and i've said it enough times, untrue.point 5 - your persisting with this idea that the bounty hunter will be stupid and that the target will always be in a blob, give people more credit.point 6 - your now venturing into paranoia with this idea that you could farm bounty hunters, yes there will be ezmode targets, just like there is for empire ganks, however there will also be much tougher ones. bear in mind that this is a chance for people to prove just how good they are, yes it will likely take a lot of patience, scheming and planning to pull off a sucessfull attack against a well prepared foe... that's the idea, that's what makes it fun.point 7 - stop acting like a victim, this is not a damned witch hunt against suicide ganking, hell lets make point 8point 8 - anna lifera is immune to all of this, cos it might interfere with her game.i'm not claiming the idea is perfect, but it's certainly more credible than the current one and with some work to address some clear issues might even work. i think all apart from your comments have been broadly supportive, does that tell you something?"

7/31/2010,"i'm a little confused - what are we voting for? i asked you earlier if there had been any communication with ccp. the reason i asked was to get a better understanding of why there is currently room in the product backlog for ui improvements and not functional improvements. i personally don't give a hoot about all the ui stuff mentioned here. scan colors - give me a freakin break. the csm should push for the core issues: lag, low sec, fw etc. having said that, then it's a great initiative, i just think it's sisyphus work"
7/31/2010,"i had this idea when i was in the csm, and i could see it being an implementation that would breathe some new life into the game. the following is my idea:the idea for small player owned structures has been presented before, but i submit a thought-out design that minimizes both code and art, while giving a further purpose to the ships in the game. the details are included below:the ship-based habitat means it will start out as a ship. this ship can be flown as a normal ship, but will have special modules that highly limit it's effectiveness on the combat side without making the ship completely useless. either cruiser-size or battleship-size rigs can be bought, and fitted to the appropriate sized ship.using lps, a player can purchase a month-long 'lease' in an area of deadspace in the system. there can be two deadspace locations in a system, and the players go there to set it up. these deadspace areas have an acceleration gate to limit the transportation to all sub-capital ships.the transformation process leaves the ship entirely defenseless for 15 minutes, so other ships are often needed as protection while a ship transforms. at the end of that period, the player can either eject in a pod or in one of the ships left in the cargohold (usually a shuttle), and the ship becomes anchored to the location in space.a player can have as many sbhs as he has levels of the skill habitat management (rank 4). he can only have one in a system though, and there can be a maximum number of habitats in a system equal to some developer-decided system, such as moons. the sbh is considered a part of the person or corp, so other corp members can have access to them if given the permissions, and attacking them in high-security space will only not cause concord interference if the corporations are at war.in the sbh mode, up to 2 ships of an equal or smaller size can dock with the sbh. these ships use a gangway to link them to the sbh, so that they're outside the armor and inside the shield of the sbh. while docked at a sbh, the pilot can engage certain modules on the ship to allow it to function as a very limited pos, and these functions will run until complete (either the sbh runs out of fuel, the function runs out of the necessary components for the activity, or the pilot stops the process).certain modules can be used for a sbh, but it can also use any other passive module designed for a ship of it's type, such as hull modifications or anything else. guns are activated automatically when attacked (with a skill level of 1 unless the anti-theft system is on the sbh).when the sbh is deployed, regardless of size, the device doubles the hp of the ship and burns 10 isotopes of the appropriate type for the ship used as the basis every hour, and 1 oxygen per day. modules which double the fuel are marked with (2x) and stack with one another, so a factory and a refiner would quadruple fuel costs.mid slotssystem scanner: detects the people in system/cloaked status/security status. detects ship type within 5 au.anti-theft system: detects and immediately evemails if the sbh is attacked, augments guns with the user's skill levels.drone coordinator: automatically manages and launches drones if attacked, uses the skills of the deployer.low slotsrefiner (2x): refines ore at 1 m3/second and ice at 1 unit/5 minutes, otherwise works as a refining array.repair bay: enables repairs of t1 ships, the percent damaged is the cost to repair in total ship materials.munitions factory (2x): assembles ammunition from raw materials at 10% higher cost.rig slotstransformation augmentor: this is the cruiser-sized rig, adding 10,000 m3 to the cargohold of the ship when deployed.improved transformation augmentor: this is the battleship-sized rig, adding 40,000 m3 to the cargohold of the ship when deployed.any commentary or constructive criticism is welcome."
7/31/2010,"bunyip, i understand the reason behind your idea. i was thinking more along the lines of creating a purpose for low sec. your idea seem to just create a form of player housing.i feel that your ship would have to be capital size to do the things you want it to do, unless those modules snap on to the outside somehow.it sound like it would be hard to find unless someone bm the location of it. so would pirates be able to knock on your door?if it is found it can't be as strong as a pos. poses have been made to be a corporate scale space base with many purposes. therefore what ever is made for individuals can not be equal to that. i hope you can see the direction i was going since i feel that our two ideas change the game in different ways."
7/31/2010,yea i had a different idea for this as well. i dont think it should be a ship that does it. it should be a item in your cargo hold. as will the acceleration gate you anchor in deadspace to limit the ships. it should deffinatly be catpure able. that would actually get a use for marines. certain amount of time the marines spend in there they come closer to capturing the resupply base. and its not supposed to be ****ing god awefull good at defense. just a meteoker defense. 5 mil structure. easy to defend if you spend alot of time in that system.
7/31/2010,"sorry but i don't think i understand you? ecm ships, as it stands now, are quite close range, since without range bonus you get about 50 kms optimal on racials. two ships have range bonuses: the kitsune (which, while a good ship, being a frigate means it has almost no place in large scale warfare) and the scorpion. the scorpion is already gimped by the fact that it's a t1 ship, and thus lacks the double set of bonuses. plus it's paper thin compared to most bss and indeed many bcs as well. and finally it even gets half the ecm bonus the rook/falcon get and still 5% less than the kitsune gets.also, the range is still quite low (especially for bs fights) unless you spend many slots on sig distortion amplifiers and jam range rigs. which both impair heavily their already gimpy tank (ecm rigs even more so since not only they take the space you'd have filled with extenders/trimarks, they also have a shield malus (-5% at max skill per rig)).so basically you get... ""extreme"" range on a frigate (well, for frigate fights at least), medium, longish range for cruisers and short range for the bs... the range on cruisers is about all right... on the kitsune is kinda wasted since racials hit around 50 km without boosts... around 80km range on the scorpion is close range territory (pulsepoc + scorch = 100 km optimal. and that's a close range weapon.), with bad strenght, useless dps and failtank.i stand by my previous post... ecm is fine. if anything, ecm platforms need a little balancing."
7/31/2010,"our ecm pilots :: scorpion ecm is 96km opt falloff 53km 68ehp 8 points a mod, falcon ecm 68 km opt 53 falloff 15 poits a mod, blackbird ecm 110 km opt 80 falloff 10 poits a mod, griffin ecm 71 km opt 53 falloff 10 poits a mod, over powered nuff said nuff the ecm ships"
7/31/2010,"ahem... typical bs sensor strength... around 20ish. jam chance per single jammer: little over 30%.typical engagement range for bss: either 150, 180 km or close ranges of around 50 km.typical bs ehp: over 100k ehp. close range bs are univocally armor tanked due to rr fits sucking with shield transporters.scorpion ehp: 70k ehp (many of which are shield which won't be tanked in said close range bs fit case).so yeah, you're kinda proving my point?range on the cruisers is kinda ok, though it gets easily outdone by sniper hacs. the strength is higher, true, but that's about it, since you have low ehp and are a primary target. also, many cruisers have strong sensor strength, even higher than bss (especially the most likely targets for jamming: recon ships and logistics).the blackbird is nice, but like i said above, range is not that useful for cruisers and as a t1 ship it has even less of the already quite laughable ehps the t2 versions have.i won't comment on the griffin since the tier system makes it basically unusable. the kitsune instead would be quite a nice platform, though the limited number of midslots, lower strength and basically inexistent ehp (it's a frigate afterall) mean that it has very limited uses, perhaps in small gang.again, you said nothing which doesn't prove exactly what i've been saying: ecm is fine, the platform could use a little work, especially the scorpion."
7/31/2010,"a scorpion doesn't take any more training than most other battleships require to be effective, and it arguably needs less, since its probably the battleship you can fly effectively and be the most use to your fleet while having low sp. that said, i don't think ships should be balanced on how long they take to train for. i think ecm should be rebalanced, rather than nerfed, it needs a complete rework."
7/31/2010,"i am aware that i ignored the tier 2 ew capability on them. but i still think it's a fair comparison. the reason is because the ecm ships get several bonuses to ecm, while the other ew ships only get 1-2 bonuses per type. as an example, the pilgrim get's a 5% td bonus and 20% neut amount bonus per level. it does not get any additional ew bonuses. the falcon gets a 30% ecm strength bonus and a 10% ecm cap usage bonus per level. but notice the tech 1 hull only get's a 15% bonus, not 30%. that's 3x ecm bonuses on the falcon, 2x of them being strength. if my pilgrim had a 10% td bonus instead of 5%, you'd have a fair point. though i still think things would be unbalanced in favor of the falcon.edit: i should add that you don't *have to* dedicate all your mids to ecm on a falcon or any other ecm ship. i have a scorp that has 90k-100k ehp while shield tanked and can still jam 2x bs's 75% of the time. you choose to fit the falcon with nothing but ecm in the mids, but that's a choice you made, you don't have to do it that way. the falcon can have a very solid shield tank with enough jammers to take out 2-3 key targets still (logistics, ew, tacklers...). given that the other recons can only take 1 key target out of the fight, i'd say that's 200-300% overpowered. this is why most people don't tank ecm ships and go all out with jammers. however they suffer the penalty of being made of wet tissue, so i'd say that overall it's no better than my tanked setups in the long run."
7/31/2010,"please, for the love of god!"
7/31/2010,"from my point of view, there seems to be one thing particularly odd about the sovereignty mechanics in eve. in many circumstances, one alliance may wish to cede one or more stations/systems to a friendly partner, or to a renter. however, i've noticed that while eve has well-developed mechanics for hostile takeovers of systems and stations, there's no way to peacefully transfer sov between allies - the ""normal"" mechanics more or less have to be followed, as if it was a hostile takeover. this seems to go against any idea of realism to me. look at real-world politics, states, and conflicts. there are many examples where territory has been transferred from one administrator (country, though sometimes smaller divisions as well) to another as the result of an agreement (convention of 1818, for example), or a purchase (louisiana purchase, gasden purchase, etc), or some other circumstance. there are many historical examples of each case. in other cases, it could be following a conflict, territory gets ceded from a losing party that has surrendered to a larger party and simply hands over the territory while keeping a smaller portion of their territory (mexican-american war, regarding the present-day us southwest). throughout history, while in some cases, territory changes hands as the result of epic and bloody battles, there are numerous cases in which territory has changed hands through the stroke of a pen. therefore, in the spirit of making the political environment in 0.0 more realistic, i propose some kind of mechanic to facilitate the peaceful transfer of sovereignty and stations between alliances. currently, sovereignty and stations can be transferred to different corps within an alliance, but not between alliances. i believe making such a mechanic would add another dimension to 0.0 politics, and perhaps even influence objectives in major campaigns. for example, if alliance x is fighting alliance y, and alliance y is struggling and wishes to surrender, some sort of agreement can be reached, wherein alliance y gives up the fight and peacefully transfers the bulk of its territory to alliance x peacefully, rather than alliance x having to grind through the remainder of alliance y's holdings. similarly, as i said before, this mechanic could be used to transfer sov between friendly alliances, or between a larger alliance and its renters/pets. i realize one concern some players may have is that this could remove an opportunity for fights, in that right now, sov cannot be transferred directly from one alliance to another, only from a neutral state to a claimed state, meaning, currently even in friendly sov transfers, there's at least an 8 hour window where, while a new tcu is onlining, everything in that system is vulnerable, and another alliance can interfere and throw a wrench in the process. however, i feel removing this for the sake of realism is worth it, and there would still be plenty of opportunities for fighting over sov. sov-holding alliances can be viewed as political entities akin to states, and therefore should be able to act as such, and in my view, this means making sovereignty more a political and administrative matter and less of a military one, just as it often is in real life.thoughts on this?"
7/31/2010,"i also recognize some people may have concerns about this being abused - for example, if an alliance's sov is about to be taken over or become vulnerable, they simply get around it by transferring it to a friendly entity and resetting the process, so to speak.therefore, i propose that there be two limits on peacefully transferring sov in a system:- the alliance holding the system to be transferred (the originator) must have held that space for at least 28 days.- the originating alliance must not have had its sovereignty threatened (i.e., the system sbu'd) in the system they wish to transfer for at least 14 days."
7/31/2010,"does make sense, why not?"
7/31/2010,"you want realism in an internet spaceship game where: a typhoon does 100x less damage than the equivalent tonnage of rifters lashed together combat ships can only fit (at most) eight items per ""slot type"" ships in space accelerate to a maximum speed, and then some sort of ""space resistance"" slows them if they cut engines asteroid belts magically appear every morning between 1100 hours and 1200 hours all governance in the galaxy is based on ""corporations"" it is impossible to ""anchor"" structures in space away from celestials wtf is ""anchoring"" anyway?i could go on. at length. for pages.no more appeals to rl!================despite foolish attempt at justification, ops actual idea might be good.how about discussing if it would make the game better or not? is the ability to hand over space quickly good, or should it be a risky venture that requires dropping sov in a system?does current mechanic have impacts on the carebearing indexes of a system? is that good or bad?are renters good for the game or do the mess it up? how does this apply to that?apply some thought to game balance and reasonings, not to the gasden purchase!that is all, have a nice day"
7/31/2010,yeah myself i'm used to converting timezones due to my job. but with the younger folk or just about anyone else that simply don't want to do simple math everytime they want to check the clock...i think it's a good idea. i agree that eve time shouldn't be removed. it should just be used as the universal time just like we have in real life with the unix epoch. i mean i find myself checking the time like three times just to confirm it's what i thought it was. there really is no need for the complexity. eve time + local time should both be shown on the clock too! as i said though the biggest problem is when eve time is the next day for you. that really confuses the crap out of things.
7/31/2010,"instead of fighting, paying the war deccer to cancel the war, or hiring mercs, players can join npc corps or form new shadow corps to immediately not become valid wartargets.often, they immediately rejoin their old corp when the war ends. unfortunately, ccp has deemed this not an exploit.however, a simple fix is to make players who were at war at the time of the wardec remain at war for a week even if their new corporation isn't at war.something similar can be used on corps that leave their alliance to avoid a wardec: corps who leave their alliance while it is at war will remain valid war targets for a week without the need to re-declare war.as a game mechanic, wardecs are a good way to make highsec carebears actually risk something, and they (should) prevent people from opting out of pvp. it's one thing to stay docked up and fight smart fights, but eve is a pvp game and there should be no opting out of pvp itself."
7/31/2010,"i know theere is a hot debate about fixing over adding when it comes to eve and i can see the need for both. up front, ccp has succeeded in creating a succesful business and a layered space game where numerous other game companies have failed or were only partially succesful. ccp should be commended for this. freelancer was brilliant and its original designers (who also created privateer and wing commander) had a concept very similar to eve. microsoft pulled the plug on development because it kept growing the project and delaying release. the result was a stunning game that was incomplete and limited in capability. egosoft's x series showed the stunning potential of improving graphics and adding complexity but presented a game that was broken, often unstable and repeatedly in need of major fixes. both of these games pioneered concepts and achieved things that many scifi fans had wanted for years but technology limits and lack of corporate vision always worked against them.what most of us scfi fans want is not an excellent strategic game or arcade/first person shooter or trading game--we want immersion in a believable scifi world with the freedom to do as we please and watch it unfold. so i'm not addressing the need for feature patches or fixes but suggesting something in line with creating a richer universe.i would like the capability to have multiple players man the same ship--to serve as actual crews. like corporations, the ceo (captain) would have final say and control but would also have the ability to use the skills of crew members when operating his or her ship.it would give new players a way to jump straight into battle and advanced actiopn and to learn at the same time while also gaining rep and isk for shared missions and the like. others could specialize as gunners or engineers and ship owners could decide if taking a crew was worth the risk of the advantage that might be gained. i think ships should continue to operate as they currently do but also have the ability to take on a small number of crew commensurate to their size and capabilities. specific crew slots could be created allowing players filling them to control part of a ship's operations. incarna is a step towards this sort of thing already and i think this adds to the game without requiring complete new inventions. certainly many bthings in creating crew must be similar to ambulation in stations by multiplayers.thanks for the notice, look forward to comments. if this is a repeat thread, apologies--i didn't see one similar when searching."
7/31/2010,"problem is, this would require development of eve online the spaceship game.wouldn't you prefer it if multiple players could wander around the same clothes shop in stations?"
7/31/2010,"i think with all the lag issues (or even under normal circumstances) this is unworkable due to this being an online game. there's simply too much latency for this to be useful. the guy doing gunnery would become inadvertently desynchronized with the guy doing navigation, etc. i just can't, on a technical level, see this working well, it's simply too much information for the server to process and to coordinate who's doing what and where the ship's going and what it's doing and to reflect the correct status back to all players, not to mention the *player* skill involved even under perfect circumstances to all operate a ship in unison."
7/31/2010,"i think a 2 day total (that includes time to anchor and online the adu) time for it to unanchor a pos is good and 50-75 mil cost. if you do use an adu in low sec without a wardec then you still get the sec hit just like attacking/destroying a ship would give you in pvp. i'm not sure if you should require a wardec in highsec or not, i'm on the fence about that one."
7/31/2010,"[not supported]ah, pirate tears!.. he wants moar pvh (pirate vs hauler) because he didn't ********** enough at 14!but yeah pve in lowsec is crap! if you loose a pve battleship to a bunch of elite-pvp-ers you've been wasting your time for the past 4-5 days! especially in minmatar space where lp stores are used only for +5 implants (profit is, with luck and time ... 1 isk / 1 lp)!not supported, because this ""solution"" is only favoring pirates with high-sec mission alts ... like this champ right here!simply boost the industrial - belts and station facilities, advantages in lowsec (60% of the chars have good industrial skills? or more?!), boost the faction warfare and the missions given by the militia corps!"

7/31/2010,"as a new player, little over two weeks, i already experienced a wardec shortly joining a player corp.i chose to stay with the corp, only lost one badger, but also stayed docked for the last 3 days of the wardec.i know eve is a heavy pvp game, i know i can leave the corp, i also know that i can choose to fight.however, as all old player know the saying, ""only fly the ship you can afford to lose"". to new player, every ship lost is a big set back, due to low isk. skill books ccost isk, ammo cost isk, weapon cost isk. so every ship lost, maybe a cruiser, or even destroyer can be a big lost, to a new player.leaving corp is an option, but a bad one, as that is properly the place for us to make new friends, and hopefully for long term.on skill point front, we are in no shape or form to fight, or defend ourself effectively.staying docked means not doing mission, ruining the game play and income for new player.so maybe for new player, there should be an option to exempt from wardec, outline as follow:- qualification of exemption base on age of account, not character. for example, only account less than 6 weeks old can use that option. so alts of older account don't receive this option.- the exemption only apply inside highsec, has no effect in lowsec and nullsec.- it is only a wardec exemption, means they are not automatically red to the opposition corp. but all other rules still apply, so they still turn red if take part in the wardec fight (or even stay red for the rest of the period of current wardec). they still turn yellow if doing aggression action towards non-wardec players.- exemption only available to qualify members of a corp, not the whole corp.ps: play with evemon abit, change from 3 months to 6 weeks"
7/31/2010,"@janos saalreason? other than easy killmail?edit: i fight, if i can afford to replace."
7/31/2010,"if your corp isn't ready to defend itself, it's not ready to be a corp.you're assuming that forming a corp is something very new players should be entitled to do in safety. why? nothing else in eve is safe, why this?"
7/31/2010,"really nothing is safe? then why is there highsec? what about npc station docking? why most ships are remove from space when player logoff?highsec is a starting point of eve. this has nothing to with old corp, new corp, big or small.the advantage to old player are minimized with account age limitation, not character age.multiple accounts is an out of game mechanic so don't count in this argument.for old players, they can send isk from old account/character and this is not even an issue for them at all."
7/31/2010,"i have to agree with this. forming a new corporation is a decision. newer players have options:* stick with npc corps until they are ready to deal with the potential of war decs* join an established pc corp that already knows how to deal with war decsthe act of creating a new corp is a statement to the galaxy ""we are here; we are strong enough and smart enough to compete with you all"". perhaps your group made that statement a little too early? there's nothing wrong with that, it's just a learning experience. instead of adding safety bumpers to the game, just evaluate the result of your decisions and make a new plan."
7/31/2010,"maybe i didn't made it clear, the exemption is applied to individual player, not to the corp. so if a corp got wardec-ed, only members qualify have that option, not the whole corp."
7/31/2010,"you don't need to stay docked, even.here is a useful resource.a destroyer warps quickly, and takes a little time to scan down, so go ahead and run some missions.edit: but... i do think this is a good suggestion. 3 months is a bit way too long in my opinion, though. 2 weeks i could support.i just need to ask, why isn't your corp supplying you with ships and equipment to fight in the war? frigates are not expensive and can serve a few very useful roles."
7/31/2010,"hi-sec isn't the ""starter area"". nor is it intended to be safe.your stuff isn't even completely safe in station; you can get scammed (and it does happen) or your corp can be robbed by a rogue member.if a new player feels that his corp is not able to defend itself, he should leave it and join one that can protect him until such time as he is ready. artifical constraints on other players wont work, because if they rely on these constraints they'll never learn to defend themselves. thus they will be just as badly off when their ""new player"" status expires. what kind of timescale did you have in mind for that? 2 weeks? a month? 6 months?no what you're basically asking for is a pvp flag, and the answer to that is the same as it always has been: no."
7/31/2010,"the problem with your idea is that it is open to heavy abuse.older players will simply make a few newbie alts and go spy on various other corps or individuals with impunity. better yet, with a bit of training they could use their ""newbie"" characters as rr support while yelling ""can't touch this!!! dun du na nahh.... nuh naaa... nuh naaa...""the point of high-sec is to be safer than in low or null sec. you are still prone to war-decs, suicide ganking, ninja salvagers/flippers, etc. you are, in a nutshell, a ""fully developed"" player from day one.as for why there is high-sec... originally there was no high-sec and no concord. both were brought in some years ago when enough risk-adverse people yelled hard enough. the devs, who had originally intended for a ""risky"" game, went with a ""middle of the road"" solution, giving systems a security level and instituting penalties for certain hostile actions (said actions were still permissible though). over the years, concord has been buffed (the first concord could be tanked) and buffed again. the hi-sec you know is probably the safest it has been in years (some people might take issue with this though).so yeah, from my perspective this is a case of ""what you sow is what you reap."" if you can't actively defend you corp you either need to disband it or go to another corp that can defend itself. and don't knock established corps or be put off by those with sp requirements... if you have a good attitude and a willingness to learn then quite a few of them will take you in and show you the ""ropes."" the fact that you want to fight this war-dec despite being a newbie will make you a hot commodity among pvp corps and pirates. not supported."
7/31/2010,"i can understand where you are coming from battle mage, however what you experienced is what eve is about: everyone vs everyone. to have only lost a badger, you got a pretty easy ""welcome to eve"". i know that sounds harsh but this game can be far harsher. that's part of the appeal to the game. normally i'd be all for helping a new player out or nerfing wardecs in highsec but on this i must agree with everyone else. with joining a pc corp you can make friends and earn more isk by working together, but with greater profits normally comes greater risks and the risk of being wardec'd is one of those risks every pc corp takes on. i love playing this game even with all the conflict/scams i must look out for, but there is a reason this pic was made: eve learning curve"
7/31/2010,"spying can be done today without this posposal. each pay account can have 3 21-days trail account each month, or just sigh up another trail account. and i believe people in nullsec can easily get plex to keep them going. you don't need credit card to sigh up or paid for this game.not sure what is ""rr"" though.i agree eve is a very hostile environment. however, just as how highsec come into place, new measure should be consider as the game get older. the overall starting experience is very unfriendly, if not hostile, for new player. a new limited buffer should be consider. and this proposal has a time limit on account, it don't go indefinitely like highsec for everyone.people in nullsec and lowsec properly don't care, but there are pvp corps that will wardec whatever large or small corp/alliance, and only go after new players in highsec area like arnon. they have enough standing or enough friends with standing with locator agents and chase down people on their list. it is pain in the ass to see them in local even i move 17 jumps away."
7/31/2010,"this is how it should be. i can understand giving new players a small buffer to learn how the game works (which tbh is what npc corps are for, you can join one at any time by quitting from your corp), but eve is - by design - an extremely harsh game."
7/31/2010,"i'm not supporting the npc, but no one is going to stay in this game long if all they can do is be in a silent npc corp and earn money to be able to one day have decent enough sp and funds to get into a corp. there are better solo mmos to play, it's important that newbies are retained and encouraged to find and be in corps."

7/31/2010,"like it or not, pvp is the lynchpin of eve. without it, much of this game would shut down.the basic mistake that many in the ""it's a sandbox first"" is making when they make their arguement is that they assume that pvp is all about blowing up spaceships. i don't they they stop and consider that the player-driven mechanics that bring pvp to other areas of the game.-ever jump into a belt to mine only to find it's been stripped of every rock? you just got ""pvp'd"" by your competition.-ever find your buy orders massivly undercut? you just got pvp'd by your competition.-jump back into your mission to find your salvage gone? you just got pvp'd by a ninja-salvager.pvp simply means ""player versus player"". while blowing up each other's ships is a part of this, it's not the only pvp aspect of the game. every part of eve is affected by this. even on the basic level - who is going to buy your barges if they aren't blown up? to pretend that pvp is just an ""addon"" to the game is to be willfully ignorant of something that should be plain as day.to adjust this game away from it's current state to something more wowish would be to strip it's soul and create another nge situation in the mmo world."

7/31/2010,"have highsec divided by a strip of low-sec systems, and add reasons for players to go to one highsec to the other (missions etc)"
7/31/2010,"there are missed points when people talk about getting players into lowsec. the first is trying to force them to go there, through making them go for missions, making crossing lowsec unavoidable for a variety of reasons, placing an industry or resource there and only in lowsec etc. forcing people to do something is the wrong way to do it, sandbox remember?ideas about trying to get 'lawful' players in is a nice suggestion but the inherent flaw is they are fighting for nothing other than trying to kill 'bad guys' and why bother doing that when they can find other opportunities to kill bad guys and actually get something for it, 00, wh space etc. unless you make a fw type of mechanic for 'lawful' players to be able to hunt and kill 'unlawful' players in lowsec there isn't any incentive to do it for 'free' when other avenues allow them to do basically the same thing and reap some real rewards. the other problem with having players police space is they can't be on 23/7, and there is nothing compelling group of lawful a to go take on group of unlawful b. as well as why would player b take the risk that anyone is going to protect him? it is a nice idea but not one that has much chance of being viable without mechanics to support it. as a lawful player why would i want to roam several lowsec systems to attack bad guys when i can do that in 00, or wh and protect something valuable while being part of a 'team'.the problems with lowsec are many and the possible solutions should also be numerous but they shouldn't focus on forcing people to play someone else's idea of what the game should be. a big problem of lowsec is that most people just want to bash on someone else, and plenty of people aren't interested in getting bashed on. i don't see a solution that has industrialists really going into lowsec regularly unless they are well guarded/escorted and to bring that kind of firepower means the resources need to be valuable and limited to lowsec. overdoing lowsec resources though could easily just turn into another situation where alliances are the only ones wielding the kinds of forces to acquire those resources. putting some resource(s) in lowsec and only lowsec is fine but it shouldn't be something 'needed' now moved there but something else added so that those who don't want anything to go with it aren't forced to now go there. it would be nice if this resource/service actually made sense as to why it can't/won't work in highsec or 00/wh. the only things that come to mind are smuggling where the source/demand is only in lowsec stations as highsec doesn't allow it and 00 has no need for it."
7/31/2010,"i always thought it would be cool if players would either have to jump through lowsec to get to other empires' space quickly or make long hauls around in highsec. (so a path would exist to each empire in highsec, but it would take awhile to travel through)that way you don't have to go into lowsec, but it is faster. adds another sweet dynamic to the game--making players choose between slower but safer paths and quicker but more dangerous paths. i can definitely see a lowsec traffic boost with this."
7/31/2010,"1) the basic problem of low sec is that pirates don't need to get a positive cash flow from pirating as they will sustain the account missionrunning or trading with an alt and, if that fail, selling plexes.so what they do is not pirating, fleecing the golden lamb but leaving it alive, but wanton destruction, where you sunk the target ship and hope for some stuff to stay afloat in the sea. as thing stay today you have too many pirates for too few targets, pirates that will not try to ransom a target and that when they ransom will mostly not honor the ransom. until that change there is no reason for ""law abiding"" players to go in low sec. 2) seriously bad idea. first, for the above mentioned reasons it will take a very heavy toll on the people trying to pass through. second, it will divide high sec in 4 sectors and people will rarely move from one to another.third, what system will you turn in low sec to create the divides you want? you will take them from high sec, a area with very few systems (compared to the whole eve cluster)?move around some low sec system?change some 0.0 system to low sec?3) another ""wonderfully"" flawed idea, i hope born of ignorance and not malice. you know why the current bounty system don't work? very simple, as soon as the bounty is worth more than the clone of the pirate a friend or alt kill him.add your changes, let's say the added bounty is 25% of the ship value when a guy has -10 standing. enter insurance and the guy lose only 30% of the hull value of a empty ship after paying it. get gcc shooting a can. your pal/alt kill your ship.he get 50% of the hull value, you get a net 70% of the hull value.net result you share 20% of the hull value as net gain.not bad for some minute of shooting (it will increase mineral demand at least).that if your idea require only a ship kill. if it require a pod kill, good luck getting it. we return to square 1 and the pirate will be killed by an alt when the total bounty (with gcc bonus) is high enough to pay for clone, ship and a bonus. the chance to get the occasional bounty will not motivate players to do the ""law enforcer"" part. 4) ""subsidize the pirates"". you have already done that in point 3, but the poor guys need more incentives. wrong. if you want to improve low sec you need to cull the pirates until they are a very small percentage of the whole population, not increase the numbers giving incentives. what low sec ""need"" are gangs that extort protection money but grant a modicum of security to those that have paid, not more random bandits on a killing spree. the first kind of players will allow an increase in the ""lawful"" population, the second will push it away. what you need to invent is a system to push people toward becoming a mafia like organization, selling protection to the people living in the area they control and keeping away the other extortionist. the fights should be between the ""mafia"" gangs for turf control and against the people that don't want to pay protection, not against any guy you see."
7/31/2010,try going from gallente to amarr or caldari and you will see your long trip.
7/31/2010,"i agree with venkul, there are already multitudes of game mechanics that make griefing (piracy without regard to ransome or profit of any kind) as simple as selling a plex or two a month and flying cheapfit ships. if lowsec is ever to grow, evolve, or become changed in any way: you can rest assured it will be at the expense of the current griefer lifestyle and not for the benefit of it. there are very few things in lowsec that in any way ****** one's ability to kill whatever you please without consequence.and please spare us the ""but, we can't get into highsec and the gate guns shoot at us,"" nonsense. it takes less than two days to make a neutral hauler alt on the same account if you're cheap and don't want a second account and a gate gun can be nearly infi-tanked by a drake and just about any other bc+ you care to fly."
7/31/2010,"this, 110%. there are simply better uses for the money spent on csm ""upkeep"", with far better results. you'd think that would be a no-brainer in a country like iceland with it's current economic troubles."
