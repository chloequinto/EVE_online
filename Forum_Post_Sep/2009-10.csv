10/1/2009,"supported as long as it consumes ""nanite repair paste"" to fix the drones.amazing verys, who would have thought you had a good idea"
10/1/2009,"/supported i like your idea of using consuamable items for repairs, which is good and helps keep everything check, but perhaps another type of item, or perhaps a new ""repair paste"" item for carrier repairs.very true on your input, but i would also like to add that carriers can only repair a limited amount of fighters/drones once they're sent to maint bay. jz like a real life carrier, they cant repair all planes at once :) perhaps max 5 at any one time, and perhaps new skills to improve repair rate and max number of simultaneous repairs.~ my 2 cents"

10/1/2009,"the balance in the destroyer class is not very good. thrasher is head and shoulders above the rest. it has adequate power grid, and gets the all important damage bonus. the others just don't really compare. destroyers as a class will need some additional help if the af 75% ab thing goes through. interdictors also need a lot of balancing between ships of the same class - all of them are pretty much horrible except the sabre."
10/1/2009,not enough destroyers in pvp.
10/1/2009,i agree with a little rocket love even the ammars heritic would rock
10/1/2009,"if we can't have them fixed, can they at least be renamed to roflkets?"
10/1/2009,"rockets definitely need a lot of work. -absurdly low explosion velocity. several orders of magnitude too low. other frigate weapons do not rely on your target to be double webbed to do any effective damage, neither should rockets-low damage for a 'short range' weapon-absurdly high fitting costs. rocket launcher takes three times the cpu of a 150mm ac, and does less damage. it also takes twice the powergrid, though this would be an acceptable cost if rockets didn't suck horribly. -missile using frigates lack in fitting across the board. this is true of kestrels, hawks, hookbills, and worms. frigate launchers are just too hard to shoehorn in. the standard missile launcher is similarly too hard to fit. for some reason, missile frigates are handicapped in terms of fitting compared to gun frigates, which really shouldn't be the case."

10/1/2009,from testing subforumso can we drop this now and move on? there's no point wasting any more pixels (or the csm's time) trying to get ccp to change their mind when they have point blank said this isn't changing.

10/1/2009,"agreed, this needs csm to bring it to ccp again, the last time it was brought up was a joke, oh btw zastrow j what ever happened when you guys talked to ccp about pos's, care to share anything or do we have to wait for the meeting minutes, which i am having a hard time finding an up to date list of current events brought up by this csm, you guys need to organize things better, in an easy to read format, and time stamp everything in the wiki so we know what time frame everything was brought up in, and when updates have been made if anywhere. idk i might just be missing it, but i don't think so..edit: correction, seems the 3rd csm have used the wiki alot more then the first two, great job there, only nothing about pos's that reguards this thread or the current pos's layout and design. some things suggested are nice but we would like this topic brought back..edit2:oh btw csm, ~4500 hits so far from isksense ad's, and expect more to come, i don't think support for this topic is going to go down any, if anything its going to keep increasing, as a matter of fact if you haven't noticed i rarely have to bump this thread myself anymore :p, time to take it back to ccp yes?"
10/1/2009,supporting a rather epic idea.
10/1/2009,the author of the idea is named evelgrivion !the candicacy for csm will start soon.i propose evelgrivion for csm.vote evelgrivion !evelgrivion for csm!
10/1/2009,"i just said what it was for. it's for giving (temporary) cap stability (or letting your cap last longer - depends on what your bag is) when you wouldn't normally have it. for example a tackle vengeance may run its mwd or its repper permenantly, but a nos will let it do both, thus letting it perma tank the bs it's holding down long enough for the dps to arrive.you have to counter neuts with a cap injector - assuming you're not using missiles / projectiles that is.if you don't subscribe to cap injectors as a counter for neuts, how do you tackle a curse?"
10/1/2009,"so for the fitting cost of a neut or cap injector and the loss of a weapon hardpoint, a nos is suppose to give you ""temporary cap stability""?no thanks, i'm gunna plate/lse up and maybe fit a neut or two + cap injector because the counters to neuts suck.lets take your vengence for instance, what where to happen to it in that instance if it tried to tackle a curse? nos might keep your tank/mwd running but as soon as you get neuted, you die, so you fit a can injector (lolmids) which wouldn't really work because if you managed to keep the cycle time of your injectors in sync with the point you could no longer fit, as soon as it came to it's reload, your in trouble.nos was described by the dev's as a possible counter to neuts, right now a they provide little in the way of tactical value when provided with the alternative. increasing there effect would go someway into positioning them into a good method of countering neuts."
10/1/2009,"any single frigate that tackles a curse is frankly in trouble, but the problem of syncing the cap booster you have in just the same way with the nos - unless what you're looking for is a dedicated nos boat a-la the days of yore, and let's not forget that they were the reason that the nos was nerfed in the first place.also, there are non-lol vengeance fittings that work perfectly well with cap-boosters, but it's by no means compulsary one way or another (it's just a frig after all). on the other hand, any true vengeance fitting sports 3 t2 autocannons which gives you a slot free for either a small dps boost (and i mean small - this is the point about tackle ships - they're not for dps) or an extra fitting option - namely the chance to sacrifice some local cap regen for taking it from your target and having more tank.nos will and can never be a counter to neut any more, because they will never let your cap get higher than his, so once he's neuted you all a chap has to do is keep his cap empty and you'll never recover. that's the central crux of the nos nerf, and in light of that increasing the amount taken really makes no difference."
10/1/2009,"the main issue with active tanks, as i see it are-absurd fitting requirements compared to buffer setups. trying to fit an active tank on a caldari ship is just painful. ever tried to active tank a nighthawk? ha ha! it's not just pg intensive, it's cpu intensive. -cap boosters being an absolute necessity. this makes active tanks take more med slots than buffer tanks, and exacerbates the fittings problem above. then of course there's the way neuts cripple active tanks and the way active tanks rapidly lose effectiveness when multiple people are shooting at you. it's entirely possible active tanking would be preferable to buffer tanking if just one or two of the above disadvantages held, but with all four buffer tanking seems superior to active tanking in the vast majority of situations."
10/1/2009,"a few scenarios where that's not true:1. i have 100 gj, you have 1000 gj to start with. you take 20 from us both, i'm at 80% cap while you're at 98% cap.2. we both have 100 gj. you take 20 from us both while i'm activating my shield booster taking an another 20 of mine3. i nos your friend4. you take 20 from both of us, then you activate your cap boosterjust a few quick examples."
10/1/2009,"all true, but it doesn't change the central point, and it's because of one central flaw - a t2 neut takes more energy from your target than it costs to activate it. if the amount taken by a nos were to be comparable to the amount taken, then you'd get into a situation (ie almost any fleet fight) where cap warfare gains you energy, and there's no way that can be right.in every measurable way a cap booster is a better counter to neuts than a nos, with the sole exception of going against neut boats, but that's completely outside the situation you're trying to protect against.--edited because i can't tell the difference betwixt a neut and a nos"
10/1/2009,change the overheat bonuses to normal bonuses and sounds great edit: overhead overheating obviously fails :p
10/1/2009,"1) drone motion doesn't cause lag. 2) the bit about orbiting big rocks outside optimal, if you're right, sounds like a valid bug that should be fixed. however, that isn't usually how orbiting big objects works, so i'd be surprised if you actually are right about this."
10/1/2009,/signedi also made a simple suggestion to give a temp fix to hanger access.
10/1/2009,"/signed this is a role that carriers should have had since the beginning, thats what ""carrier"" means! one of the rebalancing could done that there is a limited amount of m^3 a carrier can carry (perhaps a skill ca be introduced to increase its amount), and this m^3 is shared among both pilots w/ their ships and the amount of drones/fighters the carrier carries.so, if a carrier pilot cant bring a full fleet of drones/fighters with a full fleet of pilot ships. this would give carrier pilots more meaning to life rather than rep towers ~ my 2 cents"
10/1/2009,"like other older players i started with less sp than a current new player gets. did i sit in station just training for 6 months? no, not even 6 minutes. the new player content is doable and a good player learning experience, get out there and experience it while you still have the right sp for it to be challenging."
10/1/2009,"i think this cuts to the heart of the problem. the people who are asking for sp boosts do not want a challenge, they want to be powerful. it is the same as the people who will not mission run till they can cake-walk through it.... training up all their skills and making sure they have an overpowered ship so they feel godly against all those piddling npc ships. there are not the people who take a frigate into l2 missions or a cruiser into l3 missions."
10/1/2009,"my new alt has all basic learning skills to v (minus charisma), and all advanced learning skills to 4 (again minus charisma). she is a little over 2 weeks old. i admit it might have taken longer if i were truly a new player, without access to +3s, but still using evemon to plan and your free respec getting great learning skills really fast is very easy. i assume you could do the same thing to get into a mission bc quickly.these ""new player's are at a disadvantage"" threads stem from a basic misunderstanding of eve. you are assuming that skillpoints = power, as in wow or war where level = power. i started eve back when all characters started with about 35k (give or take) sp and no training bonus or respec. i've had fun since day one. your problem is not the new player experience, it's your desire to equate eve with other mmos. it's is not, and never will be. the sooner you can deal with that the sooner you'll be enjoying yourself."

10/1/2009,"this makes perfect sense. as an alternate implementation, if this works any better, have a container of customizable size - just right-click, pick a number of m3, and your can takes up that much space and stores that much stuff. seems like it might be a bit easier to use."
10/1/2009,four more years president nixon? no thanks.the only part of your idea that i'd support would be the bit about half terms not counting.
10/1/2009,"i can see a limitation on incombents running but not a complete removal of term limits. having the same person on the csm indefinately to me, does not breed inovation or a balancing of views.i think this is more an internal ccp issue for all candidates. it's a fine line that ccp has to walk with all applicants and i wouldn't remove their right to refuse any application, though for openness ccp may wish to explain their reasoning. but that's an internal decision.i can support this change if it only relates to a csm stepping down to reasonable life reasons and not for instance, a vialation of nda or the likes. in fact i believe a violation of the nda should result in forfeiture of the csm position and banning from running again.see i see this as a reason why it would be abused.the term limits also provide ccp an easy way to ride out a useless csm member that has support without having to deal with denying an application that could cause unfavourable press about how the csm is run.i agree and support your item 3."

10/1/2009,"hey maybe the carebears hit upon something - charges for hisec living!let's have docking fees and gate fees that scale with the sum of the trusec status of the last 100 systems you were in (min scale = 0) and the class of ship. move most lvl 3 / 4 missions to lowsec (they're more dangerous missions - let them be in more dangerous space) and kick in the fees at the same time the training bonus expires. that way you can make the penalties for living in hisec punative without killing off the new player experience.surely only griefers could disagree, no?"
10/1/2009,"lets also charge major ""bribes"" for negative sec rated pirates to enter high sec.5 times for every .1 or something.oh i'm sorry... guess i took your name literally."

10/1/2009,"/not supported sorry, but i for one do not support this idea, and im generally an open minded person to many of the wacky and funky ideas in assembly hall forum.but first, i dont see why a pilot cant take a max 30 seconds to jz check if his clone is up to level, and you most likely only have to check it once a week, or a month!and whenever you're podded, how difficult is it to get a new clone? even if the station has no medical facilities, undock and get to one. if the station is camped, then you have a choice to either risk losing sp and jz stay in station!with no risks there's no fun.lastly,i dont see why ccp should suffer and devote a team of already brilliant programmers to fix this problem when its the pilots' responsibility, forgetfulness and laziness to not check/update his/her clone.sorry, jz my 2 cents~"

10/1/2009,i do.
10/1/2009,/signedsounds good to me...
10/1/2009,"i'll bet that the fleet size is fixed because they use an 8 bit unsigned integer in the code. the next easy jump to make in coding is to 16 bit, which means you'd have a fleet size of 256*256=65536 people which amuses me. what you're lacking though is a coherent changeover strategy. it's all very well saying ""double the number of people in each squad"" and suchlike, but these numbers arrive in game from a skill system that has to not only fulfil your criteria but also have extensibility for the inevitable ""512 is too small we need more blobzors!"" cries from the playerbase, given that the proposed cap is going to be much less than the comedy 65k option.better optionpropose code refactoring to increase fleet memory usage.rename ""fleet command"" -> ""cohort command"" (255 in 1 cohort) create skill ""fleet command"", allows command of up to 5 cohorts (1276 max fleet size) create skill ""armarda command"", allows 1 extra cohort per skill level (2551 max fleet size)then in the same way as corp management -> megacorp management you can add skills to add sets of 5 cohorts as and when it becomes necessary.as things stand though i think your proposal is too vague to support as it is."
10/1/2009,by the numbers it looks like the cap is based on a server side limitation. personally i don't see a reason not to increase the fleet limit as long as it doesn't degrade server performance. if it would have a adverse effect on that i'd say leave it the way it is.
10/1/2009,"perhaps someone has said this before but it might be a good idea to change the way and place capital ships are built and how they are stored. no more building and storing them in stations for example. by doing so you could increase the value of 0.0 space, decrease capital ship numbers which in turn makes them more valuable and increase conflict in eve.this is my idea in primitive form - change the capital ship build & storage system"
10/1/2009,"so is this a you can't afford a capital ship so less people should have them, it would take you too long to train for capitals so less people should have them or a you just got your first capital and no one thinks you're special so less people should heve them whine?"
10/1/2009,maybe he picked the wrong side of the big war and gets killed by caps too often. just a guess.
10/1/2009,"when you reprocess a rig you get materials back. when you repackage a module, you get materials back.how come when you reprocess a rigged ship you don't get the rig materials back? (owing for loss, of course) or the materials from any modules fitted on the ship, if you want to reprocess the entire lot?"
10/1/2009,because rigs are never able to recovered. this has been explained before.edit: and because it's a pain for the server to think that hard.
10/1/2009,"you're not recovering the rig, you're recovering 80% (-reprocessing waste) of its components."
10/1/2009,same deal. once attached rigs and their components are inside the ship they cannot be removed without their loss. ever.
10/1/2009,"agreed. imho, leave the rorqual and its skill requirements alone. its powerful enough already.......next thing you know, ppl r propose ccp lets rorquals into high sec :p"
10/1/2009,"the rorqual is not a pvp ship, nor is it a pve ship. it is a mining support ship. as such, using industrial and mining skills is perfectly reasonable, and given that it is the biggest, most expensive such ship, requiring those skills at high levels is not just reasonable but also necessary. i see no reason why a capital industrial ship requiring industrial skills at high levels is at all a bad thing."
10/1/2009,all these sound reasonable.

10/1/2009,"for that matter, did the minutes of the last csm2 meeting ever get posted?"
10/1/2009,"it is the csm's job to weed through the forums and find the ideas they feel are necessary to be escalated. popularity is usually a horrible indicator of game balance.i've seen multiple say the issue was raised, and ccp's response was that they aren't going to go back to the old system. i'm not exactly sure what else you think they can do. they could make it their sole issue in every meeting, but that just prevents them from raising other worthy topics. csm brings concerns of the players to ccp, but the popularity of an issue does not always mean that it fits into what is best for the game, as ccp can see repercussions of a feature that other players can't (such as server lag)the csm represents the majority of voters. if you wanted it to represent the majority of characters, ccp would have to mandate the election results, which seems to invalidate the whole process. plus, who wants 1 representative in charge of trade alts, another in charge of 0 sp scout alts, another representing datacore farming, etc.... if you want someone to represent your issues, get other like-minded people and vote. if you can't swing the # of people to get someone elected, representative goverments just aren't meant for you.at times, the csm will be asked their opinion about upcoming changes ccp is considering, or long term plans for eve. this is exactly what they should be doing, and ccp requires a nda so that every little future idea isn't released, when a lot of them are only conceptual and might never make it in game. it prevents thousands of people complaining about xyz idea based upon incomplete information, when it is only in the initial stages of possible planning, and might never be released.csm provides input into all aspects of eve, but they don't run eve. they consult, and provide advice. do you expect ccp to run a multi-billion dollar company based on the votes of their players? that is a guaranteed way to fail. they make business decisions that are best for them, and seek player input on game design issues."

10/2/2009,"i think this would totally depend on how fast you can repair the drones. however i think triage should always consume nanite paste when repairing drones.i do from time to time have some bright moments it would be unbalanced to be able to repair all your drones at once yes, maybe even have it so that less drones = faster repair so that you can choose to repair one unit quickly or choose to repair a batch at a slower rate.however there should of course be a limit to the amount you can repair at one time."
10/2/2009,good idea.
10/2/2009,i remember a dev saying the same thing many months back. right now the damage notifications are a joke and don't notify you of anything. supported
10/2/2009,great idea. having the damage information in a window like a chat box to make it easy to follow and allow you to get the thing out of the way.it would also be nice if you could see the damage your drones were doing.
10/2/2009,scan heat is the best solution imo. allow a reasonable amount of delay free scanning for up to 15 seconds; if there are more than 15 or 20 scans in that timeframe then put in the delay for a minute or so.edit: typo

10/2/2009,"it would be so heavily skewed towards large alliances/corporations looking for some relaxation from null-sec boredom and fw as a rp vehicle and proxy war of empires would die within weeks.it would be replaced with 0.0 entities being able to fight amongst themselves without risking their assets/sovereignty, which is not desirable for anyone.militia wars have historically always been low-intensity affairs, sporadic and messy. militia's have historically very rarely received overt assistance from ""interested"" 3rd parties, usually been limited to hush-hush training, funding and materials.this is the way things are now if you think about it.if 3rd parties were to be allowed, the following must/should be in place for it to have any chance of not obsoleting the militia's as a whole:declaring war on a militia invariably includes war on its ally (minmatar/gallente, amarr/caldari), if not then the alliance idea is pretty pointless. includes persona non grata status in both empires.without direct affiliation with a militia (ie. actually joining), capturing complexes should be impossible.standings hit towards the empires upon destroying ships allied with them, be it npcs or players.declaring war on an empire, even if indirectly, should have huge repercussions. no player alliance would condone aggression against its assets or those of their allies either.and what would such a declaration cost when the empire's populations number in the trillions?if you can capture space in the name of a militia/empire without being in militia then what is the point of having the militia's in the first place?standings hit is to minimize/discourage the null-sec vacation war declaration which will come to pass were they allowed to. will have to be rather large to have any effect.bottom line is that fw does not lend itself well to 3rd party involvement without destroying the whole concept. it would rapidly degenerate into non-fw related feuding an eve themed battleground basically.i would love for especially rp alliances like sf, u'k, em, cva et al. to be able to participate more directly, but i just don't see how it can be done without completely undermining the concept in itself."
10/2/2009,"interesting, but there are a few critical flaws for me atm. being able to capture plex - an alliance that wishes to support the milita should support them - not do their job for them no wardec from opposite third parties or allied empires - this makes no sense from an rp pov. after all, the first world war started because of a wardec cascade, after some serbian guy called some austro-hungarian guy a noob in front of his haxxor buddies or something. putting this condition in, whether intentionally or not, basically asks for participation in fw-lite.on the other hand do i think there should be a mechanism whereby an alliance can declare to be part of an empire, with all the rights and responsibilities therein, but what you have atm is the rights without the responsibilities. no support yet."
10/2/2009,"can you imagine what the cva people could do for your side of the war bsc??i support this idea, or any other allowing alliances to join, with certain downsides or restrictions of course. it'd be interesting to see who joins on which sides. drop in lp for capturing plexes while you're at it."
10/2/2009,"the fundamental differences with 0.0 and large scales empire wars, be it fw or privateer stile massive wardecs, have nothing to do with numbers and everything to do with the things you can use/do in 0.0 that you can't in empire:-interdiction bubbles.-doomsday devices.-bomb deployment.-cyno jamming/generating.-jump bridges.-sov4's invulnerable poses.-effective sniper fleets(bubbles are a must to keep enemy pinned)."
10/2/2009,"i like this idea, will give teh players more knowlegde of how the big alliances role..amarr victory !"
10/2/2009,i can support this
10/2/2009,"while flying around i noticed that alot of the rats fly standard shipmodels that are simply recolored versions of the normal ones. i propose to add a small painting option in the fitting pane that allows you to do simple alterations such as changing the texture hues on various areas of the ship's base texture, or the color of windows, and perhaps adding a corp logo as nose art. if possible i would also like to see an option for the color of some of the particle effects such as thruster exhaust, and signal lights. seeing as simple visual alterations serve no ballancing purpose but have the potential to make the game visually look much better in the future. i would make this a freely available service accessable from any npc station or pos array. for people who are worried that someone may try to make a ti look like it's tii counterpart to scare people away, remember that most people will right click info and or scan you down long before they are in visual range of the ship. in all i would like to give players more of an ability to express themselves in their ships."
10/2/2009,yeah for more lag!
10/2/2009,"actually you could do it without inducing lag.1. have a preset unchangeable selection of patterns.2. make them part of the client.3. add one data element telling the client which pattern to use when texturing the ship.viola, no (additional) lag, since the hard part (drawing the ship on the screen) is done client side anyway. additionally, you could tie it into the show effects option in the menu, so people who don't want to see them don't have to.the real problem would be developing [number of ships in eve] x [number of patterns per ship] new patterns."
10/2/2009,"very, very little data sent once for each ship, a single value representing a color scheme choice. hell we could go crazy break ships down to give them several separate coloured areas and use two or three values.what this would add in lag is far outweighed by it's worth in eye-candy and subscriber retention (not to mention saving ccp from having to hear people whine about certain awful colour schemes)."
10/2/2009,actually there wouldn't need to be that many new patterns available since there is a wide veriety of color schemes already in the game for npc ships so start by enabling those presets and than gradually add more as time goes on
10/2/2009,it still needs more resources as you have to load more textures. atm 10 apocs. you have 1 texture in memory. afterwards. you have 10 textures in memory for the same ship model.
10/2/2009,"that's a client-side issue with a simple client-side fix.[x] enable custom paintjobsto a lot of users loading up a few extra textures would be a non-issue, with the huge texture memory on modern gfx cards that may well be an overwhelming majority of users."
10/2/2009,"consider the lag in a fleet battle. 500 ships, each one having send a scheme code.. i'd love the option of more costumization but i can see it being problematic to scale."
10/2/2009,"not necessarily, because you only have to send that value once - when the ship enters the grid. after that you're just sending position updates. your client already knows what color the ship is after that, so there's no need to send it in any subsequent updates."
10/2/2009,the lag for visible turrets would remain considerably higher. i don't hear any concern on that being a resource hog.
10/2/2009,"i think this is a fine proposal that will add a lot to the gameexperience of the players. ill leave it to the devs to figure out if this would be too heavy in development or system ressources, but i doubt that it is a real issue."
10/2/2009,/signedthe corporation/alliance management system needs changes and much of this would be a great start.
10/2/2009,1
10/2/2009,"this was a big problem when i was in null-sec. it is a problem in wh space as well. unless you have absolute trust within your corp, this is a big problem. in a null-sec alliance this system is miserable."
10/2/2009,corp and pos manageent are some of my pet peves in eve.the whole corp management interface needs redesigning and streamlining. right now it's so convoluted and finicky that it realy doesn't work. so completely supported
10/2/2009,fo shoan for ****s an giggles lets have the ships actually come out of the big hangers on our carriers rather then just being ejected into space.... that would be cool
10/2/2009,"i agree that this is a good idea and could be based largely on existing game features (docking screen similar to station screens, require a gang member status to utilize, etc.) like a lot of other players have already said, this is something that i thought carriers could do for a long time.in response to the issue of clone vats, i don't see that this necessarily reduces their importance. it provides another logistics mechanism that makes the game a lot more intricate and harder to predict. after all, the *clones* themselves are the important feature of this part of the game. an extra wrinkle in how they move just enriches that part of it."
10/2/2009,-you already have the bonus to training to 1.6 mil sp-you now have the skill queue which i never had!stop complaining and be patient!eve is a harsh game to new players..its a godforsaken place where you have to build your own character from scratch. in sc

10/2/2009,"i'm currious if anyone at ccp knows exactly how many new players have quit because they felt they couldn't be effective for the first 6 months.even if it's perfectly possible for players to be effective quickly, if people are leaving because they don't believe it, something is wrong."
10/2/2009,"it took me less than two weeks to be out fighting, back the day i started and what did we get 200k sp or something? back then i didn't know anyone else who played the game, but there are who have 50-100mil sp and all they do is train their skills. yeah, i made some 100 dps on my t1 lolfit rifters and stabbers, but guess what? sometimes i did even better than on full t2 gear ****. blindly attacking **** can be surprisingly productive.you either play the game or you sit in the station and your sp got very little to do with it."
10/2/2009,not supported!
10/2/2009,"yes.although one possible point... ccp might not like this because it allows you to easily put containers in a freighter. although couriers can do that, this would allow you to do it solo."
10/2/2009,i like this
10/2/2009,"another idea:a new in game item: plastic wrapper.one time use only. infinite volume. it's size is equal to it's volume + 0.1m^3.you re-name it into name of the pilot, and throw all the stuff in there. that will alow using them anywhere, including null-sec and deep wormhole space."
10/2/2009,"i just would like to point out, that anyone who thinks our dear leader mazzilliu shouldn't be appointed a life term in office is an idiot"
10/2/2009,"there is absolutely no reason to remove term limits. if you want continuity, move that 2 members of the current csm always remain for the next term as advisors. those two members should be elected by a vote of the csm as only the council can determine who was effective and who was not."
10/2/2009,i like this suggestion. i'd even go so far as to suggest that we players vote for 7 delegates and the csm elect the other 2 delegates from within their ranks to serve on the subsequent council.

10/2/2009,"it's been suggested before i'm sure but it's worth harping on about once more i think.i propose that the wallet divisions mechanic be extended from corporation to personal wallets. the default behaviour would be that the master wallet be used for everything and display of the other wallets be supressed to preserve functionality for those that don't care / don't need it, but in other ways it would mirror the corp wallet functionality.discuss"
10/2/2009,there's nothing to discuss. i've wanted this since before time was time.
10/2/2009,what would be the need for it? tracking trade funds? if so let's be honest that the information you'd want out of that is far more detailed then you'd want to deal with in the wallet. i'd love to see ccp put complete analytical software into the client but realistically that kind of this is done better with a third party software pulling the data off the api
10/2/2009,"granted, but that doesn't meant that it wouldn't streamline things to have seperate divisions eg trade, mineral aquisitions1, mineral aquisitions2. as an accountant's son i like having these all in physically seperate accounts - not least because it lets you see how much you have to spend on exotic dancers this month. at it's root, i'd say the reason is that different money in your wallet is used for different things, so having a trade wallet and a couple of manufacturing wallets and a profits holding wallet would be useful to me.for reference i also think that analytics should stay out of game. it depends on what you're doing as to what precisely you want to report on, and i'd prefer the devs concentrate on helping me pew than helping me make isk. give us an api, c# and the excellent zedgraph library and we can do for ourselves thank you.oh and the obligitary vanity support"
10/2/2009,i can see the use. though if i was to prioritise it's way low on the list
10/2/2009,i prefer to organize my personal funds by project or intended use. having personal wallet divisions would make this a lot easier.
10/2/2009,"tl:dr version at the end. a proposed solution to the issue of titan proliferation/ liberal use of doomsdays.doomsday devices work exactly like they are meant to: an anti-blob weapon. but when alliances or groups of them have reached the point where they can doomsday a capital fleets we have to accept that it has gotten out of hand. however eliminating doomsdays is a bad idea: there will be little to discourage conventional blobs. turning into a focused fire mega-weapon (and youd likely have to in order to make titans worth it) will most likely have the opposed effect: it will encourage titan blobbing. so really, changing dd mechanics is trying to get around the real issue: the proliferation of titans or rather the liberal use of the doomsday devices.there are some poor ways of dealing with this that have no doubt been thought of and discarded:a limit on the number of titans an alliance can have or a highly exponential titan maintenance fee sound initially good but theres the obvious get around: create titan holder alliances. when a titan costs dozens of billions to build, 1 bill for a holder alliance is pocket change. some ultra rare dd fuel. but then youd have a similar problem as you have with moons now: few valuable resources means the more powerful alliances will fight over control of them and youll have very thin chances of the little guys being able to get in the fight; or the cost will simply go up so only the very rich alliances can afford it, having the same effect of leaving the little guy out. id like to propose a new idea: limit the amount of active titans in a system, or the amount of dds that can be fired in a time period: when it reaches a peak blow up a random titan (or throw it in a random w-space system) and continue to do after x amount of time. sounds illogical, but in the world of sci-fi excuses can be easily written:since the events leading to the destruction of seyllin i, there have been bizarre accidents with titan-class supercapitals. leading scientist are now theorizing that the radiation emitted by the titan-class unique reactor technologies( or doomsday devices) somehow provoke the appearance of strange wormhole like phenomena which have already caused the destruction of several titans. early data analysis concludes that the phenomenon occurs with increasing frequency when there is heavy concentration of titans/heavy use of doomsday devices in a certain area of spacethe mechanic itself would be something like so:after x amount of titans present (or dds have been fired) in a system, titan class vessels will be randomly destroyed( or sucked into wormholes) with a frequency proportional to the amount of titans until the amount of vessels goes bellow the limit. (or y time passed since the last dd). titan be-gone timer= (z seconds)/(number of titans in system)or/and:titan be-gone timer= (z seconds)/(number dds fired in the last w hours)example: say the limit is 4 titans and group a has them all in system. group b cynos in 4 more. instantly a random titan explodes/gets sucked into a wormhole. 30 seconds afterward the next titan does. then 45 seconds, then 60 seconds. and now youve reached the 4 titan limit. all is fuzzy.tl:dr.-dds are fine as they are.-too many titans are an issue.-solution: if there are too many titans in a system start randomly blowing them up or sucking them into wormholes until there arent so many anymore.-profit.on"
10/2/2009,tl;dr: you're on space crack.actually i think that about covers it. no need for a longer version.
10/2/2009,yup.dominion isn't even out yet and your[op] already crying the sky is falling.here's an idea... how about you wait for it to come out before you start making assumptions eh?
10/2/2009,hi drake!!
10/2/2009,"what a surprise, the 2 forum *****s are the first to respond, and they don't even offer any critiquing, they just shut down the op without giving any reasons."
10/2/2009,you would be wise to go read the dev blogs/patch notes to see the method/reasoning to our madness.
10/2/2009,"here's the why:with the awesomeness that is the stealth bomber, the job of the dd for interdicting large sub-capital blobs is slowly starting to be replaced. note that ccp never said that large fleets of sub capitals were bad(tm) just that having them in one concentrated ball of death was boring. there might have been a technical reason too, but once you hit boring it's time to do something.the problem then becomes the increasing use of capital blobs - 100's of dreads / carriers on each side basically pounding at each other. basically the rr bs fights of old writ large and with 8 year lock times. again boring. area effect weapons are not the way to go here though, because a) you want to limit the calculations required to see whether or not each damagable object on grid is in range (one of - but not the only - the reasons that torps are direct weapons now) and b) any area effect that can be effectively deployed on a scale large enough to bother a cap fleet will render any gang of any number of bs utterly boned, hosed and generally in a bad way - no matter how many plates you have.the solution therefore is a super-powerful directed weapon, and of course the requirement that every titan pilot put in local before he fires ""now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battlestation!""hence no support."

10/2/2009,qft
10/2/2009,"fully supported! and to all of you saying that blasters are fine right now, they are not. gallente weapon systems should be the most powerful, as they are supposed to be. a torp raven should not be able to outdamage a megathron, for example. they're both tier 2 battleships and clearly, the raven is superior, because 1. torps do much more damage, 2. they always hit and 3. they can shoot up to 30km+. acs are capless guns and they will even be more powerful with dominion, they have great falloff, etc... pulses... they've already been mentioned. due to their much greater optimal, they can be far superior to blasters."
10/2/2009,"a neutron blaster mega fully skilled tracks about 74m/s per 1km of optimal. meaning at 4.5km optimal, they track about 333m/s. that's without any tracking gear. i don't think blasters need much more tracking than that considering ions/electrons do even better. the dps issue you have to remember is at a very limited range. the number 1 problem any blaster boat has is getting in range of it's opponents. if it has to soak up damage on approach, it better be able to do way more damage than it's opponent when it get's in range. right now, that's just not practical. 50% doesn't have to be the final number, but i think with the energy limitations i added, it should be appropriate. in a 1v1 at optimal, there shouldn't be many reasons for a blaster mega to lose. tracking disruptor, speed, energy neutralizing, and range can all play havoc with this sort of ship to counter that damage. in a long duration fight, cap instability really becomes a problem. blaster boats should be able to field a lot of pain, but in a very short burst of time. longer fights work against the ship. if you're burning through so much capacitor that even injectors can't keep up, that too limits the damage the ship can actually deal out. numbers on paper don't play well, reality on the battlefield does."
10/2/2009,"now your basing your stats on a ship that has a tracking bonus, that doesnt mean tracking is fine on the other blaster shipslasers could do with maybe a 5% loss in dps, but there is no way i will support a dps increase on large blasters, cause we already do more then enough.a dps buff now would in the end once again end in a damn hp buff on ships, and that is the last thing i want"
10/2/2009,"please ignore my similarly titled thread, it should be removed as soon as the mods get to it.the purpose of a bounty system is to reward players for supplementing the work of the concord authorities by bringing justice to those who have committed crime against them. the current system does not do this, and also acts as a money mill for player pirates with loopholes which allow for alt-killing. i believe the problems with the current system can be solved with a few rule changes which will overhaul the way the system works.i am going to tackle this by first outlining the issues i see with the system and then suggesting rule changes to solve these issues.bounty problems1.) limitations on posting bountiesthe limitations currently in place do not fully allow players to place bounties on all player criminals. they also allow players to place bounties on others who have not wronged them or necessarily even their corporation or alliances, which will be discussed later. a player criminal can maintain a positive security rating by running missions and killing npc's. then that same player can build up enough of a buffer that they can kill players without incurring a negative security rating. this means there are theoretically griefers who are completely immune to justice when committing crimes against the populace.2.) limitations on getting bountiescurrently a player with a bounty who is obviously a criminal is not a free-fire target. the only way a player is a free-fire target anywhere in eve is if the player drops their security rating below -5.0. this means if i am a player criminal with a -0.1 security rating and a bounty on my head, no one can freely enact justice upon me for my crimes.3.) security loss/gainthis relates to the problem #2 in that players with bounties aren't viewed as criminals by the concord authorities and can still have police protection in high-sec areas. if a player legitimately collects a bounty then that player gets no security status gain, also if a player collects a bounty in high-security space then that player may even suffer security status loss for player killing. is it really logical that someone should lose security status and become flagged by enacting justice on criminals?4.) free money mill through alt-killingthis is why everyone in my corporation absolutely hates the system and every time i bring it up they all complain. the money to pay bounties comes from a mystical money mill and not from players. this means that as a pirate, i can have my friend tag me with a 1 billion isk bounty, then another friend kills me and we all get rich minus the cost of the ship that gets blown up. also there is a big hole here, in order to place a bounty all one needs is to find someone with a low security status, so a player can tag anyone with a negative rating whether they have wronged them or not.solutions following in second post."
10/2/2009,"bounty solutions (numbers corresponding)1.) allow bounty posting on aggressors only.this would mean that anyone that attacks me or blows up my ship anywhere, anytime, can get a nice fat bounty on their head. this of course is excepting situations such as war-declarations and lawless 0.0 is still 0.0 space. i am also suggesting that the bounty be required to be placed within the aggression time limit that is in place. it disallows players from hiding from bounties by running a hundred missions, and disallows easy friend tagging.2.) a player with a bounty is a criminal.a player with a bounty has committed a crime which has been established by rule #1. so let the players kill them, anywhere anytime. criminals should get what they deserve and players should have the right to enact the justice that is due.3.) security loss/gaini think we handled this in #2 but i have one thing to add. now that players are acting as security forces, lets give them credit for it. how much can be debated later, but at the very least a player shouldn't lose security for it.4.) bounties are paid for by players out of pocketa bounty placed by a victim on criminal is a reward for enacting justice on that criminal. so i don't see why the mystical money mill (i assuming its technically ""concord"") should be making the payouts. the criminal didn't attack concord it attacked the player and that is who needs to take care of it. using this method of payment players can't create money out of space by popping each other and collecting bounties repeatedly. to make it even more fun lets tax the bounties so the first players that try to use the tactic of friend-killing actually lose money on it.now you may post that i am a troll and that the entire system should be removed or complain that pirates can't get free money anymore."
10/2/2009,nah. system needs a full rework. including bringing a player policing faction to lowsec. also a method of bring a low bit of security to the entire system in lowsec. not just a tiny bit of security at gates/stations.i'm hoping ccp does an expansion around this.with that said. bounty system itself should be refocused.if in real life. i'm a rich guy and i want someone killed. i put a bounty on his head. chances are... it's not going to be on some nobody pirate. it's going to be on some high profile dude. the chances this guy has the sort of equivalent negative security status isnt likely.the bounty system should be more distributed then it currently is. factions/alliances put bounties on people. which becomes visible to their faction/alliance. now mix those together. that is to say... have concord as a faction warfare alliance that you can join. the global bounties being issued by them.

10/2/2009,"1: ok so playera commits a can flip thus triggering aggression timer and opening up availability of bounty. 2: then the can owner flips the can of playera in retaliation, thus opening up aggression on themself. 3: at this point playera posts a bounty of their own isk on the previously stated can owner. 4: so in the end both players lose some items to each other in the can flipping and playera additionally loses isk because they posted a bounty on someone.explain who profited and how. i think you missed the part where concord is no longer paying bounties, players are. also being a player in the process of posting a bounty i should consider that the criminal on whom i'm posting a bounty may possibly arrange to be popped by a friend and end up with my isk. that's called risk and its all over the game.secondarily in response to jason, this really is a complete rework. also i am not trying to make the system identical to real life because if i was it would be simple, bounties all around on anybody, anytime. also there are something of bounties on corporation/alliances in the game already called war declarations."
10/2/2009,"in a game where there's no real penalty from being killed, and everyone can have as many alts as they want, i don't think the bounty system can be fixed enough to really work."
10/2/2009,"i noticed a (rather mean-spirited, i think) csm topic regarding problems with gms and the petition system. i would like to propose an alternative to their suggestions.we need a petition database!here's how this would work. when a gm answers a petition, he/she also flags personal information in the text to redact. after some time, say three months, the petition will be searchable on eve's website.the three month waiting period is there to ensure that the petition is not easily tied to a specific person and to ensure that any possible bugs or exploits uncovered have time to be fixed.so what's the benefit? the player base should search through the petitions before creating a new one. if their question/problem is answered and no gm is needed, that's time saved for ccp. on the other hand, if they have a similar petition-able problem, they can provide reference material for the gm. this allows the gm to see prior precedents for the issue to make a faster, better decision.overall, i believe a petition database would speed up the petition process, remove a lot of 'clutter', and make ccp's rules and the gm's decisions more transparent."

10/2/2009,"the p&p interface is really awkward. it would be nice if given an upgrade.for example, dragging buddies and bookmarks into folders becomes a pain when you have too many. having the buddies disappear form the all-buddies list when you put them on a group, or adding a right lick feature to ""put xyz in group uvw"" would be nice.the ability to duplicate bookmarks form the interface or a right click option to ""export bookmark to cargo hold and items hangar"" (if docked), and a right click option on bookmarks in hangars to ""import to places"" with out the bookmark disapearing would be great as well.in any case, a more friendly way of moving stuff in and out of groups would be great."
10/2/2009,"patience, sir"
10/2/2009,"all these are good ideas, assuming the system can handle them well."
10/2/2009,definately would speed up scanning through viable contracts
10/2/2009,"the purpose of a bounty system is to reward players for supplementing the work of the concord authorities by bringing justice to those who have committed crime against them. the current system does not do this, and also acts as a moneymill for player pirates with loopholes which allow for alt-killing. i believe the problems with the current system can be solved with a few rule changes which will overhaul the way the system works.i am going to tackle this by first outlining the issues i see with the system and then suggesting rule changes to solve these issues.bounty problems1.) limitations on posting bountiesthe limitations currently in place do not fully allow players to place bounties on all player criminals. they also allow players to place bounties on others who have not wronged them or necessarily even their corporation or alliances, which will be discussed later. a player criminal can maintain a positive security rating by running missions and killing npc's. then that same player can build up enough of a buffer that they can kill players without incurring a negative security rating. this means there are theoretically griefers who are completely immune to justice when committing crimes against the populace.2.) limitations on getting bountiescurrently a player with a bounty who is obviously a criminal is not a free-fire target. the only way a player is a free-fire target anywhere in eve is if the player drops their security rating below -5.0. this means if i am a player criminal with a -0.1 security rating and a bounty on my head, no one can freely enact justice upon me for my crimes.3.) security loss/gainthis relates to the problem #2 in that players with bounties aren't viewed as criminals by the concord authorities and can still have police protection in high-sec areas. if a player legitimately collects a bounty then that player gets no security status gain, also if a player collects a bounty in high-security space then that player may even suffer security status loss for player killing. is it really logical that someone should lose security status and become flagged by enacting justice on criminals?4.) free moneymill through alt-killingthis is why everyone in my corp absolutely hates the system and everytime i bring it up they all complain. the money to pay bounties comes from a mystical moneymill and not from players. this means that as a pirate, i can have my friend tag me with a 1 billion isk bounty, then another friend kills me and we all get rich minus the cost of the ship that gets blown up. also there is a big hole here, in order to place a bounty all one needs is to find someone with a low security status, so a player can tag anyone with a negative rating whether they have wronged them or not.continued in post #2"

10/2/2009,it would add flavor to the different regions. flavor is good.
10/2/2009,"damn, why not? will make fleet coordination a lot easier."
10/2/2009,fleets should have a unlimited number of slots (ok maybe not but a rather high cap would be nice).as for coordination? that's what wings/squads are for... duh?supported.
10/2/2009,awful idea. carriers and dreads are supposed to be usable ships. not to mention that you just proposed to make it impossible for freighters and orcas to dock - wtf?
10/2/2009,"i never said make freighters undockable (only a maybe, and if they can dock, put a limit on how they dock). how does stopping capitals from docking in stations make them unusable? if you can fit them outside a station, doesn't that mean you can use them?actually this is a 'i don't want my alliance capital assets to be placed under any risk whatsoever because we are incapable of defending them' whine"
10/2/2009,not supported capital noob proposal.there are so many things wrong with this... can't even begin to pick it apart.
10/2/2009,"say no more, get this ****ty mission out... or at least cut the amount in two, you actually get quite alot of factionstanding from this one, as opposed to the 8000 units of kernite one... but having to move 2 rounds with a fully cargo rigged transport ship sounds fair."
10/2/2009,"its been a long time since the ui has had any major overhauls. yet the ui is seriously lacking in many areas, from market functionality, too manufacturing, overviews and tactical overlays all need updating with an emphesis on useability. eg why cant i put 10 manufacturing jobs on at the same time instead of doing them all individually. why are lp stores so rediculous to find anything in instead of having a ""mini market"" like uinot to metion its looking old and run down eve needs a full ui overhaul"
10/2/2009,just my own personal gripe with carriers and mother ships. they all have huge open hangers... big open areas where fighters would fly out of.... why o why are they just shat out explosively in all directions... make fighters fly out of the big open area please ccp make my nidhoggur even more epicos
10/2/2009,sure. and do it with missiles from launchers too.
10/2/2009,currently you can only have 100 items in an item exchange contract.i suggest raising this limit to 250.i had a massive bpo sale and was forced to make multiple contracts instead of one or two large ones.what do you think?
10/2/2009,yep
10/2/2009,"i actually raised this in the 'community' roundtable today with wrangler and the lovely mod who's name i have forgetten. the 5minute ban was brought in to combat the isk spammer keylogger posting, however they are going to look at the edit/reply restriction."
10/3/2009,"this is basically the idea i stated earlier just with a consumable...yet you dismissed it in favour of a more difficult solution. are you sane?furthermore it's simple, include a drone repair bay capable of holding 1 fighter or more and take that space from the drone bay. as it stands carriers can hold 16 fighters (if you have nothing else). furhtermore you could still use drone repairs bay as a storage and launch platform."
10/3/2009,"or you could try and read instead of questioning my mental state.what i am saying here is that there should be a balance between a possible consumption and the repair rate of drones. this means that either you have a fast repair rate and consumption or a slow repair rate and no consumption, two options however the original proposal deals with the second.the original proposal dealt with here is a slow non-battle usable mechanic which has no consumption. because why should it cost money if it's something you can't use in combat? internal repair systems and remote repair systems don't cost resources other than energy either.what i however do support is that when triage mode is activated the repair speed is significantly increased and it consumes nanite paste or some other form of consumption to stay in line with the repair rate but providing a bonus just as the triage mod does now for the systems already in place.i was not discussing the mechanic behind this as it is very simple and obvious. just make sure that the total amount of drones being able to be carried is added up somewhere so that you can never put more drones into the initial drone bay than drones in drone bay + drones in maintenance bay."
10/3/2009,bump and supported even though it was brought to ccp last meeting
10/3/2009,/signed
10/3/2009,makes the scanning down of targets a lot harder!support!
10/3/2009,"i agree ccp has not adressed this matter and should with the growing support of its paying customers... however i tend to think they have put the csm mechanic into place to have fair representation of the players. lets try not to muck up the water with critisism of the csm roles just yet, the system is fairly new and seems to have some momentum as well as a few bugs to work out.to me being a csm is like having the job of a prober in a worm space corp... its a thankless job that gets critisized often, has tons of time and energy invested and no matter what or how you do it someone always has something negative to say or a better way to get the job done...but yet that same someone with the big mouth is all to often the one who does the least to help the overall cause and the first to hide when its time to knuckle down and do the tedious ground work...and campaigning for a pilot for csm has a different place my well intentioned friend !try to keep this topic clear, consise, focused and thriving with genuine input. that will get the attention of those that make the decisions. rambling, flaming, bantering and soap boxing for a csm candidacy simply gives those that wish to read this thread and digest its content more crap to wade through and detracts from the impact and serious consideration it should get.treat the topic like your favorite vessel and tweak it to the point it makes a impact and is noticable.support those few men and women who have given their time, effort and thick skins to present such ideas a chance to do their job and feel good about doing it rather than shoot them down at each opportunity.like i tell my corp and alliance members if you can do the job better, step up to the plate show your stuff (basicly put up or shut up)if your not part of the solution then better to stay silent rather than add to the problem."
10/3/2009,"to the op: do your work on politics cause you really need it. sorry to be insulting you but this wont work and doesn't make sense.if you attack amarr do you really think caldari will stay on the side without any rights to intervene. wtf ? believe me, the emperor and the people around him will say ""were allies to caldari, order them to help us now!"". maybe not like that but caldari wont be able to stay on the side they can't.of course there's other major downside to your idea like the way 1 faction could be overwhelmed with wartargets. i call that legal griefing. maybe your just giving that idea to tip the side of the battle away from one faction for all i know. who knows!not supported at all.alliances should really stay out of fw. if they get inside fw, its going to be hell."
10/3/2009,i would like to see more posts on wether or not there is a community interest in improving ship visuals and less on how this will effect lag. wether or not it will lag the server depends soley on if and how ccp chooses to impliment the system.
10/3/2009,"the easiest way to do this would be to simply allow players to apply a color over their ship.they could have a choice of 256 colors.which can be packed into 1 byte of networked data.1. no textures to generate, the color is applied over the existing texture.2. 500 ships = 500 bytes of data sent to each client.500 bytes = lol.one alternative could also be, only sending the value when ""look at"" is done at a distance, or the ships model is visible on the client.the problem with this, you're not painting logos or anything fancy. just applying a color."
10/3/2009,"not supported cause a bee stung me today in my garden! nah, but i'm not supporting it.reasons: ccp has stated before that it can't be done the person who brought this up, are you a game developer? no, then what makes you think it can be done now? furthermore, what makes you think it would be 'easy' if in fact it can be done but it is difficult and requires plenty of coding we're going to waste an entire expansion potentially on this, this time could be better spent on something useless like certificates through some unforeseen circumstance it could ruin the integrity of the game and create a massive blackhole sucking all the customers out of the game!now to be serious, unless we understand what occurs exactly when you dock to a station then we aren't in a position to suggest the difficulty of this issue. for example, what's the kind of stress having all capitals allow players to dock up to them like stations going to be like? furthermore they can't fix the speed in which to view, and sometimes never view, the multiple compartments in the carriers hanger space. i for one would like to see them fix that before adding to the carrier.carriers cost less than 1b now with titans costing upwards of 70. carriers can carry much less granted but having 20 carriers you could bring in a fleet the size you would with a titan. the cost of 20b facilitates the use of carriers more and titans less making titans that much less tactical. the purpose of a titan would have been thoroughly mapped out during their creation and, while the game always evolves, what else would you suggest to replace that function with that has equal value? something has to make up for it's immense cost otherwise what you are suggesting is what wow does all the time, making expansions obsolete (cause they are idiots)."
10/3/2009,"magic 8-ball says: ""outlook not so good."""
10/3/2009,"no. there are plenty of empire corps to run missions in. there is the ""red"" and ""blue"" empire wars corps to pvp with. someone already said if a corp told you your worthless they are ******ed and you need to find another. make your own corp if you want to. the is eve. do wtf ever you want to.the 100% multiplier is perfect. gaining 8mill sp in 3 months imo is way to much. for a normal noob that 8mill sp will take closer to 6-8 months. if you stop staring at the character sheet skills train faster too.if you guys want to keep whining go play wow and grind it out."
10/3/2009,"no, i completely disagree with any remedy to this situation. the fact is, csm have incentives to continue being elected because they get a free trip+meals and lodging to iceland every election (makes a fantastic holiday destination). altering this process gives ccp and large alliances the incentive to abuse the system in which case i might as well chuck money on the street and see how long it takes for someone to find it (usually 10 min) which is more entertaining.bottom line is, by placing this in the csm submission and ccp review pile you have already abused your powers. it's like sending a bill through to be discussed, having it denied and implementing it in society anyway. that isn't democratic, it's tyranny.i have to draw blood from a stone every time i petition ccp about an ethical issue which always requires a supervisor's input because the grunts have to stick to the ccp policy's. this money could be better spent removing one step so that people don't have to wait so long for a proper solution."
10/3/2009,"maybe you should understand that the point of wormholes probably wasn't to go populate it and just drop a pos in one and stay in it. you're supposed to move in, and move out....not try to claim systems like 0.0 sovereignty or something."
10/3/2009,if your struggling to find a good wormhole then move to a class 4 or higher... they last much longer.... just don't expect it to be a picnic.
10/3/2009,"maybe you missed it, but the devs have stated several times that the pos don't affect respawn rate in wh systems.it is simply a perception problem. you find a system where no one has been before for days/weeks and despawn a lot of sites crying bonanza!then the new sites slowly (as they always do) spawn. and you cry saying ""but there where 50-100 or more sites when i entered, clearly that is the natural state of this wormhole.""wrong, the natural state is a slowly increasing number of sites. your initial big number of sites was the result of weeks of accumulation. if you are willing to wait for weeks and no one come and despawn some of the sites you will again see 50-100 or more sites. you see exactly the same phenomenon in all the other exploration content. stuff accumulate in some forgot angle of the universe and when you find it you find a gold mine.but after you have despawned everything it will not return all in a rusk the nest day but simply trickle in a few sites every day. btw: the rate of spawn of new sites is directly related to the rate of despawn of already existing sites in other wh of the same class found by other players."
10/3/2009,"a pos doesn't influence the spawn rate of the sites, players do. just like the k-space exploration system if a site despawns the site goes to another random system.meaning that if you actively hunt down all sites the respawn rate is lower than the despawn rate. is this a bad mechanic? no, it makes sure you don't hang around in one system too long farming over and over but hunting actively for greener pastures."
10/3/2009,* facepalm *theres no pos nerfing spawns./thread
10/3/2009,yeah i'd also like to have an accountant tally up my tax and check if i can claim anything back from the blood sucking contract agents :p - since the beginning of time (the year is roughly before may 2003) people have always used one wallet for personal transactions fine. multiple wallets in corp's have been to stop thieves leeching from the main wallet. there is no practical use for this.
10/3/2009,id love this
10/3/2009,i would also want a simple system so that i can easily divide the money between the wallets by setting a % on each one and all money coming in will be sorted accordingly. a self tax system kinda.
10/3/2009,"as far as i know there is no issue that covers this however there is a similar issue already raised by the csm about revising the bounty hunter system. this covers npc's and not players and therefore do not dismiss as the same issue!my proposal is simple, as of yet we don't have the revised bounty system and while this does not make the revised system being proposed to ccp obsolete it would make the 'pirating career' that much more interesting, dangerous and potentially rewarding.the proposalmy proposal is to introduce intelligent npc bounty hunters that actively seek out players with bounties on their heads. the higher the bounty the stronger the fleet that comes after you. it could either be very intelligent where the bounty follows you from system to system or simply a spawn that occurs on a random chance with a despawn of say 15 minutes either from when they spawn or when the bounty player leaves the system.these bounty fleets could consist of anywhere between 2 ships and up to say 15 or more requiring a pirate armada (corporation) to dismiss them however because of the abnormal strength of the bounty hunter npc's they could drop valuable pirating gear to continue harassing empire, low sec and nul sec players.specificswith a bounty of say less than 20 million isk only a maximum of 2 ships will have a random chance of chasing you and going upwards every 20-50m isk placed on your head. huge fleets will not always have a 100% chance spawn rate (when bounty hunters spawn) but rather a low, say 5-10% chance of spawning with the required isk bracket. the harder the spawn the more likely that defeating it will yield a rare item however will not guarantee it. to make sure that the system isn't abused the spawn shouldn't have a long timer so that players must be quick to earn the reward. the spawn should be better than avg faction ships but not so much to make it a good training system to do wh's etc. what i'm refering to is their ability to use e-war/weapons etc well and focusing fire or spreading it out. if any bounty players are killed by the hunters concord gets the bounty on their headd reducing the value to 0 again and thus draining isk from the system.benefits/disadvantagesisk sink to take further funds out of the gamegreat way to punish annoying griefers that suicide gank youmakes the pirating career more interesting by making it more dangerousnew way to earn faction items but not make it easy to do so or any more likely than a faction spawn occuringanyway, that's enough ranting from me. let's hear your opinions."
10/3/2009,"hi-sec just not safe enough for you, eh?if you want those ebil piwats killed, do it yourself."
10/3/2009,"way to fail more malcanis.just because i post a topic about the pirating career does not mean i'm a high sec baby, i've spent the majority of my time down in 0.0. however i bring this up because the bounty system is currently 'for show' much like the certificate system. by adding to it there could be more incentives for players to go pirate and a simpler way to have noobs and those who are hit on one off random encounters to deal with their problem by placing bounties on those pirates. furthermore my topic introduced an additional topic to make pirating more beneficial for pirate groups as well."
10/3/2009,"isk out through bounties would be negligible in comparison to the currently available isk fountains.not all pirates are suicide gankers, many are outlaws who cannot even enter hi-sec.with global criminal countdown, gateguns, and lack of access to hi-sec pirates have enough penalties. that last, given the lack of low-sec attractiveness and thus lack of trade hubs, is particularly debilitating to those with a single account.the reward is minor if it's approximately equal to ratting, plus being jumped during 1v1 or 1vx engagements would lead to making piracy pretty much unbearable.your problem seems to be with those who take piracy as side proffession or gank people on alts, while having the heaviest effect on those who take on piracy full-time, especially those who yarr solo.if anything lo-sec piracy needs a few minor benefits to improve it's attractiveness vs suicide ganking on alts or roaming 0.0."
10/3/2009,no.go and do it yourself.npc's doing things for players is ****ing cancer in this game.
10/3/2009,as clever as the idea is... this only leads to one conclusion.... player harassment via exploitation of bounty system.not supported for lack of foresight.
10/3/2009,"hang on, so if i give myself a bounty via an alt then i get faction loot dropping spawns that follow me around?:awesome:"
10/3/2009,i got bored after reading your first paragraph but the reasons are probably in there. i don't support nerfing titans.
10/3/2009,"and a high-value system, like say a titan nursery, would have the maximum number of titans in system at all times making any attack practically impossible.end result: 100% fool-proof defence with zero chance of defeat. yay for static sovereignty maps!solution is to find a way to make people want to bring titans forward into the fray while at the same time minimizing the utter devastation that multiple titans can cause when used together.this is the focus of a rather lively debate in the test forum but it is at an impasse i am afraid, almost impossible to give any ability worth having without it scaling horribly."
10/3/2009,the last paragraph is all that's needed as a reason. the rest just seal the deal.
10/3/2009,"my proposal is as follows:let players pick one of their 3 characters per account and then transfer all skills acumulated on the other two characters to their chosen main character. all ""relearned"" skills would get turned into raw skill points to be applied wherever the pilot sees fit. im sure most will be opposed to this idea and here are some forseable reasons why, followed directly by why i think it should still happen.1. ccp will say its to hard to do:well they say that about allot of things. that may be why instead of taking the time to make other ships more competitive they take the easy way ""nerf it"" approach until ships like the raven become nothing more than support dps. it may be almost impossible but it still seems nessasarry to me.2. some people like the way it is because; you can set up the other characters with diferent attributes to help train certain specialized skills such as titans or industrial characters, this comes in handy because ccp in all their wisdom cant come up with a safe way for a titan pilot to exit his super capital and pilot anything else withought trusting a bunch of people who would gladly pod their best friends for a chance to get at his titan in the ""saftey"" of their 0.0 pos. would it be so hard to let somthing as big as a station go into a mode outside npc station where it is considered part of the station by the npc and thus made indestructable while it is externally docked to it? even if it means longer docking times & aggression timers for supercapitals? as far as the training bonuses to our alts go has anyone taken into account the -100% bonus to our main character's training while we train our alt's? has anyone stopped to think that mayby ccp copied other popular game systems allitle bit when they started out and then realized even tho it doesnt quite fit the game its already there and would just be too hard to fix?is it really worth having a specialized miner when you have to stop training your main to save a much smaller percentage, just to have to log on as a different character who has stolen valuable combat skill training time just so it can hold its own against a few belt rats? doesn't that start to equal out after awhile? what would be wrong with having implants that would only work in conjunction with similar implants but would go higher than +5's so a pilot could temporarilly train industrial faster than combat etc?3. corp spies and corp killers would have to work allitle harder to infiltrate corporations, and a lot harder to disapear or avoid retaliation.dont get me wrong i love watching the ceo's of my alliance watching me out of the corner of their eyes after ive been there for 6 months as much as the next guy always wondering if im really the person i claim to be or if im going to dump this load and come back with my second account and my pvp ship to blow them away every single time we go on a mining op only to disapear into the woodwork. once again i dont see a problem its not impossible to infiltrate an enemy corp just because they know you as their enemy. people do similar things in real all the time. i've done it ive got the medal for doing it and if i can do it, then it cant be that hard. and if somone really doesnt have the wit to be a spy withought an alt they could always buy an account, close it, buy another, close it. because they sure wouldnt want to follow their main around with it. mayby to make it easier ccp could change the 15 dollar swap char portraits option out with a 15 dollar+ hit to skill points creat new character for this account option.i will only answer those posts directed to why this is a good idea, a bad idea, or an idea to improve this idea, or an alternate idea to fix this idea. so if your here to flame my grammer my spelling or my intelligence. just make sure you throw in an actual reason to be opposed or be ignored. fire away!"
10/3/2009,"i dont mine, so i think all mining barges should be removed from the game and the equivalent minerals deposited in the owners hangars. no compensation for the skillpoints tbh; you people must have known that getting free minerals from rocks that just hang stationary in space without even shooting back was always an exploit.also i want - no, demand a pony.also, someone should beat me with a cluebat night and day until i'm either pretty or stop making extremely stupid proposals in the assembly hall about moronic ideas which have been proposed and shot down twenty times already."
10/3/2009,"i like my alts and don't want to pay several times my current rate to maintain my variation of playstyles and affiliations. if you would allow new accounts at a discount, so the costs wouldn't change, there would be no point to this.your basic reason for suggesting this seems to be ""it still seems nessasarry to me"" (i'm assuming you mean necessary). you don't actually give any good reasons for doing it, so there isn't much to refute here. but i'm sure you don't see the need to provide strong reasons before ruining the playstyle and fun of many current players. i might as well just say no and leave it at that. this is propably a troll anyway, so why waste time on it."

10/3/2009,"sounds to me like you are thinking up schemes to get the sp respec which has been shot down repeatedly.if you don't like your alts and that ccp makes good hard cash from multiple accounts, then recycle you unused characters, cancel any extra accounts and feel content that you are making eve a better place.no on all counts."

10/3/2009,"lol i am well adapted to the current system and was well aware when i posted that almost no one would agree. because what im talking about is adapting, and not just adapting but, adapting to face the concecuences of the decisions we makei can fully understand how my proposal can bring out the little carbear in all of us. and the fact that it is so strongly opposed only reinforces my belief that bringing the concecuences more in line with reality will increase the adreniline experience, because quite frankly i can smell the fear in your posts.also i never said a thing about limiting accounts, only their alts. i would never get rid of my current accounts i dont think anyone would. as for the current assosiations bit. yes unless you made arangments you may loose some friends unless there was some way to track them down..and there are many.as for the idea? is it really possible to do? no i seriously doubt anyone in the game or making it has the creativity or the ability to make somthing like this happen. somtimes i just like to post what if's to hear carebears whine and find it extremely gratifying to hear people that think they are above the rest whimpering and crying little carbear tears and worrying about somthing that cant even be done out of a distant fear that they may have to make a choice as simple as. are they a girl or a boy and actually have to live with it ;)enjoy"

10/3/2009,when you create a new character the skillsheet should be empty or you should be able to customize what skills you have at start. starting a new character only to have a bunch of useless skill that make your skillsheet ugly is bad.
10/3/2009,"your character clearly didn't have the logic skill from the beginning.think newbies have enough skills to train, and newbies won't really understand what skill does what so they will end up just giving themselves a bunch of botched skills."

10/3/2009,what you did was assume... like you usually do these days.stop compensating for your shortcomings and start reading.assumptions make you look stupid.i reacted that way because i strive for balance in game mechanics... people foolishly think that ditching one thing will cause no harm to the game as opposed to the other.... and vice versa.this isn't hello kitty online but nor is it gank online.it's eve online... the balance between high sec and 0.0 is required... yes its a problem but if you dont strike a balance your never going to get the problem solved.

10/3/2009,"i agree a fix is needed but throwing damage at it is possibly not the best fix, improving tracking would help since they are supposed to be close range weapons and since webs are nerfed this makes tracking with blasters overly difficult.1. improve the fall off mechanic in terms of hit quality:half falloff = 5% additional miss.single falloff = 10% additional miss.double falloff = 50% additional miss.more then double fall off = 95% miss2. allow low damage ammo to also give better falloff (like iron / lead).same goes for all other guns, hence boosting flexability of hybrid and projectile ammo and giving t2 ships designed for falloff something more useful. this also adds little for lasers which should be inflexable, as intended to work at their good optimal range. ships with ammo have to reload and carry the ammo but they have more flexability within their given specialisation."

10/3/2009,"good in theory, bad in practice.the problem stems from the hierarchy for the gm petitioning structure. ccp staff at the front-line level are required to apply very strict policies to your petitions. this is why you get bad petitions and an overload on the petitioning system (imo). what you suggest would mean a lot of useless and insensitive examples would become precedent for gm's to use.what you need is to replace grunt rules with a new approach to allow creative but controlled and monitored solutions. such a system would decrease the petition load."

10/4/2009,"fully supported. i can't imagine why there isn't some sort of folder system or anything like that for your hangers and ships. i tried going the station container route, but it's a pain in the ass when you fly to jita to buy a new ship and you can't check your assets window to see what modules you already have at hq and don't need to buy..... and that uncertainty gets expensive when your ships are fitted entirely with t2 mods."
10/4/2009,"this proposal collects several positively received ideas.issue 1: enabling overload in the heat of battle can often be tricky.solution: make the button a few pixels taller, and it should go orange when overload has been activated and will be enable on the next cycle.example:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.here i am overloading 1 webber, the guns and the mwd ill be overloaded on the next cycle. issue 2: in battle, it is very hard to see what target is affected by, impossible to know whether it is scrambled, warp disrupted, jammed, sensor damped, in large battle it is hard to see who is remote repping who. that makes fleet management all more complicated.solution: when the target is locked, under the target bar you can see all the remote effects projected on it, including damage, remote rep, and all commonly used mods. hovering cursor over it will cause a line to be drawn from the effector (the guys who is projecting the effect) to the target. the lines will have different clolour depending of the type of the effector: red for damage, blue for e-war, green for remote-repp and shield transfer, yellow for cap transfer, or whatever colours developers see fit. as well as that, hovering your cursor over the icon of the effector, let's say warp disruptor, will cause the multiplyer to be shown, showing how many of the modules are being used on the target. that will help fc make sure that target is jammed and all dps is on the primary. example:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.here i am attacking retriever, and the icon of the warp disruptor and webber at the bottomn helps me make sure that my friend in a tackling frigate has the target immobilized. having a status bar next to your capacitor deiplaying all effects projected on to you would be nice, so in a 10 men fight i know who exactly is jamming me, and i tell my fc about it, so that that guy is primaried. if i am doing a mission that will tell me which rat is webbing or scramming me. clicking tactical overlay button would display all effects in the form of lines for all targets in sight, it could have an arrow or something else to demonstrate direction of the effect, this would greatly help all fleet commanders.issue 3: i do not want to be limited to just a few ""warp at"", ""orbit"" and ""keep at range"" options.solution: when you click ""esc"", you would have a menu ""personalize"", where you could change all the ranges defaults, to any custom numbers in kilometers, with 1 decimal place. that was i could completely change the entire set of ranges that pops up when i click ""warp at"" to my guns optimal, my point's maximum range, and my drones maximum range, and pick the one i need. for a ""warp at"" i would be able to enter coordinates x, y, and z, with the center of the coordinates being at the object that i am warping to, so having:x = 50y = 130z = 73would mean that i am warping 50 km in front of the gate, 130 km above it, and then 73 km to the left.these coordinats would be saved, and would show up in the ""warp at"" menu, in custom order, in format x50y130z73, or in the for of the linear distance to the gate. issue 4: it is annoying that when i try to fit my ship, and i do not have a scrambler of meta lvl 4,but instead have a lvl 3 one, i cannot use automatic fitting, but i have to do it manually. solution: add a pop-up asking ""no item of exact meta lvl found, would you like to fit the closest avaliable lvl item instead?"". the same would happen for ammo and drones, scripts, booster charges and so on. when one of the items is not found during fitting, an option to ""skip"" and ""replace"" would pop up, whenre fitting would continue without this item, or you would fit something else instead."
10/4/2009,"issue 5: it is very hard to transport large amount of goods, belonging to different people, and then figure oput what is whose.solution add an in-game item, a plastic wrapper with volume of 0.1 m^3 that acts exactly same way as courier contract once you place your items into it. can be only used once. shows name of person who packed it.please understand that as i am not a professional game developer, exact balance and tweaking and color is up to ccp game designers to make it the most user friendly and appealing. same goes for the numbers and exact position of buttons. if you like the suggestion, but you have another view on how it could be solved in a more elegant way, support this topic (as you want to solve the same issue) and post your way of solving it. if you disagree with just one of the five points i posted, point it out with reasoning and preferably some constructive critics. lastly, not all of the ideas are mine, i just collected alot of ui issues and there solutions under 1 roof. ps: i know that barge on the picture is not a hulk, but i cannot change it to retriever due to character limit."

10/4/2009,"i support all of this but the solution to issue 3. the premise of warping to something is that your warp drive finds the object, locks onto it, and flies to it. it's not surgically accurate, nor should it be, and warping at distance is the only reasonable custom coordinate to have. though i am in full support of allowing full customization of at-distance values (up to, say, 180km or something so that you can't warp in to just anywhere at 210 to scout out before warping the rest of the way)."
10/4/2009,if i had an isk for everytime i saw this thread...

10/4/2009,"as most of the people here i think that giving away a large bunch of sp to people that don't even know how the game work is a sure path for failure.the next step would be ""we need to be capable of respeccing our skills, as we did them wrong""a suggestion that i have often seen and that, a this point in the game evolution, i would support, is to remove the first tier of the stat enhancing skills and give directly a +5 increase in all skills.people that have trained all the learning skills to 5 like me will feel a bit shortchanged, but most of us would not stay irritated for more than a few minutes, especially if ccp gave some of the sp we spent back in some form. naturally it would not have the same effect on new players that saying ""you have 1.280.00 sp (the 5 tier one skills at level 5) to spend as you want as a free gift"" but it would do much more to help them that giving free sp that most of them would spend to learn to fly cruisers without even knowing the basic of the game."
10/4/2009,"they should just get rid of the training skills, give everyone the extra stat points like we all had max learning, and then give everyone who has skill-points in learning double-speed training for twice the number of sp they had in learning."

10/4/2009,"eve is a complex game, you use those few months to understand the way it works, for beefing up your wallet, trading, making friends, finding the right corp, choosing part of game you like, learning how to pvp, fit your ships, e.t.c.i am a relatively new player, and there is plenty of stuf newplayers can do. you are not suppose to be able to get as good and someone who played this game for few years withing couple of days, at least not in anything except flying t1 frigs."
10/4/2009,"i'll bet they know. and you know what else i'll bet? i'll bet they don't care. i don't know how many people have active subscriptions to eve, but i do know that there are probably an average of 30,000 people online at any given time. just counting that number (30,000), and assuming the average amount they pay per month is $13 (factoring in the lower-rate extended subscriptions, and the higher cost per month of timecards), ccp is making $390,000/mo gross income. though i remember reading that there are several hundred thousand active subscriptions, so that number could easily be multiplied by ten. eve doesn't need more subscribers. of course, more subscribers does mean more money and that's always a good thing, but they don't need to sacrifice very important game mechanics in order to keep the newbies playing. ccp should be plenty content with the number of subscribers they have now."
10/4/2009,i want to see this too maby it can be a way to transport rigged ships. once the ship is in a package it acts like a freighter can and can be loaded into any standard transport while the rigs remain intact
10/4/2009,supported but...need an idea how could be increase the negative standings toward npc pirates.maybe a solution for that:cross standings toward other npc pirate faction.like this: drones/sansha/blood hate angels/serpentis/guristas and vica versa (so if you shot angels the standigs toward angels decreased but blood increased)
10/4/2009,"you fleet with the alt and then the alt hands the mission in for the fleet.however, it works fine for the corp standings, but iirc you need to have a faction standing of above -2.00 to get missions yourself (and thus your own storylines). the alt's storyline missions won't give you any faction increases."
10/4/2009,"choices should have consequences, but in a dark universe such as eve deciding to turn traitor to your faction really should be an option. especially given that most of the pirate factions members likely originate from their opposing empire faction."
10/4/2009,i propose a new class of industrial ships geared towards the transport of rigged ships throughout highsec. i propose implimenting 2 verieties of these vessels a small and very cheap veriety for use by individuals who are simply moving one or 2 ships and a large capital veriety simmilar to a general freighter. these new ships will use the same models as their standard industrial / freighter counterparts save for the fact that their cargo holds are replaced with maintanance bays of apropriate size. aside from this they will be no different from their industrial counterparts in terms of fitting. they will require the new skill industrial transport carriers trainable after gaining rank 4 in any of the normal industrial skills. the freighter veriety will require the freighter skill as well. the ingame story will be somthing along these lineswith recent advances in rigging technology the number of ships that cannot be transported by normal means has been on the rise. with concord imposing strict limits on capital ships within high security space enterprising corperations have begun retrofitting their fleets of industrials replacing their massive cargo holds with specialized ship maintanance rigs capable of handeling the transportation of a wide veriety of customized vessals without the need for wastefully dismantling after market additions.
10/4/2009,"i don't think this is a good idea, as it hugely simplifies logistics when moving region to region. while i understand that currently logistics is a *****, i don't think creating a cheap ship carrier is the solution."
10/4/2009,well the alternitave would be to allow carriers in high sec and just make concord do a **** ton more dps to compensate for the high sec ganking problem
10/4/2009,you failed horribly at searching.
10/4/2009,"tbh, the search feature of the forum is completely useless - so i don't really blame them for that.as for the op, this has been hashed over and hashed over in numerous other threads. the general consensus is that a lot of people would like it, and a lot of people wouldn't. i go back and forth on the matter."
10/4/2009,"so, you want them to implement an orca?"
10/4/2009,hah i knew there was already a ship for it!
10/4/2009,"when the orca was first introduced, i was quite ecstatic that there would be a new ship that was being designed specifically for hauling ore. i figured this would be especially helpful in w-space where i tend to mine as much ore as i can before returning back to k-space. the problem is that the orca's mass makes it difficult or even impossible to use in some instances. at best the orca may be able to make one or two 2-way trips from w-space before the wormhole reaches critical mass and is on the verge of closing.the orca is also a cheap tool used by w-space corps to shut down unwanted wormholes with ease without risking a more expensive ship such as a carrier. if you look at the ratio of cargo space to ship mass you'll find that when comparing the orca to the next largest hauler, the iteron v, the cargo space to ship mass ratio is way out of line.i propose to give the orca the same ship mass as a covetor or hulk since they appear to be about the same size on screen (even give it 30% more than the hulk and it would work). as it stands, the ship's mass doesn't work well with its defined role with regards to w-space transport.thanks!"
10/4/2009,uh... no.because you obviously have no experience with whs.i've seen wh's survive 4 to 6 trips with an orca.
10/4/2009,you obviously have no experience with whsit all depends on the wormhole type.
10/4/2009,"exactly...if the class of the wormhole itself is low, the orca won't even have a chance of making it. a class 8 wormhole (not the space itself but the class of the wormhole entrance/exit) will normally allow 2 two-way trips by an orca before it starts to destabilize. i did give some thought to the mass of the orca. since it's able to store 2 hulks i would then say make the ship 3-4 times as massive as a hulk. this would still put it way under its current mass. 3 times may not seem as much but if the ship is mainly filled with empty space inside (much like a balloon) then it wouldn't have all that much mass compared to something like a carrier which would have more armor and such which would contribute to its mass."
10/4/2009,you know what... i don't care what you think or say because i've seen it myself.this proposal has a chance in hell of flying because of the raw facts of whs.don't expect it to work out pal.
10/4/2009,"i'm not opposed to this idea per se(as long as its effective agility doesn't change), but i'll just point out that the orca really wasn't designed for w-space, it was designed for highsec mining gangs with a sideline in the ""small freighter"" business."
10/4/2009,"this.the orca's primary benefit is that fleet members can load cargo directly into the ore bay, thereby bypassing the dangerous use of jet cans and the need to anchor secure containers. the orca pilot would be better off flying a hulk and loading things into a hsc, and then coming back with an itty 5, while a corpmate or two fly around fighting off rats and pirate gangs."
10/4/2009,"a lot of people already agreed that it would be lovely to have more hangar divisions for the individual players, just like the corporations can do.what came to my mind is something to make it even better and more useful.everyone can have multiple hangars and multiple wallets (this apply to corporations too).then you have an option to protect one or more hangar/wallet divisions.when you do this everything inside the hangar/wallet is locked and to unlock it you must request an unlock code.the unlock code is sent to your rl email (the one you registered with the account) and expires in 10 minutes (or something like that).this way when a hacker get control of an account he can't access everything but cheap stuff and people can get back in the game withouth so much pain.what do you think about this?thank you for reading."
10/4/2009,"from the comments i've read on the forum , it seems the first thing a hacker does is change password and email. this to prevent there victim from logging in or recovering there account.so this system would only act as a delay for them, not really useful.and not to mention highly userunfriendly towards the players."
10/4/2009,"well, you are right, but not completely imo.with a secure hangar you can save your most precious stuff, like bpo, faction ships and items, unique stuff and the most of your money maybe, so when an hacker get control of the account he cannot empty your characters and when ccp give your account back, you have still plenty of stuff to keep going and the recover will be easier."
10/4/2009,"considering that a lot of accounts get hacked through use of keyloggers, it is not going to prevent a lot.once they have access to the account, it is done.this is just a case of people needing to learn how to keep there computer secure, or suffer the consequences for failing it."
10/4/2009,giving users personal divided hangers and wallets because of security is a really poor reason.9 times out of 10 the breech occurs at the corporation level... not the personal one.good idea... bad motivation.not supported.
10/4/2009,"not supported.people don't ""hack"" you to get your password. it happens by way of you downloading a keylogger or being phished. basically, the only time anybody can get into your account is by way of your own stupidity when you essentially hand over your account information to them.honestly, though, i would appreciate a ""save password"" checkbox in the eve login screen... it would make things easier for you to get in using your own computer and would also make keyloggers pretty well useless."
10/4/2009,this seems decidedly inferior to the authenticator idea that's been mentioned a few times.
10/4/2009,what if those faction loot dropping spawns would pod you ? would you be so happy ?
10/4/2009,"i can understand having a 72-hour restriction on forums use, but why is api information a part of the restricted system? surely nothing bad can come from people being able to access their api information immediately. i suggest that api information (and possibly all character info available online) is separated from the 72-hour forum login restriction.(perhaps ccp will make a better way when this cosmos thing comes out with dominion... we'll have to see)"
10/4/2009,1
10/4/2009,"yeah, this is silly."
10/4/2009,"so if you're here to flame my grammar, my spelling, or my intelligence, just make sure you throw in an actual reason for opposition, or be ignored.*"
10/4/2009,just no
10/4/2009,"easy, i don't like missile/gun skills on industry characters and i don't like mining/industry skills on pvp characters. yes, you can pick your character, but it still screws you. basically, i would prefer to pick my own skills so i don't have to accept the crap they stick me with. having tons of random skills that are useless is ugly, i want clean skillsheets. you do realize that the skills given when you create a character are less than a day of training? they are random skills over all skill paths worth almost no sp that only wreck your skillsheet. the skills given to you are already botched, why would it matter, especially since it is only 50k sp.you are arguing to save the 50k sp you are given at the beginning?screw that."
10/4/2009,wow is that way seriously... how long have you been playing eve?
10/4/2009,"i vaguely understand where he's coming from...opening your skillsheet the first time to see a bunch of skills you don't recognise or understand isn't hugely helpful.maybe just a new tutorial explaining each of your starting skills, and suggesting a few others to be trained, should be implemented?"
10/4/2009,"i love how you say this because it is the exact opposite.anyone with many accounts and is useful in this game agrees with me. i may have 8 accounts and characters that i would prefer to not have stupid skills that i am stuck with.remember, you are arguing over 50k sp and >10 skill that you are stuck with, woopdee do, what a waste."
10/4/2009,"that's the way this game used to be. the problem is that eve is so complex and noob-unfriendly that it was impossible for a newbie to know what they wanted to do and would often end up with starting skills that were completely different than how they decided they wanted to progress. so ccp implemented the very-basic-skills-at-start-and-then-double-speed-training-until-1.6-million-sp plan and made everything much better. there is nothing that needs changing.and what's wrong with being ""stuck with stupid skills""? it's not like there is a downside to having skills that you don't necessarily need besides the extra sp it takes to keep in a clone.... but beside the fact that 50k sp is only going to push you into a higher level clone when you are 45 minutes of training from the next one anyway, said higher clone levels are very cheap. that is, until you are in the tens of millions of sp when those extra 50k won't even be noticeable.stop crying about stupid things."
10/4/2009,really you want a pure build industry character... this proposal is just for the looks and thus completely unnecessary.
10/4/2009,"i lolled, dont tell people about spelling, then go on to spell stuff wrong.also, i didnt brand people who disagree as a griefer, i branded the people who would probably emorage at me as probable griefers (even if they post with an alt).also, an idea is better than just bleating about others ideas.also, move out of your mums basement, try speaking to real females, and stop wacking off over japanese schoolgirls. you may be allowed to join the human race.also, cybering doesnt count as real sex, you need to actually touch the other person.and lastly, if you dont like a suggestion, just post not supported. itll save everyone from suffering your incredibly dull intelect."
10/4/2009,"yes. mercenary contracts. i support this. i do not, however, support any of the op changes.and of course it is reasonable from a storyline/rp point of view that concord will accept money to look the other way. it's just like earth."
10/4/2009,"when you browse for a fit you can only click ""fit"" to automatically fit the active ship.but it is useless if you don't have the modules already.what about a ""buy and fit""?when you click it, a window opens and it list all the module available on the market at the lowest price, then you can click ""buy all and fit"" (or just ""buy all"" then you can use the ""fit"" button in the fitting browser) or buy just single modules (with a 'buy this' button next to every single module).it would save a lot of boring time imo.what do you think?"
10/4/2009,"that would be cool, so i have a pvp ship fitting saved, and i realize i need it now, so i get the whole thing in few seconds in case i just need the ship asap."
10/4/2009,just no.
10/4/2009,the only ship i'll allow is the one that pulls your ideas out of your head and allows others to gank them.*that was my subtle way of saying no
10/4/2009,anyone heard of mobile warp disruptors? no? must have dreamt that was what they were for then...silly me. oh and can i have a frigate that carries capital weapons? only i cant afford a dread...
10/4/2009,"i think what he is asking for is a ship you can put in the middle of space between two stargates so you pull people out of warp leaving them 0 chance of survival, yeah this seems totally balanced."
10/4/2009,"new players want to get into the action like anyone else. they'd like to hop into some of the cooler ships but skill training time stands in their way. i propose that when new (subscribed-not trials) players go through the tutorial mission in noob 1.0 systems they gain credits that can be used to rent a non-combat ship for x amount of time which is limited to the noob 1.0 system. the time rented/location/ship type would be limited enough to insure against abuse/gank/etc. perhaps 2 weeks of credits would earn you 2 hours of flight time or whatever. so, if i'm starting and earn enough credits i can trade it in for a hulk/orca/covops (renting ships like covops etc ship types would come pre-fitted not allowing players to refit weapons for example.) and try it out. ships available would be non combat for anti ganking reasons. this allows new players to get a taste of what they are training for and perhaps allow them to decide if this the path they want to train for. i'm sure there are ways to abuse this idea but that goes with most things."
10/4/2009,"im going to say no to this idea as the ships you are proposing are specialised t2 hulls. the tutorial already covers mining and industry and provides a mining frigate to try pew pewing some roids.i would say the tutorial needs to introduce new players to scanning and maybe point players towards certain hulls for different activities, the procurer for mining, cruisers for pve, cov ops for scanning, etc. this way new players will have some idea of the direction to head in and wont put them in overly specailised hulls like hulks/cov-ops.edit: i haz grammar and spellings"
10/4/2009,so the fanfest turned out to be a damp squib (information wise) so one wonders whats the big hold up with the much more important minutesskunk
10/4/2009,"to show you it is even worse, i am now a csm 3 members and i don't have the minutes of the meeting yet either. i would have expected to have gotten the raw version sent to me immediately after i was appointed as a replacement. they must be very ""special"" to have taken this long.issler"
10/4/2009,"since the election i havent really seen much from either ccp or the csm that either confirmes or denies any changes on whatever they promised during the election. from ccps side all i have seen is ""dominion this and dominion that"" and the only csm i have seen doing anything is csm larkis who get himself banned for something! whatever if the csm is going anything worth mentioning ccp doesnt really let that come to public anyway, so this system is more like mentioned before a popularity contest by attention *****s. it isnt us the players that need to stop whining, rather that csm start taking action and show the players who voted for them that they actually tries anything of what they promised."
10/4/2009,you know what is funny is that csm term limits also has more support within ccp then you would expect. it probably has something to do with the fact that first-timers are somewhat not very good at contributing because they have to deal with the fact that there is all this new csm rules to learn.this forum and you posters in this forum is also a pretty terrible measure of player opinion. its also hard to get the message out to your concerns because all we can do is post things that end up getting drowned out by more posts by trolls and or people who are mad for little good reason. i get most of my measure of player opinion from my corpmates and forums that arent the assembly hall because this forum is the caod equivalent for the csm.
10/4/2009,b/c captcha doesnt ruin forum experiences right?
10/4/2009,"you mean like captain above youit just really annoying going on many of the different forum sections and still having to wait for the 5 minute timer, i dont want to spam the forums anymore i just want to reply to many topics on different section of the forum , after this i am going to c&p having to wait there then to gd and having to wait there then test server feed back after having to wait again. will be happy for a 1 or 2 minute but 5 minutes is a bit much . plus how do you get past the forum times captain"
10/4/2009,"agreed, it sucks."

10/4/2009,"the dev blog said that submissions would open on the 1st of october...but as far as i can tell, they haven't yet? am i just going to the wrong page?"
10/5/2009,/support
10/5/2009,i like it
10/5/2009,"i'd support this given the following restriction:drone / fighter repair operations take a considerable amount of time, i.e. 5 minutes or more, and they need either minerals that get used up in the process or spare parts."
10/5/2009,not much else to be said.
10/5/2009,"i think, repair rate shoud be 10% for hull and 20% for armor per minute for all drones in dronebay (no maintenance deck). or 2%/4% as basic and +80% repair rate per level of skill."
10/5/2009,"fully supported. it might be a good idea to create a nanite paste bay that this ability draws from which would need to be periodically replenished. possibly even a module connected to it, though i'm not completely sure about that. and i agree that different types of drones should be able to be moved in to the bay, and returned to their original groups after their trip to the infirmary.in support of this new ability that seems such an obvious thing to have, could we also please make it possible to check on the status of our drones' health while they're in the drone bay? i get so tired of deploying fleets of drones just to see if anyone needs a band-aid."
10/5/2009,great idea!
10/5/2009,1
10/5/2009,"not a new idea, and one that certainly has its implications, but a useful and welcome change nevertheless (specially for those like me, who've had their friends reprocess their faction mods thinking it was garbage)."
10/5/2009,"supported, but if you're gonna do this, add a small tag of the faction logo and not some ugly ass crap that was posted in the op. i.e a small red tag with the blood raider logo on... if its at all possible to recognize. if logos are too big make a new smaller i.d for factions."
10/5/2009,"as someone who nearly reprocessed 10 amarr navy energized adaptive nano membranes while cleaning up my hanger, i fully support the op."
10/5/2009,"absolutely! the ui is terrible and even minor change would aid both handicapped and other players.edit: i work as a sysadmin in a design company that has a well respected interaction design department. if ccp doesn't have the resources or the ui skills to do this, i'm sure that there are many, including my company, who could do this. convo me in game or send me an evemail for my email addy if there is a need."
10/5/2009,supported this communtiy should not be left out of the best game online
10/5/2009,"recently i came up with a similar idea, i wanted to make my own thread about it much later but since you're allready on the same track i might aswell add my idea to yours.a couple of years back a study was done in the netherlands to try to find out how many people have self-harm issues. shockingly, the numbers they came up with is that 1 in 8 girls in there teens and 20s, and 1 in 30 guys of the same age admitted to it in their survey. using those numbers over a playerbase of 300.000, assuming most of them are guys, then eve would have 10,000 people with self-harm issues on average. however, i argue that the concentration is far higher in massive multiplayer games, since a lot of people who suffer from self-harm issues are drawn to these games. 10,000 people (on the low end of the estimation), that's a number worth thinking about, especially with that team you suggested in your original post.i'm a moderator on a self-harm forum, and have years of experience with them. and i can tell you, eve's learning curve doesn't help their self-image. however, your suggested team can do simple things to improve the situation.to name a simple example: if you have one list that keeps track of who's best in your game, you have one best player in one catagory of fields. if you have many lists, you have many number ones in various fields, meaning more people get to feel good about themselves. it's all about feedback.regardless of what people might think about people who have these sorts of issues, or even physical or other mental disabilities that makes life (also in eve) harder, their numbers are hard to ignore.i fully support your idea, and i hope you'll take mental conditions like the one i just described into consideration when expanding on it."
10/5/2009,very much supproted.
10/5/2009,for the win!!!
10/5/2009,"fanfest is over, many enquiring minds want to know how you got on."
10/5/2009,csm delegates: did you ask ccp about this ?(if not you fail and csm is useless)
10/5/2009,"fix the scanner, if you dont want to remove the delay just listen to the players, there's a lot of excellent feedback and ideas, just go and read.the current status is ******ed and just makes me want to quit the game everytime i get the annoying pop-up and take 10 seconds to scan 3 belts while all targets warp out.seriously it's the single most ******ed thing that was ever done. it's totally stupid and it's embarassing that you released that on the live server."
10/5/2009,"adapt or die?just sayin'. ""what's good for the goose is..."" and all that."
10/5/2009,is the scanner going to be fixed soon finally??
10/5/2009,"there is no adaptation to the handicap that has been placed on hunters.the situation is as follows:--jump in, 360 scan, target on scan (*usually a raven).--recalibrate scanner, narrow down in a direction of belts that likely hold the target and scan again--scanner is empty --rescan 360 degrees, scanner is empty because the pilot saw you in friggin local chat he has now warped and cloaked.ccp have stated that small gang and solo warfare should remain viable thoughout the changes they have made, and yet change after change they have handicapped the hunter to the point that now, if you go roaming, your effectively just going sight seeing as the chances of you catching a target have been reduced to near nothing.pretty much leaving you to engage defense fleets or assault fleets only. resource denial is a valid warfare tactic, and needs to be allowed to live on, or all you will have is blob on blob crap ass fights that are of a limited fun, and take hours of prep time.the scanner change has crippled the ability of an aggressor to wage resource denial on an entrenched sov holding body, by making it virtually impossible to catch someone in space if they are simply at their computer and paying attention to local."
10/5/2009,"according to ""forum that shall not be named"" ccp is decreasing timer to 1.3 sec and making button unclickable during that timer"
10/5/2009,"sweet bubbah, drop it already... you all spam the button and lag my game... gtf over it... or go play mine sweeper or something"
10/5/2009,"perhaps you know something that we don't, and have adapted in ways that the rest of us can't understand (your limitless intellect is shown in your post, so i'm obviously not doubting you..).i guess you have a way of finding targets that the rest of us obviously inferior creatures can't grasp, so perhaps you'll enlighten us on what it is.perhaps if they gave us a working functional scanner, or gave hunters back the ability to actually hunt things besides the ever present mass of ships that make up the blob we wouldn't be ""lagging your game"". also, since its your game, can we now forward all complaints about it to your inbox?"

10/5/2009,sure
10/5/2009,tie it into needing to be in a player corporation and you have my vote. pcs need incentives and this would work marvellously as it doesn't benefit the 1-man corp (has corp hangar division) as much as the multi-corp.
10/5/2009,could i suggest that you'd also incorporate idea of personal hangars which you could set permissions ie. 'pos access' or such so if you belong to a player corporation or an alliance who owns the pos you could see and use your personal hangar for blueprints at the pos as well instead of just corporate hangar.edit: small requirement could be that being able to access to your own 'pos'-hangar would require the corporation to have a office on that station. thus not making the corp hangars absolutely obsolete.- j
10/5/2009,"you have a point there.. what do you think about warp drive having sertain inaccuracy, like +/- 5km? either way, ven more options of range would be nice. currently warp drive is not surgicly precise either, it will warp you in somewhere withing 2km of the point you where warping to.actually bulky interface would not be that bad if the dedicated fc uses it to coordinate fleet action. however for 1 person we need something rather small, but i think everyone will agree that currently it is very hard to see what is going on on the battlefield."

10/5/2009,i can attest to this.currently the larger minnie boats are somewhat underpowered. and it prolly will take ccp a few iterations to get it right again and have another faction start whining about being nerfed too much.
10/5/2009,not supported. anything that may add to lag on warp\jump in is a big no no. even if i turn off the skins the fact that the server will have to still push those skins to each player on grid will still ultimately cause more lag for everyone involved. talk about an easily exploited grief mechanic.
10/5/2009,"well, if what a lot of people here are saying is true and it is indeed possible to be effective within weeks rather than months, then no game mechanics have to be changed. they just need to show new players that it can be done, and how."
10/5/2009,"what's with all the new player hate?every time a thread pops up about helping new players, it gets flamed and shot down by either csms or other players.are new players really that unwelcome?"
10/5/2009,get rid of learning skills so new players can put that 1.6m sp bonus to things that are useful to them now instead of training things that will help them train other things a month from now.
10/5/2009,"i'm against this proposal, but i welcome new players. we've taken completely new pilots into our corp and taught them how to survive and then thrive in eve. what new pilots need isn't an ""easy mode"" to get started. what they need is to stop hearing things like ""you must train all learning first!!!"" and ""you will be uselesss for months."""
10/5/2009,"no. new players are very welcome. i've run with many since back when i was a new player until now.the flaming in this and other threads is when new players think eve should = wow and want to purchase sp or whine because they can't pwn in the largest ships in the game. some new players wonder what's the deal, get it explained, and go on happily in their eve life. recently i chatted with a new player in my alliance that had some of the same concerns as in this thread. he left, too, but he left because he realized eve wasn't the type of game he really wanted to play, and he did so with a head on his shoulders.new players that just want to complain that they can't jump into a battleship just by grinding npcs and can't get over the non-wow aspect is the people that generally aren't welcomed."

10/5/2009,"perhaps you should learn to read before you practice replying. besides if you think you know who is an a large alliance with a huge amount of out of game coordination i think you been smoking to much of the wacky weed dude. i think the way this was pushed through the csm with no quorum (counting an absent member to make a quorum is an interesting interpretation of their rules) and very limited support. yeah, three supports and off to ccp it goes. wow look at the great representation the eve community has. reminds me of certain workers collective representation which always after awhile begins representing the collective representation rather than the workers. disband the csm!!!!"
10/5/2009,"of course it should be optional.not only does eve have an international customer base, the very definition of profanity changes so quickly that the overhead in maintaining an effective filter is not worth it.therefore, any profanity filter ia going to be just a gesture for those that want such a thing - for whatever reason. those who want to be free of such a gesture, or are just confused by it should be able to choose not to make it.supported."

10/5/2009,"there should definitely be an option similar to sisters of eve here.another option that could be applied to all factions might be to take consumer goods like antibiotics and consumer electronics and sell them at a lower price than the market demands, say 25%. the benefit to the player is getting bonus lps or a faction standing increase as a reward for effectively subsidizing their corporation of choice. this would create a bit of a demand and lots of market activity for these objects, and might serve as a test case for using them as part of a planet economy some time in the future, as has been suggested for new sovereignity and might be used in infrastructure development.this is also an effective way to pull some isk out of the game, if there is an incentive to sell for less than the item is worth."
10/5/2009,"this already exists after a fashion since some pirate factions will offer missions to kill others. for example, you can receive missions from blood raider agents to kill both serpentis and angels."
10/5/2009,"there are a few major faction pirate'ssansha'slocation: stain, system occupation: 132 systemsserpentislocation: syndicate, system occupation: 106 systemsguristaslocation: venal, system occupation: 95 systemsangelslocation: curse, system occupation: 50 systemsorelocation: outer ring, system occupation: 59 systemsthukker tribelocation: great wildlands, system occupation: 101 systemsblood raiderslocation: delve, system occupation: 12 out 97 systemswhy has such a large faction as bloodraiders soo little npc space? has it been forgotten? is it going to be fixed in the dominion patch?my proposal is that delve need to become npc space to make it inline with other npc pirate home regions. the dominion patch is the perfect oppertunity to straighten this out.troll away!!"
10/5/2009,"serpentis' home is fountain (although they have some agents in curse). while syndicate is npc space, none of it is serpentis sovereignty. fountain is an npc/player sov hybrid like delve.aside from that 1/10 on the troll."
10/5/2009,fountain: 7 npc systems out of 115 systems total. still the same issue... bloodraiders only have a few npc systems compaired to other faction.. serpentis have 106+7 systems
10/5/2009,funny how you chose delve as your region of choice.
10/5/2009,the main reason for personal wallet divisions is to have a 'savings account' to ensure you don't get completely fscked over by a market mistake. it's damn annoying having to log into my bank alt just to withdraw isk.
10/5/2009,hi all
10/5/2009,"i'm not sure there is any ""main"" reason, but certainly there are a multitude of uses to make life easier, which is why i think the game would be better with than without it."
10/5/2009,"actually, what he really wants is an orca you can cram a battleship into - a conundrum i found myself trying to solve last weekend. of course to be useful, you have to be able to put in two of them.unfortunately, it can't be done, at least that was the consensus me and several orca pilots came up with."
10/5/2009,you just have to squeeze the bs a bit and they fit into the orca. :p *scnr*
10/5/2009,"if i recall correctly ccp said at the time that the orca's size was on purpose, so it wouldn't fit a bs. of course now that they've made it so all but the angel(?) bs is 500k m3, so carriers can fit two they might look at making the orca fit a bs with room for a cruiser or a few frigs."
10/5/2009,i've said this many many times.allow the freighters to transport rigged ships.problem solved.no it's not perfect.... but it keeps the orca in its niche.
10/5/2009,lol..that's hilarious. i myself have seen orcas go through multiple times. it does indeed depend on the wormhole. but i see no need to reduce the mass of the orca. it seems balanced enough to me.--isaac
10/5/2009,"actually if you go to the following link, you'll find that the orca is just the ship that people advise on using to close down wormholes...link"
10/5/2009,don't waste your breath isaac... they are just crying to be crying.
10/5/2009,"i am waiting for them to start whining about the wormholes you can't take an orca into at all because the mass limit is too low.@op:this is the stupidest thing i have heard in a very long time. wtf does size have to do with anything? go find a loaf of bread and a chunk of concrete the same mass. tell me if they are even remotely the same size. (hint if you say yes, you're either a liar or a dumbass)."
10/5/2009,no.my corp intentionally uses orcas to force collapse some wormholes. sometimes we use it to force collapse an enemies high sec wh exit so they can't escape or enter.
10/5/2009,"the kill contract (or bounty or merc depending on which name you like better)works similar to a courier contract where you can make it public or private.target info:(individual or corp)only gives general info about target (not exact player/corp name to keep people from taking up the contracts on themselves or their friends) damage goal: total number of kills required to fulfill contract. (either on the individual or corp)reward: amount of iskies upon completiontime frame: # of days/weeks to accomplish goal to receive iskiesother info: ---any info the contractor would like to place here---examples:(individual)target info: male caldari player, home system (clone location?) of jitadamage goal: 12 shipsreward: 62 million isktime frame: 2 weeks(corp)target info: caldari corp (based off of race of founder), home system (hq location) of jitadamage goal: 50 shipsreward: 150 million isktime frame: 5 dayswhat do you think?"
10/5/2009,"how would the actual mechanics work and what would be acceptable targets for them? this idea isn't exactly new, so the details are what matter.it looks like this is just an official mechanism for merc contracts. for bounty contracts it would make sense if it would be built around the security status system and be limited in who you can target with them. as a dedicated bounty hunter it would also make sense, if you could avoid getting concorded for doing their job.if this is just for mercenaries, i got nothing against it and something like this would be nice to have."
10/5/2009,"with the introduction of dominion on the 1st of december and the proposed 11% tax on npc corporations this will cause a flood of one man corps through out eden. the 11% tax is a great idea but will not solve anything as alliances & corps will not war dec one man corps & under this situation there is no incentive to grow corps into any size at all.proposal- make all corps pay concord tax similar to alliance taxes & increase the cost of creating a corporation from 2million to 20million.if corp tax was based on the amount of members and the tax payable was on a sliding scale ie. 1-100 members 10%, 100-300 members 5%, 300-500 members 2.5%, over 500 members 0% tax. this is just an example and not probably what ccp would introduce if they were to incorporate this idea.if this idea was introduced alot of players both new and old would seek out the larger corps which will enhance the game for both. also alliances with extrememly small corps in them ie: 1-10 man corps it'll give an incentive to merge with the larger corps within the alliances.and finally any corps who do not pay the tax are disbanded and if this is done name shortage will not become a future big problem. ie: i wanted to use the name hidden empire for this corp but the name was registered to a 2004 player (one man corp) who's in my address book but in a year and a half i've never seen on ."
10/5/2009,"greetings,i can see your point and your personal cow too that is laying in the bottom of a pit so to speak, the idea you have has a valid stand points.however, considering different aspects of organizations ie. pirate corporation and other rather non empire based organizations it would be rather, funny, to pay some tax to concord or to anyone in the empire in that matter.and also there are a bunch of one man corps that are used for different things you could not want to be doing in the corporation that you might be in, due the current aspect how the game work ie. research and invention.as even you would want to do research on your current corp, but not to have those precious small antimatter charge bpo's in the pos modules, but instead resting safely in the station, you probably couldn't do that since you'd need a corp hangar access for that and when speaking of that someone else would have access to there as well. thus making your precious bpo's vulnerable for theft.what could be used for inactive corporations could be that you have a time counter that tracks the activity of a corporation and if not active the corp would go in a state of inactivity which after x amount of time would disband the organization. however, still the issue with shares would be have to be looked at.this solution would eventually open up the cool names that bring you fame and followers, probably a cake too, to be back in the pool so to speak.what comes to the issue non deccing one man corps, well, instead of having the lovely spam on the corp chat what you used to enjoy and be fond of in the npc corp, you would find a peaceful silence and most people would probably feel lonely too and perhaps try to seek out more members to their own venture or end up joining to some other organization for daily 5 oclock tea chat.but the point from your idea to get the inactive corps to fade into the oblivion is a good one and the inactivity timer would probably give some solution to it as well, although probably not all.and not everyone would enjoy playing in large corporations either - some larger corporations also can have the tendency to turn like the caod is now which, yuchh, is a quite horrible. the universe should be somehow related that people enjoy what they are doing and if someone enjoys playing as a lone wolf, let him if he gets most joy out of the game that way - don't see why the person should be punished for his or her enjoyment of the game just because he/she doesn't want to join some massive blob organization to play and try to have 'fun'. probably this method would only discourage people from playing the game that only way to have some sensible play it would be in 500+ member spam chatroom.best regards,- j"
10/5/2009,you bring up many valid points so maybe going down the road if all corps pay 1 million a month for the registration of the corp name and if its not paid in 6 months the corp becomes invalid (defunct). seems the easiest why both for players and ccp in incorporate.
10/5/2009,no. you dont want to nerf other people's game play even more. some people just dont want to be in multiple hundred player corps. for some people the 10men corp with their friends is more than enough.
10/5/2009,"darius i agreed to that, but having 100's of corp names taken up by inactive players is not an answer to this issue either so something has to put in place regarding this issue. but i gather nothing will be done till corp names are like this - @%$&*()(%^$ - because anything good has already been taken."
10/5/2009,hi maybe it has to be the longer you are in a npc corp the more taxes you have to pay.most players who realy want to play the game will find or create a corp with in 3-6 months
10/5/2009,no there doesnt have to be put anything in place. you got all those corps already. their number will just go up a bit. and even if you force them to merge. you will end up tons of bigger corps with too many inactive players.and normally a ceo does good in kicking any inactive people. especially when he doesnt know them well enough.and if it is just about corp names ... creativity always ruled. i personally consider the tax for npc corps stupid btw.
10/5/2009,as a member of a small and awesome corporation i do not support this idea.
10/5/2009,"why would you want to punish the many people who are playing the game with a bunch of friends in small corporations?adding a congregation tax like that would add no value whatsoever and make people vomit in disgust. just imagine if a government instated a rule that all cars must have a minimum of occupants when on public roads or the owner is slapped with a fat bill.thanks, but no thanks."
10/5/2009,this.
10/5/2009,"no! it's bad enough eve loses some the sandbox attribute when players feel they are being forced into making a player corp, or to join one. now you want to force that person to join a large corp?what's next? after the tutorial you'll be assigned to a player corp? come on guys, you won one, ease up for goodnesss sake."
10/5/2009,i agree that introducing npc corp tax(as it should be) will cause more 1 man corps. however i do not agree with the solutions op offers.my solution is:1. double the amount of wardecs you can have going.2. have a flat weekly tax on all corps. none of that percentage bs. enough tax so 1 man corps are hindered and 10 man corps are barely affected. something like 5-10 mil a week?
10/5/2009,"some people is rather terrible at arguing:- no one is forcing you to do anything, stop this bull**** argument (same with the 11% tax). there are plenty of isk sinks and taxes in the game and we all (some more than others) 'suffer' them (are necessary). if you want to keep a corp paying 1 mill. a month is not going to be a nightmare, if you really want it you will pay.- increasing the tax to create corps: long time due, seriouslly this would stop proliferatyion of stupid one-man corps, anyone else (including people who really does need to create a corp) will pay, as with much else in this game. i would leave exact quantity to ccp.alliance maintenance and creation should be probably increased too, due to the currency that major players move around now.variable maintenace bills: if all major corps/alliances should pay an higher bill, not the other way around. pay for the advatage of being bigger. my model would be somethign like: 10 players or less x isk/player; 50 players or less 0.8x isk/player; 100 or less 0.5x isk/player; etc."
10/5/2009,"so, now that ccp has given into the whines of hi sec pirates you begin to realize that this alone won't bring you targets en masse. so you move to step 2; force them from 1-man corps to multi-target corps. maybe we could ask ccp to paint bullseye targets on their backs to make it even easier for you to shoot them. we wouldn't want you to work for your kills now."
10/5/2009,"who is to decide whether some really does need to create a corp or not?there's nothing wrong with a one man corp, or a two man corp, or a 1000 man corp. there are many different reasons for wanting to form a corp, anything that acts as a barrier wouldn't be good.there is a lot of mention of inactive corps. if there are these flying around then they will likely have a number of outstanding bills for office rent. it wouldn't be too out of place to have a corp that is say 12 months behind on its headquarters to be wound up, the corp assets seized to pay for the outstanding rent, and the members placed into a random npc corp."
10/5/2009,"that. hhen you have a bunch of pricy bpo's, you can afford 5 mill a week."
10/5/2009,"proposing a solution to a problem that does not currently exist. i am not supporting this, but i would reconsider _after_ we've had dominion for a few months and we've been able to analyze any potential problems."
10/5/2009,"i do not support this at all. first of all we are trying to solve a problem that doesn't even exist yet. how the hell do you do that?and punishing small active or even semi-active corps is not the answer. i do not know what the answer is, but it is definitely not more taxes that make absolutely no sense in the game. a 0.0/low sec corp paying a tax to who??? care to explain how that would work within the cannon of eve?now, starwars: galaxies had a rule that once a guild was created, you had to get 5 (or 10?) members within a week or it was disbanded. something like that may work. but not charging corporations some bogus tax."
10/5/2009,"i don't even support going that far. there's nothing inherently wrong with very small corps. during low points the corp i'm with has been down to 3 members. those three were active and during that period we flew and acted together as a corp. other people don't want to war-dec tiny corps? that's a seperate issue, and maybe the war-dec system needs to be looked at, but the problem isn't the existance of small corps."
10/5/2009,i would say that even the wardec limitations are fine. you should not be able to wardec everyone and their mother.
10/5/2009,qft - and awesome sig!!
10/5/2009,not supported.
10/5/2009,"what limitations? you can currently wardec anyone who isn't in an npc corporation. you just have to do it three at a time.here's a thought: stop wardeccing people just to get your e-peen stroked, and you won't have this problem. (not directed at you darius ) but seriously, if a one man corp isn't worth your time, go find a bigger corp to fight. oh noes! i haz to makes choicez!"
10/5/2009,i am a peaceful industrialist. i don't even know about that war thing. i just supply goodies to shoot things.
10/5/2009,very much this...
10/5/2009,"war dec limitations? lol lmeao lmfeaorotf oh my, after several tries to get the war dec limitation raised to 6 or at least to 4 this is just to funny. i have found many one man corps to be quite profitable targets of war decs. perhaps you just don't recognize a target rich environment when you see one? or perhaps you don't have a clue how to make money off of a war? having caused hundreds of billions in damages from war and made over a hundred billion in profit from war, i can assure you that war in eve can be very profitable."
10/5/2009,thank you for proving my point -- the limit is fine like it is.
10/5/2009,"if you're in a corp and pay tax anyway, you shouldn't be able to be wardecced.why would you pay tax to concord for protection if they then wouldn't protect?"
10/5/2009,"well, i never pretended to give the best idea out there but i think that something should be done and talking about it is always good.i never heard about the idea you are talking about btw, do you have a link please?thx."
10/5/2009,"i agree. half-way good idea; bad motivation.individual hangers might be nice for sorting stuff....... but have we considered station vaults? you can set these to require a password, too, if i'm not mistaken."
10/5/2009,"named this thread to proposed as i suggested this in the community round table at the fanfest and hoping it doesn't just vanish into a black hole of nothingness.the caod as it is now and has been a quite long time - a garbage land inhabited with trolls - lacking the actual organization discussion or something worthwhile to read announcements from them.what was suggested that you'd have a spokepersons role in the corporation / alliance who would have the right to speak for organization that they represent and post on that forum which would (hopefully) bring quality back to the discussions and announcements.ofcourse this would bring out the issue 'hey i just create a new corporation called ****ingtrolls and grant my alt a rights to post there! ha! that will show them!'.well, what was proposed to this that the caod would be discussion and announcements for a bit more ""veteran"" corps (ie. x amount of time existing) - yes, you could have your evil trolls in the hood alt corp running for x amount of time and then jump in the spread chaos, troll poop etc all over the forum, although, your corporation would probably be banned after that completely.then, what about the junior, our new formed corporations and alliances? we could have a, for example, a forum called 'junior caod' where you could actually introduce your newly found corporation and alliance.throw it to the bloodthristy audience that lurks there - get your fair share of all the bashing and crap there is, which should be in some other forum (cry and whine here with cheese and arrow through my brain forum).probably after a while of the **** and crap there is to evolve to a bit more civilized discussions and announcements and take your place among the veteran caod forum.not only this would (hopefully anyway) introduce a bit more quality in the discussions, but also would give people something worthwhile to read and probably for the scope to get some juicy stories to write as well and give your (now a bit civilized) corporation / alliance name and fame amongst the people of the new eden.just some thoughts for brighter (and something worthwhile to read while at work) future,- j"
10/5/2009,"c&p is actually just as useless. they're both epeen extens0rz.c&p is for individuals and small corps, while coad is for large corps and alliances. what's good for one is good for the other.personally i say get rid/fix both or none. they both are crap."
10/5/2009,breaking up the circle jerk that was caod and bringing the level is discourse down to raw ****flinging is probably the best thing we've done for eve

10/5/2009,"apocrypha 1.0 and the updates that followed overhauled the probing system, simplifying it and making it more accessible to probers. but the improvements neglected the directional scanner, only one tab to the right from the probing system. the directional scanner should be radically overhauled as outlined here: linky"
10/5/2009,agree with most of this. go for it.
10/5/2009,"only thing i dont agree with is the whole 30 second for 360, whats the first thing when any pvp'er, scout, carebear, pirate does when he jumps over a gate in lowsec/0.0, he scans for any hostiles and targets.if you were to implement that, piracy will die, carebears will live..as fecking usual.i agree with moving it a bit and making it look nicer, maybe fix it so you can see the scan radius of say 30<U+FFFD>, other than that. its fine, aw and the whole au - km thing...."
10/5/2009,"lots of good ideas here. i like the d-scan on its own tab, but automatically updating it without the player spamming the key is attractive. i foresee ccp dreading the number of calls to the server that this would create and there should be some discussion of that, but largely in agreement with this.i'd also make sure that filtering of results was possible, and that low strength results not be fully identified (an excellent point).one other possible change to the system could be to give a visual of the ship's orientation on the d-scan tab and an arc indicating where the scan was being aimed. the arc would be sized according to the player's desire (through a drop down or by manual entry of the number of degrees), and could be grabbed with the mouse and manually aimed/rotated rather than tedious zoom out and back in after orienting."
10/5/2009,"reading your proposal im quite confused, aligning and repositioning your scanner to point @ celestials isn't hard. besides it's not the ship you have to align, its the camera, and holding down alt givs a nice crosshair. is that what you mean by ""aligning""?i like you integration proposals though."
10/5/2009,"himy corp is an empire production corp. 1 of the activities is selling bpc packs (for example caldari frigat pack of 6 frigat max run bpc's)on contract.it is a painstacking job to sellect the bpc you want in a contract, discribe the items in the contract,prize it and put the contract out because at any time we have about 120 of those packs outstanding.now my request is: is it possible to make a save function in contracts so 1 don't have to do these stapsover and over again instead looking trough a saved list and pick the contract setup you want.provided you have the items in your corp or personal hanger."
10/5/2009,"if you had read through the wall of text, you'd know the op did not propose there be a cap of allowed titans, just that something terrible happens to titans after a certain number has reached. lets say the limit is 4, and defending alliance has 4 titans in system. when attacking alliance b cynoes in a titan, alliance a has 4/5 chance of something terrible happening to their titans, while alliance b has 1/5. area of effect weapons are terrible on the server, yes, but i can't think of better ways of dealing with blobs."

10/5/2009,"ooh very good idea, seconded."
10/5/2009,trying to manage anything out of game is impossible without this. give new accounts api access.
10/5/2009,"since apocrypha i noticed a new and rather anoying feature cp added that prevents you from undocking if your ship is fitted with modules that the powergrid cannot support. the dialog box claims that this is for ""saftey"" reasions but i call bull**** it is a usless feature that only serves to make it harder to move fittings in smaller ships. in the olden days i used to fit strip miners to my friggates empty slots because they could not fit in the cargo hold and i am certain i am not the only person that does this i held my toung when ccp changed the way they worked so they only fit on mining barges. but now when i cant even undock because i put on a large shield extender on my daredevil when it wouldn't fit in the hold i understand that ccp may see it as an exploit but in reality it is no different from strapping a bike to the back of a car it serves no balancing purpose and is a purly surpflous function added by gm's who dont have anything better to do with their free time than harrass people"
10/5/2009,"step 1) build a ton of doomsdays. step 2) put eight on a destroyer, put destroyer into carrier sma. step 3) repeat 2) until sma is full. step 4) congratulations! you are now transporting many tens of billions worth of minerals in one jump-capable ship. (yes, people actually did this.)this won't change back. really, it doesn't need to either - you're allowed up to double your pg in modules equipped, which means you can have two complete legal fits on your ship without breaking anything. the fact that you can't use module slots to transport items far too big for your ship is exactly the point - you're not supposed to be able to. you want to move strip miners around, get a barge or a hauler. you can strap a bike to the back of a car with no difficulty. the problem is, you're trying to strap a car to the back of a bike. good luck with that."

10/5/2009,"could someone on the csm suggest that the actual date be put at the top of the raw logs and the meeting minutes themselves when they are posted? labeling them using the format ""3.008"" is decidedly unhelpful and incomplete when you are wondering when exactly the discussion took place."
10/5/2009,"short answer - yes!the csm definitely can effect eve in both good and bad ways. the csm has the opportunity to directly interface with ccp in a 1:1 manner that can definitely change how they think. the csm can also help keep ccp ""honest"" by being a set of player ""eyes"" to review ccp actions when scandals occur. so you can choose to believe this or not but i can tell from direct experience these are the facts.my advice is not to ask ""does the the csm serve a purpose?"" but ""how do i make sure it is as effective as it can be for making eve a better place for you?"" how do you do this?participate! study the candidates, make them clarify their stands on issues. make them state clearly why they are running and what they expect to do if they are elected! then when they are elected follow what that do and hold them accountable! if they what the bring up as issues or how they voted is inconsistent with what they promised you when they ran call them out! if a scandal occurs and they remain silent should ccp make decisions you don't agree with then call them out! they promised you when you elected them to serve your interests, make sure they honor that promise!or better yet, run! be part of the process by joining the csm! but if you do please take it seriously!issler dainzecsm2, csm3, csmx"
10/5/2009,"to the op and all the naysayers: if you don't think the csm is acting on behalf of the player base nor accomplishing anything, i suggest a reading comprehension course.that said, communications from csm to players is sparse and somewhat poor--particularly regarding meeting minutes. it annoys me that it takes so long to learn what was discussed in csm meetings--especially the ones that take place in iceland. from the perspective of expectations management, regular official status updates--even if no progress has been made in the minutes getting through ccp's review process--would be nice. they could be put in maz's sticky in assembly hall for ease of tracking.edited to add: from my perspective, the opinions of people who can't be bothered to participate in the csm process by either voting or running for the csm carry far less weight than the opinions of those who embrace the concept of csm and do what they can in order to try and improve it through tangible action."
10/5/2009,i would like to get by it ='(
10/5/2009,eee i know how to get round it now =)
10/5/2009,no more details?does that mean csm was not involved in current sov overhaul scheme at all?
10/5/2009,"so when the discussions are in the form of ""brainstorming"" it is hard to point at specific items. ccp opened the discussions with some high level concepts and then we openly brainstormed how they might become real in game. specific things we did stress were that poss needed to be removed from the sov mechanics, that we wanted to be able to do ""more"" with our space and that we were really excited by the idea we could improve the quality of our space if we had sov.in the case of the csm 2 the ideas were still very much in the early stages of formulation so no specific implementation was discussed.i wish i could point at ""feature x of the new sov was the csm's doing"" but you have to remember, the csm is not intended be where specific detailed feature designs originate. that is what ccp does for a living. when we do discuss features and game changes we are expected to be more general in our description of the problem or opportunity.i am sure there had to be some discussion of the sov changes with csm 3. once they recover from fanfest maybe they can share something about that here in this thread.issler"
10/5/2009,"the brainstorming as i know it and use, is not a constructive discussion. it is a sophisticated method to seek for new ideas, inspiration and possible solution."

10/6/2009,"proposal:create a new web strength amplifier module.this mod would be a low-slot item. only one could be equipped per ship (like a dcu).it would be supported by a skill further amplifying its effect. at level v, the mod + the skill bonus would make webs roughly 80% strength (compared to 60% without the mod/skill).why?an 80% web would un-nerf the huginn/rapier and make them fair compared to all other recons. currently amarr have recons that can cap-**** any other ship in seconds. caldari still have recons that can totally remove 2-3 ships from a fight. gallente have scram out to 20km + which is now uber.an 80% 10km web would not be overpowered on the average pvp ship, especially if it had to give up a damage mod or tank mod to do it. an 80% 35km web is not over powered on a minmitar recon that has no other useful purpose and would give up speed in exchange.in fact, this would be a great addition to the game, and add exciting new trade offs to pvp."
10/6/2009,amen.really csm deligates....... how did you think that would fly?after seeing the massive objections on the forum....... then continuing to *not* explain your reasons to the general public......amazingly brash. think this shows that we very much *do not* want these same candidates if this is how they behave.
10/6/2009,1
10/6/2009,"mazzilliu, if your going to update this to the csm how about putting the player input into the answer. for example:cons: - allows large corporations to abuse the csm system - allows ccp staff to abuse the system - reduces flow of ideas and processes leading to a power struggle - creates more tension for ccp which it doesn't need right now - likely to cost more than it's value (ccp investing to get new ideas and thoughts rolling) - gives a lot of players the incentive to become a csm member for the wrong reasons - may indirectly impact other volunteer programs which receive no special incentives - on general principle, makes the csm members think they can rule the world...perhaps next you want to scrap the election process while your at it - half the eve population doesn't know about what csm is, does or receives from ccp in terms of benefits"
10/6/2009,"quoting a qft, posting in an epic fail thread, and...completely...utterly opposed to the ideas presented."
10/6/2009,is there a way to impeach mazz for being a total idiot in ignoring the obvious lack of support?
10/6/2009,"unfortunately, no. we can simply think of this as the asshat csm and (hopefully) not have a repeat in the future. unfortunately, the good things this particular csm have done will forever be drowned out by the idiocy of the last six months, which is unfortunate. the current members of the csm who can run again are going to be tainted by association."
10/6/2009,"there are plenty of remedies to correct this atrocity however the problem is after the first few posts csm stopped looking at this issue, probably because of the one week time frame to be considered for csm submission. at any rate, here's a few fixes: - update the evelopedia file with proper information, not your fantasy version - remove the information from the submission pile provided it hasn't already been processed"
10/6/2009,"this issue passed in the csm. you have three other delegates to thank, not just mazz.i don't think i'd want to go so far as to impeach or recall mazz, as (s)he's done a lot of good work on the csm...but this particular issue has been handled very badly. there are also no hard rules on how an issue needs to be proposed to the csm, so while this may be a rather disappointing incident, there is technically nothing ``wrong'' about it.all you can do is remember who voted to pass this issue when it comes time for voting."
10/6/2009,"complete crap. three csms have just guaranteed they will never get a vote from me. i encourage just about everyone to take this stance. even if they pass this nonsense, make sure they don't benefit from it."
10/6/2009,"ccp still has final say. it is, in fact, their game...their rules. they can decide to completely ignore whatever the csms have done on this matter, should they choose to.still, i already know who i'm voting for. his home corn liquor brew sold me."
10/6/2009,"ah yes... let's all thank the egotistical ""i got boobs"" (no offense to de of course) lets make a proposal and vote it in with less than 3 supports for making such a stellar farce of this csm term.yes... much good to be had here.i'm glad you love this sort of thing.. it's no wonder the csm have a hell of a time retaining any sense of decency let alone respect when there own ####ing people ignore the ####ing public.normally i always back them... but this... is crossing the line.hell i'd say this is worse than lark... at least he had the guts to fess up to it (sorta kinda)."
10/6/2009,fuck yeah
10/6/2009,"yes but i gave a thought to something else.that is mission, i thought for the belt and plex npcs.and other thing 0.0 rats why give for players security standings ? no concord there. not decreasing when someone shoting to someone, but increasing when shot the npcs ? that's need to change to npc pirate faction standing change."
10/6/2009,that is exactly the point! you shouldnt take those hits. you keep your empire faction standing to run missions there if you get kicked out of your region at some point.
10/6/2009,its were u get your bounties for right? its were u get your lp's for right? its why u earn 45m p/h right?no penalties for farming tons of isk in the safety of empire? if ccp implement this im going to quit eve with my 5 accounts. not supported wow --> way
10/6/2009,yes
10/6/2009,you realise this proposal is designd to allow people to move to 0.0 and mission out there but otherwise cant because they nerfed the hell out of there pie faction standings while living out in empire.also supported as missioning is slighly less boring than going round and round and round the belts in a trance when your skint or theres nothing going on and i cant run local mish because i nerfed my standing to hell while doing the empire thing lol
10/6/2009,"i agree with this sentiment. buying your way with isk i don't like, but some betrayal mechanic should exist to show the pirates you're really with them.again, though, choices have consequences. this should do something like turn the +8 caldari standings to -8, or something equally as drastic. if you're going to betray your faction, they won't like you. the pirates will also require that you've not run missions for their enemy or shot at any other their ships for at least a month. (how are they going to trust you if you're still shooting them down?) a negative sec rating could also be required, also to prove you are really a pirate. something that will get you shot down if you go into high sec systems (at least 0.7 and above).there could be some isk, as a bribe to the agent, but the above faction effects would be more worthwhile, as those standings take time. you could have more challenges (to prove your worth), such as taking on fleets of empire navy ships in a mission in low sec.but not a simple payout and cool off. if you really want those pirate standings, you can't be working for the empire any more. also, you should know that the empire won't take you back, probably ever. pirates betray people. caldari, or your race, won't trust you again after you've betrayed them, though."
10/6/2009,i agree with these proposals. who cares if you have to pay isk to bribe your way to neutral standing? that isk leaves the game and its actually rp appropriate.

10/6/2009,"i support this op 100%, but i also support the idea of a web strength amp mod. see:"
10/6/2009,"i seem to remember a point in time at which there were rumours about a low security sovereignty system. i suppose this developed into factional warfare eventually, but to the point:low security space is the unfortunate middleman of space in eve. high security has concord and wardecs, nullsec has its own player-run empires, and wormhole space has no local and the routes to and from it fluctuate, whereas lowsec is an area in which most pvp will get you flagged, local is present, and you cant set up systems by which you can easily lock it down.now, before the whines start im not proposing we do any of the following: remove local, allow bubbles or remove sentries. none of that. has been done to death, and the answer is typically an overwhelming no.what i suggest is that ccp make low security space the new black market for babies, organs, drugs, biomass and baby organs. simply put, make low security space different from high, null and w space, rather than a mix of all three. perhaps put a sov system in place that provides economic bonuses for those who hold sov, like whats presently proposed for nullsec on a smaller scale. increase the incidence of gas clouds, allow implant manufacturing there etc. etc.another suggestion i remember seeing was to delay local by a short period of time. maybe something like 30 seconds to 2 minutes. the gate crews are probably understaffed and underpaid, and itd add to the danger of the whole place somewhat, but not to a huge degree.this is by no means a properly thought out list of ideas, it's a call for improvement in that area.tldr: create incentives for players to visit and establish themselves in lowsec other than pvp. make it unique."
10/6/2009,"while i don't know if any of what he suggested is sensible, lowsec definitely needs a revamp. right now, gate and sentry guns, as well as the gcc, only encourage big ship warfare as opposed to discouraging whatever it is they were meant to be discouraging."
10/6/2009,"assault frigs, projectile weapons, capital hybrid turrets, destroyers... the csm has raised and argued about a lot of various balancing issues already, and there's still a lot more floating around. what i want to do with this thread is poll the forums for which issues that have not already been raised in a csm meeting are really annoying the hell out of you. just list your #1 complaint with a certain ship, weapon system, module or whatever to help us prioritize our list of issues."
10/6/2009,#1 lachestis... wtf missiles?#2 keres... is it usefull with only 2 dampers?#3 arazu.. uhm dampners s**k cause u need atleast 3 #4 sin.. t2 battleship that is even worse than a battlecruiser#5 gallente destroyer.. a rifter is even better#6 gallente ships could use some extra cap or power grid in general because of the use of blasters. a blaster ship without mwd = dead and a mwd ship without capbooster = fail. #7 black op can use some more power grind in general#8 cover op jump portal generators uses 1500 powergrind on a ship that has a bonus for it? whats that all about?
10/6/2009,"i may be going over some of the stuff you already raised, but will post anyways.rockets. torpedoes were boosted to be useful in pvp, then hams were introduced while rockets have been unchanged.tech2 short range ammo. is useless compared to faction ammo. tech 2 guns take quite a bit of training and cost more powergrid/cpu than t1 and only get a 8-10% damage bonus from the spec skill. maybe change t2 short range ammo from high damage/terrible tracking to decent damage/awesome tracking, i dunno whatever.it's also really annoying how the sabre is leagues above every other interdictor in the game so much that the sabre is insanely expensive. boost the other dictors, plox. i know you raised t1 destroyers, how about t2 as well?"
10/6/2009,tengu (and to a lesser extent the proteus) seem to be completely out of whack compared to the other t3 ships in usability. those 2 either need nerfing (boo) or the other 2 need boosting (yay).from my own experience and chatting to others it pretty much boils down to the tengu/prot being able to both tank and do serious damage where the others need to make a choice between gank/tank.
10/6/2009,"to be fair to the proposal, it's always been the blood home region, and those dozen npc systems sitting in the middle of it are a big part of why it's so defensible, along with providing a good source of player-level income a lot of 0.0 space doesn't get. delve is the mecca of 0.0 in large part because of the blood bits. still, the game just came out of a three year long war over who would own that region. it doesn't seem quite right to call the whole thing off after it's over. not to mention the lynch mobs the players would organize based on claims of ""ccp would have done this years ago, except bob owned the space then"" and so on. it's not necessary, and it's not justifiable. no support."
10/6/2009,"delve and querious is going to be splitted among many small aliances/corps after dominion sov-changes anyways, because of good rats there.we have enough npc-0.0 there, no more is needed.fck the time flux"
10/6/2009,"war or no war, it has nothing to do with my proposal, its not inline with other npc homes regions and amount of npc space from other factions. this wouldnt have been able to be changed in the past because sov is very important (and now all sov will go down anyway). dominion gives the perfect oppertunity to straighten this bug out and show us (the eve players) that we are all equal and no alliance gets any benifit above others. strangly u can say exacly the same from the ferrogell exploit wile it was still undetectend and u owned a few posses that exploited this bug"
10/6/2009,battlestars has valiantly kept the blood raiders at bay.
10/6/2009,"depends how you count, really. the blood are low on sovereign systems, but in terms of settled systems, they actually beat the guristas pretty handily, and aren't too far behind the serps and the angels. yeah, they're on the low end of the five, but it's not so low that they're in obvious need of repair. and no, no alliance is getting any benefit over others. you want delve, go take it. you're seriously trying to compare different npc factions being different with a massive and economy-wrecking exploit being abused? that's moronic."
10/6/2009,"syndicate belongs to the intaki syndicate, not seprentis.also for example, mordus legion live in pure blind but only hold sov over one system."
10/6/2009,"what im trying to say is that all the major factions have npc space to float around in and blood raiders only have 7 systems. srry if i wasnt clear enough my native langish isnt english. ore, thukker and mordus arnt exacly large factions, they dont even have officers"
10/6/2009,"rather than perscribe a particular remedy in which the forest gets lost in the trees, simply this...that the csm:1. acknowledge the likely hood of a proliferation of small corporations after the change to the npc tax rate.2. acknowledge their consituents desire to be able to start legitimate corporations wihout using a character randomizer because all of the names they wanted, and all of the sensible variations there of, are taken up.3. realize a fair number of corps are simple placeholders. while using a character to keep a corp open and name reserved isn't bad, squatting shouldn't be indefinitely free.4. ask ccp to commit to developing an elegant solution to the issue which allows players to continue this practice as long as they are active and paying attention but closes the corporations of purely inactive characters to allow for the growth of the community.my personal take is that hq's should have a tax similar to offices which can over time bleed a corporation out if no one is around to fill the coffers and click the button. perhaps someone else or even ccp proper can develop a more elegant solution, which is why i ask the csm to take up this issue and raise its importance to ccp rather than debate and advocate a specific mechanic to fix it."
10/6/2009,"interesting idea, but how would ccp be able to tell that an inactive character's permanently inactive? people do take very long breaks from eve, after all. i like the idea of ""automatic rent"" (tax) for all rented offices that the corp has. once the corp wallet is exhausted and rent can no longer be collected, the corp members could be booted to the npc corps and the corp auto-closed. but...kf a corp is closed, does the name become available for others to use?anyway, i'll be interested to see the discussion on this topic. if a well thought out suggestion for a solution is made, i might support it."
10/6/2009,solution for a non existant problem. not supported
10/6/2009,"city of heroes had a system in place where if someone's character was inactive for over half the year, their name would be up for grabs by new players. if they resubscribed after that, if that name was chosen by a new player, they were given the ability to choose a new name.this was necessary because folks would often create level 1 characters to reserve names, should they decide to roll a new concept character to play with. however, most never did use them, and it became a bit of a problem until that was implemented.if corporation names end up being a problem with the npc tax system, i think a couple lines of code to account for that would be more than enough to suffice, and ultimately also wouldn't have any of the negatives that a tax might induce."
10/6/2009,this.
10/6/2009,"i think that the potential increase in the number of one or two person corps is a relevant concern. however, no one wants to be too heavy handed before the problem actually materializes. the automatic billing proposal seems pretty reasonable, though.what concerns me with the potential for all of these corps popping up is the premium that offices will be at, and the increase in costs because of that. i'm sure ccp has already considered this and concluded that it just pushes more little corps together, and that's what their aim is, to get people interacting. we'll see what happens though. i'm not concerned enough to propose something be done before seeing the scope of the issue."
10/6/2009,"yep, this"
10/6/2009,valid reasoning... but a very very very very very very very low priority issue... and at best non-existent.not supported.
10/6/2009,"the point being that the orca would be less dense due to the fact it's designed to hold large amounts of items which means that much of the space is filled (when empty) with space. the orca is like your floating piece of bread as bread has pockets of air. something more dense would be something like a carrier or even a battleship which is laden with armor, weapon, and redundant electronic systems. it's amazing to see so many people have issues with changing things. i'm curious as to what your ulterior motive is. is it because you also use the orca for shutting down wormholes or is it because you are against anything any industrial player asks for? you have attacked the logic behind the ship design itself but you have given no indication why you would oppose such a change in the game (how would this negatively impact you should this proposal be accepted)."
10/6/2009,what we have issue with is your incesesant whining and crying.we have no issue with the system.the orca is fine as it is... its a sturdy ship and it serves us whs explorers/miners/industrialists just fine.in all honesty its a bit stupid to use the orca for the sole purpose of killing a wh... a battleship with armor plating would be far more effective.maybe its time you should stop playing in the sandbox (class 1) and start working in class 2's and 3's so you don't have the problem of killin wh's.additionally... its a valid tactic to slam the door on people who invade areas of whs that are claimed... and since its 0.0.. anyone can do whatever the #### they want to do with it.don't like it? then move along kiddo... because this isn't going to change a single bloody thing.if it wasn't the orca you'd be picking on an another ship and asking to have it's mass lowered as well.the issue is you... not the orca.capiche?
10/6/2009,you could always kill the orca if your problem is wormholes shutting down.....
10/6/2009,"you still haven't stated what issues you have with the proposal. instead you dodge around the issue and make attacks on me because you're unable to justify a real reason besides saying ""you are the problem."" let's not degarde the issue into childish banter. personal attacks is simply a childish means of deflection. stay ot please."
10/6/2009,"frankly, this wouldn't impact me one way or the other, since the wormholes i frequent are too small to get an orca through the begin with.and speaking as an industrial player, my opposition to this change is because there's no need for it, aside from your whine in this thread. and since i don't see a long line of people in here supporting it, i'm guessing there aren't a lot of other people who see the need for it either.sometimes people who don't support your ideas do it because it's a bad idea, not because we have an ulterior motive. seriously...paranoid much?"
10/6/2009,try reading first off.secondly... try listening.but since i have to spell it out to you since your such a whs noob... fine then.1: your obviously lack experience if you keep having trouble with orca's getting in.as i've clearly indicated... step it up to class 2's and 3's... problem solved.2: you want to lower the mass of the orca for whs transitions but in reality the real problem is mass itself. to what end would this accomplish? more entrances and exits with orca's? what's your real motivation and not this pathetic excuse you've given us. as i said... if i was going to kill a wormhole then get some real mass... a battleship for example.in addition... just because no one can come up with a obvious drawback (in your delussionary world) to your proposal doesn't mean we are stupid and your ideas is the best.the point is as i've said many times before.... this is a waste of time... and your whining over nothing.whs is supposed to be unstable... unpredictable... risky... yet rewarding.not everyone is going to figure it out.i suggest you take a step back... and start doing a little bit more homework and alot less griping.nothing irritates me more than hidden/veiled proposals.mass smass.... your up to something else here.
10/6/2009,"actually i was just making the proposal in hopes that the orcas would be able to make more trips through the wormholes and be able to traverse the lower class wormholes as well. i have no other motive than to be able to use a ship for its intended role. also, a battleship currently has much less mass than an orca so closing a wormhole will take longer with a battleship. i have no issues with people using orcas to close wormholes although i believe that this may be why some oppose the proposal. it's cheaper to lose an orca than a carrier."
10/6/2009,i give up... this guy is hopeless.
10/6/2009,"i like the idea, but if you don't moderate it correctly people would just use their alts to get a ""kill / grief anywhere"" license. and.... that'd not be good.tbh i don't see how it could work."
10/6/2009,"there's enough things for mercs to do that aren't purely killing(protection, suppression, etc) that i'm loath to run it through a contract system that only includes kills. also, kills as a raw count is an awful system - ""hey, player1, just took out a merc contract on you for 100 mil. let me pop a dozen shuttles and i'll split it with you"" is hardly what we want to encourage. i appreciate the attempt, but i don't think that this is the right way."
10/6/2009,"ok, i'm just going to go ahead and say it because i think some are missing the obvious. 1-man corps do pay taxes. the ceo collects that tax however hell he wants to and spends that tax however hell he sees fit, whether it's buying its members (ie, the only member ) ships, mods, whatever the hell the ceo of that corporation wants to do with that tax. so why in the world would you want to add another tax to 1-man corps?would it make you feel better if all 1-man corps were forced to set a corp tax of 50%? as the ceo they'll still have access to that tax money and it will still belong to the ceo . so in the end it's the same amount of isk but in two different wallets.stop trying to ""fix"" something that needs no fixing. s'all."
10/6/2009,go wardec noir. or goonfleet or some other large alliance/corporation.oh wait... you cant because you wouldn't win or make profit.yep... make sense to me.
10/6/2009,they shoot back . of course he wouldn't want to wardec 'em.
10/6/2009,"the reason the tax is being implemented is to make it so that the wardec immunity provided by npc corps doesn't come free. one player corps aren't immune to wardecs. it might be slightly annoying to have a million of them buzzing around, but it's not actually a problem, and even if they never group up, it'll have done its job."
10/6/2009,bingo... amongst other things.
10/6/2009,you miss the point. its corp names thats the real issue im getting at. in a few years under the present dominion expansion finding a name will be a real problem. the idea is to weed out the inactive corps so there ticker names be added back to the pool. and btw on my alt noir wouldnt be a problem and you go and dec the goons.
10/6/2009,"can feel your pain, people have been swimming in the **** of trolls so long that they have been morphed into them. no one really bothers actually to read the posts anymore - just pick one random thing in the posts and start going at it and ignore everything else.- j"
10/6/2009,"why? you can't think something original for your corp name and suffer because the name you want is already taken?i am against the recycling of even dead corps name. after a name is chosen it should be linked to that corp and only that corp. if you want to use a dead corp name do at least the minimum work to call it ""new xx"" or ""refounded xx"".having 99 of dead sparta corporations and one alive because a lot of people enjoyed the film will create a lot of confusion about who was in what corporation."
10/6/2009,"funny that drake as i see you in forums constantly but i never see you logged on. i guess you do your fighting in forums ""troll""."
10/6/2009,i find myself looking for alot of the same things on contracts constantly just to check prices of certain items and rather than keep putting the item name in and selecting from a list i wonder if it would be possible to implement a quickbar of sorts for contracts so a person can immediately look up something from a list of favorites.thoughts?
10/6/2009,"bumped for a breath of fresh air and a windbags prerogative.after further thought, i'll readress this topic w/o adding it back to the op.the sec status link had 3 major effects. 1 it affects empire wars. it's easy to travel 4 jumps if you have no wars, it becomes more challenging if you aren't so lucky.2nd, it affects time/reward value. especially for 0.0 players, is it really worth going to empire every time to insure a ship at a higher value? for a lot of players, it's not even worth 2 jumps. if that were not true, you wouldn't see a varied market price from system to system on the average mods.3rd, it affects piracy. it's easy to move a bs to 1.0 with good security status. but it penalizes people who live a life of crime. and quite honestly, why shouldn't it."
10/6/2009,remove insurance alltogether imo
10/6/2009,"i agree, insurance has a number of flaws, but they are not critical, your system just is not going to work.pvp is already very expensive, especially for the new players. what i would like to see is insurance varying depending on what modules you have installed, and maybe some kind of insurance for t2 gear and ships."
10/6/2009,"i think that this is, on face, a great attempt at fixing insurance scamming. i'm in full support of not giving payouts, even the 40% base payout, to gate gun/concord/self destructs. also like the idea of shortening the premium times.but if insurance is designed to encourage pvp, then the penalty for losing ships will start to play against that. i like the mechanic itself, eventually you will be prevented from doing something you're bad at financially or a lot of isk will leave the game. so how about this compromise:the lower the sec rating of the system where you lose your ship, the more forgiving your insurance history becomes. instead of the model being ""you went to a dangerous place and that was stupid,"" it shifts to ""thank you for losing your ship in a dangerous area, rather than doing so in our highly civilized highsec systems.""this lets pvp go and be pvp. it also means that if you want to shoot your ship up because it's about to be uninsured, you can take it to a lower sec system if it might affect your insurance history. and if it's gonna end up dead anyway, why not have some fun there and ""drive it like you stole it"" rather than just having a friend or local pirate shoot it? lower rate of profit oriented insurance scamming, more traffic to lower security systems, isn't this what ccp has been trying to effect?"
10/6/2009,1
10/6/2009,"yeah, brilliant idea. all they have to do then is just read out the stored password from a file."
10/6/2009,"to be honest, i don't bother with the rest of the forums and find it difficult sometimes with this one when you have trolls just shutting down ideas without providing honest feedback. ccp clearly doesn't monitor these forums and so nothing occurs.that said, it wouldn't be a bad idea for them to seek volunteer moderators to clean up ill responses as they are so numerous and need a lot of folks cleaning them up. after so many reports from a volunteer moderator, a senior steps in to determine the situation and if necessary ban them.presently, this can't be happening because the trolls are still around."
10/6/2009,"once again, cheers for your insightful knowledge drake, dismiss an issue without giving any helpful feedback or, in your words, foresight.the bounty system is already exploited and this new system does not ensure that faction loot will drop when you kill a spawn. the idea is to make it a random chance with the majority of spawns being difficult, deadly and threatening to pod you if you get caught. they won't be like ratting at all, more like either between ratting and wormholes or like wormholes in difficulty (without the system disadvantages ofcourse).so, i put forth once again that you have dismissed an idea without having your own foresight...as your a forum troll and devote 10 seconds to each post. if only forum administrators made a new rule for exactly that behaviour..."

10/6/2009,"good ideafor the meeting minutes we are waiting for, perhaps 14/02/2010 might be an appropriate dateskunk"
10/6/2009,"there has been some discussion about changing the process so that the ""final"" minutes are approved as the meeting goes on. basically after every topic the portion related to that topic get read back and approved right then. that would allow the minutes to be almost immediately released. i hope the csms of the future adopt something like that.issler"
10/6/2009,"excellent summary. at least the forum whining (from the csms) was interesting to read when jade was involved. now i feel like i'm reading some horrible deviantartist justify why their non-art is actually art and how everyone else is wrong, without ever providing any facts to back it up outside of ""i know something you don't! nyah, nyah, nyah!"". the egos of most of the csm posting in this thread are precisely the example of why they are not fit for the job. according to modern leadership theories, good leaders (which they fall under the definition of) have words such as ""coach"" or ""servant"" or ""humble"" or ""able to listen to viewpoints directly opposed to their own"" attached to them. unfortunately, they're as hard to find on internet games as in the real world.emphasis mine."
10/6/2009,"i read sun tzu<U+FFFD>s art of war and quote from it continuously. i think this makes me fit to lead. i have also read machiavelli<U+FFFD>s books and i have come to the conclusion that not only am i fit to lead, i ought to take down anyone else trying to run for the csm until i am the only viable candidate remaining.also i occasionally have the word <U+FFFD>servant<U+FFFD> at least attached to me. as in sometimes i can get someone to do stuff for me. i also like to <U+FFFD>humble<U+FFFD> others for my own amusement, and <U+FFFD>coach<U+FFFD> people when i think i know things better then them.also the bolded word in your quote is my own emphasis. its the loophole that makes me exempt because i am a girl in real life woohoooooo"

10/7/2009,i mainly fly t2 frigates and have no fear of dessies whatsoever. surely this is wrong.iirc the purpose of having -25% rof but with more guns was to increase alpha. it all made sense a very long time ago.
10/7/2009,"cormorant i'd prefer to fit with 8 missile slots, to be honest. tweak them they can only effectively fit rocket launchers and give them a missile range boost, if you have to; that fits in with the anti-frig effect, anyways."
10/7/2009,"i honestly love the thrasher, even if i don't fly it that much any more. you could make it better by adding another low slot for a gyro, or another mid for some more shield or a sebo.even nicer would be if there were 2 t2 variants of the thrasher, one, the sabre, and two a little terror damage boat with a tank.the one thing they should do with the thrasher is remove the rof penalty, to make it viable against afs and cruisers.they could make a t2 catalyst variant with 5 drones, aka an ishkur with guns and tank.coercer could simply do with a cap bonus, and cormorant, well, i honestly don't know, because it's so bad.but any buff to destroyers would be lovely."
10/7/2009,ccp please help:a donation of 90 m/s explosion velocity could rehabilitate a vengeance.a donation of 25 hp damage to a basic rocket could save them from the recycle bin.please reach deep into your hearts and give to a deserving cause.

10/7/2009,are there any numbers on how large the group is that has physical limitations like this? (if ccp believes that this group is very small they may feel less inclined to do something about it)

10/7/2009,100% supportedsomething i'd love to see is a talk to type function built into eve voice. i know that they are widely available but anyone who's ever fc'd with deaf people in the fleet will know that the available workarounds are a pain in the ass.it would also be a great tool for all players if everything the fc said was repeated in a text window.

10/7/2009,"that would actually be a good middle ground imo. while i would prefer it to be even a bit lower, i could live with that.making the button unclickable is a great idea as well, should also remove the auto-rescan when adjusting angle.edit: or go an entirely different way and make the delay depending on how many things the scanner actually finds, say 10 msec for every signature found."
10/7/2009,"i was going to suggest the same thing, though 1.3 is probably still a bit long. it's fine for people that just spam the button to check for enemies but when you're fast at using the directional scanner to pinpoint something, any delay over 0.5 seconds will slow you down.what if they changed the delay to 0.5 for frigates, 1.3 for cruisers and 2 for anything bigger? scouts and covops would retain their current usage but mission-runners and w-space pilots (the kind that need to spam the button) will still only be able to hit it every 1.3 to 2 seconds."
10/7/2009,the only thing ccp has to do is remove the delay from narrow scans.
10/7/2009,".3 seconds or less should be fine - for an inty, 2s is ridiculous."
10/7/2009,definetly needs changing

10/7/2009,"as far as i can tell, ccp added scanner delay for purely technical reasons... so the chances of this delay being removed are as likely as session change timers being removed. i think it would be more productive for your thumbs to instead weigh in on the proposals trying to fix local/system hunting."

10/7/2009,"while i agree most of what you said, keep in mind, not everyone is able to take time away from there rl and fly to iceland, or go to meetings every week about a video game. in addition to that, the csm considers this issue already brought up, and i as well as many others disagree with that, it was a poor job, they misrepresented the idea, and made it look like a joke, not worth 10 min of there time. it never even made it, officially to the table, as it was ""already discussed"" and ""there was no point in talking about it"" as such, the csm has failed on this topic, and until that changes, or i am in a position to signup for the csm and support this idea myself, i'm going to lobby for it.sure you can sit there and say you do the job, and see how it gos for you, but end of day, the real world knocks and bread and butter come before anything else."

10/7/2009,yea
10/7/2009,"i'd prefer a set of changes like this to what is currently planned by ccp. most importantly it avoids the problem of having to rebalanced the falloff mechanic which might well unbalance such ships as that already work well with ac's like the vagabond and vargur (and future machariel). changing artillery based on size stops the artillery-thrasher becoming overpowered, so that seems like a good idea to me.though i would like a 7-mid tempest, i'm a little worried it might eclipse the maelstrom, putting a shield boost amp ii in that 'extra' mid makes it essentially identical while having close to the same effective turrets and 2 utility highs.edit: maybe best to rename this topic 'dominion projectile balancing revised'"

10/7/2009,9 times out of 10 these stupid posts are always due to lazyness and people who don't want to wait for sp's.learning skills honestly teach you to be paitent... you invest in skills to gain an advantage that will take months off of that nasty very long skill down the road.boosting noobs who join the game are self defeating and insulting to players who have managed to get capital ships (as i'm not at that stage yet and its daunting in itself)they already have a major advantage.... the biggest issue is they keep getting told to do stupid things and you have these corps who demand a higher sp qualification (not in every case mind you... some corps don't have a choice in the matter).but that's not the problem... the problem is this is eve online.not world of frakking warcraft.not supported.
10/7/2009,a friend i know in another corp who i helped recruit for got two newbies in. they never had a problem fitting in and yes they did train learning skills but it was between other skills for pvp. they were effective tacklers at about 1.5 mill sp and they both still play and like the game./not supported.
10/7/2009,"there have been lots of threads about salvage theft and loot theft, etc.. especially in relation to missioning in high security empire space. i want to ignore a lot of flames on these threads, which usually boil down to ""go mission elsewhere"" and bring a specific point to the table. i would very much appreciate it if the csm could then take this to ccp with the intent of looking at getting it ""fixed"" or at the very least explaining to me why the game works in this way.what am i talking about? when someone comes to one of my cans or one of my wrecks and takes something out of it, i am able to attack him without concord getting involved. to put it simply he goes flashy red. obvious exceptions excluded.however if this same someone was to instead salvage one of my wrecks but not remove any of the contents, he does not go flashy red.so he is not allowed to steal my loot but he is allowed to steal my salvage. or to phrase that differently; i'm allowed to protect my loot through the threat of killing the thief, but i'm not allowed to protect my salvage.bearing in mind that quite a few missions require you to fully salvage them for them to be profitable at all. why? and can this please be changed?"
10/7/2009,"the only point that is to be brought to the table is that it is intended game mechanics, we have too much threads flogging the dead horse and its not going to happen...ninja salvaging is a profession. i dont like it that much either but i recognize it for what it is. i think the whole missioning system sucks, but that doesnt make me want to start an endless stampede of annoying threads about it.now can we please stop the flooding of the ""waaah, someone salvaged teh wreck"" threads./sigh"
10/7/2009,"game mechanic answer:loot is inside a container, which is tied to your character and your corporation (unless you happen to be in an npc corp). so anyone who takes from the container without being a member of your corp (or you, obviously) gets flagged, because that's how containers work inside the game code (for more reference, look at how jet cans work).salvage, on the other hand, is not inside a container because a wreck isn't treated like a container. it's treated more like an asteroid, to be honest - you perform some action on it and it yields an appropriate result. actually, i suppose they're more like hacker sites which may or may not yield anything at all, but the point remains - until you actually have the ore (or salvage in this case) in your cargo hold, it belongs to whoever gets to it first.as far as getting it changed, you're fighting an uphill, losing battle. ccp has already stated, repeatedly, that they are not going to change this mechanic because salvaging is a mini profession separate from missioning itself (and as missioning is not the only way to create wrecks, they do have a point).and to your point of missions only being profitable if you fully salvage them - if a few armor plates or tripped power circuits are the difference between profit and loss for you, i question your methods."
10/7/2009,"wrong - sftu. you dont know what your talking about. quit living under a rock please and get a life ffs.what do you think people did with the new scanning change. they whine, yelling, screamed, ****ed and made some threats here and there. and it worked. pirated finally cried enough (mega nom nom) and it finally worked.ccp decided to put it down to 1.3s. here is the only thing that i can say about this. continue screaming, yelling, crying until ccp make the changes. this is how it works. yell enough and ccp will make the change. plain and simple. its a business thing. if you dont know what i mean, stfu."

10/7/2009,"ccp devs have repeatedly and consistently made the same answer every time this subject has been brought up: salvage is free for all, that's how they intended it to be from the beginning and that's how it will stay. furthermore, they have no intention whatsoever of boosting the income from hi-sec mission running; to the contrary.deal with it."
10/7/2009,1: she was attacking your belligerent attitude.2: she did read.3: she never needs help. she can take care of herself just fine.your pushing it too hard... back off... you made your point... no need to get a jackhammer out.and no i'm not the model example of this as i tend to get riled up myself but you don't go attacking your allies in the process.as for the situation... i don't like the idea of ninja salvaging as much as the next guy... but my beef is inside missions itself... everywhere else is open game to me.but these days i spend more time mining and exploring than i do missioning so its a bit of a moot point.
10/7/2009,"thank you for explaining. i understand what your saying.however the wreak does have my corp name on it and personally i still think that i should have the option of defending my claim on it. just like how i can defend the loot which i created. i'm not asking for concord to defend it. i'm not asking for salvaging to not be a mini-profession. i'm asking for the ability to shoot people who profit off the back of my work, without concord being involved. i'm sure that there is an acceptable change which could be made here - i don't know what it is though.given that you say this has already been addressed then i'll go back in to my hole and try to stop getting worked up over it."
10/7/2009,"something that i have been working on is not free for everybody. i personally did not suffer much from that, but i think i should be able to kick ass of some tard that is stealing my mission salvage. the simple reason that makes salvage not free for everybody is that if they repeatedly steal someone's loot, that someone is going to dec them, sooner or later, just the matter of how that person gets ****ed off. although i think nidhiesk is a bit too emotinal about it, i do agree with what he is saying. this is for the same of more pvp. if someone steals my stuff they should be ready to face the consequences."
10/7/2009,you people do realize that if... and i do mean if you get this... your opening up a new can of worms right?when you declare that wrecks are yours... essentially this means can == wrecksand when that happens... a whole new sport of ganking takes place.
10/7/2009,i know a whole lot of people who would love for this to become true. and they are not mission runners.edit:i forgot to give support to this wonderful idea.
10/7/2009,let them reap what they sow.
10/7/2009,"i fail to see any significant can of worms. they already equal to cans, the only difference is that you cannot salvage cans.taking stuff out of someone else's wreck already makes you vulnerable to them, and shoting other peoples wrecks, equally as cans, will get you concorded."
10/7/2009,"supported so i can hear the sound of exploding ravens from motsu to gulfondi. and while you're there each mission hub should have an aztec style pyramid for making human sacrifices, surrounded by a moat of carebear tears.to the op and those who agree with her - given there are some fairly sizeable corps based on salvaging do you think said corps will simply go away if your proposal was accepted or do you think they will specialize in blowing up mission runners?1) currently salvaging is non aggressive (no flagging or concord)2) making salvaging aggressive means people have no incentive to leave your cans behind so they will take both the loot and salvage.3) mission runners will now have to pvp to protect their loot.4) carebear tears flood the ccp office because not everyone wants to pvp."
10/7/2009,"wow. this seems to return every week.you know what normally will happen if you shoot the ninja salvager?he will come back in his shiny pvp fit ship and kill your shiny pve fit ship.i saw someone loosing his absolution to a hurricane because of that yesterday.so instead of loosing some wrecks you will loose some wrecks and your mission ship.sounds smart?that said and taking into account that the usual answer from ccp was ""salvage is for everyone""you got options:- shoot the wreck. what doesnt exist cant be salvaged.- leave the mission and hope the rat aggro pops the ninja salvager. (bonus lol moment for you!)- run missions outside of the big hubs where you got less people and therefor less ninja salvager.not supported."
10/7/2009,i would endorse the suggestion that ccp should put up a screen with a careful and detailed explanation of why salvaging can never be considered theft every time you start the game.
10/7/2009,"i will agree with your proposal on one condition.anyone can tractor any wreck, no matter who its tagged for.otherwise, you are wanting nothing more than to widen the gulf between risk and isk in regards to high sec mission running.ninja salvaging is the risk to your isk tree, stop trying to deny it."
10/7/2009,per ccp mitnal: per gm faolchu : per senior gm ytterbium : per ccp prism x : (these quotes are kept handy for your convenience at ironfleet.com.)
10/7/2009,"thanks. personally, i don't have a problem with ninja salvagers - it sucks to high heaven when they hit my wrecks, especially when i'm doing something like ae 4 or one of the missions with a very high wreck count - i like the extra isk as much as the next girl.but when you get down to it, it's not that big a deal. *shrugs* i mean it's no different then if i go into as asteroid belt and start mining the rocks someone else is working on right? and i don't see half a dozen posts a week about that in the assembly hall.""zomg asteroids i am mining should be mine!!?!!!eleventy!!!11""competition for resources is as much a part of eve as pewpew. so get out there and compete. bring a buddy (or an alt) to salvage behind you as you go - side benefit, they can rr you or bring additional dps to the party meaning you can finish missions faster and earn more money per hour."
10/7/2009,"will they go away? no.if i don't shoot at them? no change, no worries.if i do shoot at them after they are flagged, will they come back in a pvp ship? yes.is this what i want? yes.i can do pvp - well assuming that they get flagged, which they don't currently. i disagree. i think that it is different because the wreck only exists due to my efforts in killing the bad guy.for a moment though, i'm willing to put that disagreement aside, ignore the fact that ccp have said no to this already (i am grateful for that information) and consider the concept of ""it's floating in space therefore it's free for all"".in that case why does taking stuff out of a wreck (or can) flag you? it's just floating there.the problem here in my eyes is that there is a disparity between loot and salvage. it doesn't make sense (to me and i guess others who've posted on this subject) that the game will protect my rights to some of the dead bad guy, but not to all of him.to everyone who moans about these posts - it's the fact that it doesn't make sense which causes people to post. please seriously consider trying to have a civilised conversation instead of just moaning.in relation to the asteroid analogy; come to think about it, flagging people who mine the same roid as me would be kinda fun. seriously, why not do it? the flag only means that i have the right to kill them without concord killing me. it doesn't give them the right to kill me, until after i shoot.people keep talking about isk for risk - where is the risk in this ""salvaging profession""? (or the mining profession - if you want to take the discussion that far?) i do a mission, i might be killed. i do some market trading, i might lose a lot. i go to low-sec, i might be camped. i take salvage from someone else's mission, no come backs. at the moment it's risk-free free cash.thanks for reading."
10/7/2009,"ok, i did not think this would be so hard for everyone to understand, so i will go slowly:no, it means that they know that if they touch my loot, they will be shot, so there are less people stealing my loot, because they know that they will be shot. currently everyone who wants some isk can just get a scanner out, find a mission runner and salvage his mission without any kind of retaliation, and if they are in npc corp you cannot even war dec them. you know what happens if someone takes from my can? my entire corp can attack the thief. i have a number of people in the corp that are always happy to shoot someone.then that person wasn't very smart, since he could have warped away while the thief was getting his pvp ship out, and could have brought something appropriate for combat or called his friends. if someone is dumb enough to shoot something he cannot take on, he will loose his ship. this will give me an option to protect my loot, all mission runners still can shoot there wrecks or politely ask the guy to leave. that means i do not get my cash. i personally do not suffer from this problem, but alot of people are affected by it. current situation is illogical. if a wreck is a useless piece of junk, then why do you get concorded for shooting it? effectively salvaging an empty wreck and shooting the empty wreck leads to the same consequences for the owner- the wreck disappearoing, but in the first case the offender will get popped, and in the second case he is absolutely safe."
10/7/2009,"since no ones hit on it yet, i suppose i'll fill in the blanks here.""if"" this policy would be changed so it were ""logical"" loot ownership would belong to the killee not the killer, as currently exists in pvp mechanics. which means anyone could come into ""the"" mission (not ""yours"" since there is no instancing in eve) take the rats loot (not yours as the npc corp is the owner) and salvage ""the"" wrecks (also not yours since they would belong to the npc's at best)if you want an actual logical fix, that's the fix people should be lobbying for. i'm a mission runner, i salvage my own crap, and everyone who whines that there's no salvage aggression needs to quit crying about ""me me me"""
10/7/2009,"it also shouldn't have ""my"" name on it ... and anyone could take or blow up anything and concord doesn't get involved. that would make sense - i could live with that. although i wouldn't like it as much as what we have now, it would make a lot more sense..can you imagine the pve mechanic being used in pvp in relation to loot & wrecks? it would also work in a round about way.i agree with everything that maxsim goratiev has said in this thread. just for clarity i still support & wish for my original proposal. i think ccp need to counter the arguments put forward in this thread. just saying ""no"" because they want there to be an easy way of making isk without any risk doesn't seem like something which should be in eve. i mean isn't that what level 1 missions are for? well, there isn't ""no risk"" in a mission - someone might steal your loot or salvage of course."
10/7/2009,"/supportdo it, just to see how many 'omg turn it back' threads we get by comparison a week later after hundreds of missioners lose their ships to ninja salvagers in hilarious fashion"
10/7/2009,supporting for carebear tears
10/7/2009,hey. dont tempt me to support this! i would sit outside of the station all day and salvage their wrecks!
10/7/2009,"i always assumed salvage worked much like ""international waters"" does atm.first to get to it, gets to salvage it :)working as designed as posted above, no support."
10/7/2009,"so a 33% increase to web strength, give or take? yes, i'm in favour of a paladin fitting 120% webs. this isn't needed. rapiers are just fine, and don't need a special module to assist. maybe trade off the weapon bonus for a web strength bonus, but no generic module for the task. that's just silly."
10/7/2009,mod? norig? maybe....rig with penalty? yes.not supported otherwise.
10/7/2009,"no thanks. everyone shot you down in ships and modules, why did you expect to get anywhere here?"
10/7/2009,just give the rapier/huginn an extra role bonus for web strength tbh.
10/7/2009,think rigs with penalty would be good.
10/7/2009,here are my thoughts on this.npc webbing works at 75%. webifier t2 works at 60%. so put it at 75% and put some rigs which could affect it.t2 web at 60% is really a useless mod especially with intys or nano ship or anything that moves at lightning speed. those web modules are simply not enough.
10/7/2009,"i fail to see the point of this. use 2 slots for 2 webs. adding a low slot mod to supplement this is like asking for mid slot stabilizers or adding low slot tackle. if the recons have you concerned, i can get on board with making the rapier fill a similar role to the pilgrim or the falcon to an extent in that they are designed to be up close with a bonus to recon mod strenth. pilgrims work up close, curses at range, falcons up close rooks at range. put the rapier in line with a suitible recon strength bonus, say 10% per recon level to strength, but keep the range. side note, this would be nice to have in regards to remote sensor damp ships as well, but that exceeds the scope of this thread."
10/7/2009,haha i am quoting this for posterity because this is funny.if ccp pass this issue i suggest you quit eve
10/7/2009,"then answer me this miss ego trip.why did you pass this when there was no support?i'm quite sure that everyone here would like to know that.if you can't answer for your actions ""i suggest you quit eve.""hell i just might run for one single reason... to make sure this crap doesn't happen again.i may not come up with great ideas and spend alot of time shooting down several really bad ideas but i'm not stupid enough to ignore the majority public opinion (no not the omgtheykilledthescanner angry mob) but when its obvious they don't support something you don't going around pushing the issue and then sit there acting all trollish and prideful.this is an abuse of privilege and power.yes... ccp could still say no... that's not the point.the point is... you ignore the public and passed the damn thing anyway.that is why you are as just as bad as lark if not worse.a lot of people may hate me or not appreciate me but i think it's safe to say they agree with me on this.so what do you have to say for yourself?what's wrong? too busy asking me to shutup?"
10/7/2009,enthusiastically supported.
10/7/2009,quite old enough to read these naughty words thank you.supported
10/7/2009,"loads of good ideas in this thread and easy to implement too, should be a no brainer for the csm to bring this up."
10/7/2009,i think hyena is nice where it is.rapier and huginn should be 2 ways.1. same strength but longer range.2. stronger but same range as now.huginn i think for the stronger one?
10/7/2009,"i'm a little uncomfortable with the idea that, since webs are too weak to effectively stop ships, we should boost them on the rapier alone, making it the only ship capable of effectively stopping other ships. wouldn't an overall look at webs be better?"
10/7/2009,"why fit a webifier when a scram has just about the same range, but will potentially slow down a ship far more than a web? mwds are pretty standard, and disabling those with a scram is simply far more effective than a web. as far as the rapier and huginn are concerned, they do not slow down ships enough to warrant their use. their role has been taken over by the arazu and lachesis."
10/7/2009,not supported only for recons. just boosting webs to 75% fixes it. webs have simply been to hard to the point disruptor+web is very very meh. scrambler acts like the old web in comparison.
10/7/2009,"please post your suggestions for fanfest here, so the csm can help you help ccp make next year even better. if its relevent information, also mention wether you were at fanfest or not so i can figure out if you were getting your fanfest experience via the feed or from being there.here<U+FFFD>s some i can think of right now:1. the bar needs to stock much more gin and tonic and much much less opal. polar beer is a **** beer. you should offer viking and guinness at least as an alternative. smirnoff ice is a little girl<U+FFFD>s drink but its what many of us(me) were practically forced to drink due to the lack of aforementioned gin and tonic.2. ratio of food and drink tokens given to the csm needs to be swapped(so making it 26 beer tokens, and 12 food tokens), and doubled(making it 52/24). if not doubled, at least give us more beer tokens.3. i can<U+FFFD>t really remember."
10/7/2009,"drink some more, maybe it will come back to you."
10/7/2009,"look - it's another ""whee i'm a csm, gimme more free stuff!"" post from mazz.if anyone's surprised, you obviously haven't been paying attention."
10/7/2009,"yeah no really, there were scheduling conflicts with some stuff and things can be improved for next year. for example the csm panel was scheduled the same time as some popular stuff, and it was also scheduled way too early in the day. the big presentation speeches also had a lot of repeat material that had already been announced.erik has a really good post in the internal csm forum about it and ill let him copy paste it over himself, so we can make this an official csm thing."
10/7/2009,i have to agree with this.
10/7/2009,"even out the scheduling, i spent way too much time idleing on thursday and saturday and missed all the fun stuff on friday since i was hungover from the goon party.agree on the drink selection, i got tired of polar really fast."
10/7/2009,oh yeah... and if the public says no... she ignores you.no surprise there.
10/7/2009,"yes, i know this proposal gets brought up pretty damn often, but i also think it doesn't get brought up enough, because the only people it really bothers are new players. all we older players and csm members don't give a **** about learning skills because most of them have them to 5 as is, but really, this should be a top issue. for new players, it sucks. it ruins the game, they're utterly pointless, and all they do is waste time you could be spending training something useful.remove them, reimburse them, change them, hell, i don't care what you do, but this should be a priority. learning skills ruin the game for all the newbies, and for a lot of older players as well who never bothered getting them up to 4-5 and are constantly reminded that they're at a disadvantage. we need new players more than anything, we should be thinking about them first and foremost."
10/7/2009,"yes, exactly. when i started eve and saw the learning skills, i went ""wait, what?!"" and immediately quit.learning skills are, frankly, the embodiment of what eve is all about. choice, and consequence. you have the choice of training them all in a row, and thus maximizing their benefit, or training them as you go, and maximizing some other portion of the game. i get so tired of this argument of ""zomg if you don't train them you can't compete!"". for the first month i played this game i didn't even know that learning skills would help my training. ah, the joyful bliss.i also had no idea what support skills were. you know what, we should get rid of those too, they ruin the experience for new players having to train all these skills just so they can be effective pilots. and this level 1 through level 5 crap. that's just silly. once you train a skill, you should just have it. no support."
10/7/2009,what de'veldrin said.not supported.
10/7/2009,this
10/7/2009,"yes, learning skills i've just completely forgotten about the annoyance of. after all, i've only trained three alts in the last six months - why would i remember their existence? and the fact that my main is doing a 10-day learning skill, and i constantly explain how they work and why they're good to newbies, complete side issues. point is, my main is old, so i'm clearly just a grumpy old vet looking to make others go through the same pain i once did now that i don't have to think about it any more.yet again, not supported."
10/7/2009,no one said you had to train learning skills.no seriously.... what is your problem?that's it?not supported.
10/7/2009,"seeing how several new players feel that they need a ""boost"" to compete (not that they really need it that much) removing the first tier of learning skills and giving everyone +5 to to the characteristics could not be a bad move. all our alts would get it too, so even the ""veterans"" would somewhat benefit."
10/7/2009,"where the hell do all these attempts at wowification come from ffs...dont like learning skills, dont bother with em... the eve learning curve is steep, the majority of the playerbase likes eve for this. wow has an easy learning curve, if you want it easy, wow is the way to go."
10/7/2009,"it has nothing to do with ""choice and consequence""...it's a problem of a) get bored, and train fast, or b) don't get bored, and train slow. it's an option between sucky option one and sucky option two. there are no actual benefits to them, and all they succeed in doing is adding useless training time in a game where all other skills train for the purpose of actually getting you somewhere."
10/7/2009,"the fact that you can list it as ""choose a or b"", and listed different results for each, makes it a matter of choice and consequence. you successfully nullified your own arguement in the first sentance of your own post."
10/7/2009,"choice and consequence shouldn't be about choosing between two options, both of which suck! don't get me wrong, i've been playing since late 05, i know that we all make choices: whether to train to bs or sb, tank this or that, interceptor or cruiser, we start early. but each of them gives you something exciting to look forward to, something interesting in the future. each skill is trained for a reason.learning skills are just trained...so we can train more. it's a choice between training slowly, or training skills that are boring as hell to train for 2 months.why do we need this useless and miserable choice? why can't we just, you know, have choices we actually enjoy making? i can't think of any other portion of eve where you have to make the choice between 2 totally miserable options.don't get me wrong, some sort of proper choice would be great. who knows, chose once skill instead of the other. but really, other than slowing you down and ****ing you off, what actual enjoyable purpose to learning skills serve?"
10/7/2009,choosing between 2 easy things is well.. easy.. soft.. unchallenging. eve wouldn't be eve without choices that:1 - are hard2 - force a sacrifice 3 - have a real impact
10/7/2009,"while i completely see where you're coming from, there is a very big difference between forcing yourself to make a hard choice, giving you two choices which are both undeniably crap. it's not a choice, it's a frustration. seriously, what do you gain from the learning skills being in the game? that you're going to make tough choices? you're going to learn that playing the damn game!"
10/7/2009,"learning skills were a stupid idea, and i'm horrified at what stupid advice people give to newbies regarding learning skills when i'm hauling on a alt or something.a choice whether you get it anally or orally sucks; you're still getting shafted anyway."
10/7/2009,"why?no i mean seriously, why? i've been playing this character since december, and the only learning skill i have yet to raise above a 4 is learning itself. thes rest of them are all 4/3. why is this? frankly, because the payoff for having it doesn't outweigh the cost of training them any further. they might, once i start training things like carriers or the like, but frankly, until evemon says ""hey, you oughta do this!"" i'm not gonna bother. and that, frankly, is the advice we ought to be giving the new players. train them when they will actually help you reach a particular goal faster, not just because they're there.as as side note, for not having them all maxed out, i've still managed to accumulate 13 million skill points in 10 months."
10/7/2009,learning skills are good. it's the implants which bust it up like you speak. anyone can train learning skills and keep them. implants on the otherhand... you pretty much cant pvp with +5s. i'm pretty rich pvper and wouldnt consider pvping in +5s. +4s and 3% is what i pvp in. on top of that... if you're really rich or in a massive position like supercap pilot... you most likely want slaves in your head. the shield supercaps are kinda rammed. which are +3 and not +5.there's the problem there.
10/7/2009,these are useless old baggage that should be removed one way or another.
10/7/2009,"well it's nice to see that not everybody disagrees! so apart from learning skills not being quite as bad as i make them out to be, does anybody have a reason why they're a good thing to have?"
10/7/2009,"um.. because the provide a tangible benefit (improved training times) in exchange for time spent training them, just like most other skills."
10/7/2009,"i like low-sec the way it is. the whole point of it being low-sec is that it is not patrolled by concord, but it is still monitored. why would concord monitor systems that aren't held by official factions?also (on to stupid rp bs), local is automated. there isn't a guy at every gate updating local whenever somebody passes through it. would factions really be paying people to sit in gates doing that? how come alliances don't have to pay salary for each gate crew in space they control?low-sec is fine. not supported."
10/7/2009,"the alternative is bad; instalocking ceptors and such making it largely impassable. which would be really horrible for people who try to do any business in low-sec; there is no need for 0.0 mk ii.if you want to see what i'm talking about, get to -10 and then traverse fw-infested systems; it's probably the best power of two promotion that exists.generally the large ship camps are much easier to deal with. they practically encourage smaller ship use for roaming, since smaller ships slip by so easily. that is quite good, if you ask me.increasing the isk rewards of low-sec is of course interesting; giving some unique things which can be done there is the right way to go, and in that respect i agree with the op. low-sec needs to be a profitable but risky place to live.also: we need more low-sec. it's getting a bit crowded."
10/7/2009,but i agree with the rest of your post.
10/7/2009,"spent too much time in fw bloblands and nearby areas, probably"
10/7/2009,"mhh, low sec is fine as it is. but the only thing that needs improvement in my opinion is the reward or bounty when you either do exploration or bounty since we risk our ship every second when your in low sec. well anything that gives you isk from the game and not the market (npc bounty).also the fw sov system. ??? wtf is that. whats the purpose to capture all the systems. ccp should give something in return since we ""worked' for it. for that mhhh, i really dont know.and yes, more low sec system please... its getting crowed.. but for fw, thats fine as it is since more target are present mwhahah"
10/7/2009,"agreed sentry removal is bad. and to be honest sentries are fine as it is.oh, andthat's changing with dominion.i'm not saying change specifically mechanics, or resources, just make the place more appealing for players who aren't into omg1337pvp as well. make it worth holding.also: please read the post before you reply, people evidently haven't been. there's shed-loads of lowsec systems as it is, just no-one wants to be in them."
10/7/2009,"there are plenty of people in my low sec, eating my cookies and sleeping with my agents. you must be in the wrong low-sec.however, i completely agree with you that low-sec needs some changes. particularly for the ""good guys""; the ""bad guys"" already have everything they need."
10/7/2009,why are players forced to petition isk spammers?why is there no gms in each trade hub and the rookie help chat 23/7?the isk scammers are there every 10-15mins yet it's left up to the players to police it.by the time petitions are processed noobs have already been lured into their trap.gms in the trade hubs. insta-bans!when will my ccp wages arrive for helping staff the anti-rmt division?
10/7/2009,or the smart trick of trying to find certain patterns in repeated postings in local with code instead of man power (which costs a lot more)
10/7/2009,processing of strings is a very cpu intensive process.filtering that volume of text data is not a good idea for keeping lag low.the gms are already there.... they already ban isk sellers....there are already dedicated gms for answering isk seller petitions......so why do we have to send petitions?why can't they just use their eyes?
10/7/2009,"gms are insanely busy, and despite the rather irritating volume of isk sellers, there aren't nearly enough to justify a half-dozen gms watching chat channels 23/7. flag the spammers, it jumps to the top of their queues, and they deal with it. i'm for better reporting systems, but this isn't going to happen - ccp is not going to spend a million bucks a year on mostly-idle manpower for something like this."
10/7/2009,"because they would go nuts. have you any idea how much utter bull**** goes through the local channels?quite honestly, if i had to read the drivel of a bunch of acne-ridden 13 year old morons that cant spell properly going off at each other over someone docking or not undocking or stealing someones ore or whatever stupid reason, and for like 20 different systems at the same time (or how many do you think a single gm should handle), i'd commit suicide very shortly.even if they just have to crossread all that real quick that would be to cruel to ask from a human being, and certainly against the geneva convention or something.not supported, petitions work fine."
10/7/2009,"what you fail to realise however is that isk sellers *cost* ccp both dollars and customers.the rookie help channel is constantly spammed by isk sellers.....if the ""new player experience"" is so important in reducing customer churn, then surely protecting these new users from having their accounts ruined is a profitable cause.first thing new players see is 15 posts by a isk seller spam bot.this is something worth spending money on."
10/7/2009,"having just created a second account, i see where the op is coming from: isk spammers are prevalent in noob chat and in market hub local chat.however, i have also observed that gms are on hand around half the time in noob chat and they do their part to shut the spammers down.though it may seem counterintuitive, i think it's ok to *not* have gms in place at all times to ban the isk sellers in market hub local chat. new players (and sometimes older players who make new accounts) need to be exposed to and reminded that isk spammers exist.they need to use the report feature and learn how to use ""right click > block"", the later which helps to make chat in places like jita far more manageable as you can block scammers just as easily as spammers.i agree that isk spammers do cost ccp real money, however i don't think that cost exceeds the cost to train and pay a group of people to work 23/7 on monitoring noob chat and all heavy traffic market hubs. note i'm estimating there.we as players have some responsibility to deal with it ourselves. ""right click > block"" is like a reflex and it's easy."
10/7/2009,don't block isk scammers.petition.
10/7/2009,dont touch the tengu. it just rocks as is. seriously. hands off the tengu
10/7/2009,"1- t2 ammo. some need a slight nerf, others a huge boost.2- blasters3- i would have said projectiles, but nozh did an awesome job on those. now fix the rockets."
10/7/2009,"1. roflkets. no explanation needed. (may already have been raised?)2. t2 ammo. ranges from the useless (void, precision missiles) to the well-balanced (fury/rage missiles, barrage) to the overpowered (scorch). needs a thorough rework.3. shield transporters. utterly insane fitting requirements mean that it's impossible to fit a lst on any armour-tanking bs, which basically means that shield rr bs gangs are impossible. if a large remote armour rep took the % of pg that large shield transporters take cpu, it would take about 4400 pg. it's insane that a best-named lst should take up 16.3% of a megathron's cpu."
10/7/2009,"blasters and the tracking issues with short range weapons in general. due to tracking required increasing exponentially instead of linear, blasters basically have 5x less tracking than lasers at their optimal.****ing raise this issue for gods sake, every time i brought it up it gets voted down!npc ewar, sensor boosting has no effect against npcs and some of the more annoying ones (caldari *cough*) can just keep you permajammed or damped to <5km range.that and the kronos sucks dps wise. 125 drone bandwidth would be the least it should have."
10/7/2009,"1) rockets. just terrible. low damage, very low explosion velocity, high cpu costs on the fitting. you can't have a frigate weapon system that relies on dual webbing other frigates to deal half damage, the missile frigates just don't have the slots or fitting to support that. also, standard missile launchers take too much cpu. 2) get rid of the 'tiers' for frigates and cruisers. all this really does is make otherwise very interesting ships not really worth flying compared to their peers. 3) tech ii ammo. in many cases, sub par to faction ammo, because of the big downsides. precision in particular is terrible. the damage reduction means you do about the samedamage to small fast stuff as with faction, it's just that your range is gutted and your own ships speed is gutted. 4) shield transporters. absolutely laugh inducing ridiculously high cpu cost. it shouldn't take half a ships cpu to fit two shield transporters. armor rr gangs are ubiquitous. shield rr gangs are nowhere, because most ships don't have a prayer of fitting a shield transporter on top of any halfway decent fit5) active tanking vs buffer tanking. active tanking needs some help. a good first step would be reducing the fitting costs of an active tank compared to a buffer tank. many ships, especially caldari ships, just don't have the fitting or slots needed to mount an active tank compared to a passive one. that all active tanks require a cap injector to run further exacerbates the slots/fitting problems. 6) nighthawk having hundreds less pg than it ought to. compare the nighthawk's pg with the drake's pg."

10/7/2009,"here's the list that comes to mind. - electronic attack ships. aside from fitting the most jams into the fewest points for alliance tournaments, i can think of no reason anyone would ever fly these. - i thought t2 ammo had been brought up, but if it hasn't then bring it up. specifically, all the high-dps ammos and void(since even as a long-range ammo, it's a short-range ammo). range is a perfectly valid role for t2 ammo, and worth eating some drawbacks, but dps is not, because we have faction ammo. repurpose it, likely to middling dps and a huge tracking boost. also, for the love of god, ditch the per-loaded-weapon penalties. - ew drones other than ecm are unusable. partially it's the stacking nerf, partially it's the fact that you're giving up 10 points of jam or 300+ dps to use a flight of webber drones, but in general they all suck. i want to see all drones get used at least occasionally. - split weapons are awful, full stop. - combat recons have some issues, mostly the lachesis and huginn. despite the term ""combat"", these are not dps ships. if the combat recon picks up a bonus you don't care about and loses a covops cloak, you're not going to use it. the curse sees plenty of use, because it picks up a bonus that actually fits into the ship's role. the rook sees some use because it actually does useful dps, with five twice-bonused launchers. the lachesis and huginn are split-weapon stupidity with no benefits at all over their covops counterparts. strip their second weapon bonus, and give them probably ew drone strength(on 100m3/50mbit) and web strength respectively, in the same style as the curse. either that or make them actually usable at combat, with as much firepower as the rook. - the prophecy, ferox, and cyclone are kind of junk. make them as good as the brutix. - i may be wrong about this, but i think halo implants are junk. if i'm right that they see far less use than slaves/crystals/snakes, then give them a boost. (i exempt talisman because they do interesting things, even if they're niche implants). - cap batteries suck, they take too much fitting and don't give enough bonus. a large cap battery takes twice as much fitting as a medium cap booster and delivers the same amount of cap as one 800 charge. yes, they boost recharge, but not enough to justify their use very often. slash the fitting reqs and add an xl battery, give us something that at least pretends to be an alternative to boosters. - there are too many awful rigs. take the ones nobody uses, realize that 40% isn't a useful bonus size for something like warp capacitor, and buff them until they're usable. - active tanking is no good for normal pvp. yeah, it'll never be usable in fleet, but in gang-sized combat it should get some buffs, as long as it doesn't make it too good for pve. boosting the overheating bonus is probably the best bet here. - shield flux coils are junk. cfcs sees a bit of use on mission ships, to permarun the cap better than pdus can, but i don't think i've ever heard of a sfc fit. active tanks don't need them, and passive tanks don't care too much about the cap penalty from sprs. - painters need some work. they're slightly usable sometimes, but they could be a lot better. also, there's no reason they shouldn't have range like old ecm did. i can see why damps and tds don't hit to 250km, because they'd be too good, but painters aren't broken at that range. 150+100 or so is completely fine for tps. that's all i've got for now. might think of more later."
10/7/2009,"herschel: eas are fun actually.sentinel for anticeptor work is just too funny. let them approach you. 2 neuts on him, td on, warriors nomnom.keres well not my fault damps suck atm.kitsune. nice annoyance factor.hyena is also nice with web bonuses."
10/7/2009,"blood have 13 systems, not 7. and they all have stations, and a good number of agents as well. and of course ore, thukker, and mordu's don't have officers - they're civilized factions, not pirates. but even by the standards of pirate factions, they're not really that bad - they have about twice as many stations as the guristas do, remember, even if their nominal sov is smaller. besides, somebody has to have the least."
10/7/2009,every other day there's a thread about how salvaging another persons wreck should result in a criminal flag so to save everyone the bother i propose the following:- a message on the agent conversation window that clearly states that there are no salvage rights in eve.- the new player experience should teach noobs that wrecks do not belong to them.- wrecks should be marked differently from cans to avoid confusion over what does or doesn't belong to the player.the ideas need some flesh so all suggestions welcome.
10/7/2009,"iirc, wrecks used to be marked differently from cans - ccp changed from that to the current scenario (or you used to have to loot the wreck before you could salvage it - something or another like that).however, i endorse the idea of adding this to the new player experience - maybe have a drone ship or something that comes in and loots the wreck and another that only salvages it so the new players can actually see the difference."
10/7/2009,"as i said in my thread about how salvaging another persons wreck should result in a criminal flag i think that the problem is is that there is a disparity between how loot and salvage is handled in game.it doesn't make sense (to me and i guess others who've posted on this subject) that the game will protect my rights to some of the dead bad guy, but not to all of him.i put forward that if it made sense then it wouldn't need explaining.however in the absence of it making sense then yes an explanation would be a good idea."
10/7/2009,yep been asking for this for years.
10/7/2009,i would love it if i didnt have to wait 4 hours everytime my agent gives me 2 faction missions within a 4 hour period. it is especially annoyin when im running lvl 4s with some of my corp members and have to choose between a standings hit or calling off missions for the night. i understand you dont want people to just decline missions till they get blockade or world collide everytime.... but faction missions suck for anyone who plays in all 4 sections of empire. wouldnt be bad to drop penalty lower or remove altogether... just my 2 cents
10/7/2009,you have two weeks to accept or decline a mission.not supported.
10/7/2009,damn good idea. i have run around between 3 different agents when i grind corp standings. huge waste of time. very few people i know run faction missions anyways.
10/7/2009,who cares about the two weeks to accept/decline... its the 4 hours im worried about. huge buzzkill to have a mission night cut short because you decimated your standings declining faction missions. so easy to lose standings.. so hard to repair. faction missions should either have no penalty to decline or have special agents for people who actually want to do them. noone i know does.
10/7/2009,"it's annoying, but at the same time it's a necessary system to prevent people from just doing only the best missions. jump between agents, get your gangmates to pull missions, or bite the bullet."
10/7/2009,last i checked there is more than one mission agent.surely you can find some that will eat up 4 hours of your time.
10/7/2009,ccp has already approved and built ur idea into the game. they are called orca/rorqual. now we can close the thread. isnt ccp just grate and awesome.
10/7/2009,i think hugely simplifying is the whole point.difficult for the sake of difficult alone is not good design.
10/7/2009,"hrm...while on the one hand i like how wormholes promote a team effort to really exploit them, i also can understand the point of view that wants to be able to bring as many toys as possible into w_space.shaving the mass off of an orca seems like one way to go, but maybe there are other ways to ""lighten the load"". perhaps a new module that halves the mass of a ship for a limited duration? or a science based skill that allows a pilot to treat any ship he or she flies as 5% per skill level less in overall mass per wh trip?"
10/7/2009,(*) bolded for emphasis because you've proven so far that you would probably miss it.
10/7/2009,"lul. i dont care about this proposal , did i supported it ?i just pointed out your incompetence , thats it.though maybe i should support it , more orcas flying into w-space = more juicy kills for me./supporting"
10/7/2009,"folr all the folk out in 0.0 alliances, isk per hour wouldn't be a huge issue if your alliance leaders would just come up off some of the iskies from the moons. <jk> saw this was already in a raised to csm vote and was wondering if their was any update or possible changes we may be expecting?"
10/7/2009,everything that brings more people in the belts is a good thing. suported.
10/7/2009,"the latest patch notes says the directional scanner is set to 1.3 seconds.my proposal is (im very serious about this) sftu about the new change. they aren't going to lower it more. they wont. its clear.so please. adapt or die.p.s: yes, im angry at this change... but it doesn't mean i have to whine about it over a 1200 supported thread... just adapt. and i don't consider myself a pirate and i don't whine about this change...i never did lmao"
10/7/2009,"so someone sets up a public contract against you. you use an alt to pick up the contract and so defend yourself from getting popped and just dont get the reward, or better yet pop yourself with the alt a few times and take the isk. yeah this would work"
10/7/2009,"i can actually see this as being useful. but the broker fee would have to be equivalent to a wardec fee. the contract should inform whether it is an alliance, corporation, or pilot that will be targeted. if it is a corp/alliance, it would give a rounded (10,100,200,300,etc) number of the members. the actual name of said alliance/corporation/pilot wouldn't be revealed until the contract was accepted.edit: a friend just made me think of this. you shouldn't be able to place a bounty contract on a pilot who has a positive sec status.edit 2: in regards to using an alt to pick up your own public contract, wouldn't work as you don't know which contract is actually you. also, the ""kill/grief anywhere license"" already exists as a wardec. so obviously, you wouldn't be able to place this kind of contract on any npc corp either. and in regards to ships as a count, maybe damage in isk? i'm assuming regional average of where the kill was made would be the value in damage."
10/7/2009,"actually, wardeccing a very large corp makes a lot of sense for a one man / woman army.you wont be perceived as a threat at all until you have made a fortune off your kills if you play it well.the only problem with wardeccing alliances is the increased fee, but lets be honest, 1-2 good hauler kills on the way to or from jita and the war paid for itself.edit: not supporting this, the reason for the tax was making people pay for wardec immunity, the only thing left to do is extending that to all forms of revenue, i.e. trades and industry."
10/7/2009,"nonsense. get an imagination. tickers are a bit more of an issue, since the namespace is so much smaller there, but this is what dashes and periods are for."
10/7/2009,i like it.
10/7/2009,"i am not in support of wis. eve is a game about internet spaceships, not showing off stupid trinkets and drinking games.if it does come, it should have massive risks associated with it. we are leaving our immortality behind, and dying outside the pod should be an eminent factor throughout our time spend out of pod. there should be dramatic punishment for dying outside of pod; i'm talking skillpoint loss akin to not having an up to date clone... in fact, no clone.wis also needs a reason. a real reason for immortal pod pilots to unplug from the grid. the incarna teaser does seem to hint at this. all i hope is that ccp implements wis right, and it keeps the dark, dank, evil environment that new eden represents. **** drinking games, hiring npcs, collectible trophies and all that sims crap."
10/7/2009,on the subject of submissions... do you have to pay for the trip to iceland or is that included in the package?
10/8/2009,"similar letters have to be fixed, size adjust would be nice too as long it doesn't screws with ui..."
10/8/2009,in my opinion it should be done in a separate bay so you can not repair all your drones at the same time. it should be a mechanic out of the heat of the battle and not inside.
10/8/2009,"""a tiny launcher that can carry a very limited supply of rockets. not really intended as a primary weapon but rather as a cheap supplementary weapon system.""supported, this needs to be fixed. increased clip size would be a critical part (provided rate of fire stays the same).might be stating the obvious here but as rockets get a boost their fitting requirements should be looked into as well, as they are practically ""free"" to fit at the moment."
10/8/2009,"so, it's october now.was this brought up with ccp in september?if so, what was the outcome?why does ccp have such poor communication with the community on this issue that clearly a lot of people care about yet ccp has ignored for so long?i thought this council on stellar management was supposed to help communication between ccp and it's player community?i applaud the posting of issues raised here '"
10/8/2009,agreed.
10/8/2009,"supported, and what does ""in the works"" mean in this instance?"
10/8/2009,yes
10/8/2009,"yes that time of the year is approaching. can we string our ships with lights? seriously, it would really boost the holiday spirit to have a ship covered in night blinking lights....while i get bombed on egg nog and kill people....it could even be a high slot. i got extras."
10/8/2009,honestly.... wth not.coupled with snowball cannons and the works.
10/8/2009,you talking about bombing eggnog made me think...what about eggnog bombs for stealth bombers :) or maby somekind of special christmas booster.
10/8/2009,blueprinted bombers that can do lightshows in highsec. that would be epic ingame.
10/8/2009,"yes, and i want to see the ""santa claus"" ship flying in space too. with his reindeer wingman. hihi.wow, the lights, the egg nog. i love that."
10/8/2009,bring on the blinky blinky!
10/8/2009,this would work with formations!
10/8/2009,supported! bring forth the lights and eggs.
10/8/2009,bump
10/8/2009,supportan everything but #3
10/8/2009,nice ideas/supported
10/8/2009,if it wasent as easy as it sounds rats wouldn't have different skins at all 5 bucks says each ship has a flag that tells which skin to use and changing a value is not that difficult though the implimentation and the user interface for said task may take time
10/8/2009,either option 1 or 2option 1:basically 3 types of heat reduction rigs(not large/med/small obviously). highslot heat reductionmidslot heat reductionlowslot heat reductioneach one lowers the amount of heat damage applied to the mods/increases their resistance to heat damage for that rackoption 2: more overpowered heat reduction rig that affects all the slots to increase their resistance to heat damage.would allow others to push the edge away from some cookie cutter setups. pros/cons?only con would be seeing some t3 setups for extended heat timers... but you sacrafice other things to get that so i would still see it as balanced.
10/8/2009,supporting my own topic with a brofist o9 and a thumb up (btw we still dont have a thumbs down ccp. ;-p)
10/8/2009,isnt it called strategic cruiser?if they really add those rigs that might get overpowered with said cruisers. just as a side note. iirc a strategic cruiser can already be setup to overload for 7minutes.(edit: sidenote)
10/8/2009,"hmmmm not bad, but...... coupled with offline module heatsinks this could stack to be too heavy a bonus.offline modules in a rack suck up damage from those around them."
10/8/2009,"seems like an interesting concept. as long as it's balanced, even on the uber-heat t3 ships, i'd like to see it."
10/8/2009,"and that disparity, unfortunately, exists because of the game code surrounding containers. so if seems illogical, it probably is - but unfortunately, loot ends up inside a container, and follows the mechanics thereof. salvage, otoh, does not, and so behaves differently."
10/8/2009,this is where you are doing it wrong.wrecks do not belong to anyone because without specialized equipment it's just trash there is nothing of worth. however if you take specialized equipment (salvager module) and use it on a wreck it becomes something of worth. just like asteroids before you mine them they are just plain old rocks.now modules on the other hand have an already determined have a certain market value. of wrecks you can never determine the value until the wreck has been salvaged.because you need specialized equipment and because there is no value to wrecks before salvaging why should you then be able to get the rights to kill anyone over a bit of worthless trash?
10/8/2009,"would be an interesting extension of this argument if next miners started complaining that some hulk started mining 'their rock' meaning one they had already laid a laser to.no, that is silly.it is working as designed and there are denial tactics you can use against ninja salvagers such as looting your own stuff as you go (i do that in some missions) or firing on the wrecks and adopting a scorched earth policy. mike"
10/8/2009,"/supported you told : ""wrecks do not belong to anyone""it's wrong belongs to who kill the rat.if you pickup from wreck a loot why you get global flag ?because those wrecks belongs to someone.mini-professional ? that's lol, this is not mini-professional just stealing. someone stealing from someone salvage items without risk, because the rules is unlogic and the salvager not get criminal flag like at loot pickup.someone's buy weapon , ammo and waste his time for kill those rats and can't pick up the own stuffs because someone just steal them.what is mini-professional, when someone scanning the ""abaddoned wrecks"" and salvage them, but we knows those guys jumping to mission.so, dont tell me those words ""mini-profession"". it is just simple stealing.if there would be a mini-professional you would scanning the wrecks. but you can't, because a ninja salvagers/stealers scanning the missioner ships or just jump to belt/anomaly etc."
10/8/2009,"it's always so nice when people don't read and take your words out of context, like you have just given a perfect example of. i didn't say wrecks belonged to no one i pointed out why salvaging is not stealing. there is logic in the system, in your crypost there is not.it is a mini-profession because you search and salvage with a specialized ship and or equipment.you are not wasting your time and ammo when killing rats, last time i checked grabbing loot and bounty brought in the main amount of a missioner's income which is plenty as it is.ccp stated from the beginning of salvaging that it is a mini-profession and not meant as extra income for missioners.i'm going to leave it at that because most of your post is unreadable and you really should consider a full rewrite with some logic and constructive arguments."
10/8/2009,"qfe. it seems that the people who have posted since i posted the above haven't read the above.imho.. loot and salvage should be treated the same. perhaps loot should be free for all?perhaps there should be a timer on it? at current it vanishes after a set period of time if you don't loot or salvage it.... perhaps instead after a period of time it becomes ""unprotected"" (which is to say that you don't get flagged for taking it) and after a longer period of time it vanishes.... or perhaps there is another solution i haven't thought of.what i do know is despite how much you explain it to me right now (i understand you and am thankful for the explanations) ... it doesn't make sense (to me and everyone else who has complained about this) that loot is protected and salvage for the same wreck is not protected.as for asteroids and mining, well see my previous post.another thought that comes to mind is that in ""real life"" things like modules would definitely come under the heading of salvage. i mean isn't it nice that you blow up a bad guy and then get a perfectly good working un-damaged module out of the deal without requiring you to have any skills in being able to salvage the wreck? yes, it's nice. yes, i like it. no, it's not realistic. missiles, documents, gold coins, etc. all make sense as loot. ship modules, etc.. not so much.again thanks for reading, i'm happy to see a mostly civilized discussion on this subject."
10/8/2009,"1. fail post again. i explained it punctually for what theft and you you talk about the fact that your words are not read. lol2. you said again not belongs to someone those wreks.if not pls answer when you pick up a loot why can shot you someone ? because the wrecks belong to someone ? :dyes!3.you told againt fail words.""it is a mini-profession because you search and salvage with a specialized ship and or equipment.""ok i go buy a covops search your mission with specialised ship and equipment and pick up you loot. oh nooo you will be get criminal flag !!!!! and tell me what do you looking for ? wrecks ? you told mini-professional, that's b*llsh*t. you will be scanning ships and not wrecks.yes salvaging a mini proffessional, but just the salvaging not salvaging other player stuffs, if you can't kill anything.about what you talk it only a pathetic one explaining into the things"
10/8/2009,/agreed
10/8/2009,"i was not talking about theft in my original post i was pointing out the facts why salvage is not stealing. shooting it might create a wreck but without specialized equipment it is just trash.the wrecks belong to the npc but the loot belongs to the player there is not doubt about it, but wrecks are worthless in their initial state and you have no right on shooting somebody else's ship because they are cleaning up your mess. why would trash belong to anyone, i have never seen so many people argue about trash.your are whining about having other players ""steal"" salvage. the fact that salvage itself is not defined to any user combined with that eve is an one universe no instance game makes it open for anyone to exploit anything they can get their hands on. this is how the entire game works, why would they chance only salvage to have this kind of system.the only thing i hear from you is how obviously i fail in posting while you can't even write a well written argument yourself, a typical case of the pot calling the kettle black.these threads are so enjoyable because you are never going to get this ingame, this is never going to be raised by csm and because people like you keep crying about it.most posts are not giving any constructive idea like ""hey this can be done otherwise."" and wasting forum space and time.next!"
10/8/2009,"loot belongs to the player who killed the rat, you can see that by ""right-clicking-> show info"" on the wreck. check it before you post incorrect information. problem is you hear only what you want to hear. if you don't want it to be implemented, and you don't want it to have a point, does not mean there isn't any. all the reasons have already been stated above multiple times, i am not going to repeat them all. if wrecks are so worthless, then why can i not shoot an empty wrek belonging to other person withought getting concorded?"
10/8/2009,"pipe down mate,i do know what i'm talking about, i do not live under a rock and i have a life... we whined for years for a skill queue, we did get it in the end but that was because a skill queue had a future and was beneficial for everyone, it was just ccp who had its doubts about the possible consequences. removing the possibility to ninja salvage however is ****ing in he soup of a lot of players, which aint going to happen. its going to get a load of cheers from one playerbase and a load of boo's from another. its on the same line as piracy. dont like getting killed in a gatecamp and still it happens. i'm pretty sure a lot of people think that way. doest mean piracy should be taken out of the game...i do know what you mean, but i just disagree and will not stfu... to end with an old meme : adapt or die"
10/8/2009,"actually the wreck still belongs to the rat as by logic the wreck belongs to the owner just like pvp wrecks do. why should wrecks suddenly belong to you while they are not your remains. i am not against this because i don't want to hear this or exploit the business but because there has so far been no good reason provided why the killer should receive the right for the wreck.the only reason i have heard so far: ""i want more cash!!!"".because they are loot containers, although there is no loot in them sometimes the code doesn't allow others to blow them up. this is all due to coding and should be changed however this might be easier said than done."
10/8/2009,"mission runners already get bounties, loot, mission rewards. (which include isk, standings, and loyalty points)why should you also be entitled to the salvage? you're already sitting in a somewhat safe environment, with essentially no real risk of losing it to the rats, making a ridiculous amount of isk per hour. if anything mission rewards should be decreased.ninja salvagers add a form of pvp to what is essentially a pvpless activity. if you don't like it, move to low sec where you can kill them. if you can't afford to lose your 8 billion super officer pimped battleship, don't fly it. you can do a level 4 mission in a tech i fit drake!"
10/8/2009,"hey whine man, go to belt and shot down a npc and show information on wreck.the wreck will belongs to who killed the rat, and show for you the information panel.and not just the pvp wreck belongs to you, just try use on wreck a tractor beam. oh no you cant use, but the wreck owners can do or who fly with them in mission.so better if you dont speak more stupid things.so, when someone else salvaging others wreck that's just a nice stealing."
10/8/2009,you told very well.nice explanation!
10/8/2009,"ok, seriously. let's put this bit to bed. in order to be consdiered stealing, you would have to be taking something that a) doesn't belong to you, andb) belongs to someone else.using that definition, let's look an npc ship after it's been killed in reference to the game mechanics that the ultimate arbiters of such matters (ccp) have put into place, shall we?a wreck is clearly split into two seperate parts - the wreck itself, and a container which may or may not hold anything at all (yes, the container is always there, it may just be empty - try it sometime - you can open container on an empty wreck).ccp has clearly indicated that those items inside the container belong to whomever kills the ship - they even tag the container with your name, and your corp name. additionally, removing one of those items if you are not the owner of that container flags you as a criminal - clearly, this is stealing as defined by the game mecahnics.however, the wreck iteself belongs to no one, and therefore taking from it does not flag you as a criminal. therefore, how can we call it stealing? if it were, in fact, stealing, would it not behave exactly as if you taken from someone's can?as for those of you who say ""but the wreck has my name on it!"" actually, i posit that what really has your name on it is the container inside the wreck, not the wreck itself. the misconception may come from the fact that the container and the wreck are visually one unit, but logically two separate entities (game logic here, folks, not people logic).be that as it may, according to the mechanics of the game, salvaging a wreck, whether you actually caused it to become a wreck or not, is not stealing."
10/8/2009,"it only his physical realisation for the game, because he could not be some other way to solve, but let us not explain it already into the things. but why you pulling the wreck when you using on them tractor beams ?because you grab the container ? :d and why you can't if you can do anything who do you want ? because the tag belongs to killers ? (game mechanics again)but i told you this is just a simple game development thing.so that's is still stealing, because you didn't anything for kill rats.you need someone who kill those rats or you never get those salvage items like as loot."
10/8/2009,salvage a non empty wreck before you loot it and tell me what's left over. then come back here and tell me there's no container in a wreck.go ahead. i'll wait.
10/8/2009,fixed my answer.
10/8/2009,ccp are not in any way going to boost your risk-free mission income. accept that and get over it.
10/8/2009,*puts tissues and popcorn on the table*
10/8/2009,"bolded for incorrect assumptions. salvage is not owned by anyone and is considered free-for-all first come first serve.the discussion about ""salvage theft"" is invalid because nobody owns wrecks. you can't steal something that nobody owns. nobody can steal from you what you don't own. what's next? are you going to complain that someone is mining your asteroid belt?your false beliefs of ownership are your own problem to deal with. you can cope with reality and accept that you don't own everything you see, or you can cry and wish ccp to cater the game to your own personal whims. your choice./thread"
10/8/2009,"even though your post contains little logical argument, i will respond to it.if mission running is so risk-free, then let me risk it and shoot anyone who thinks he is tough enough to steal my mission loot. i am asking to give mission runners an opportunity to protect there loot, hence for pvp and pvp is risk, therefore your argument is not valid as i am asking for risk, both for the mission runner and the salvage stealer. [quote boost your risk-free mission incomehow on earth is letting me shoot the guy that stole my stuff a boost to my income? i simply fail to understand logic in that statement. you are complaining about mission runners getting too much cash, but mission running takes a decent ship, good standing and a lot of work to become profitable. (yes, i know it is easy for a 2-year old veteran char, but we are talking from a relatively new player's perspective)ninja salvaging can be done after a day-two of training with a salvaging destroyer, you can about as much isk per hour, as a mission runner in his expensive faction battleship without even risking getting scrammed and killed by rats (yes, for a new player that is a valid threat). why are you protecting salvage stealer that parasites on other person's work and receives substantial income without any risk involved? mao if you are ****ing other people off by taking there stuff, you should face some consequences, in the end, i am not asking concord to kill the f***er for me, am i?even decing is not the solution, because first of all many ninja salvagers are in npc corps that cannot be deced, and secondly, it simply isn't worth it unless it is done repeatedly, to dec every ****** that salvages some wreck, because probably they are going to sit in thations if they log on at all.i just fail to understand why everyone is protecting ninja salvagers, i cannot see any valid reason for it.i do not care what is the real-life perspective on worthlessness of a tangled and burned wreck, it's gameplay that matters, and by game-play, it belongs to me with the loot and the tags/bounty, because i killed the wreck, i own it, and there in no point in the dead rat owning it's own wreck. game-play wise it makes sense, and that is all that matters. why make up all this complicated stuff about wrecks in containers, containers in wrecks, and so on? it is simply a wreck with stuff that is not damged that you can simply take out without speshial equipment or skill, when you salvage wreck, you putt all the stuff in container, it is that simple. please read above, as i already stated, if wrecks are so worthless, and have no owner, then why can i not shoot an empty wrek belonging to other person without getting concorded?"
10/8/2009,so consistency dictates that as long as npc wrecks are a free for all so are player wrecks right?oh wait...can't have it both ways.
10/8/2009,"you realize that effectively that halfs the speed of the ship ou are webbing, from 40 to 20%? that's too powerfull for just one mod, a mod that would improve it somewhat, like mag field stab, and has stacking issues- yes, mod that doubles webbing power with one mod.. no"
10/8/2009,i would like to know the answer to this.
10/8/2009,"no.if ccp decided that certain members of a specific csm were valuable assets to the company they could hire them on as consultants or community reps. they would then still be in a position to influence ccp without being stagnant holdovers of voting power blocs. fresh blood may need to relearn the job every six months but it still has a chance to make new idea blossom, make new mistakes, and maybe even manage a few new successes.term limits exist for a reason. please keep them.mike"
10/8/2009,+1 i'd like to know as well.
10/8/2009,"as usual, this just goes to show that in the end, some members of the csm has their own agenda. representing the eve community is the last thing on their mind.yet another sad day for the current corrupt csm council.next thing you know we will hear about a csm member using insider information to attempt to profit... oh wait."
10/8/2009,"well that's eve for you.of course it's a terrible idea, no-one's disputing that. all this emo butt-hurt about it, though..."
10/8/2009,"the nerd rage here is palpable.from my (limited) perspective.as a csm virgin there was very little in the way of feedback from ccp about how we were supposed to conduct ourselves... it was simply a case of 'you're coming to iceland on these dates... crack on ladies and gents.', at least in my experience, i know there was a bit more conversation between dv and ccp xhagen.it wasn't until we got to iceland that we really started to see how the process operates and what it's all about (and by that i don't mean insider trading )... so it's not really until the second term that people are really able to start making a real contribution (not that myself or any of the first termers didn't add a lot to what was going on), at least in the run up to the iceland summit.mazz's suggestion is pretty balanced if you read it, maybe not entirely correct. certainly things do need to be looked at. most of the trolling here is typical csm and flamebait from the usual suspects. knock yourselves out, i enjoy reading it. if you're so rabidly opposed why don't you run for the csm this time around and make sure you use your powers for good rather than act as a malignant despot like everyone on the current csm!with regards to power blocs keeping the same people in position year after year... i do realise that many people in these blocs are mindless drones essentially but i don't think many of them would put up with their alliance being represented by an incompetant boob. i believe the goons ran their own internal primaries and i'm sure many other alliances did. you don't like that? it's the way the cookie crumbles. joe bloggs from 0.0 naptrain bloc 2 is going to be able to rally much more popular support than john smith from empire mining and production corp 1532523. it just means you have to put in the extra effort. the csm is a political body and as a consequence of that the most powerful organisations are going to make sure they have representation. if you are naive to think it's going to be any other way then l2politics.the arguement that most people live in hisec and the csm is a misrepresentation is pish and codswallop. you will probably find that of people in hisec a large proportion are farmers, trade/hauling alts for 0.0 types or mission alts for 0.0 types. regardless, the vast majority of goods manufactured and generated in hisec are going to make their way up the chain to the 0.0 war machine. that doesn't mean empire should be or is ignored by any stretch of the imagination. in fact on the current council 5/4 members predominantly stick to high/low sec.tl;dr...csm is a force for good. term limits need to be looked at, maybe not in the way suggested but a bit of a shake up is in order. perhaps not right now but certainly another year or so down the line."
10/8/2009,"the reason they implemented the term limits is because they were emulating some sort of icelandic system of government and the issue itself wasnt exactly a big deal for them. it was just that way because they had to pick some way, and that was as good as any other way, knowing what they knew back then.like i said in another post, the assembly hall is like the equivalent of caod for the csm. its a good measure of the opinion of a few dozen active assembly hall posters, and that's about it. i'm mourning the fact that i will never get the votes of a few dozen of you, i really am. pretty much almost every single issue ive raised was one i raised myself or something that didnt get more then a full page of replies much less actual popular support. but was something that was blatantly broken with the game.for example one issue ive raised all the way back in april(create tools to detect macroers without player petitions involved) got trolled to absolute **** and i ended up not raising it- but then(in september, the first iceland trip) during a meeting, one of the devs specifically requested i send them a link to my list of suggestions since it was pretty much exactly what the ""unholy rage"" project was, months before it was even announced.my point in all this is that aside from a few major issues(for example the huge reaction following the scanner change), the assembly hall is pretty much a gallery of ideas and csm members can load up their shopping cart with whatever they want. a lot of ideas are bad ideas or repeats. the reason for this specific issue that i have raised is because the first term of csm members is largely spent being useless. learning the system, figuring out what the ****, et cetera. by the second term they finally know what is going on, and pretty soon after that they are disqualified for life.term limits in real life are intended to prevent corruption, since the longer someone serves the more likely they will be more of a detriment then a benefit to their office. the csm is not applicable to this since there's not really any ingame special interest groups that are trying to push issues at the cost of another group of players. instead, the longer a csm member serves the better they are able to serve, since this sort of position is more like a consultant job then an actual public office. the better handle the csm member gets on how ccp works internally, the better they are able to filter good ideas from bad ones, and the better they are able to re-work raw ideas into forms that ccp can actually implement.so tl;dr: yeah i do a lot of assembly hall trolling, and you can interpret my motives any way you want(i suggest you interpret them in the most malicious way possible), but at the end of the day im not really going to get my measure of public opinion from what the csm-caod-equivalent posters say, aka i dont really care about what mr. drake draconis thinks."
10/8/2009,"webs are not supposed to stop ships; they are supposed to slow ships down. webs are working as designed and as expected on all ships, including the rapier and huginn.so many scenarios on this thread are referring to the vagabond or interceptors -- these ships are supposed to be fast. nobody complains that a sensor damper works poorly on a ship with a long targeting range; or that a tracking disruptor doesn't make guns stand still on a ship with good tracking; or that guns which will peel the shields right off a ship with weak defenses will only take them halfway down on a ship with good defenses."
10/8/2009,supporting this.
10/8/2009,this should go instead of the tp bonus.
10/8/2009,everyone who champions the old stupid 90% web returning on any ship needs to realize this: webs are not meant to be a impassable brick wall of doom.
10/8/2009,"my suggestions for improving the fanfest:1) better value for money at the pubcrawl. don't get me wrong, i had a blast doing it, but the free drinks/shots that were promised, i didn't see any of them. blobbing the first bar with the last three groups prolly didn't help much either.2) better arrangements for storing coats and the like during the party at the top of world. i nearly lost my sweater (<3 kras & ccp xamother)3) i missed an area to lounge. the space that was used for the pvp tourny looked like the ideal area for a lounging area.agree with you at the selection of drinks.yes, i was there"
10/8/2009,off topic and trolling comments removed. please stay on topic.
10/8/2009,"wouldn't it be arguably be better if they weren't there at all though? in terms of benefits you get from skills, learning skills are pretty much the ****tiest satisfaction/time trained ever."
10/8/2009,"satisfaction is a subjective thing. and let's face it, it is another form of pvp(only without the asplosions). if i can train faster than you, i can reach more advanced equipment more quickly, which means:a) against people who started at about my ""birthday"" i have a competitive edge.b) against people who are older then i am, i reach par with them skill wise more rapidly, which means that our skill as players becomes more important when we compete.however, like every other form of pvp in this game, you have to make the choice to compete, and like every choice in this game, it means giving up something else."
10/8/2009,"the only real reason i can see for their defence is that i trained them and so everyone else should have to. the ""it's a choice"" crowd seem to miss the point that this is a game and no choice you make regarding the skills is fun or entertaining. their removal could hardly be considered dumbing down the game or ""wowification"" when getting past them takes patience and the willingness to swallow the bitter pill of a pointless delay in character advancement. two characteristics i would imagine are common in the average monster/loot grind mmo player.they don't put off what many an elitist would call undesirablesthey don't require any intellect or skillthey don't count as a meaningful achievementthey are a time-sinkthey slow down character advancementthey provide a perceived barrier to entrythey do all this in the critical early period where a new player is hooked or abandons the gamethey cost ccp subscribers, which translates to less targets, customers, allies, fixes, and new content for uspersonally i like having more people competing in our shark infested sandbox and i like ccp having more money to improve the game with. the dumb ones will quit when they find that eve is hard, the ""undesirables"" when they are shown that it is harsh. a couple months of wasted time barely registers on the radar of the kind of player who grinds x thousand of creature y to obtain their very own +2 z of righteousness."
10/8/2009,"really? would you be happy with the training times without this avenue of improving them? if the learning skills were removed, but character stats were not buffed to replace them, would you be happy with everyone training at the same, slow rate? if the answer is ""no"" then you in fact do see a very positive benefit from these ""worthless"" skills."
10/8/2009,de'veldrin: wouldn't your competitive edge be more meaningful if it was due to having made more intelligent choices on what meaningful skills to train rather than having been more patient during the period of time where most are figuring out whether they want to stick with eve or not?
10/8/2009,"again, that's a subjective measure. how do you define meaningful? as i already pointed out - i was a month (maybe two) into the game before someone even pointed out to me what a learning skill was. and even after i found out, i still didn't sit there and grind them all down at once. id one or two, trained a few skills, did one of two more, trained a few skills...etc, etc. nothing in the world says you have to train them all at once."
10/8/2009,"all things are subjective that's neither here nor there. many have an opinion on this matter but the opinions that matter most when it comes to something that adds little to the game once the time-sink is passed are the unheard views of those who left the game, in whole or in part, because of it.in the first use of meaningful i refer to the standard definition, that of having significance, which in a game setting means generating more satisfaction, fun, or entertainment. to put it another way is making a good decision or sitting around waiting a more satisfying way to achieve a competitive edge.in the second use i refer to those skills that are significant beyond the skill-system itself, apologies for using the word twice, i could alternatively have used the phrase: skills independently beneficial to in-game enjoyment.as for having to train them all at once of course not, you don't have to train them at all. but to rephrase an earlier point it is a selection of choices that don't, in and of themselves, add entertainment value to the game.in addition: you have now twice pointed out that your opinion is likely biased by the fact that you were hooked before you discovered the time-sink. i wouldn't be using your personal experience as the crux of your argument."
10/8/2009,"last things first, cause that's how i am. even if i had discovered them from day 1, i feel fairly confident in saying that they wouldn't have lessened my enjoyment of the game because, frankly, i wouldn't let them. i didn't train them all in one go for the simple reason that i wanted to train other things as i went. but that doesn't mean i don't appreciate them as a choice in the game.back to your definition of meaningful. they do have significance, as i already pointed out. they add to the environment of choice and consequence and they do provide a benefit to those players who choose to utilize them. sorry, i'm huge on choice, and i dislike having those choices taken away simply because other people don't find them ""meaningful"".and i question your opinion that they don't add enjoyment value - the idea that i might have an edge over someone else - even a minute one - is immensely enjoyable."
10/8/2009,"this seems to be the essence of a much more reasonable discussion. we've boiled it down to two simple differences of opinion.it's a fallacy to claim that your wrong as this is your opinion, it's an opinion likely shared by a number of players. my concerns about it are twofold. first that this is likely a minority opinion, but without an accurate survey beyond the scope of this forum i couldn't prove that point. my second concern is that what they add for those people isn't worth what they take away from others. this would be both the dissatisfaction caused from the effect on efficient character development, the impact this has on retaining new players, and the impact that has on revenue used for game development. there is also another consideration that reinforces the second point, the existence of a secondary mechanic providing similar benefits with far less impact on the aspiring newbie: attribute implants. if a player chooses to use attribute implants then an opposing player can take that advantage away or at least make it an ongoing cost. there are also choices in how much you wish to invest which scales with how much you stand to lose and the option of a trade-off even setting aside wealth, referring here to pirate implant sets vs +4 and +5 sets (and +3 sets vs low-grade). in short: learning skills provide greater reward with zero risk; once obtained they cannot realistically be taken away making the choice far less significant than that regarding implants. all this while still allowing the player to continue to directly and perceptibly advance their character. so although i feel more enlightened to the opposing position i would argue that the drawbacks of the learning skills still outweigh their benefits, especially in light of the existence of a separate mechanic that provides greater benefits (regarding your point on significant choice) with reduced dissatisfaction."
10/8/2009,"^this right herei would only support the removal of learning skills if they were ""not"" supplemented by increased attributes. base attributes + implants is all you get, no ""+10"" to replace learning skills."
10/8/2009,"i think you mean you have the tier 1 skills at 4 and tier 2 at 3. you plan to play for more than a few months?take evemon and prepare a 1 or 2 years plan instead of some month long plan (it is not important what you plan and if it is something you want, it is only to see it).it will suggest to you to train the learning skills up.the highest levels of the skill pay if you play long enough, but as long as you plan at most a few months evemon will not suggest you train them."
10/8/2009,"protip: if a newbie does make a 10 year skill plan and listen to evemon, then he'll fail and get disgusted of eve right off the bat.he won't even be able to afford advanced learnings while flying in his starter frigate, much less implants. obviously some skilling (in order to do anything in eve) is necessary unless you're purely training up a alt or buy isk right off the bat, in which case you can go down the ""optimal"" route (if you find sitting in station interesting anyway).evemon is not in possession of all the facts.i've preety much trained to 4/3 and then went 4/4 looong afterwards and trained useful skills. largely in eve, experience > sp count, so it wasn't nearly as bad a choice as some ""sp is everything"" nubbins would like to present.that said, the advice generally given to newbies regarding learnings in npc corps and on the forums is downright horrible. eve is a game, and it is meant to be fun. nobody is going to get 'hooked' on sitting in station waiting for learnings to finish, and it's not even the optimal choice if you want to maximise sp (since the month spent getting learnings to v could be spent training for ships you can make isk effectively in for implants/skillbooks which a new player will not be able to afford otherwise) on a genuinely new character.what is optimal for training your alt is not optimal for a new player. i wish people would understand that particular bit.also, experience and knowing how to play the game > sp count. for a long time after i started pirating, most of the fights i picked were versus (often much) older players. getting out there and doing stuff is much better then sp whoring which pays off after a year+.unless you're training a alt or something.the best fix to learnings and what they do to the new player experience is to mute everyone talking about learning skills in rookie chats / npc corps, and ban them if they do it thrice."
10/8/2009,"while i understand the competitive aspect of skill training (eg, i've trained this skill so you're better that the person who hasn't trained it) but surely isn't it better to add skills which actually give you a meaningful achievement? eg, i do more damage, i can fly more ships, i can move faster? not i've just managed to get bored for longer than you have?sorry, but i'm in the opinion that surviving large amounts of boredom shouldn't be considered an achievement."
10/8/2009,"you are replying on a different point from what was the focus of my post to de'veldrin.she was saying that she will never train the last levels of the learning skill unless evemon was suggesting it, i was pointing to her that unless she do a year+ long plan evemon will never suggest to train the higher levels in the learning skills, but playing a 1 year or more will make training them to 5/4 convenient.what you are saying is that training only the learning skills before any other skill (for your main) is dead boring and a great way to leave the game, and i concur.when i trained my mains i did it during play, doing the operative skills while playing (and enjoying very much the access to a new module or ship) and the passive learning skills while offline. it worked well even without the skill queue.that is the way to do it i will suggest to a new player. with the added benefit that the skill queue will not require him to put up the alarm clock to call him 5 minutes before the end of the skill."
10/8/2009,"yes, and all of those training options exist. the option to training learning and affect your time to train all of those abilities also exists. since all are options, i do not see how it's good to remove some of the choices and force all players down a narrower path.edit: i'm also curious about your answer to my question. would you support the removal of the learning skills with no buffs to replace them?"
10/8/2009,"this, at least, is an argument for removing them that i can stomach - i'm not saying i agree with you , but at least it's not the normal ""whaa they take too long"" put the game on easy mode for me whine that we usually see on this topic.it's worth noting, however, that at this stage of the game, i'm not sure there's a way to remove them without screwing over (if you'll pardon the term) large portions of the player base, especially the older players. additionally, i'm not a fan of removing the idea behind the choices that these skills represent.on the bright side, at least we're not yelling at each other."
10/8/2009,options for removal include:remove skills and add +11.1 to all attributesremove skills and add nothinggive all players the skills at 5alternatively:give all players the skills at 4/4the last allows players to get going from day one without feeling like they're seriously r.etarding their development while still providing a choice on when or if to train the heftier level 5 skills.
10/8/2009,you forgot an option: leave it as-is; it's not broken.
10/8/2009,not supported. i trained them its part of eve. think of learing as school for your character.
10/8/2009,"people really need to get over this argument. so is pos warfare, doesn't change the fact that it's a horrible game mechanic."
10/8/2009,"says the pot calling the kettle black.this ""proposal"" has been raised many many many many times and has been shot down many many many times.you have little to no room to be throwing a fit over something that has obviously been settled long before you began this little discussion."
10/8/2009,"here's the problem with learning skills. when a new player joins the game, they often ask what they should train first. 9 times out of 10 other players respond with learning skills. get them all to at least 4. training learning skills first puts all other skills on hold. even the most vital ones. new players want to actually play the game, not sit in a station spinning their ship and waiting several weeks for learning skills to finish.they quit. they leave and call eve a boring ship spinning game. i certainly wouldn't want to play an mmo that tooks weeks and weeks before i could play it. i'd quit on the spot and play something else, and we can see from new player retention that's exactly what's happening.how nice it would be if new players didn't have to sit in station for weeks and weeks training learning skills. it would be great if instead they could train the skills they actually need to get out and play the game."
10/8/2009,"so what they should do is shooting the people who tell them ""you have to train all learning skills first"". yes it is benefical to have the learning skills high. but it shouldnt stop you from *also* train skills that improve your game play."
10/8/2009,so the game should be changed because people give dumb advice?if the majority of players start telling newbies to self destruct uninsured ships should we petition ccp to automatically provide insurance coverage for self destructions?
10/8/2009,"alternatively:explain learning skills in detail in the tutorial, the advantages of training them and after what time they can expect to reap the benefits and the disadvantages of training them right off the bat, how to optimally skill your character, etcetera. do it properly, since this is a very important bit.do not let players give them false and erroneous information which is only useful when training your alt.this is very important for the new player experience, and is one of the worst things about it.alternatively, just auto-mute everyone talking about learning skills in npc corporations and starter systems. more players who are not disgusted by training learning skills and not experiencing eve in the process is only a good thing."
10/8/2009,"wow, people would then get relly a dread for their trained dread-sp and not a stationhuggin- and pve-mobile.. ooohhhh what a pity"
10/8/2009,"you fund somewhere in the instruction book of moros prohibited with them the pve or station huggin ? lolban the moros from lvl5 missions, because mr. caldera advised it. what a pity!"
10/8/2009,"we all know what happened last time you thought outside of the box with your moros(es).really gents there's nothing to see here. while i embrace diversity like a liberal with a hardon for albanians and kwanza the moros was overpowered in it's role. now that we have carriers and... dare i say it the rorqual there really is no need to use a dread for this sort of station hugging buffoonery. dreads are there for two things... killing towers and killing caps. if you want to be able to shoot the smaller stuff bring a support fleet.ps there is nothing stopping you from engaging in your station hugging/level 5 grinding buffoonery btw. you will just have to siege. what's that? you don't want to risk your ship when there are people out there with a chance to violence your boat? please, i invite you to come and join me on wow instead."
10/8/2009,"what about that? i am not a capital pilot, but could this fix it?"
10/8/2009,"the proposed concept was named viceroys, it somehow involved holding the space in the name of a faction. i like the idea of people finding a reason to move into lo-sec and improve parts of it. i also like the lack of bubbles, the gate-guns, and the sec hits for non-sanctioned violence.in my view lo-sec should become an alternate stepping stone to being a pet/renter for growing alliances. a treatment similar to that coming to 0.0 focused on improvements to the systems ability to provide black-market boosters, implants, clones, etc would bring people into lo-sec, both those looking to hold-space and those looking to use it. a modest tax should be applied to npc bounties there which goes directly to the governing viceroy. those holding sov there do so at the will of their allied faction, it's not their space it's the factions and while they can improve it it should be clear that if they want to grow into a larger more profitable group or keep undesirables out they need to get out from under their benefactors toes. these sponsoring factions allow sanctioned violence against viceroy aligned with opposing factions through an fwesque concord agreement... and a blind eye is turned to a little unsanctioned competition between those seeking the empires favor. in the case of those viceroys supporting pirate factions such sanction is neither offered or desired.it makes sense for the empires to seek the aid of independent capsuleers in gaining advantages concord have made illegal, it makes sense they'd want their representatives out there quashing piracy, it also works well for the pirates themselves who are probably now looking to acquire some independent capsuleer muscle to secure their operations in lo-sec and remind the empires that there are still sharks in these dark waters.if your not fresh out of awesome by then you could add that being +2 to a pirate npc faction with negative sec status stops them from shooting you. those siding with the outlaw factions should, of course, be able to install improvements that lure empire and concord npc's rather than pirate ones, and spawn similar plexes.while this concept could be adjusted and applied to npc 0.0 i'd much rather see the factions themselves making their presence known out there and would love to see something done that makes them truly stand out as the interstellar powers that they are."
10/8/2009,"no doubt.i don't think anyone is arguing with that.so why not hire more gms? cost, i'm sure. but i don't think it's going to get any better by doing nothing.a new interface would help. more gms would help even more."
10/8/2009,"i actually support this idea, you can't beat a real person insta banning isk sellers to be honest, it also opens up employment options for people who may not have the skills to become a gm in other departments.------------------------------------------------"
10/8/2009,"i only support this topic if ccp creates a group of poeple who will take care of this isk spammer issue.really simple. that specific group has the power to suspend that character temporarily. but to do that he has to copy/paste and get a screenshot of the actual isk spamming. thats it. if a person goes back to ccp, ccp can shove that screenshot and all other evidence in his face.taking a screenshot and copy/pasting takes seconds to do.hell, we could do the same thing with scamming.if a person abuse its power, ban all his accounts. that way your sure he wont abuse it..well i think cause i wont."
10/8/2009,"supported, however, ccp's history of things is to let the playerbase do the work."
10/8/2009,what about a random day of the month where there are some dedicated gms that hit some noob channels and trade hubs? makes it hard for the spammers to hide if they can't predict when it will happen.
10/8/2009,"i think at fanfest they said there were about 60 gms? do you really want to waste about 10 of those so we can have 24/7 insta isk banning? petitions are slow enough as is.seriously, i think some sort of client side pattern analysis would be better. download a blacklist from somewhere every time you log on, and every time you see a blacklisted url it hides the chat message and automatically petitions ccp."
10/8/2009,in another game i used to play we had two options that would apply here.right click character name1. block2. report isk seller (to be investigated not autobanned)the reports where automatic and automatically added that person to your blocked list.if you reported a non spammer you got a ban.(to stop griefing of other real players)worked pretty well.
10/8/2009,"they don't hide - the half-life of an isk spammer is maybe 10 minutes. they just roll up new trial accounts. one day a month of extra enforcement won't help, except on that one day."
10/8/2009,"you have to remember that these isk spammers are bots. they're not real people who get tired. they're automated programs that are constantly running.these isk spammers will never give up and they will never cease their activities. they will never throw up their hands in frustration and say ""i surrender"". they will never stop spamming even when plex sales undercut them.no matter how difficult it becomes for them to spam, they will always keep trying. they're programmed to do so. ccp isn't waging a war against a group of people, they're waging a war against hundreds and hundreds of computers programmed to spam."

10/8/2009,2nd tier (rank 3) learning skills such as clarity and focus are 4.5m isk.this is a little much for characters that can't really afford a ship yet.coupled with the loss of skills that used to be free this is a road-block for new players.to improve the new player experience and allow new players to follow the advice they are given by older players i believe the amount of isk to purchase these skills should be lowered. matched to the entry-level characters that purchase them.
10/8/2009,"will it be good to make things even easier/more affordable for newbies? not sure.will it make a nice small wave in the market if these changes did take place? probably.does it really matter from a slightly older newbie's perspective (such as myself) what the price point of these 2nd tier books were? personally, not really. which is why, i support this movement. at the end of the day speeding up the process of learning these learning skills and upping their sp/hour count can only do so much for them when factoring in the entire eve experience; they still need to go out there and learn to lose their ships, pop other people's ships, and pod themselves some. /signed."
10/8/2009,"i'm not convinced. the cost is one of the few things that signal to the noob, that they should focus doing other things before bothering with advanced learning skills. a new player shouldn't try to train them at start and instead focus on ship, support and other skills, that actually enable them to play the game.now they get to play and learn the game at least a little, instead of wasting all their trial/early game time on learning skills. if they really can't afford the skills, they have better places to invest their skilltraining and time. forcing them to play the game, instead of letting them get bored to tears while trying to follow a sp maximizing guide, isn't hurting them and is propably better for new player retention."
10/8/2009,"have you tried the tutorial?you get a tonload of skillbooks and some ship.if the ""new player"" want to skip the tutorial because he ""already know it"" he misses the 0 cost skillbooks and ships that it give. his/her choice."

10/9/2009,"i think this is generally a good idea but needs to be developed more. some sort of safety lock to prevent emptying of wallets, contracting all items over, trading all items over, etc would probably help too.what i find interesting is how the character sale went through with a legitimate credit card and a hacked account? this incident really sounds like an edge case and not worth creating a csm issue specifically over, although i really dont have petition statistics on hand to see how often this happens."

10/9/2009,"even though your post contains little logical argument, i will respond to it.if mission running is so risk-free, then let me risk it and shoot anyone who thinks he is tough enough to steal my mission loot. i am asking to give mission runners an opportunity to protect there loot, hence for pvp and pvp is risk, therefore your argument is not valid as i am asking for risk, both for the mission runner and the salvage stealer. [quote boost your risk-free mission incomehow on earth is letting me shoot the guy that stole my stuff a boost to my income? i simply fail to understand logic in that statement. you are complaining about mission runners getting too much cash, but mission running takes a decent ship, good standing and a lot of work to become profitable. (yes, i know it is easy for a 2-year old veteran char, but we are talking from a relatively new player's perspective)ninja salvaging can be done after a day-two of training with a salvaging destroyer, you can about as much isk per hour, as a mission runner in his expensive faction battleship without even risking getting scrammed and killed by rats (yes, for a new player that is a valid threat). why are you protecting salvage stealer that parasites on other person's work and receives substantial income without any risk involved? mao if you are ****ing other people off by taking there stuff, you should face some consequences, in the end, i am not asking concord to kill the f***er for me, am i?even decing is not the solution, because first of all many ninja salvagers are in npc corps that cannot be deced, and secondly, it simply isn't worth it unless it is done repeatedly, to dec every ****** that salvages some wreck, because probably they are going to sit in thations if they log on at all.i just fail to understand why everyone is protecting ninja salvagers, i cannot see any valid reason for it.i do not care what is the real-life perspective on worthlessness of a tangled and burned wreck, it's gameplay that matters, and by game-play, it belongs to me with the loot and the tags/bounty, because i killed the wreck, i own it, and there in no point in the dead rat owning it's own wreck. game-play wise it makes sense, and that is all that matters. why make up all this complicated stuff about wrecks in containers, containers in wrecks, and so on? it is simply a wreck with stuff that is not damged that you can simply take out without speshial equipment or skill, when you salvage wreck, you putt all the stuff in container, it is that simple. please read above, as i already stated, if wrecks are so worthless, and have no owner, then why can i not shoot an empty wrek belonging to other person without getting concorded?yes!"

10/9/2009,not supporting this because my e-vote is v. important .
10/9/2009,"i was surprised that mazz's proposal was passed, given the lack of support here. i hope ccp does not support her proposal as written, but do feel continuity is important...by which i mean, continuity of productivity (not continuity of pet issues each csm might support) and best use of ccp's investment in the csm. lark's amusing description alludes to the struggles a new csm deals with. some remedies that occur off the top of my head (and that would seem to contribute positively to the idea of my definition of continuity with or without a change in term limits):proactive self-education. i would expect every new cms member to have taken the time to read every word of past csm meeting minutes (raw logs, too), other csm stuff at evelopedia, and at minimum the first 15 or 20 pages of this forum and jita speakers. in addition, i'd expect them to have had at least some discussion with previous csm members who ran on similar platforms to learn more about progress and obstacles relative to their initiatives and what some reasonable next steps might be. being as informed as possible would seem vital to new csm delegates being able to hit the ground running and not waste time raising issues that are non-starters or have no traction. but...do new csms actually invest the time and effort to avoid that? i'd love to hear from some incumbents and past delegates about how much ""back reading"" they did to prep for the job.new csm orientation guide. some kind of living document that orients new csms in a practical manner to how internal csm processes work, level of effort expectations, obligations, links to important internal csm info, contact info for relevant parties, etc. maybe something like this exists already but if not, it would be extremely useful--especially if it were all in one easily accessible document or wiki or something.new csm orientation. a meeting between new csms and exiting ones before the new folks take up the yoke, for purposes of information sharing, q&a, etc. surely this must already happen. doesn't it?anyways, i ramble. bottom line, with such short terms i feel it is vital that new cmss be at maximum velocity from the first minute of the first meeting they attend. doesn't sound like that's the way it happens currently. there is no reason it can't, though; to validate ccp's investment in the csm, it should."
10/9/2009,"theres already a sort of orientation, but that sort of transfer of information is better handled speaking to a past csm 1 on 1 rather then in a short meeting.also all the internal csm rules and **** is out there and public but its buried under irrelevent stuff and outdated stuff and i would rather kill myself then read that boring ****. i tried to do it, but i just couldnt get through it. theres no way you can expect someone to 'get' the csm from just reading that even if it were theoretically possible to do. the only way you can do it is by experience and communication. my term up until before the iceland trip was pretty much spent on doing nothing much since i didnt know wtf was going on. everything useful i learned about how to do csm stuff was from speaking to past csm.also who would update such a document to educate new csms? i guess we can get around to it after the meeting minutes are released. lol"
10/9/2009,"so what your saying is you couldn't be bothered to read up and get the general feel and history of the csm's progress?wow... that's yet an another strike.i can distinctly remember numerous occasions where many people would be screaming at the csm for just that very reason... they failed to pick up on past things... and lo' and behold... your repeating history.oh and nice dodge on the obvious again.have i read everything on the csm? no... but i did catch quite alot of documents and minutes from time to time just to see what the hub bub was all about... and i managed to get one thing clearly in mind... the csm is not about ""showing up"" and just passing anyones ideas at the drop of the hat. it takes effort.. and alot of work.you have to read the posts that people propose ideas for... you have to listen... you have to observe... discuss... pay attention to details.not every idea let alone everyone is worthy of pushing ideas forward as most things i shoot down are utterly ridiculous or a waste of time... but the fact remains that its just my opinion and that doesn't justify my so called opinion to take precedence over someone else.if i was csm and i proposed an idea and everyone said no... even if i disagreed and thought the mob was crazy... i would have no choice but to disregard and move on.... aside form ccp making a point to say otherwise... which i would document and make sure it was clearly stated that was the case.why? because unlike half the scumbags around these days i give a damn about being honorable enough to keep my frakking word.csm would be a nasty job personally due to the fact that your forced to realize that its not about what you think anymore... it's what everyone thinks...being csm is not taking a personal power trip... and pushing your agenda.damn good thing that the ccp is really the one to choose whether your ""sly move"" is going to take affect or not.i'm pretty sure they wont... but if they do... it's gonna be one messy day for the forums."
10/9/2009,"itt drake draconis gets trolled...i know you are maybe considering running for csm drake, i'd advise against it though. i guarentee you will either alienate the other delegates long before you arrive in iceland or give yourself a stomach ulcer/have a stroke.you might get some straight, polite and honest answers if every time you make a post about something you don't agree with you don't spew out so much spiteful bile."

10/9/2009,people always give me funny statements about ulcer's and strokes... but this is who i am... i can no more fault you lark for being a pirate than you can for me being a bit zealous and passionate about how i think when it comes to certain subjects.thanks for your concern regardless.if i was a csm member however...i'd probably stop posting the way i do currently... as being csm representive means i represent a larger group of people and not myself... nor my corporation... or my alliance for that matter. i'd be come a target for alot of harassment and troubles... can't exactly afford to take pot shots.when i post.. it's my opinion and only my opinion.as csm i would have to alter my perspective and try to take it as someone who needs to filter out and spend more time listening... short of giving my opinion which would have to be less... barbed and more... subtle... if not tactful.but i'm not required to do that right now.and i'm still testing the waters so to speak because i'm not convinced it would be worth the effort if all we are going to get is a bunch of guys abusing power.but i do have one question...if i alienate myself from the rest of the council for pushing this issue... then i dare ask.. what exactly is the issue they are taking?the fact that i'm against passing a proposal obviously opposed?i'm curious as to what you people think about that.and what would you people (the public) think about that!
10/9/2009,"yeah...csm public info is a mess to find and read through (insert organizational nerd rant here). i know there have been attempts to be more organized and timely in publishing csm info, but i still see a lot gaps and questionably long (sometimes annoyingly unexplained) delays. too bad, really, because i think good and easily accessible documentation of csm activities and initiatives is a big part of the continuity puzzle. that and the development of new csm orientation materials just need champions to take up the cause."
10/9/2009,"everything is still a work in progress, every time we meet with ccp so far we always bring up csm organization as a subject. not only do the public info release need to be better organized, the communication within ccp between the csm and the people working in the relevent areas need to be worked on. same with the scheduling. we have come a long way from absolutely nothing but we still have a ways to go and at least we are plugging away at it.basically theres a lot of internal-ish csm hit that is also broken and needs fixing too that the public doesnt even know about because its either not spelled out or probably under the nda or something like that. even after finishing most of one term i dont really have a good enough handle on the situation to really know what is the best plan for everything."
10/9/2009,"how can you fault me for the way i play the game? really... what's so bad about being a pirate, but i digress.all well and good broski. but you said you'd stop yourself from behaving in the manner you are behaving now if elected. judging by your posting history i find that very hard to believe. it's not just this one issue, you seem to approach everything you disagree with with the same 'passion' and 'zeal' (i call it spite but one man's hot apple and pastry dessert is another man's evening companionship). and in no way am i suggesting that you will alienate yourself from this council or any that you end up serving on by arguing about this issue. it's quite contentious and understandably so, only those of us on the inside looking out have a real perspective on it (and those who voted for it are far from freeloading, power hungry despots). i'm making that assumption based upon your posting history, which quite frankly, unless you genuinely are rping a 15 year old with a chip on each shoulder one called nerd rage and the other unwarranted self importance, is pretty terrible even by my standards."
10/9/2009,"i wasn't faulting you for anything.. i was making a comparison of your judging me for my behaivour is no different than me judging for yours.in other words... pot calling the kettle black.if you wana get picky... if what i've been doing is so ""bad"" in your eyes... lets not discuss what you did recently eh?but i'll stop there as you've been very respectful.know that i genuinely appreciate your comments and respectfully say that regardless... if you can go around saying ""stuff""... so can i.and that is why i do what i do.i don't intend to offend or insult randomly... there is a method to my maddness if you will.strike up a convo with me when you spot me and you'll find i'm quite capable of admitting im at fault when you give me valid enough reason to accept it.i'm unique... i tend to not follow the crowd... like it or not.. it's who i am.regardless... let's stop beating around the bush and covering up the fact that mazz and whatever people you guys feel appropriate to pick... have pass a proposal without... well daresay our consent as a whole. (bad choice of words yes i know but how else do you describe this).is this the csm's true nature?i hope not."
10/9/2009,"just to clear this all up:mazz answered your question earlier as to why it was posted for submission. csm members aren't, in mazz's opinion, as much political positions as opposed to 10 year old fat kids running through a candy shop. the topic was submitted because ccp asked for a previously non-submitted topic raised by mazz which makes all future posts valuable, apparently...on another issue, just because your position doesn't clearly depict that of a typical icelandic office doesn't mean that the terms should be increased. those terms are based on several very well structured theories which have been established globally and known to work. for example, in australia some cities there are entire museums dedicated to these theories and the history of democracy. that still doesn't avoid the issue of ccp paying for all expenses for that trip to iceland every year. with less than 9% voting for csm its a shock because ccp hasn't added it sufficiently in the game to give more attention to the very sensitive issue.on the issue of large corporations and alliances voting in their own members, i realise this is going to be the case however by increasing the term limits - and in some cases, someone suggesting they are unlimited or take on a more consultative role means that these members could be rotated in the alliance for who gets the next trip to iceland. this is fantastic because it becomes the opposite of good, it means we pay more money for nothing."

10/9/2009,"current flaws with market mechanics.- exchange of goods at prices outside of sell / buy order spread.- trading with yourself- inconsistent broker fees.as of right now, current market mechanics impair market efficiency, more specifically by making them sensitive to manipulation and leaving individuals with little safety. as we all know, there is usually a marginal spread between buy and sell orders currently on the market.this spread should reflect the interval in which current market prices (mp) are settled. the spread consists of the ""best"" (highest) buy order price and the ""best"" (lowest) sell order price. currently when placing buy (sell), orders above (below), best sell (buy) order price settlement is done at the price specified by the second party issuing a order leading to a direct exchange, with the minimum (maximum) price being the best sell (buy) order price. such issues are non existing in real-life market places for commodities, and induce manipulation and may result in some economically costly surprises to people not paying enough attention to their price settings.to illustrate:the following buy and sell order sides are present for good x. i have exactly 4500 units of x to sell, but i don't want to wait in line at the price of 50.75. instead i place an entire sell order for my stack of x <U+FFFD> 50.25, this would result in me selling 1000 <U+FFFD> 50.5 and the remaining 3500 <U+FFFD> 50.25. please visit your user settings to re-enable images.in eve-online, doing such a thing, (selling an entire stack at a price below the best standing buy order price) would yield different results. instead of having the best price standing dictate, i get the following transactions: 1000 <U+FFFD> 50.25 and 3500 <U+FFFD> 50.25. leaving the buyer at 50.50 a 0.25 premium. if i wore to set the sell price on my order to say, 48.00, i'd get 1000 sold <U+FFFD> 48.00 and 3500 sold <U+FFFD> 48.00. a price that is not within the current market spread and giving premiums to both buy orders. the real-world case would be identical as posted earlier.now, one could of course place two separate sell orders in order to maximize the prices, but if we really strive to have good markets, mechanics need to ensure trades happen within the spread. this flaw can easily lead to costly mistakes for individuals and might lead to market manipulation.i'm sure we're quiet familiar with the daily average prices of the different goods that we buy and sell, it's a indicator to which we put some weight of how good of a price we're getting in comparison. as trades outside of the spread are allowed, and so is trading with yourself (banned at all world-wide stock markets), one could technically impact the average price people put their trust too, without actually having a impact on the sell/buy order structure. this brings me to the third point, inconsistent broker fees, currently broker fees are not consistent, they are only applied if you buy something through ""place buy order"" or by trying to sell something through the ""advanced"" sell order option. if you want a direct settlement on the market you can easily avoid such fee's. but when you think about it, what is really different between placing a buy order that lasts a week and one that leads to a exchange immediately. not much, and so, comparing eve with real-world broker fees, one can also conclude that it is not realistic. i would suggest to either remove it completely or be consistent with it, apply it over all boards. to sum it up:- incorporate market mechanics allowing market settlements at multiple price levels for one order and market exchanges to only be made within the current spread.- ban trading with yourself (yes it can be bypassed by having several accounts, but removes ""simple"" manipulation).- overlook broker fees and be consistent.the market in eve needs more functional features and mechanics to ensure continued efficiency. if more illustrative examples are requested i'll happily handle it."
10/9/2009,imho the market is fine.
10/9/2009,"it would be nice if the market gave incentives based on bulk rather than a flat rate. i know this would benefit mass production more than the little guy but the npc goods need to be sold in different quantities to fix this. gear the buy orders towards a small, medium, and massive ship so that new players have a nitch in the npc goods market, mid level players don't compete against freighter owners, and freighter owners are capable of buying up an order reasonable to their ship size rather than dozens or hundreds of smaller ones. each tier being less profitable per unit but easier to handle for your respective ship size."
10/9/2009,"theres some problems with releasing the full meeting minutes on time- probably largely stemming from the fact that you cant force someone not on your payroll to do something for you, and also the fact that in life, **** happens.there is the nda issue that we cant talk about meeting stuff before the release, so this issue is about tweaking that rule a little bit and providing clarification- since sometimes minutes can take a while to get out, but people want to know if a csm issue passed or failed in a meeting especially if its their pet issue or something.so, my proposal is that csm members can discuss the results of the csm-only online meetings- such as whether an issue passed a csm vote or not, what was said and so forth. any releases of this nature ought to happen on a public forum to prevent any future scandal. csm members still cannot discuss parts of chat that were not going to be released in the meeting minutes(all those times the secretary says x lines are going to be striken from the logs, etc), and csm still can't discuss results of official csm-ccp meetings until the minutes are release.this isnt entirely off from what happens anyways, and i cant imagine anyone getting really punished for doing this right now, but i think that the nda gets in the way a little bit for no good reason in this instance, and right after a vote is held id love to post in the issue thread that it passed or failed in real time. im telling you, absolutely no secret **** happens in the csm only meetings. theres no reason to treat them as such"
10/9/2009,there was an area full of couches and beanbags on the 2nd floor - it was pretty chill.my addition - csm panel should have either been a roundtable or a live csm meeting rather than a panel. a live demo of how the csm operates or a better way of qna would probably have interested more people than hearing 9 people spend 20minutes answering 1 question.
10/9/2009,"many people have chosen nicks that may be great for a spaceship game, but with incarna this will change. nicks become increasingly important when you are actually gonna be face to face character. i would like to pay 20 or whatever to get an additional nickname. this doesn't mean that i should be able to swap between them. but i could change my displayed nick once every year or once in a lifetime. it could even display on character info: ""the red lion formerly known as redlion"". and then noone could take my old nick, and people searching for the old nick would find the new. standings/buddylist etc will update automatically, so it's not exploited."
10/9/2009,"when this game was young, long before the super packs and massive blobs, even before alliances, standings were hard to interpret. ccp brought out tools for warfare to make things easier for people to see and understand.one of those tools was alliances. it became obvious why this was needed. it was a logistical nightmare to coordinate corporations independently with no way to really tell who they were. the alliance system was added so that all friendlies could unite under one banner.it had a side effect though. suddenly, alliances became the new corporations of eve, and corporations became subsets. it became a game of working for the alliance more than working for the corporation. a 2nd addition was the newer overview. it allowed better coordination of fire, easier targeting, and better selectivity for the fc. the 3rd addition was more problematic. it became blue-red syndrome. now it wasn't enough to be corps with allies under one banner, we instead need to make it ridiculously easy to pinpoint who are friends and enemies are.i believe this made it all to easy to make the super power blocks because standings were much easier to sort amoung friends. now it wasn't about having an alliance, where protection came from being under the same banner. rather, we created blocks.... alliances of alliances. seems counter intuitive and redundant. what has become the point of protection under an alliance when it's really only about protection under blue status in the region.the results of this impact are obvious. corps are constantly hopping between blue friends. players are constantly hopping between those corps. someone might not like the rules of member a, but loves the benefits of that blue group, so he just hops over to lil o friend of big brother and gets an easier life. so again, what's the point of corporation or alliance teamwork when you can separate people out so easily. no need to keep your industry core in alliance, just make another, hide alts there, and keep them blue incase something happens.==========phreeze tried to make a proposal, but due to some obvious flaws, it didn't pan out. but i believe his base was good.i've aimed to rework what he started here:there should only be 4 standings. alliance, fleet, at war red, and neutral.people in alliance should be easy to spot. it's the benefit of flying under 1 banner. same with fleets.neutrality creates confusion in a good way. it makes battlefields harder to read and position on while avoiding threats. it makes identification that much more necessary. it forces fleets to coordinate better together so that it's not just a matter of looking where all the blues are on a map with 800 people. this is good. it also forces people to more closely watch and organize who they need to shoot. this will probably create more subsets of fleets where support, and dictors, and logistic need more coordination to avoid affecting friendlies.war is confusing. in the heat of battle, it's hard to tell who's a friend and who's an enemy. it's more about communication, and anticipation rather than just looking for the guy waving the blue flag. red status for wars only helps in several ways. if you have enemies that are really a problem, war declaration makes them obvious targets. if they're just a minor harassment, then who really cares. this should translate into more empire conflict carry over from 0.0. it should also create more isk sinks which this game desperately needs.everyone else, it needs to be shades of gray. i think this would positively impact 0.0 warfare and remove the desire for super nap pacts. it's hard for someone to want to be in an alliance currently when it's so much easier to avoid the alliance while reaping the blue rewards. lets change that, force people to declare intent and loyalty more.if you truly don't want to be in an alliance, fine, but suffer the drawbacks of those choices. neutrality is a *****."
10/9/2009,"why did i mention the overview. well obviously standings affect overview performance. if we make these changes, again, the benefits need to be played to alliances, fleets, and war declarations. its so silly that you can actively declare war on someone in 0.0 by just turning them to -0.01 standings. force people to merge into alliances to avoid friendly fire incidents.ff is a great tool for breaking nap pacts. accidents happen in war. it should require more political swagger to fix issues than it does now. ff now are really just stupidity and mistakes. the proposed changes make ff more practical and realistic. it's hard to decipher who really is a friend when everyone has a gun on the field. so force overviews to only show all neutrals and reds, or just people you've declared war on. if a new player comes into the mix, great, it adds to confusion until you see their intent. if they are a problem today, war dec them tomorrow.lets break up the super alliance pacts that are so easy to make now. lets push for more conflict, uncertainty, and build a 0.0 filled with warfare, even if it's sometimes mistakes for the politicians to clean up"
10/9/2009,"why don't you go full ****** with your idea and get rid of all standings, even if you are in the same corp/alliance.i hope you don't expect any real discussion of your ""idea"" because it borders on the insane.lastly, you should wait until what dominion and treaties bring. it may be a limited number of ""blue slots"" or maybe a sliding cost to how many blue allies you have or something. ccp is looking at it and we can only wait to see what ccp will do."
10/9/2009,"so what you're saying is add a 5th condition for treaties. from my understanding, treaties are more about demands from industry alliances coming from their war overlords. it's pretty easy to treat them the same as war decs working the other way where a payment is panned out for security status. i'm fine with that and it plays well into what i'm aiming for. please be constructive with post. all you sound like is a carebear **** who's worried his nap brigade might go away. and try a main, it helps lend weight to your post."

10/9/2009,"so...my first forum post, because i actually felt strongly enough about this subject to post.i learned about learning skills my second day of playing (i'm about a 3-month old character now) from the newbie channel. my very first thought: ""wow! i can actually control the speed at which i 'level up!' this is great!""...and i immediately went and bought the skills and started training. as a 3 month old character, i have most of my basic learning skills at 5, and most of my advanced learning skills at 3 or 4. man is it giving me an edge.i have the same skill points as a few characters that have actually started up to 1-month before my ""birthdate.""the op's claim that""its a choice between wasting time learning those skills or being stuck training slowly"" has one big false assumption. he assumes that learning skills are ""wasting time."" they help you do everything faster later in the game. lastly, of course learning skills are a time sink....every mmo where you actually improve as you play has a time sink. why do you think that for games with character levels, it takes longer to reach the next level the higher you go. for games with skils, it takes longer to improve that skill the better you are at it. the only non-time sink mmos i can think of are fpss. as for me, i'm happy with eve being a game where i improve over time, and actually have some control over how fast i improve, rather than having skill learning being set in stone.not supported"

10/9/2009,"protip: they don't need to spin their ships in station waiting for the learning skills to finish. heck if they are not mouth breathers they realized on their own that they can train a few things to 3 and greatly increase their noobish effectiveness with little or no effect in their long term training if they even have a long term training plan. new players already get more skill points at the start, and an accelerated sp training period. that not enough for you? fine please go **** yourself.i play the game to enjoy myself just like everyone else, alright not everyone some make this game a second job. so when i was advised that training up my learning skills first was a good idea i went with that... for about 2 days. then i had a whole bunch of skills i wanted or needed to accomplish whatever it was that i was doing at the time. so i made myself a big ass list of skills i wanted bought them all and trained learning skills when i was logged off and the short skills i wanted when i was logged in. it worked beutifully. i probably lost maybe 2 days tops in stretching out my learning skill training by adding what i wanted.so in conclusion, don't try to change the game because you are incapable of thinking for your self and spend weeks spinning your ship in a station because you think you are not allowed to train anything but learning skills. you have a skill queue now training is easy now ffs no more setting an alarm to change a skill or wondering if you remembered to set a long skill before you logged off. i guess what i am trying to say is get bent."
10/9/2009,"huh, hello? phoenix?having said that, the nerf is indeed unecessary to be honest. it's not that far-fetched, though, now that they're merging the tracking penalty into turrets' base stas - dreads won't be able to hit ****, whether in siege or not."
10/9/2009,"proposal: provide an additional system defense upgrade that is similar to the cyno-jam currently available, whose purpose is to provide a gradual degradation of the cloaking systems of neutral/red (defined by the sov-holding entity) ships in a system.the rationale behind this idea is tied to the current ""rule"" that prohibits fitting 2 cloaks on a single ship, that they cancel each other out or are out of phase.this upgrade module would, over an extended period of time (perhaps 60-120 minutes), attempt to ""tune"" itself to the encroaching ships cloaking signature and begin cancelling it out. the initial effect of this could be a slowly increasing chance of being probed out, and the final result be complete failure of the target ship's cloaking module.similar to the current system that allows friendly(blue) ships to utilize pos's, jumbridges, and cyno's; friendly ships would not be effected.to simplify the system, the timer would be reset every time the target ship exited and reentered the protected system, but this would expose the ship to interdiction and destruction during that transition.this is motivated by the incredible ease with which opposing ships with cloak can perma-camp even the highest level sov system with near impunity collecting intel on in-system activities."
10/9/2009,either it affects all cloaks the same (no matter what standing) or this gets a no.and the requirements to have this upgrade should be really high. (above cyno jammers maybe)

10/9/2009,"tracking is linear and exponential. if you're talking essentially even tracking, then it's linear based on range. if you're talking about increasing tracking compared to what it tracks at increasing range, then it's exponential. what you're complaining about is linear. either way, tracking is fine in this game, but gun range or damage trade-off, or some other variable needs to be looked at. i'd personally rather see more damage for less range for blasters. autos don't use cap, so they win with neuts.at 4.5 optimal, a blaster mega can track about 300m/s. at 4.5 optimal, a non buffed bs can track about 200m/s. with a web, most cruiser fall under that speed unless they use a mwd. mwd can be countered with point or capacitor warfare. an ab cruiser can get over that speed, which is intended. bs v bs, it's hard to outrun tracking of blasters. it's likely if you can outrun tracking, you can just as easily outrun range."

10/9/2009,"in my opinion normal destroyers should be able to fit a gang link. right now there is no ""command ships"" for small, frigate sized fleets."
10/9/2009,both ideas sounds a bit like not really doable.1. commandships have the advantage that you normally dont want to shoot them first because of their tank. having a similar tanky frigate would make it overpowered in other situations.2. the smart bomb frig sounds very much like overkill. having a bs size smartbomb on a frigate will make them pretty dangerous for your own frigate gang.with those 2 concerns i cant really support your idea.
10/9/2009,"they're not without issues, but a claymore can keep up with a frig fleet and adds so much to it that it's not even funny.to topic though, i agree it's premature. let's hear what ccp have come up with and shout about that. it'll be more efficient."
10/9/2009,i think you can also set up a very fast t3 cruiser with a gang link.
10/9/2009,"when t3 frigates come, the one thing they better not have is the interdiction nullifier. they would be impossible to catch.but frigate sized command ships would be very nice. smartbombs? not so much. there really is no point to that."
10/9/2009,i seriously doubt there will be any tech 3 frigates destroyers.crusiers? already there.battlecrsuiers battelships captials? yeah... now your talking.now if ccp does release them... i'd be a bit... troubled by the ease of reconfiguring for a number of things.. as we don't need an omgwtfbbq frigates flying around.
10/9/2009,drake: they said on the fanfest live stream that they will release t3 frigates. :)
10/9/2009,oey... i hope they take balancing into account.so be it.but no... i don't support this proposal regardless. : o pthanks darius o7

10/9/2009,"naah, only 90% of the time."
10/9/2009,"i recently tried to start a new character using no halp at all from other accounts and following advice i was given by other players, tbh it was easier when you started with 800k. the skill books you get from the tutorial and starter arcs are really ****ing random (got a load of shield tanking books and modules as an ammar char but no armour stuff, and a laser boat with no energy management and no controlled bursts is unusable). to cut a long story short after doing the starter arcs running a few missions and buying my first few adv learnings i was in a worse position than the old 800k days. the books are very expensive to a new character and are pretty usefull to have early even if you don't train them up very high since you won't have bling implants to fall back on, having somethiong you can actually work towards rather than sitting and waiting is not nessesarily a bad thing however. three mil is probably a better price.+-50mil is going to make no difference to alts. this is however pretty important to genuine new players.not supporting however till i can find a genuine newb to throw through the npe and grill for information."

10/9/2009,"the editing is, indeed, lolz.i don't know if this would work. barack obama is a huge care bear. i mean, he just won the nobel prize for peace.i can't really picture universal health care for eve, and my npc corp taxes are going up...i think eve would be better suited for one of those horrible dictators out of africa."

10/10/2009,"i like the idea of being able to ""lock"" a character to prevent transfer or termination. at least it's one more obstacle. details need sorted, but supported. and although i like the idea of email confirmation as well, it is not a fail-safe. someone who hacked or stole your login details could just log into the eve-o site and change the email associated with the account, couldn't they?"
10/10/2009,this.
10/10/2009,very good ideal. one week timer on locked toons before you can sale them is a great ideal.if you get hacked it buys you time to get your account back. and if your legit in wanting to sale off a pilot you will simply need to wait a one week time before doing so.

10/10/2009,"having recently given wow a shot one thing that blizzard do well is 'world events' which tie into real life events goings on. while they can get away with it sort of in wow i think ccp would be hard pressed to write similar events into eve as effectively.saying that, why the hell not? i mean really. snowballs are great and everything but lets have a bit more like that. if it breaks immersion slightly but people have some fun with it then who cares right?"
10/10/2009,no need... just go fly caldari ships. they have an obsession with lots of flashing lights!
10/10/2009,please read last psot made by me before reading this thanks hello. please take this seriously as i have come up with a brilliant new idea for a ship. it is a caldari ship. and i designed it to be a cross miner/hauler for small mining operations that do not require an orca. i have drawn some sketches and diagrams of it and even made a model if you want them. it would have 8 turret hardpoints which can only fit mining lasers (just standard mining lasers not strip miners). it would have a bit more of a mining yield than a retriever.it would have a cargo hold slightly lesser than an orcas and an ore hold. i have decided to call it the 'gull'. as most caldari ships are named after birds and gulls scavange in a way. thanks for reading. please let me know even if you do not want the idea.yours faithfully oliver stoner.
10/10/2009,well some people in game are telling me it is too god to be feesable. maybe a ship with half the mining yield of a hulk and half the total capacity of an orca? please can i note i did not intend it to be able to fit mining foreman link modules.
10/10/2009,"i'll tell you why i wont support it, even though it might make a miners life a little more comfortable. it's one of those ideas thats just too overpowered. in my opinion it's going to make both the hulk as well as the orca obsolete. i do understand that a hulk with no storage capacity can be a bit of a pain, especialy when there is no orca buddy around. but getting the two ships in 1 mega mining ship is just too much i'm affraid. an addition might be that these ships can only be used in 0.0 or somesuch, but then again, thats why hulk's were designed in the first place if i'm not mistaken."
10/10/2009,i believe capital industrial ships can be used in high sec but i may be mistaken. i thought it would be a good idea for small mining ops like 1 hulk 1 orca. but if you only have 1 hulk why would you need a whole orca? so this is why i made my idea.
10/10/2009,"hey stoner,first of all it being a caldari ship is an awesome idea. caldari ftw *raises fist i like your idea because it would be sort of a ubermining ship which i had thought of myselve a couple of times, but i bet all the macro miners out there would be very pleased to have one too and believe me you wouldn`t want those guys to get their hands on something like this... market would just collapse me thinks.on the other hand, if this thing was only for low or null sec, macros would prolly not use it, unless there is an alliance protecting them. which i don`t believe any alliance would do but still, there is the chance that could happen.i like your idea and i hope pple will discuss this matter a little more.fly safe..."
10/10/2009,i think that empire macroers will instantly go for the max yield. and a hulk is in that favour. which pushes me to think that this ship will only be used for honest small mining ops
10/10/2009,oh yeah forgot to suuport it
10/10/2009,"no. the rorqual is the only capital industrial ship, and as it cannot use gates, they are unable to operate there.industrial command ships (the orca) lack a jump drive but can use gates. orcas operate in highsec.no. the barges, rorq, and orca are faction ships developed by outer ring excavations. if your proposed ship were to be caldari, then they would need to add similar ships for the other three races. all ships for the one playable race has a rough equivalent in the other three.no. problems:* this would be abused as a jump freighter if you made it slightly smaller than an orca. an orca fit out for hauling (t2 expanders, t1 cargo rigs, idc iv) can move ~179,000m3 (only 50,000m3 of which needs to be ore). it can move 400,000m3 worth of rigged ships (20 frigate hulls in addition to other cargo + as much ammo as you can fit in there). for comparison, the rhea is ~353,250m3 of cargo space (freighter iv required, so +20% to the base cargo, neh?).* haulers and mining ships have been kept separate. this promotes teamwork. this model has not been broken in all the time eve has been out and it is working perfectly fine. i see no reason to add an <U+FFFD>ber-barge that can mine for two hours by itself; it isn't addressing a problem.* there's no reason to put a corp hangar on a mining barge. carriers have them because they are combat logistics ships; they can bring replacement ships to the field, allow you to refit with different mods, and can bring additional ammo/fuel to the fight. rorq/orcas are mining support platforms; they also allow refits and can bring fresh mining crystals / ice / gas harvesters to the excavation site.all that aside, if you've done concept art on a caldari-style ship, please post it somewhere. everybody loves fan art."
10/10/2009,it doesn't necessarily have to have a jump drive or a corproate hangar array or a ship maintenance array as long as it has a decent ore hold. i would like it to be smaller than an orca and have a yield a bit more than a retriever. all ore ships have a faction just look under preview e.g. orca is caldari ndustrial command ship. i never designed it for solo miing but small mining ops because 1 gull and 1 hulk is better than 1 orca and 1 hulk as yield is alot more and there is still a decent capacity. ok?
10/10/2009,sounds like a good ship. i think it will encourage afk mining but then again so does the power of 2 offer with 1 orca and 1 hulk. thumbs up for sir stoer on this one.
10/10/2009,sounds good to me.
10/10/2009,i think you should make the ore hold big and the cargo hold quite small so people can't use it as a transport then trasport stays in logistics and this would be a full mining ship i like this ida same ship size but one high slot with tractor bonus but mske it a drone mining ship that give big bonuses to the mining drones (mining carrier) give masive bonuse to the drones so it will get as mutch as the retrever with max skills but the drones would keep macro miners from using thim becus npc normly pop thim first
10/10/2009,great idea but you seemed to lke it so why did you not show support?
10/10/2009,so we're onto the idea of being a mining carrier with small cargo but big ore hold. with big bonus' for mining drones. is there some way we could let is have loads of drones like a normal carrier?
10/10/2009,bump
10/10/2009,if the ship has a small cargo but big ore hold the miner will need to be at the computer all the time to constantly switch ore from cargo to ore hold am i right? so that completely eliminates the afk mining problem. so atm we are either thinking of a mining carrier.
10/10/2009,not supported. eve is about teamwork. hulk(s)+orca=win.
10/10/2009,"darius you obviously haven't been bothered to read this post. it was not designed for solo mining, it was designed for small mininbg ops. and if it is only about teamwork why do people do missions on their own and do pvp on thier own?"
10/10/2009,"well for small mining ops the orca as is, is 100% fine. my corp often just have 1 miner and an orca sitting in a belt. no need for a new ship."
10/10/2009,"while the concept is great, it does not promote a very important part of eve play, which is team work, either from players with 2 accoutns or with other members in a corp, i do the samething using 2 accounts 1 account with a mamothand a ret while the other account is in a hulk. the only thing that needs to be address here is the ability to sheild the ret better, but i am working on that with my skills"
10/10/2009,"well i think the whole concept of mining needs to be more dynamic. rather than locking a rock and activating lasers. i'm begin to like the whole idea of a mining carrier here, and if enough people like the idea of having loads of mining drones flying around the place we could ditch the whole idea of having a huge ore hold and make it purely a mining carrier. anyone like this idea?"
10/10/2009,maybe we could also get a large mining drone the size of a fighter.
10/10/2009,you will get more dynamic mining. see this video from the fanfest where they talk about comet and ring mining.
10/10/2009,mining rokh + jetcans + orca in station = your ship. not supported.
10/10/2009,when i find ur psot. i will read it entirely.terrible idea.so a rokh? rokh with giant cargo. gtfo.
10/10/2009,"so you're a caldari player asking to ccp make a caldari only super ultra mega afk mining ship? screw the other races, make them train caldari!that's about as fair and balanced as msnbc.how about no."
10/10/2009,"assigning roles to people directly causes mass confusion, so i only use titles.there is no way to grant a member the ability to assign a title without making them a director.i need the ability to create titles that will have roles associated with them which will allow those people to grant other titles.this would solve many problems in snigg, and i'd imagine other corps as well."
10/10/2009,"i think people that keep spamming the same crap over and over despite the fact that ccp has firmly stated their case and reasons need to be placed on the killrights list of everyone in eve. this would both reduce idiotic spam, and make the game more fun."
10/10/2009,"also it is not theft, saying it in your topic title will not make it true."
10/10/2009,"the mission runner has created it, so i consider it belonging to the mission runner.it has the mission runner's name on it, so i consider it belonging to the mission runner.if you shoot the empty wreck, just like any other property of a different player, you get concorded, so i consider it to belong to the mission runner."
10/10/2009,"wrong. the character who activated his salvager created it. you can ""consider"" it yours as much as you like, but the guy who actually applied his skills and mods to create the salvage is the one who ends up with it in his cargo hold.please explain why you think hi-sec mission running income needs to be boosted still further?"
10/10/2009,"you do have that option. you can mission in lo-sec or 0.0, whereby you can do anything you like to salvagers.or, better yet! you can support my proposal to make all level 3/4 combat mission deadspaces lo-sec, which means that you can choose to initiate aggression, at the expense of a small sec hit. of course, so can the salvager. but whoever starts the fight is then stuck in the deadspace for 15 minutes. that way, everyone gets what they want. the current salvage laws stay the same for eg: belt rats and pvp wrecks, you brave, bold mission runners get to shoot at salvagers if you really want to, with only the minor sec hit penalty (you should have sec to spare), and if anyone tries to gank you, they're stuck in the deadspace for 15 minutes, so you can get your fellow bold brave missioning buddies to come and help you beat the hell out of them. missioners and salvagers share the same level of risk, no-one else needs to be affected, no rules need to change.i trust i have your support in this proposal, since it will give you everything you say you want, without affecting non-involved parties?"
10/10/2009,"salvage = salvage. if it wasn't available to anyone who wants to salvage it, it wouldn't be salvage. end of."
10/10/2009,"should be more fun, if the parasites would not try to sponge others off (like ninjalooters in mission of other players)"
10/10/2009,"support: implementing this will increase the possibility that a fail-fit pve mission-boat being killed in pvp action, which is a yes-yes."
10/10/2009,"i think that a lot of people here are drifting off topic by arguing with each other about what is logical.for me what is logical is consistency and the way thing are now is not consistent, hence why lots of people make forum posts on this subject.please see my last post (which appears to have been mostly over looked - it's on page 2) for details of my views."
10/10/2009,"so if i understand you correctly you will not be happy with salvage until both a can with the loot(old school), and the salvage spawn seperatly at the death of a ship? thus the salvage will be an unowned item and can not be tractor beamed by anyone increasing the time for salvaging universally. if this will make you happy i guess you can petition for that so you can feel better about the current state of salvage rights."
10/10/2009,"no, i will feel better only when i will be able to protect my property without concord interfering. i want to shoot any f***er that is dumb enough to touch my salvage. the wrecks belongs to me, you are not allowed to do anything with it, shoot it, salvage it, scramble it, webb it. try webbing someone's wreck- concord will pop you even thought you are doing nothing to a bunch of rubbish, bu for some reason concord let's you take the rubbish apart. it's simple as that: you do not touch other people's property, move it around cans, or f**k around with it in any other way without permission, if you do they have a decent opportunity to dispose you of your ship.this wll mean more pvp and loses on both sides, both mission runners shooting salvagers that they cannot take on, and people salvaging wreck of a mission runner that has a bunch of friends in system, making game more interesting. something less lame then can wars."
10/10/2009,"you can protect your property.however, this does not include salvage until after you've actually salvaged it."
10/10/2009,"it seems that whenever i scroll too far in the standings listings, i'm all the sudden lagged by the computer trying to load dozens of avatars for the agents that i might have talked to once. these avatars serve no visible purpose, and could easily be switched for another icon.what i propose is to have the corporation logo in the location where the avatar currently displays, and maybe some details about the agent. for instance, one agent would be listed in the current system as:[avatar] sihsad aphuka 10.00 (superb) (i)in the new layout i envision, it would appear like this:[carthum conglomerate logo] sihsad aphuka l4 q18 10.00 (superb) (i)comments? suggestions?"

10/10/2009,that is a bit of a stretch.first off... we have just her word to go on it.secondly... this sets a nasty precedent... basically it means that the greater majority of us here... at assembly hall.. can say all we want.... good... bad... ugly... loud... quiet... it won't matter... only having ccp to stand in there way.everything we are discussing here is a colossal waste of time.anyone in the csm can make proposal and it will be passed or rejected at-will.i find it a bit hard to swallow that.which leaves one final question.what is the point of having a csm when they can ignore the overall population?because if that's the case... then why bother giving input to begin with.
10/10/2009,there's a reason people hate politics. welcome
10/10/2009,"for once... i actually agree with you.yeah there's always politics... but honestly... they could have made an effort ""ffs"""
10/10/2009,"practically speaking, the csm is a consultant job not a political office. flying 9 csm members to iceland twice per year probably costs about as much hiring one guy full time to try to figure out wth the community wants, and can do the job better too. the only reason there are elections is because its the only fair way to decide which players get the trip.the problem with all your arguments is that you think this is like electing a senator or a governor. the only wrongdoing a csm member is capable of is not really made any more possible the longer they stay in office. you're basically electing a player opinion consultant for ccp that is paid in free trips to iceland.most of the rest of my posting here is just to provoke drake."
10/10/2009,"the scope of the csmthe purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp. this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness, understanding, and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base.topic presentation and management by the csma topic can be anything that a player considers important. the goal is to either gain the support of a representative, or gain a 25% public support level on the issue from the total number of voters from the last general election. if either of these conditions is met, the topic must be addressed by the csm.*basically, if a topic gets the support of just one csm, it can be brought to vote. now as far as a csm starting a topic and then the same csm voting yes to it so it can be voted on by the csm counts, i am unsure about. if that is allowed, then that rule should be changed otherwise it would be an auto-csm-vote on anything a csm member feels like.*source:the csmon a related note, i dare not attempt to copy and paste the raw log of the minutes of the last meeting, even only the discussion of this topic and how it came to be a 4 to 3 vote. i encourage everyone to please read it, specifically the term limits section towards the end. it is interesting to say the least.source:csm meeting minutesi guess my question is, did the csm represent society interests on this topic, as per their job, as described by p<U+FFFD>tur j<U+FFFD>hannes <U+FFFD>skarsson of ccp?"
10/10/2009,obviously no they did not!according to ccp that is.
10/10/2009,"quoting this so it's in my post and not editable by mazziliu. this should be reposted the next time mazziliu is up for election so people can mazziliu's own words on what they are getting with a vote... a ""player opinion consultant for ccp that is paid in free trips to iceland"" whos level of wrongdoing is ""not really made any more possible the longer they stay in office""inspiring stuff there."
10/10/2009,"as an aide memoire the following csm reps voted for this proposal.mazzilu, proposed the topic and took it to the csm with three supports on the thread and naturally supported her own proposal.zastrow j. voted to support the proposal.avalloc voted to support the proposal.vuk lau voted to support the proposal.(even though he wasn't there for the debate on the proposal, i thought that if they couldn't be there for the debate on a vote the next person in line was supposed to take over and vote and if there weren't enough people to make a quorum the meeting should have been closed at that point)the next csm election is coming up."
10/10/2009,"vuk lau, avalloc, and me wont be running next term. im pretty sure zastrow's support base will be even bigger when they see this thread and the fact he helped troll the crap out of you 5 or 6 guys. i suggest you do what the eveo trolls did with larkonis ""adam ridgway"" trassler and write our names all over the place and generally go ape****, im sure that will help"

10/10/2009,as a mini who could fly the recon ships but has never bothered to get one because they are useless. i support this proposal.
10/10/2009,"- incorporate market mechanics allowing market settlements at multiple price levels for one order and market exchanges to only be made within the current spread.nah, if there's a mismatch in prices, the benefit should go to the person who posted the order"
10/10/2009,"there might be a need for a qualifier or two on this proposal, in case something nda-worthy ever does come up in a csm meeting, but i certainly support the principle of it."
10/10/2009,"yeah everything nda-worthy is striken from the logs anyways and that is already mentioned. like the one time i accidentally pasted a password into the chat, ended up getting removed. or like when we go off topic and agree to remove the part entirely. those bits never make it to the public in the end anyways. but everything else, it's really not worth keeping secret since its nothing but discussion between players.stuff like the results of a vote right after it happens, we should be able to give it to people in real time. it generates more interest in what the csm is doing and puts less pressure on the secretary to get the minutes out on time, and generated less rage when the secretary inevitably does not get it done right on time(honestly our secretary does a better job then i would, that's a lot of work for a fakejob)"
10/10/2009,"sounds good in theory, but in this game so much is tied to one's name. whether or not that shows up in some sort of history is irrelevant."
10/10/2009,"yes, but incarna is still some way out in the future, so the csm has good time explaining to ccp the importance of having a cool name when roleplaying!"
10/10/2009,not supported.
10/10/2009,"why would your choice of name change just because you can walk around instead of flying around?unless you can present some kind of pressing reason why this is even necessary, much less desirable, i'm gonna say no."
10/10/2009,for some roleplaying is important.
10/10/2009,if it was that important to them they shouldn't have facerolled across the keyboard when they created their character.
10/10/2009,"this, tbh."
10/10/2009,"i've been testing t3 cruisers for a while at the sisi and flew them much less at tq. very nice ships, overhelming most of t1-t2 and... extremely expensive. that's why i do not fly them a lot at tq.really, i can't imagine a person who can easily afford the loss of 1,5 billion isks ship.i think this is the time to make some changes to the t3-materials price or invent some smaller/other class t3-ships that will not be made of gold.may be, the solution hide in inventing some ""spacecraft enchancements"" that will apply some characteristics to the ordinary ships occupying their rig-slots? something like ""xx% reduction in projectile turret powergrid needs per level"" and we could see the thrasher fitted with 720mm arties that will surprise someone a lot; ""+5% to all shield resistances per level"", ""+20% of stasis webifier range per level"" etc. i am speaking about all the bonuses of t2 ships implemented in separate upgrade modules applied to the t1 ships. i don't think this is a ""brilliant idea"", and whilst i'm not a professional in game design i can't predict all consequences of it implementation, but i beleive this is an actual subject to discuss."
10/10/2009,"eve is not all about combat you know. there is mining, industry, trading, transport and other professions. not everyone plays the game for the pew-pew.yes... it can be boring out in the mining belts, watching the roids pop, seeing the occasional rat impale itself on your swarm of defensive drones. so .. what do we do to pass the time? chat with other miners...we share stories of real life, and of eve. where to find good belts, what corps and alliances to be wary of, who can flips, and who is a member of the hulk jihad. now and then, we fleet other miners to get the mining bonuses. they are not corp mates, just other fellow capsuleers out at the coal face.helpful folk get tagged blue, can flippers orange and gankers red.this is where relationships start. flagging people with positive or negative standings at an individual, corp or alliance level is where you start the process of reviewing someone for an invitation to your corp or alliance.of course it can work against you too. if i get can flipped by one player, good chance i'll flag their whole corp orange. so don't expect me to help when one of their newer miners in a retriever is under attack by rats and is pinned against roids with shield failing fast. sure i could launch my t2 drones and deal with it ... but ... your corp is no friend of mine, and well... i'd have to recall my mining drones...if only you, your corp or your alliance had a positive standing, i'd launch combat drones, start remote repping, call in help from pvp corpies, fleet you for mining bonuses and offer to help you haul ore.standings mark the foundation of relationships and are the seeds of corporations and alliances. they are a very useful tool and core to the goal of people moving away from solo play and towards team play.any call to be rid of the standings system (and to limit flagging in general) sounds simply like a ploy for a pirate based player to hide their poor standings or negative security level."
10/10/2009,i couldn't have said it better myself. my corp also marks red anyone we see admitting to (on the forums or in local) or actively scamming - just to help protect our members from them.and here you people thought i was reading crime and punishment for the fun of it.
10/10/2009,"wouldn't work. people are used to forming blocs now. this behaviour would not change because the ability to set people to blue/red ig has been removed.instead, you would end up with groups making web apps to manage their standings. every time you see a target, you would have to look for their name / corp / alliance in your bloc's fof tracker. it would end in frustration for everybody involved. i don't disagree with your sentiments, and i don't necessarily think what i describe above is a good thing, but that would be the prevalent ``solution'' to a standings nerf. that is not fun."
10/10/2009,"so in other words, you just want to make fleet fights harder to manage. that's idiotic. the standings system is, if anything, too simple. don't simplify it further for the sole purpose of making life harder. if your ship can see a pilot's name and corp ticker, it can check that against a standings list."
10/10/2009,"i've been playing this game for just over a month. i have just over 2m sp so i'd say i'm still a noob.my two cents:cent 1) the first thing i want to say is: leave the learning skills alone. they are fine and reward a long term investment in your character.cent 2) they dont take anything away from the game. they add choice and difficulty. do i want to run combat lvl 2+ missions and train cruiser and beyond, or do i first want to set myself up to be stronger in the long term with learning skills? this is the fundamental choice of life. do i spend my money on a new car now? or do i invest it and make more money to buy a better car later? the world if full of both types of people.im just saying this is the best mmorpg ive ever played. its very well thought out and very complex. thats why i like it."
10/10/2009,"i too would like to see some love given to lowsec, i get tired of one side saying lowsec is bad because its full of pirates (well it would be really wouldnt it...) and the other saying lowsec needs gateguns removed blah blah blah...what it needs is some sort of boost. it is supposed to be the dark underworld of eve, maybe have some (low powered) faction police there that are bribable to look the other way, a seperate black market that is lowsec only, make drug production available, possibly the implant trade... something to warrant the fact it harbours the criminal underworld of eve.i like the idea of teh viceroy thing, but maybe it should be more of a criminal thing, like the head of a holding alliance would be like a mafia boss, this kind of thing... mhow the holding alliance would become the godfather type would be a problem, but worth looking into."
10/10/2009,"make lowsec fluctuate. make that dependent on the average security status of the players in the system.one day it's 0.4, the next it could be 0.1, or maybe 0.5.good guys can gain a foothold and those who do so intentionally might manage to put up poss in the meantime, or reap the resources. or the bad guys can move in, and drop the status down. gankers and jan bradys in charge one day, missionbears and non-combatant corporations the next. would make things interesting."
10/10/2009,lol...carebear?it hasn't occurred to the trolls that i'm the one flying a cloaky? currently being carebeared by cloaky invulnurability.are cyno-jammers carebear? pos shields/guns?back under the bridge with you.
10/10/2009,"yes.to an extent... yes.as i've stated before, if one individual, afk in a cloaked ship is enough to prevent you and your corporation/alliance/naptrain from conducting operations in your system then you really should go back to hisec."
10/10/2009,"ah, i see, the assumption is that i want ccp to ""fix"" some meanie tactic that is threatening to me....project much?the proposal is purely for more interesting cloaky play, not to nerf anything for my benefit alone...enough said."
10/10/2009,no way.not supported.
10/10/2009,this. if you can't defend yourself (or your alliance defend you) what are you doing in lawless space?
10/10/2009,"sometimes i think they should rename this forum crybaby hall.not supported, cloaked ships cannot do anything but cloak and watch. you want everything handed to you in easy mode. why not go full ret@rd and ask for concord in 0.0?"
10/10/2009,"ok, well, i've apparently touched upon the sacred cow of ""don't tread on my cloakiness""...so i'll let this die.but, i will have it known that the idea occurred to me while bopping around in enemy space in a stealth bomber; not as a ""defend me ccp!""...but as a ""wouldn't it be interesting if..."" moment."
10/10/2009,oh ffs. not more anti-cloaker ****.if you want to carebear in 0.0. just do it. just have friends nextdoor ready to come save you. it's pretty effective.i'm a massive carebear. dont be a poossy. admit when you are a carebear. just try to also point out that carebears can pvp also.jammers? u betcha. posshields? u betcha. guns? not so much.seriously. the new sov system is designed to give pvpers or at least the fcs/alliance leaders who make isk to get protection forces out there. cloakers are meaningless if you have friends nearby who are going to protect you.
10/10/2009,this is a terrible idea an no i dont have a guardian/basilisk alt that follows me everywhere *twiddles thumbs*
10/10/2009,"there's absolutely no difference between a rep alt that's neutral and a rep alt that's at war with you.in both cases when it reps you can shoot it.you suggestion would result in you being able to shoot it even when it's not repping. but it's a rep alt. so when it's not repping, it's docked or logged off.even if the alt also has some other purpose / role (like an l4 isk-making alt for example), it's very easy for him to avoid enemy combat pilots (insta undocks and eyes on scanner for probes).tl;dr: there's no situation in which you will kill a rep alt when it's not actually repping during a fight, even if you do have kill rights on it because it's at war with you."
10/10/2009,it doesnt change much of the mechanics. it just lengthen the aggression periods for the repper everytime he enters the fight.
10/10/2009,actually you can shoot a rep alt that isnt repping when its at war with you. and these non actively repping but not aggressed alts are one of the most annoying things in empire wars. fairly common despite your beliefs.
10/10/2009,"now that we kind of see more or less what wormspace is roughly. i think the construction of outposts should be allowed. the thing is. no sov in wormspace. so the system has to be tweaked. since no sov. no sov should be required. furthermore due to that change on how outposts work. also with the double reinforced outpost changes in dominion. they should be pretty much siegable at all times. also no restricting who can dock or anything of the sort. all the outpost controls more or less go away. no docking fees, no taxes or anything.true homesteading in a system that will be fairly difficult to manage."
10/10/2009,no. wh space shouldnt turn into k-space 0.0.it should be harder to live in it.
10/10/2009,this.
10/10/2009,"let's try to get all these api suggestions in before, say, october 15th. try to keep them short and to the point.one problem i've come across myself, is with the membertracking csv output. the newline characters in people's titles aren't properly escaped within the csv file so using php functions like getcsv are broken when people have titles with newline characters. you pretty much have to use the xml output because the workaround to be able to use the csv output properly uses some pretty complicated regular expressions.lets try to stick with simple easily implemented api suggestions that will give the greatest returns. i dont have a lot of time left in the csm term to do very much followup.---------------------------------------------another suggestion made by a corpmate:"
10/10/2009,"api method for listing blueprints, please.at the moment, listing (your|your corp) assets will only tell you what blueprints you have in the hangar - ie you have a thorax blueprint. it does not indicate whether or not this is a copy, the me level, or the pe level.currently, you can only get that info from the industry jobs method. the information here can be stale and requires the bp to have passed through one of your lab/production slots at some point in time. even if you were to sort that cluster**** out and turn it in to your bp master list, it could potentially be missing bps. not a good solution.tl;dr give me the s&i's corp blueprints tab via the api."
10/10/2009,"id like to see rather then an interdiction nullifier, a sentry targeting disrupter. this would allow frigates to engage on gates in lowsec without the fear of being two volleyed by the solo pvp deterrents called sentry guns. this would allow pirates to engage people on gates with ships smaller then battle cruisers, it would lead to light quick ganges of t3 frigs roaming, bringing more action to lowsec. this is also an advantage that nothing other then a super advanced t3 frigate has or should get.so ccp i beg you please let me enjoy frigate pirating on gates. even if i must pay 100m for a t3 frigate the ability to engage on gates would be worth it. what does the community think?"
10/10/2009,"it seems too powerful. i'd prefer changes to sentry mechanics to make frigs survivable(though not invincible), not a magic t3 subsystem to do it."
10/10/2009,i think that would be pointless. except maybe the opposite. the focused point you get immunity from. you still get pointed and bubbles still mess you up. so for highsec and lowsec where no bubbles exist. it brings value to warpcore stabs again. perhaps even putting a bonus there to reverse the warpcore penalties. gallente t3 frig could get also subsystems which are designed to use sentry drones. perhaps a massive tracking bonus for like 2 sentries. so the sentries become like anti-frig or cruiser.similarly the other races can get medium-large weapon fitting bonuses to do so also. perhaps we can restore the old stealth bombers with cruise on the caldari t3 frig.another t3 frig setup could be a crazy tanker designed to be able to easily active tank lowsec gate guns. yet not being quite as good as perhaps a hictor. with frig kind of dps. giving pirates small ships in lowsec.also where in the world is the 5th level of t3 subs?
10/10/2009,"ok you say, there's no pos nerfing. ok explain me this:i find a class 2 wormhole, when i enter there are 20 signals (if you don't thouch a signal it lives 4 or 5 days, they cant acumulate, the evelopedia say this)i install a pos, in the next dt (i dont touch any signal) there are only 3 signals.tsk, coincidence i suppose. but 1 moth later, we still haven't touched any signal, and i still have 3 signals o 4 maxium. this is my experiment and you say, no nerfing. can you explain me it??"
10/10/2009,someone else came into the system at another time and ran the sites? ;)
10/10/2009,...that many other mmos have already implemented in the form of a mature language filter.it's not a very intensive process. it's rather commonplace.
10/10/2009,"because the last topics on the agenda were discussed at fanfest and i was waiting for documents from ccp to finish them, i now have them received in my mailbox."
10/10/2009,"so does that mean they'll be published once you've written them up, or do they have to go back to ccp to be filed in the nearest convenient black hole first?"
10/10/2009,"it's still totally crap and also that's not the point, i asked if csm raised this issue with ccp or notgo back the wormhole space"
10/10/2009,"as has been mentioned in countless other threads... we were very vocal about it at the csm summit (i can't speak about fanfest, welp). however, from what was explained to us the changes were for good reason and not to shaft anyone in particular. as one of the old school scanner pros i especially hate the change and still argued against it.but as people of your ilk so often decree 'the csm has no power' (unless there's something you as an individual want changing then it absolutely must have power over ccp policy and game design)."
10/10/2009,csm 3 meeting 9 - sunday october 18th 16:00the ninth issues meeting of the third csm. issue submission deadline is october 17th 16:00.agenda:1: scan timer (dv & mazz)2: csm information release (mazz)3: scan angle buttons (dv)4: character lock no resale possible (mazz)5: redesign sb and eccm effects (dv)6:
10/10/2009,"ive already made a wiki page about the scanner. we could use that and make the changes you want, or you could make one yourself, send me a convo or something and we can work on it."
10/10/2009,"i don't know exactly how much the rest of the delegates during my term put in, but ccp asked me for how i would envision the new sovereignty system working, and i compiled a document listing my views and their application. how much of this actually made it into dominion i have yet to see, but it does appear that they weighed my suggestions along with other sources.they specifically mentioned that we were just one gear in the machine. they sorted through ideas from the csm, the forums, and their own dev think tank to come up with the new system. i'm eager to see what the new system is like, and how null security will change because of it."
10/11/2009,"sweet solutions, m8."
10/11/2009,"sounds sensible. in fact, i like the idea of a ""timer"" being user-defined.there's plenty of players who don't want the terminate / sell functionality."
10/11/2009,small bump
10/11/2009,"the reason this isn't done is probably because of the same reason we don't have different icons for bpo's and bpc's. takes too much resources.i would still love to see it and while doing it, add meta 1-4 tags as well."
10/11/2009,"nah, this is different. the client has all of the data available and doesn't need to make a query to the server to get a bpo/bpc status of an item."
10/11/2009,1
10/11/2009,"what a bunch of little babies...love the tears chumps, keep it rollin!"
10/11/2009,hey yes
10/11/2009,the little buggers definitely need some love.
10/11/2009,i think its time to break out the man eating furriers...
10/11/2009,"i think you misunderstood, my point was to stay involved (here on the forum) and keep it constructive. if each person who ""ever"" signed this drops by once a week and catches up, tweaks a few concepts and makes a constructive suggestion... it will stay on top, it will be reflected by the huge amount of posts to the thread and ccp will feel the pressure to re-examine the concept.personaly i applaud your efforts and the efforts of all that have contributed to the concept ""topic"" as well as those who have tried to refine it to a acceptable proposal...my comments regarding knocking csm's, campaining in the thread for a csm job or irrelavant and useless commentary was in no way pointed at you. i am simply trying to drive home the point that...if the csm who origionaly pitched the idea dropped the ball and didnt drive the concept home properly, didnt follow up, didnt make proper notes then lets not associate that persons shortcomings with the whole csm project or people currently doing the job. support those doing their best and if anything assist them.any proposal submitted in albeit rl or in this game should be tweaked and brainstormed. (i think most of that has been done)formated in a way that highlights the advantages of the change, the downside if any and how to minimize that downside making implementation smoother and transition to the new system as as painless as possible.then, document the support and if need be call for every pilot who wants to see this implemented to submit a petition or direct mail the development team... a cut and paste support statement and request for change could be posted and easily pasted to the petition box and sent in a matter of minutes. the real issue here is to be heard and stressed that as a paying customer you (we) feel the matter was not properly addressed and the community wants it to be looked at a second time.petitioning is a valid and constructive means to getting those that represent you to listen. the trick is when they do then its essential you have it properly formulated and laid out in easy to understand concept, implementation and support.i have no desire to be a csm or representative (as i stated its a thankless whipping boy position) however that said i would volunteer to spend the time ""on this idea"" if the current csm, you or anyone with a ear to ccp will run with it... ""i as i am sure many would sit down and write a serious proposal.""if those supporting this can put aside childish remarks, knocking csm's for doing their best and contribute by editing the proposal with constructive and workable ideas a finished product could be presented and then a mass petition organised filed or mailed to show the overwhelming support that this concept has."
10/11/2009,"from the '09 keynote:this mindset needs to be applied to pos's current implementation. this idea fundamentally improves the game experience, instead of anchoring a blob of mods it changes to building a starbase. also, i find it funny that had ccp actually investigated this idea when it was first posted, instead of saying ""too tough, not going to try"", they might have even found the ferrogel pos exploit."
10/11/2009,"i'll bite, good job compiling the well received issues/suggestions."
10/11/2009,"yes, especially overloading.at the very least, holding shift when clicking should turn overloading on/off"
10/11/2009,"#1 it isn't your salvage.#2 the loot inside the wreck is yours.#3 my basic assumption is ccp didn't want you cluttering up the system any more so they put can of loot inside the wreck instead of spawning 2 things every time something dies. therefore the wreck obeys all the standard aggro mechanics. #4 salvage comes from things other than missions.#4a the wreck from a ship loss belongs to the corp that lost the ship#4b those wrecks shouldn't be yours#4c they should belong to the npc corp you just shot.#4d this is actually broken, the loot shouldn't even belong to you#4e every time you loot from a wreck you should get a flag from an npc corp, and absolutly no wrecks other than wrecks from your own corp should be lootable without a flag.#5 in conclusion the mission runner should get concorded for performing any aggresive action to mission loot.how is that for an easy summary why your conclusions are wrong. the only reason you can perform agressive actions to wrecks is because back in the day to many people got concorded for using a smartbomb (when you could smartbomb wrecks). you are basically making a tweak to game mechanics to keep you from blowing yourself up for doing something stupid as the crux of your argument."
10/11/2009,"wrong again.dear ninja looters, you killed those rats ? no! you can salvage without kills ? no! you need someone who make kills or you can't salvaging! you can scanning out the abandoned wrecks ? no! you scanning ships who make the mission.ninja looters=parasites!!!!"
10/11/2009,"easy to prove it how you do not have truth.just the killers can tractor beaming the wrecks, the others not."
10/11/2009,"guys, can you help please.i'm trying to get this dead horse into this thread here, but it's really heavy. i can't manage it by myself"
10/11/2009,"oh god, why is this thread still going? it's already been resolved. salvaging is not theft. the devs have already said so. please just let this asinine thread die."
10/11/2009,sure
10/11/2009,"ideally, i'd love to see this as an option extendable to all characters. sometimes i'm not as interested in seeing what an avatar looks like as i am in seeing what corp and/or alliance they're in.

10/11/2009,"makes sense to me, supported."
10/11/2009,"i was just thinking the exact same thing. i use a mobile internet connection where i pay per mb and that is why i like eve - it is generally low bandwidth.having thosse tiny icons load in that list serves no positive purpose really, and goes against one of the major advantages for eve.supported"
10/11/2009,yes!agent avatars did not use to be there and standings worked much more smoothly. i have absolutely no idea why ccp introduced them.
10/11/2009,yes please.
10/11/2009,good idea for this reason alone.
10/11/2009,save your rage for fall of 2010 when i will run
10/11/2009,i'd say let incumbents come back after they take a term break.
10/11/2009,"to date, most of the people you have insulted or looked down upon mazzilliu have been informative in their messages with the exception of drake draconis who doesn't seem to read or interpret english correctly (you won't have my support if you ever try for a position such as a judge dd).again, the people on csm who voted for an extension of the term limits are, with no surprise, the people about to get the boot. in many newly formed democratic nations it is common to see this, it's only natural - people are power hungry and like to suppress their fellow man.on the issue of your position as a csm representative, regardless of what you want to call yourself mazzilliu, a consultant is commonly experienced and professionally educated in the field that they are consulting on. furthermore they are impartial to the issue they are consulting. so far, it just seems like you've breached both those requirements, am i wrong?this can only conclude that you must be a politician in which case your duty is firstly to the people who elected you to your office and secondly the greater player base of eve online. of course this is contradictory to the rules of the csm however those rules are in conflict of being re-elected. i can't see any reason we would want to give you more power, you clearly can't handle your present duties.on the case of the cost, only 10%, 8% and 9% voted in years 1,2 and 3 respectively. these statistics don't indicate that it's getting better and most likely, that only a small section of players know about csm. these are in a sense hidden costs because most of the players don't know they are paying for them in their subscription. that said, a permanent consultant would be better as they would atleast take the suggestions made in petitions and what not seriously for once instead of brushing them aside."
10/11/2009,"mazz, your performance at the fanfest csm-panel was impressive. after arriving late the only thing you contributed with was ""thanks for voting so i got a free trip to fanfest"".i can see why you are aiming for the fall 2010 term next."
10/11/2009,"i was really divided on this issue, cause its not pure black/white decisions. looking for my perspective csm 6 month term is actualy extremely short, and the most unthankfull thing with csm is that fruit of your csm office will be visible in best case for the duration of next office, and as we saw you can wait even for 2-3 more terms. continuity of csm is also tricky cause basicly its all up to dedication/willingness of the delegates who are continuing their terms to pass the procedures and help the new candidates. as much as i can only express huge thanks to ccp for idea of csm both as regular player and csm candidate i still think there is a lot of place for improvements in tools csm shiould have for better work and for better continuity but anyway back to the topic.i initially voted yes for ccp to generally reconsider 2 term limit of csm candidates, but then again as much some current/past csm delegates should have been allowed to be in csm for as long as they are getting enough votes, then sadly there is more people who shouldnt be allowed nowhere near csm. at the end i know there is no perfect system cause if we look our politicians its the same **** as huge percent of them should be publicly crucified, but instead of that they are leading our countries thanks to voters.what is something that extremely annoys me is the people running for csm for the free trip, 6 months of free gameplay, trip to fanfest etc. i know i would run for csm even if there is no trip to iceland at all, and when i was running 1st time we didnt even knew we will get free time. at the end i have faith in ccp that they will make good decision about this matter."
10/11/2009,i speak and unederstand english just fine.. how ironic that the one who thinks i don't agrees with me regardless... even if he didn't mean to.vuk - i find your insight quite disturbing... in all honesty the only reason i would run for csm is to make sure that people got heard... that's it. and even then i'm not convinced its worth my time.the trip in all honesty while great and all that... doesn't really interest me.i'd rather be playing eve : o p(aside from meeting ccp face to face but still)i'm not into the drinking and partying bit... but that's just me.
10/11/2009,"i never thought on you when i said that, but i want to throw up when people are openly talking about that during campaign, get elected :facepalm: and then still have decency to talk around how they applied to csm just for kicks, free trip..."
10/11/2009,"i think you'll be pleased to know that right after that i went back to taking a nap and nursing my hangover. i really would like to know who hasn't taken their fakejob seriously on the 3rd csm. seems like everybody at least contributed something, even i did. it seems like the ccp guys have a general idea of who has pulled their weight and who hasnt so i am pretty sure the ccp veto of anyone over 2 terms should be pretty effective for keeping away people that dont deserve it. the metrics for performance are pretty simple... the number of issues, and the significance of the issues raised"
10/11/2009,"welp, in the end, each person on the csm was voted for by players.if the players vote for the village idiot, and then are up in arms because that persons decisions are stupid then all i have to say is:what did you think was going to happen?term limits are a double edged sword. you restrict the time you get with the good ones and restrict the time you get with the bad ones. all the events that have unfolded in these last several months reflect that having a two term limit is a good thing."
10/11/2009,this if nothing else convinces me that there should be no change to term limits. csm should not be a recurring free holiday for powerblock idols prepared to put pictures of themselves on the internet.the term limit keeps things honest. and it challenges the community of eve to keep finding new representatives to serve their time on the csm and then go back to the player base and enjoy the game.this thread was quite ill-advised and the discussion of this extremely unpopular issue cannot be other than a waste of csm and ccp time.

10/11/2009,"hey back when ships had 25% less ehp then a 1 minute aggro timer to redock/jump wasn't completely retarded, but now that every single ship with a trimark or two on it takes at least 2 minutes to die then 1 minute aggro is dumb as shit.personally, i'd like a 15min timer on aggro for docking since this would even make it possible to kill nerds who camp undocks in capitals, but whatever, change it so i at least have a chance at killing a trimarked abaddon with less than 5 ships and i'll be happy.thanks."
10/11/2009,"woah, radical awesome idea bro, totally supporting this"
10/11/2009,15 minutes is maybe a bit extreme. personally i would also like aggro to follow you through gates but w/e.
10/11/2009,"hey thanks man, your support means a lot to me!"
10/11/2009,"supporting this, least 5min on station docking. if you're gonna change gates max 2min, changing it for gates has its bad sides too. just don't mess with the re-dock timer when not agressing."
10/11/2009,frigate: 60secscruiser: 90secsbs: 120secscapital: 240secs
10/11/2009,"yeah, not sure if it makes sense to change gate timers too much since it's possible to have tackler on the other side of the gate, but station hugging is just all around gay."
10/11/2009,something like this would be great.
10/11/2009,"i second this, a much better idea than a fixed timer (especially for cap ships which can take alot of damage before dying)"
10/11/2009,nobody has suggested fleet target and fleet fire. i think you're trying to make mountains out of molehills.we're just talking about an align option for the fc and an align option to bookmarks. that is all.
10/11/2009,"supported.those who are against it are showing dissent only because it's getting so much support. in other words, get out, you are the minority."
10/11/2009,"sorry, but no. an fc is a commander, not a controller. why not added ""fleet target"" and ""fleet engage"" while we're at it?"
10/11/2009,"because those don't make sense, dimwit."
10/11/2009,"if you can't convince your fleet they should be aligning, then you shouldn't be fcing, or your fleet should be playing attention.all i'm saying moving a fleet should be an exercise is fleet command. i think commanding a fleet takes a certain amount of skill, and making sure you can get your fleet to stfu and pay attention is part of that."
10/11/2009,"fcs have enough to do without worrying about idiots lagging behind because they failed to align as commanded. this feature would take one less worry off the fc's shoulders. of course there will always be morons who **** around with their ships and get out of alignment or otherwise don't follow orders. for that we need a ""kick from fleet and pod right back to their clone."" but i digress. supported."
10/11/2009,"there is a 'kick people out of fleet and send them back home to a pod' option; its called making them primary.honestly, though, supported. you armchair fc's can sit there and say 'oh fc's shouldn't be able to control the entire fleet' or 'why not just give fc's the 'fleet target' and 'fleet fire' option, but when you get right down to it, having a a fleet align option can save your pilots ships when they need that split-second to avoid a doomsday or a bomb."
10/11/2009,"""nah, if there's a mismatch in prices, the benefit should go to the person who posted the order on market, not the one who did it instantly.""there should be no benefits to standing order posters nor to those filling the orders. if i want an order filled instantaneously at best buy or sell orders posted. 1 order should be enough and able to fill this order at multiple price levels that people are willing to sell/buy it for. having to enter each order individually is cumbersome and far from a well designed market mechanic. ""who cares? if someone wants to do this to manipulate the averages, and pay 1% on their fake trades to do it, more power to them. rl stock markets are trying to be fair, eve stock markets are trying to be amusing. and rl stock markets don't charge fees by the individual trade(brokers do, but the market doesn't), so there's actually a bigger disincentive to this in game than in rl.""actually its a big flaw and the percentage sure is an disincentive, another would be to ban trading with yourself. there would be no harm in incorporating such a counter measure. i'm not sure where you get ""eve markets trying to be amusing"", the market is there to ensure low exchange costs, transparency & good information, not to be entertaining, eve sure has other features to handle that? even if it wore entertaining, i rather have it make economic sense then randomly designed. care to elaborate on ""and rl stock markets don't charge fees by the individual trade(brokers do, but the market doesn't), so there's actually a bigger disincentive to this in game than in rl.""indeed its the brokers charging the fees, such independent market brokers are absent in eve, such fees are thus injected by the market mechanics. who charges the fees has no impact on the incentives of economic agents. ""those ""broker fees"" are more properly listing fees. you want an order to be posted publicly on market, you pay a fee. you want to just fill an order, you pay no fee. the cost is for advertising, not for trading.listing an order and filling an existing standing order on the market has the same basic mechanics behind it, looking for an exchange, the only real difference is the price asked/offered. there is no advertisement involved, you compete solely with your price, the price is your advertisement. and there should be no penalty for asking/offering for a higher/lower price. for a good working market, there should be little to no barriers to trade, inconsistent broker fees are exactly the opposite, within some price intervals, forcing sellers & buyers to accept posted prices. if your price is to high/low, you're likely to be under/over bid and you have enough competitive incentives to change your price."
10/11/2009,the only market change i'll support is allowing all items to be traded...your changes?no way.not supported.
10/11/2009,what 0.1 isk buyorders are bad?how is that a problem?how is that?sure. ranging from 0.1 isk to 10billion.should... but usually doesnt. the whole trade of traders who go around making isk by those who are selling their goods below the price of buy orders elsewhere. is good.ya and that's why there's no such thing as wallstreet. oh wait... it's called wallstreet.costly mistakes in my eve? nevar!also market manipulation. bahahahaa. i so wish i had the kind of isk it takes to do that. if someone has the isk to do it. i hope they do.so they are avoiding the fees by having the other person pay them? ok sounds good to me.
10/11/2009,"simply there would be no avatar pictures. the size of the person in local/chat/fleet would be like 1/3 the height and no picture. it would show everything else like the name and related icon like a skull/blue/red for standings and stuff.this would be less load time (i assume so, i'm no programmer) and would allow to see more intel without having to scroll as much.sound good?edit: also there would be an option to go to classic avatar mode."
10/11/2009,yeah there is currently too much advantage for guys like you that hide towards the bottom end of local. meanwhile most of us a-e guys show up in local instantly without people having to scroll.
10/11/2009,so... you giving support? if so pls give thumbs up.
10/11/2009,"leave it as it is i say. and having an ""s"" name has nothing to do with me not supporting it."
10/11/2009,"it wasn't important 6 years ago, but it might be important now."
10/11/2009,i am sure there was also role playing 6years ago.
10/11/2009,"that is true, and completely out of topic"
10/11/2009,"not really. your reasoning for the name change is ""you need new names because of role playing"" but role playing was already there when the picked their name. so nothing changed. no need to change names."
10/11/2009,"people change, everything change, that's the way of nature."
10/11/2009,"i propose that the current system of security ratings be changed so that in low sec you can only read a characters security rating when they are on your overview (or in the case of a -10 flashing red). consider piracy at sea, how can someone spot a pirate ship a 1000 miles away? it is only obvious that some other ship may be pirating when they start shooting or ignoring radio communications to keep their distance. solo -10s currently have too hard a time as people read their sec rating and dock up or leave the system."
10/11/2009,"indeed. or perhaps extend it so that you can never see the security rating on a player's info, but only the colourtag on the overview? tht way when someone is on grid, they'll appear yellow or red if their sec is low, but otherwise all players appear equal, unless you know otherwise."
10/11/2009,tissues?(not supported)
10/11/2009,"cry more. that's what you get for going -10.since we're looking at this from an rp point of view, local is not dependent upon on-board sensors -- or else local would exist in whs. instead, it is provided by the stargates and supporting infrastructure, and notification of recent criminal activity and long-term security status is a feature of that system.strongly unsupported."
10/11/2009,"ahem, to the above trolls, im not -10. i was starting a debate on what could be done to make the game more fun for many solo players, prob doesnt concern you."
10/11/2009,"i'm really not clear how this would buff low sec solo piracy. it would seem to be more likely to result in people being more paranoid than ever in a ""better safe than sorry"" kind of way."
10/11/2009,"here is why this won't work.1. players stay out of low sec because once they jump into a low sec system, they are blobbed by 10+ pirates.2. once player is blobbed, they either don't have the isk for a new ship, or learn from their mistakes, and don't enter low-sec.3. player never returns to low-sec, meaning less targets for you. even if you ransom the player, any kind of ransom will usually make whatever their doing no longer be cost effective, meaning once they leave low sec, they'll never return. if all level 4 missions were moved to low sec only, players would just stay doing level 3 missions. within 2-3 level 4 missions done in low sec, they'd get their mission battleship popped. not very profitable.until there is something to do in low sec that is absolutely massively profitable that so many players go into low sec, low sec will be empty. its not profitable."
10/11/2009,so i'm a troll because i disagree with you and use logic to support my point?i didn't realize that eve forums were slashdot.
10/11/2009,how about remove keys all together? eve isnt for dungeons.
10/11/2009,"in my experience, the keys are not so much a problem as static complexes are.it doesn't make any sense either. why would the angel syndicate put a drug trade post anywhere, where it gets raided each and every day, every hour?remove static complexes entirely and most of the key issue is gone."
10/11/2009,"go further - kill statics and make exploration a little bit more profitable. make ded's have a bit better drops, or even a few more of them within new eden.absolutely agree. static plexs need to go."
10/11/2009,a t2 fitted/t1 rigged t3 cruiser costs you about 700m atm. (depending on your race)your suggested ship changes would make it too overpowered.that said ... not supported.

10/11/2009,too overpowered. really.
10/11/2009,"well if you go look at ammo. you can find faction ammo. go look at scan probes. you can find faction probes. why is that? well the item's value is so low per unit. contracts would become extremely frustrating.so how about adding all the cheap mods to the market. price out centii a-type thermic plating. it's worth like 1mil. how many dont even get sold? i suggest putting them on the market. much easier that way.the same thing can be said for even the expensive faction mods. raven navy issue. why not list it under ships - battleships - caldari? not much else is there on the list. not like you are necessarily spamming market with it.where to draw the line? im not sure exactly. should we have a new category? ships - battleships - blood raiders? then have only 1 listed. should the category just become ""pirate"" or something. or just leave those out?how about officer modules? should they stay on contracts?how about uniqueish things? interbus shuttle, guardian vexor? pretty sure they shouldnt be on there."
10/11/2009,supported
10/11/2009,"how about this - the market is for buying and selling stuff. not ""stuff, as long as it's common enough"", just stuff. all stuff."
10/11/2009,"yeah, but the option to sell them on contracts should still be there. i don't see any reason why stuff shouldn't be available on the market unless it was contraband (funny thing is, you can sell contraband on the market)./support for what hersch said"
10/11/2009,all items should be on the market.
10/11/2009,"i'm not so sure how it's hard to manage. if things were to stay exactly the same with these changes, sure, it would. i anticipate that things would change dramatically politically. it creates a newer political landscape. it revives the role of corp within alliance rather than alliance within a block. i have trouble believing with these changes you would see the political landscape stay the same. do you realize that when alliances first came out, before standings were introduced and log before ccp had the player population it does today, alliances were similar, or the same in size. shouldn't they naturally grow larger as the game grows larger.instead, because of the blue mechanics, blocks have been the path to growing size. most of the major alliances have migrated to much fewer, much larger corps essentially reducing the political mess that is large corp management schemes making alliances virtually 1 voice. sure corps still do their own thing, but not like eve's past. if people make war hard, they're doing it for 2 reasons with these changes. lack of organization, and lack of communication. right now, the extent of communication with other entities is as complex as, ""we're at p5 fighting, warp in and shoot the reds"" even with the largest of battles with multiple fleets, it's very simply a matter of getting friendlies on grid, then they shoot whatever. the only time it becomes more complex is when you have to focus fire on a very strong rr group, usually carriers... and all that requires is coordinated fire. this would push warfare to a new, and more engaging scheme. it would require planning when and where other alliances will come to the field. it will require more understanding and identification than the simple point and shoot non blue philosophy. read the forums, and typically you'll find the most fun battle reports are 3 way engagements, where it becomes a very awkward question of who to shoot and when. it creates tactic, political interest, and a much more significant role for corp and alliance structures rather than blue structures.right now the question is, are you willing to blue someone. it becomes a much harder question if you have to let them into your alliance to get the benefits of standings.for those in empire who set red standings to thieves and gankers, that's an issue with game mechanics and the harsh reality of what eve offers. a red list dumbs down the game. the point is to have risk and reward. a red list removes way to much risk. can gankers, rr out of corp, and all those ****ty tactics are mechanical issues, they have nothing to do with a red list problem."
10/11/2009,"first off, anyone who supports this needs to just stop crying. this what i saw as the benefits to the learning skills which take what....a month to get everything to 4?? which drops everything else from 16 days to 8 days or whatever with implants?1)it lowers your training time, you don't want to train it then don't.2)while your training it you can get aquianted with the game more. reading the market about other skills and other things you might want to get into. why does everyone assume that everyone knows exactly what they want to train from day 1?? i'm a 06 toon and i still have trouble what i want to train next when a long skill is coming to a close. it's not a time sink its a time buffer. you are gaining something while basically putting the game on pause. take the time to ask your corpmates questions. look at the different items in the market, read the description on all the different skills you can train.i actually have 5/5 training time. i put in a lot of time for that. i chose to do it and im satisfied. new players complain about everything. i don't want to lose my stuff, i want to be completely 100% safe wherever i go. i want to pvp when i want to not when someone shoots me. yet you pick this topic because you don't want to train the skills because your lazy. train it or don't. nobody is forcing you. thats my rant"
10/11/2009,"ok problem is... those who have spent months training all to max suddenly get hurt. those who plan to train soon could be hurt. those who havent trained at all are being hurt. newbs who want to know what to train... are told learning skills even if that's a good idea for an alt... it's not for new players.that's more or less the problem in a nutshell. remove them: so what i spent months of my training to get them all to lvl 5. suddenly im just plain old losing them. that's like just randomly taking hac, recon, carriers, and 2 other skills at random. you think maybe that's a bad thing? time and effort people put in.reimburse them: so i trained them all to 5. now you reimburse... meaning char upgrade? so just for having the opportunity to have in the past trained it. i get to keep it. while those others who in the future were planning to do the training get railed?or reimbursed as in skill training time? applied to skills at random or by choice? no thx. rather have learning skills and be able to train faster.change them: to what?all these suggestions though would royally **** me off. after all the nerfs ingame. it has been very very rare for them to take something from the players directly. just look at the highsec capships. quite the threadnaught came from that one.learning skills arent a problem really. best way to fix newbs is sort of boost that 100% training time thing. they get 100% until 1.5mil sp or something. make it 200% so long as they havent trained learning skills or something. if they try to train learning skills. they get warned that they will lose their 200% bonus. perhaps even bump it down to 100% if they do. they can even make it @ 1.5mil sp that they should go do the tutorial on skill training or something which @ 1.5mil sp to 2mil or 2.5mil that they should train their learning skills. so from 1.5mil(when they lose their skill bonus) to lets say 2mil sp. by training learning skills then. they retain the 100% bonus then.hell if you do that. you could even leave the 100% bonus from 0 to 1.5mil sp. it kinda impresses upon them to train learning skills after 1.5mil sp. which is what they are doing during their first month of playing. then they train for those better guns and such."
10/11/2009,"no, learning skill should stay as it it now."
10/11/2009,"agreed, learning skills should go. but i would like to get something out of it as the 2mill sp i've put into them represent a huge chunk of my 10mill sp character.a possible solution would be to give double training speed for double the amount of sp that one is loosing. that way you get everything reimbursed. i'm not sure if this is technically possible but it sounds to me like the closest it can get."
10/11/2009,"that's a losing argument. the game designers have decided that it is, in fact, broken. they just haven't figured out a way to change it that doesn't **** everybody off.don't take my word for it, here's soundwave and eris discordia responding to question about ``the learning skill problem'' during the new player experience presentation at fanfest earlier this month."
10/11/2009,"i have trained all but one of them to 5, and i would do it again, but alas, i realize how silly they actually are. i'm amin/max kind of guy, but i can totally understand that other people aren't. i can understand if people are agianst a reimbursement, but i wouldn't mind getting something in return if they where removed.either way, i support a solution, whatever it be."
10/11/2009,now im not gonna get into any sort of huge elaborite story but...heres a few ideas i have for changes: the buy/sell order screen needs to be broken into a skill tree setting just like when your looking to buy items you click on a section (engeneering) and then other options drop down to choose from. if our market buy/sell orders were set up the same way it would be a lot more helpful instead of having them all in alphabetical order. it would help you better manage what your orders are and keep things more organized. second would be to give us a green/red percentage on our products we are buying/selling. i know there is one when your selling but i wanna see them all the time. last it would be very good if we could see what regions our trades were in. for example. if i place a buy order in verge vender and then i jump to amarr and place a sell order id like to be able to see in my buy/sell orders what region thse are in. thats my 2 pennies... i welcome yours
10/11/2009,revived and updated... *yay*
10/11/2009,"this could work. let's assume a corporation/alliance (group a) wants to be active in a lowsec system, group a will pay rent to the sov holding empire faction, they exploit the system to repay their rent and make a decent profit. by being active in the system, they make it save enough for new agents to settle in (migrating agents), rp-wise: the agent couldn't settle down earlier bacause of npc pirate activity in that system.the agent supplies missions (30% in current system, 70% 1-2 jumps out in another lowsec system), with the agent(s) the lowsec system will be able to nurture more players, making it a safer system to be active as a player.because the system keeps it's original security rating, rivalling corporations/alliances (group b) will be able to raid the system, without npc intervention (except when at a gate/station) or sec rating loss for a player.this way, pirate corps or players can have their share of small fleet pvp, while carebears are able to improve their profits. to make this work, titans and super carriers (moms) should be restricted to 0.0 space, give alliances the time to prepare for 0.0 by building up assets.50% of all station profits should be given to group a, since they are providing security for neutrals in the system (neutrals in lowsec can be like renters in 0.0)"
10/11/2009,"with teh introduction of saving and trading fittings, why not allow us to buy and sell fittings?i thought of this as i was workign on fitting my typhoon last night and couldnt think of a fit for a rr gang. so i thought wouldnt it be conbvienint if i could go to the market and buy a typhoon fitting. perhaps sell them in packages you get the fitting as well as all the mods?it could use some refinement but i think it would have benefit to eve"
10/11/2009,"sadly, no, unless it came with some kind of rating option so that people could rate the fittings after they bought them, there's too much room for abuse where people make crap fittings or joke fittings and put them up on the market or on contract as ""l33t fittings"", scamming poor suckers into buying the crap. plus, the price would drop to a few thousand isk instantly, as there's no limit to how many copies of the fit could be made, and in reality everyone and their dog can make the same fitting and put it up online, turning it into a useless endeavor overall."
10/11/2009,"simple allow us to input and save orbit preferences and keep at range preferences. allow us to type in say we want our ship to orbit at 50km or 4km because that where our optimal is. its a simple enough request not asking for uber god mode modules or i win buttons, just asking for the ability to set my orbit.helps missioners so they can orbit with long range weaponshelps pvp'rs so they can orbit with medium to close range weapons"
10/11/2009,you can already do that.
10/11/2009,try right clicking the orbit/keep at range buttons...
10/11/2009,"they only give you a few options for keep at range its 50m 100m or 500m....???? when will i ever need to be 50m from something. for orbit the max you get is 30km what if my guns optimal is 40km?? what do i do? all i'm asking is ccp allows us to imput our orbit ranges, maybe in station you can type in your ""default orbit"" to be whatever you choose so when you undock you still get the same options, but also you have the ability to set orbit at your optimal"
10/11/2009,on the selected items window you got an orbit and keep-at-range button. right click on those.
10/11/2009,uber fail on my part absolute complete fail.... i'm sorry im a noob.... *self desctructs*
10/11/2009,how can any new alliance be able to claim a system in 0.0 space if they are all takin.'i lloked on the map and all the systems were in sov except a few by the jove empire...so what now?
10/11/2009,in b4 flaming.tons of sov up for grabs.only a couple sov 3 jammed systems at all.sov is wide open lots of places. though yes. it's very static. aggression is bad for business so the more friends you have. the better it is.the new sov system in dominion will fix all this.
10/11/2009,how so?
10/11/2009,how so?...what are they doing exaclt...i saw fanfest on youtube but i didnt understand the new sov plan...whats going to be differnt?couldnt the wealthy and powerful corps and alliances just come in and take it all?
10/11/2009,this forum is not about asking general questions.maybe try it in the general discussion forum
10/11/2009,"the point is that in the new system the incentive for alliances will be to compress into smaller spaces and develop their systems rather than sprawling across half the map, that paying ccp a sovereignty tax for 100 systems that only get used by one guy every other week is a pointless waste of isk, and that without having massive r64 incomes attached to a many million hp space needle empty systems will be much more easily disruptable.and yes, this is the wrong forum for this thread."
10/11/2009,how do you get to the systems east of the jove empire?
10/11/2009,set destination. go through gates.of note. the 3 jove regions you cant goto. well most people cant goto. there is legitimate ingame methods of getting to jove space. though i dont suggest going. nothing has been updated in awhile and everything looks pre-premium client.in the off chance you're speaking about cobalt edge or perigon falls. refer back to first sentence.
10/11/2009,this forum is not about asking general questions.maybe try it in the general discussion forum

10/11/2009,"they abused their interns too much... who knew they'd die so quickly, throwing em in a meatgrinder was just a practical joke!"
10/11/2009,incarna & dust will require a lot of additional staff and the planned/expected subscriber increase incarna will bring will allow ccp to recruit more peopleif you were smart enough you would also have noticed that dust is nothing more than an alternative marketing plan...

10/11/2009,"i know people have asked about larger tractor beams and have been suggest other ships were the bigger sizes etc.what i'm wondering is if there was a down side to have a skill or something that makes the tractor faster?? bad idea? i've thought about it as how it could be exploited, but you can only tractor your own wrecks and loots anyways, so why not just make it faster?the other thing is that i was wondering if we could suggest since eve is getting somewhat old and pretty stale in animations. not that the graphics haven't been upgraded which they are and they are very pretty. i'm wondering if they could somehow work on some of the hulls for certain ships (or even the color of the exhaust) i love the nyx and the megathron, abaddon next....actually most amarr ships are pretty (i fly gallente so no bias here). also the deimos with the green look and the green exhaust make it a very pretty ship to look at. some of the ships can be worked on a little. complete hull overhaul or something. i don't know exactly if this would require a lot of work code wise. i don't doubt that some artists out there would like to put a touch to it though.yay or nay??"
10/11/2009,well the issue is. doing this would make lewting easier and thusly more people would do it. this devalues lewt and salvage. so there's a pretty much double edge there when just looking at those salvaging. now calculate the mineral changes due to the extra lewt or even meta 4 stuff. mineral changes due to mod reprocessing would hurt miners. more meta 4 stuff hurts 0.0so just by adding this one mod to make lvl 4 runners more convenient. it hurts so many others. so why would they do that. of note. the module exists already. they only need to publish the item basically. they chose not to for those reasons.you must be new to eve because it has been brutally changed several times now. the issue is that they want to keep the minimum requirements low for crappy computer people to keep playing. doing any drastic in bring uber quality to eve can have subscriber issues. that being said... you should check out
10/11/2009,"there are actually 4 skills for faster tractor beams:1. marauder -> ships: golem/kronos/paladin/vargur2. industrial command ship -> ships: orca3. capital industrial ship -> ships: rorqual4. strategic cruiser of your choice with ""emergent locus analyzer"" electronics subsystem -> ships: legion/loki/proteus/tenguhope this helps.and you ship changing suggestion is too unspecific.not supported.(edit: i failed at counting)"
10/11/2009,"sorry i was unclear it seems. i'm not saying graphics wise. i do understand that eve is a lot prettier then it was in the old days. that i realize. however, no matter how many shining lights you put on **** it still is ****.my point about the ship change is that we all have ships we hate looking at and wonder how did they make it. mine is the dominix and a few other ships. leave the ship basically the same just change the hull design on it. thats what i'm suggest is just a hull change thats all. not a huge graphic overhaul to make the image come out of my screen and hit me in the face. just that there are some ships that look really bad and some that look really awesome. how about changing the ones that look bad into something that looks awesome, or at least decent on the eyes :).scorpion looks ugly too :)*edit* you were also right on the velocity increase on the maruaders. didn't realize that, always thought it was just range lol since all the arguements i've read about salvagers was about range. i never had a problem with range just speed. apologies"
10/11/2009,i consider the basilisk nice. my corp mate thinks it is the most ugly ship in eve. and i think his beloved dominix is just ugly..... still not supported.
10/11/2009,theres no pleasing you is there?? lol....they could make your basilisk look even more awesome and the domi even more awesome. change isnt always bad. :) but if you dont support it thats fine. just suggesting
10/11/2009,"these screenshots demonstrate everything that is right and wrong with eve online.before i explain, allow me to make two introductions.logit probit is a scumbag who ninja-salvages other players' missions near a highsec mission hub. he's a parasite and a griefer. on top of that, he doesn't honor ransoms. he runs an association of similar players, who choose not to incorporate mainly because it makes retaliation difficult.i'm a 29-year-old ph.d student at a midwestern american university. i'm married, have a doberman puppy, love to ride my motorcycle, and i help my landlady take out her garbage. i'm a researcher in the areas game theoretics and mass behavior, and i love playing eve online.if you are a mission-runner, logit deserves your scorn. however, give me a chance to convince you that logit is your best friend at the same time he's the biggest pain in your backside.as ccp is well aware, eve is great because it's a sandbox. the lack of constraints on us in-game allow numerous steady states of group behavior to arise. in fact, there are so many different behavioral equilibria that it is difficult for any one player to experience more than a few of them. even within one profession, you will see different tactics in different regions, even if the strategies are the same. mining ops in one area will be organized differently than ops in another area; fcs in the north operate a little differently than russian fcs.multiple norms of behavior allow the events to occur that make eve amazing.armageddon single-handedly destroys a 40-man highsec mining fleet with a surprise suicide attack.trusted broker's conscience gets the best of him; commandeers stolen unique ship and returns it to the player it was stolen from.bank ceo absconds with hundreds of billions.legendary alliance destroyed by espionage.in other words, eve is great because the unexpected occurs.there have been other games like eve, sandbox games that were great, but were ruined because well-intentioned changes rippled through them, destroying behavioral equilibria. a classic example was the addition of rare tools into star wars galaxies that could prevent gear from decaying to the point where they were unusable. this change was meant to preserve the hard work of some of the game's most dedicated players, and to encourage rare item use in pvp. however, the change disrupted the player-made economy; demand for high-end crafted gear evaporated, incentives to hunt for looted crafting components disappeared, and swg was soon hemorrhaging 10k subscriptions per month. swg had unintentionally constrained the variety of fun behaviors and interactions.while ccp has maintained minimal constraints on behavior, its track record is not perfect. for instance, the introduction of jump freighters has reduced the number of viable behaviors available to those who enjoy the challenge of long-range, heavy-volume commerce. soon, a comprehensive set of structural constraints will be introduced into 0.0. while the changes may turn out for the best, it is a fact that increased constraints reduce the possible number of behavioral equilibria.in other words, with more rules, the unexpected becomes less so.on the 4th csm, i'll dedicate full effort to exploring the unintended consequences of the big changes that are coming to eve.logit probit may be a horrible bastard, but i'll be on my best behavior, and i'll do everything i can to preserve that sweet spot in eve where the learning curve is just a little too high and the barrier to making horrible mistakes is just a little too low.trust me, that spot is where we all want to be.now get out there and run some missions."

10/11/2009,that's very true... let's see how this turns out.
10/11/2009,"so after your first thread in c&p failed you try again here?fake edit:also, those 2 screenshots seem to be the only ones you got."
10/11/2009,link to geddon thread?
10/11/2009,you get my vote ;)
10/11/2009,a csm manifesto that's well-written?almost deserves a vote.
10/11/2009,"this is a far better post than your ill thought out attempt to get c&p on your side.allowing multiple behavior patterns to evolve and flourish is a worthy goal, and keeping eve from becoming a wow-style themepark mmo should always be encouraged (my interest in that game died when blizzard banned players from jumping on rooftops to pvp in neutral towns, which had lead to encounters that were far more thrilling than any bg). however, simply being ""anti-rules"" doesn't lead to the full spectrum of potentially interesting behavior emerging, because a certain amount of rules are necessary for complexity to flourish. eve's economy is primitive - bartering and a simple marketplace system. because institutions like the eve bank and any stock/bond offering have to store their isk with the directors having access, the potential for fraud or theft limits the willingness of the public to do business with them. a character's reputation is the only safeguard, and that's been proven over and over again to not be an effective deterrent. a stronger financial sector could allow banks or investors to finance corp wars so that a smaller alliance would have a chance against a currently dominant one, offer different types of insurance, have more bond and stock offerings from industrial corps, etc. a futures market (puts and calls) would allow far more interesting options for manufacturing (and market manipulation). contracts could be enforced by allowing the betrayed party to sell or offer the right to a certain number of characters or merc corps to have kill rights on the contract breaker up until the insured value of destroyed ships equals the amount lost. mercs could bid on contracts to pod a certain number of players from a target corp, etc.there has to be a way to allow the corp theft and betrayals that we all love, while still giving some greater security to these sort of interesting interactions. i'd recommend creating a second corp type (""financial"") with a different rule set allowing for greater security but also limiting its options (so that it couldn't simultaneously be a merc corp for example). further complexity would come from things like putting rare types of asteroid needed for planet development only in a few systems in lowsec (and moving all ice and ""dense"", ""condensed"" etc. asteroids to the rest of lowsec)... risk vs. reward."
10/11/2009,"actually, a radical anti-carebear elected to the csm will do less damage than one that presents himself to be ""more balanced"". for this reason alone i encourage all the carebear haters and ""omg im s0 ub3r h4rdcore"" pvpers to vote for this guy. there's nothing like an idiot elected by idiots to represent them."
10/11/2009,"wait a second, you call people ultra carebears and gank people, pvp, pew pew, etc etc.but you hide in npc corp where you can't be war decced?i was trying to find a word to describe it, so i looked in the dictionary, found your picture under hypocrite."
10/11/2009,"that's odd, i could have sworn the caption read ""pragmatic"" not ""hypocrite"".so logit, since you so politely invade my sunday brunch and forum browsing, i shall ask you a question regarding your plans for your term.what do you plan on doing to get rid of this silly charade? what's that? none? ok, well i'll see you later then. o/"
10/11/2009,"sorry probit, but ur just as ***** as those you prey on, if you want any support get out of the npc corp and quit preying on dyslexic, pts afflicted carebears.disclaimer: i dont like carebears, but hiding in an npc corp to avoid the wrath of said carebears takes the cake imho."
10/11/2009,"i know my ninja-salvaging and carebear-killing isn't going to win me any support amongst the carebear community, and my lack of e-honor is going to turn off lowsec-pirates-with-a-hint-of-rp types.i'm not a pvper. i'm a salvager, and not a nice one. as far as exposing myself to retaliatory war decs, i've been there and done that, and it while it's all good and fun, it prevents us from doing what we like to do in-game.the fact is that anyone who i or my mates have ever destroyed has deserved to lose their ship.rule #1 of eve is: don't aggress in a ship you aren't prepared to lose.there are multiple, multiple ways to make ninja-salvagers go away; warping out, shooting wrecks, or leaving and getting in an actual pvp ship. carebears that shoot salvagers expecting an easy kill or no retaliation are making a mistake, and i'm more than happy to take that to the bank. it's part of the game.as far as the idea that some of these carebears have something wrong with them and should be left alone, you said it, i didn't. the internet is full of characters and it's not my job to pre-screen people for emotional problems before i return fire. if you don't think someone melting down in local over some pixels is funny, well, maybe eve isn't the place for you.finally, i find the idea that people can't separate their in-game persona from their rl behavior disturbing. personally, when i see a vehicle wreck in real life, i don't run up to it and break off a chunk, hoping the owner will then pick a fight with me over it so i can punch him in the face and take his wallet too, and i wouldn't do that even if the rules of society allowed for it.i'd like to keep eve fun for everyone, not just myself. part of that is making sure the implemention of well-meant changes doesn't ripple throughout the game environment, causing unintentional problems. i've got lots of experience modeling just those types of problems, and i hope that the eve community will give me a chance to contribute what i can. it would be the least i can do, and perhaps a fitting penance for my parasitical in-game activities."
10/11/2009,"is there a reason why you keep spamming the forums with ""elect me plox!1!"" threads?couldn't you just start one and stick to it?"

10/11/2009,this question will determine who gets my vote; are you for or against the stardrive on certain ships (t3 mainly)
10/11/2009,"there is something else i'm finding interesting about this guy. he states there that he is:i remember reading about some other researcher, who actually went as far as creating a paper based on his jerky and griefing behavior in an online game (city of heroes or whatever that game was).it appears to me, that some of these social sciences 'researchers' take great interest in acting in the most disruptive way they can come up with, in the name of their 'research'. i guess that is just as good an excuse to being a jerk as any other."
10/11/2009,"pretty sure c&p and eve-o general are separate audiences, at least for the most part.also, of course, i don't know latin. i've just seen the matrix. and i meant it as a complement, since you indeed seem aware of your nature.i'll be chilling here all day, whilst i watch football. nice to see culpepper on the field again, i always enjoyed watching him when he was throwing to carter and moss, even though i've never really been a vikings fan.anyway, matrix skye, let me ask. what is it about me specifically that attracts you to my threads? is it my desire for attention? my love of tears? the fact that i hide in highsec, in a noob corp? arrogance? hubris? a crappy portrait/stupid name? did i blow up your alt? now is the time to reveal your beef! drama ahead!"
10/11/2009,"yes. yes. yes. i find this particularly hypocritical and thus, interesting. yes. yes. no.i don't think so. no beef. i just like calling out bull**** when i see it. consider it my research :).by the way, have you considered posting your anti-carebear propaganda on the jita park speakers corner, where it belongs, instead of aimlessly spewing it everywhere else?"
10/11/2009,everyone from charles manson to jack the ripper convinced themselves their victims deserved it too. the ability for some people to rationalize like that allows them to do terrible things and not see themselves for what they are.
10/11/2009,um...it's a video gamenot denying i'm mean in the game though.
10/11/2009,"why would you decide to be 'mean' in a game though? is it safe to assume you'd act that way in real life if you could get away with it as easily, and have these desires and urges in everyday life, but hold them back and wear a mask simply because you fear your true self being revealed?"
10/11/2009,yea no....
10/11/2009,"1. the npc bad guys in this game aren't particularly convincing. if the sandbox is to function in any interesting way, somebody has to play the role of the antagonist.2. the barrier to entry for being a baddie in eve in terms of moral turpitude really isn't that high. should one also feel bad about beating somebody at chess?3. all that said though, from having read many of logit's posts here and used those to take some (admittedly internet-distorted; this forum in particular brings out the worst in people) measure of his personality, i'm prepared to allow that the guy behind the toon may well actually be a jerk of some description or another."

10/12/2009,"i think the security question is a valid idea along with the e-mail confirmation. another thing that may or may not help is to not allow important account info, such as email, until a safeguard has passed."

10/12/2009,i feel obligated to bump this topic since with the poor quality of the search filter it will never been seen again at this rate and i have gotten some good feedback on this issue
10/12/2009,agree. cans or wrecks r the same thing. ninja salvagers should get a job !!!
10/12/2009,"your wrongness if off the scale...where did you get that stupid idea in the first place?these are not arguments backed up with anything, neither is it constructive criticism of why what i suggest is bad, it is simply a number of statements, ideas and facts, with half of them being false. could you please answer to my arguments rather then stupidly repeating that the salvage does not belong to me over and over again? that is the only argument i heard so far pretty much, and no logical reason why it should not be done, like why it would be bad for gameplay or anything.all npc wrecks belong to the killer. full stop. you are not allowed to tamper with them without the owner's permission."
10/12/2009,"sorry i assumed you took ccp's statements as fact not your wants and desires as facts. the loot is yours without a doubt. the salvage according to ccp from day one has been a free for all. this is why you do not get a flag when you salvage a yellow wreck be it mission spawned or pvp spawned. i don't know how else to explain it to you, simply because mission wrecks do not follow the standard game mechanics for belonging to the person/corp that lost it. you can decry that everything in eve that you come in contact with is in fact yours but that does not make it true, nor should it. maybe a game with instances might be more to your liking? i say that because if something as small and insignificant annoys you so greatly that you will convince yourself despite the repeated counter statements by ccp that your opinion counts as fact when you are blatantly lieing to yourself and others by trying to claim possession to a universal good. but discussing facts with a person that is beyond reason is in fact pointless. i wish you good luck in your efforts to find more ways to isolate your self from contact and influence by external forces, but i warn you that is a fools errand in this game and more often than not when a isolationist idea actually goes through it has the tendency to bite the bears smack in the ass.but seriously can you actually qualify this?i'm reasonably sure if i flew up to a npc wreck i didn't kill i can loot and salvage it. the only time something in this game is yours is in your hanger. anywhere else aggro mechanics aside anyone with the appropriate cargo hold can do whatever the heck they want. you can call me ignorant, or whatever you please. i know and you deep in your brainskull know that you are just trying to lie to yourself and get others to believe your lie. it is an old tactic find a small basis of reasoning and pound on it until you believe the whole game revolves around it. however if you do manage to succeed and get aggro mechanics added for npc salvage loot you are the first to lose their mission ship to the new can flipping.pot kettle etc. why is your suggestion bad? honestly i don't care about salvage rights, however i do react badly to individuals trying to prop their ideas as proper game mechanics when they have no basis in fact, or any stated fact ever made. your premise is false %100 wrecks have been open for everyone to salvage from their inception in game. prove me wrong, the only thing that belongs to you aggro mechanics wise is that can that is left over after you salvage a wreck."
10/12/2009,"ok, i did not want to repeat all the reasons that i already named 3 times in this thread, but apparently no-one ever even reads the first page of the threat..you are looking for minor faults in my statements rather then talking about the point of this thread. so, first of all, i stated that all npc wrecks belong to the killer. now, you said: salvage did not exist on day one.. but whatever...that does not contradict my statement, you are allowed to salvage my wrecks, that is how game mechanics works, even though it is mine. skipping next 10 sentences as it is just insults.. yes, that is a fact, and you can check it by clicking ""show info"" on the wreck. you will see my ugly face on it. and if the owner is nearby he can kick your ass. owner has the right to protect his assets. that is what i am asking for. well, if you realized that is the sole purpose of this threat, so if you do not care about it, why are you arguing? gameplay is the only thing that matters, and it makes sense game play-wise to have the opportunity to protect something that you have created.why should ninja-salvagers be able to make millions with a 1-day character absolutely risk-free? they gate almost as much as a mission runner in his battleship, and they don't even have risk of ai shooting them, they do not need standings or anything. why do they deserve easier life then mission runners? that is what matters the most, not whether it shows owner of the wreck, or minor faults in my arguments, ui or game mechanics. it is gameplay that matters"

10/12/2009,"slaves/crystals: ccp already said in the testserver feedback forum they will look into that imbalance.snake: still make sense. their boost just isnt as good as before. but the extra 15-20% can be life saver. it will be interesting to see what afs with the speed boost and snakes will do.halos: they make more sense than before. sigradius tanking is very important now. try afs, try t3 cruiser, try hacs. they really benefit from their sig radius. commentators on the tournament were also assuming that pl was running the gang link for sigradius to make tanking the stealth bombers easier.cant comment on the talisman."
10/12/2009,"okay from what i understand from larkonis and vuk lau's posts was that the continuity is terrible in the csm and that the first term is more or less training. well, sounds like you want longer terms or a method to fix the continuity and ""csm rookie"" issue. i don't see why you need to have unlimited term limits to fix those problems. if anything, this creates more work for ccp as they now have to monitor the csm to determine if they are doing their job or not because they have this ridiculous ""veto"".i would gladly support terms changed from 6 months to 1 year or an overlapping system so the outgoing csm gets to teach the incoming csm but i definitely do not want to see anyone on the csm for years upon years.have you read the eve-o forums or played eve online recently? that's all players do mostly, they want themselves boosted and the bad guys nerfed so that they win. there are no formal organizations like real life political lobby groups yet but i am not so naive to believe that it cannot be done or hasn't already been done to some extent.lastly, this thread should be renamed ""the spazzilliu and drake rageconis show"""
10/12/2009,"in the sense of this issue, you need to define formal. formal in whose eyes? i'm fairly certain goonies have formalised their voting process to get 2 folks in, the probability of two getting in is low.on that note, mazz' stunt speaks volumes of information to major alliances. namely, that they can do what they want and get free cookies in the process for casting their votes in an organised fashion. prior to this thread, i was unaware that csm gets free play time, not that it matters much - a good trader can make 6 months worth of gameplay creds in the same time but it's the incentive which is problematic.csm gets too many incentives to increase the time frame they can run for. next thing you'll see is ccp paying for body guard protection on the flight and transportation to and from iceland .if your going to volunteer to do something, that's what it should be - volunteer work..."
10/12/2009,sums it up nicely.half year terms seem to be short when it comes to digging into the matters (and red tape). initially when i read the subject i thought it was about extending the half year into a full year and pherhaps cutting down the terms to just one.having csm noobs is a good thing since it minimizes the chance of personal agenda's being pushed. since csm aren't eve noobs there is nothing against having other perspectives from other players. this outweights the having to read into csm to get the job done imho.besides if you want to have a during influence and go to the fanfest every year you should apply for a job at ccp.
10/12/2009,"i think i will run for csm for the fall term too. i could use a free trip to fan fest. free 6 month of eve subscription. all kinds of stuff for myself. also the ability to push forth my own agenda even though the voice of the eve community doesn't want me to. after all, i know what is best regardless of their opinion. and just do this over and over and over...and once in a great while, bring forth something to the voting table that some non-csm low life so i can say i am a voice of the people.my people of course... muahaha.... muahahahahaaha!!!"
10/12/2009,"as i already said somewhere big powerblocks will always have their candidates in csm, and i dont see nothing wrong in there. if you could actually spent hour or two of your life instead of smacking 0.0 reps, you would see that most of the changes we will see in dominion and most of them were proposed by either goon reps, myself and i think jade constantin in csm 1.0 (i am talking about incentivizing 0.0, supercap changes and such). the funniest thing is that the big alliances like goons or morsus mihi will suffer the most due to all this changes proposed by us, so all the whine that we are pushing our own agenda before trying to make eve better place for everyone is pure bull****.extending csm term to 9 or even 12 months was my idea aswell, but i think ccp is against it.at the end i will repeat myself, there isn't perfect system neither in rl and naturally not in internet spaceship game, but there should be room for improvement for current one."
10/12/2009,"thing is vuk you shouldn't pretend that pushing the agenda of the people who elected you isn't a big part of the role. eve players are voting for you take their issues to ccp and try their best to get them into the game. this ranges from the little things like ui fixes and ship tweaks, to the medium stuff like boosting blackops and bombers - right up to the reinvention of 0.0 as we will shortly see.these are passionate subjects and players expect their representatives to carry that passion to ccp. if delegates were really only go-to-guys collecting forum posts and copy and pasting into the wiki when why bother having elections in the first place? ccp could just hire an intern to do that job and have done with it.the best thing the csm can represent is a vital and enthusiastic debate where many sides of the argument get presented and all the talking turns into good stuff. got to say i was pretty exhausted by all the butting heads i had to do with goons in csm1 but at the end of the day we managed to get stuff done and promoted the issues that the voting eve public wanted us to present. though i've not yet had the urge to do my 2nd term (mainly because i'm really looking forward to playing with the changes in dominion and frankly the csm is hard work if you do it properly) - i can say i'm glad i did it, i think it needed doing and frankly somebody did need to confront the status quo of the big powerbloc alliances and say what was wrong with the current sovereignty model.i'm against it too. i think six months is fine and two terms means you get a second bite at the cherry in a while (perhaps to see how your issues helped shape the game down the road). but keeping the terms relatively short and avoiding ""delegate-for-life"" rubbish keeps it fresh, gives everyone a chance to take their term and prevents the abuse of csm status by power bloc favourites treating it as a free holiday and beer fest.i can't disagree with that, but thats a long way from supporting a motion from a sitting committee to extend their tenure and privileges that got less public supports (3) than it did council members (4). to be honest that vote was an embarrassment and i think several of your current csm delegates realized that in the course of the discussion.this issue certainly doesn't represent anything the community is asking you to take to ccp and seems more about maz trolling people than actual practical reform.you should strike it from the submission list and pretend it never happened to be quite honest."
10/12/2009,can i be one of your people?!pleeeeeeeeease!?
10/12/2009,glad to know i'm not the only one here seeing this.
10/12/2009,"cross posted for emphasis:this reminds me of a recent us congress vote for pay raise even when we're getting lectured on how broke our country is from these same people. it's in nobody's self interest except the members of the body of voters. the players are obviously happy with the way the system works, even if the system is horrible. come up with a better proposal, or throw it away totally.personally i think the entire election system is a crock. it's not well published, it's not well maintained, and it's very much in favor of large alliances.it's sad when i read goon responses to a goon csm on here where they blatantly say i was told to support this so click. same goes for all the other csm's. most of the major support threads on here are a csm and his alliances backing after they were told on their private forums to go support it. if you look through the actual supports, it's 10% or less of independent voters even commenting on most issues.the forum is woefully under read, woefully managed, and poorly done.i think before the csm tries to force longer terms, maybe they should take a harder look at what makes this system so bad.for starters, how about an option to support or disapprove of a thread. i've seen 1000 post threads get 100 supports and 900 alts or replies detailing the thread more. surface value would say that there are 900 rejections of the topic, when really it's just a stiff debate between posters. how many threads get passed up because of this mistake?what about better publicity and handling of information from devs and csm. open ts night 2x a month, open csm only forum where topics can be debated by them for everyone to see. open ask-a-dev forum where issues regarding csm get a post, and no replies allowed until someone in the know answeres the question.how about an updated csm section on the website.open csm debate sessions on irc.etc.all those issues are far more important than the longevity of a csm."
10/12/2009,and yet again... agreed.
10/12/2009,"dont you think we didnt already proposed bunch of that/or similar stuff. it had to pass 1+ year to get semiworking csm emails and part of the forums where we can discuss issues internally. i dont want to sound as little whiner like yaay is :d especially cause concept as csm is something nowhere to be seen, and only having it live and going is huge success for a ccp as a company, but the fact is that csm delegates (esp. csm 1.0) had/have a lot of difficulties on their path. as mentioned we are still experiencing lack of support from ccp (yes i am whining again :d ) but i assume exclusively cause i think that ccp is undermanned, not due to lack of will to support csm as project. thats the same reason a lot of things yaay mentioned above are still dead on a paper. anyway this is bit off topic.as i already said i was and divided on this matter. sadly i had to leave the meeting due to rl crap before this issue came to the table so i voted yes, but mainly cause i wanted to see ccp view on this matter."
10/12/2009,"i will support any changes that will enhance the csm ability to do its job better.i absolutely will not support anything that removes/extends term limits. the reason they are there serves a very good purpose. only 3 terms into the csm and you want to remove the biggest safety feature. ""this seat-belt chafes my neck while i'm driving, lets remove it so i am more comfortable."" the solution would be to adjust the shoulder strap on the b-pillar lower so its not on your neck.i will not support a ccp veto on a csm member because they think they will suck as a csm member. the players voted them there so they should be there. the moment some csm member from say a power block is disqualified because ccp decides they are not good enough that power block will be up in arms shouting that ccp is bob or some stupid crap. i highly doubt ccp is sitting over expenses wondering if the free stuff is cost effective on your input. they make plenty of money and are doing just fine.you really should have pushed forth changes to help csm members do a better job during the two terms and you would have gotten the support of the eve players.you still have time to redeem yourself with the players and bring forth the needed changes you need to happen so the csm can better serve the players within the two term limit. unless of course you don't give a ****."
10/12/2009,"vuk, you don't need ccp to implement most of those changes. there are plenty of csm's, plenty of outsourcing that you can do in your alliances, etc to get most of that done. hell, be would probably host a ts session or 12 considering they do it every patch anyways.irc is like lol free.there are forums outside these.wiki could be vastly updated and more timely.if ccp is behind, it's up to you guys to make your positions work. if you don't have the resources from ccp, create them yourselves. you guys make it sound like such sacrifices you have to make to do this stuff. first, it's optional. second, you're reaping plenty of reward to justify the extra effort. hell, a trip to iceland is what, about 3000 dollars american pay roughly after boarding, food, etc?you can't blame us players for not having sympathy with you guys. right now, csm is a glory ***** position. if we got rid of all the alliance leaders who do it as a sidebar to everything else and got the less well known passionate players to do it, maybe we would have already seen these 2ndary changes occur. all we ever hear from the csm is lots of talk and hype and not a lot of result. maybe you guys should realize you aren't doing things right or efficiently."
10/12/2009,thats true aswell.
10/12/2009,"please yes. why it's not there already, i can't imagine.all those things would support continuity and encourage more player participation. lack of proactive outreach to the player population at large is the csm's biggest failing from my perspective. part of being an effective voice for the people is reaching out to inform the uninformed so that they too can step up and be heard. i don't see any of the csms doing anything to accomplish that. and it's not a lack of tools. the tools and mechanisms exist and are free. blogs and twitter come immediately to mind. relying on the ridiculously tiny viewport to the playerbase provided by this forum is pathetically short-sighted and frankly, lazy. despite i'm one of csm's biggest supporters, all i seem to see are people doing the bare minimum required to get their free trips to iceland. maybe i have a skewed perspective on what we players should expect from csms since it is based on how i'd approach the job. however, i am not impressed with csm's (lack of) efforts to inform, educate, and encourage players to participate in the process of getting heard. ccp hasn't really put their shoulder much into the yoke in this area either. but hey, they are footing the bill. given that and their familiar ""it's your sandbox, play in it"" mentality, i can forgive them for expecting the csm to step up if indeed that's what is going on behind the scenes. if there is evidence out there to prove me wrong, please by all means share it and i will cheerfully admit that i am misinformed and ignorant. wouldn't be the first time."
10/12/2009,great idea! alll my fives!!!
10/12/2009,"i don't necessarily support this; but i do support a fix to the station docking games mechanic. if you make the period too long, then the cooldown time after any fight is going to just suck.don't artificially expand it to an arbitrary limit; i like this guy's idea. oh ... wait, that's my idea.if you go with that, then no buff to the ehp of any ship is going to cause this problem again. you want to fight, or you don't want to fight -- make a decision."
10/12/2009,not supported
10/12/2009,sounds awesome! go for it.
10/12/2009,"pretty simple. make isk-seller reporting quicker/easier.a way to do it directly from chat would be nice. they tend to spam in channels where the chat is already moving pretty quick. ""right click> report isk spammer"" would be cool."
10/12/2009,"this suggestion has been brought up many times and it boggles my mind why it hasn't yet been implemented. definitely supported!also, if you right-click on their post in chat and choose report isk spammer, preferably it would log that chat post that you right-clicked so ccp can clearly see that yes, they are very identifiably an isk seller."
10/12/2009,"sounds like a good plan, along with the chat-log idea."
10/12/2009,"what would be great to have is the ability to multi select items and sell them, instead of having to do them one by one. if you have many items that you would like to sell it can be tedious going through each one at a time..thx"
10/12/2009,yes please. bad design is bad design.
10/12/2009,i think the issue was moreso. you sell something. it comes up tell you the price of each item and the regional average and blah blah.do you really want 200 of those windows opening up all at once? not really. but how about a sort of window like the reprocessing window. you can still see the important info you can uncheck any that might be at bad prices or bad average. then sell the rest.while leaving the same 1-off window.
10/12/2009,"supported, as long as it takes into account the fact of creating sell orders (what the advanced button does today)."
10/12/2009,"supported, but you should still have to create sell orders 1 by 1, in my opinion, as you're going to need to set those prices by hand. mass selling to buy orders can be more or less automatic, however."
10/12/2009,oh yea of course i didn't mean have tons of windows but thinking on the same lines as you with the repro window..sell items similar but ablity to edit prices of course
10/12/2009,"i can agree with this so long as there is other fields than just what to sell. have a checklist of all items with the price people are offering to buy it at and the variance from regional cost should help. ccp might turn this down due to the additional load on the market server though, so we'll have to see what they say. for now, agreed."
10/12/2009,i have been waiting for this for a long time but there would need to be assurances that 1 it would always pick the highest available price and b that any items that are not sellable will be put back in your hanger and not do that bull**** where it freezes the whole operation midway through to ***** at you
10/12/2009,a much needed improvement.
10/12/2009,i'm surprised this didnt come up during pvp roundtable. or maybe i did and missed it while watching.
10/12/2009,"seems reasonable. if warp fleet exists, this should too."
10/12/2009,supported!
10/12/2009,yes.
10/12/2009,"sorry just can't support this, you might as well turn fleet members into drones if the fc can do anything for them."
10/12/2009,yes
10/12/2009,"imo, the usefulness of this idea seem to outweight the negative notion of puppeteering."
10/12/2009,supported
10/12/2009,i love this idea!
10/12/2009,"as i've played other mmos, i've noticed that some games have a tendency to give special items to longer-term players, and i thought eve could possibly do the same thing.the problem? the reward would have to be something that wouldn't mess with game balance, but would be cool enough to be worth having.the problem perplexed me until fanfest, when i was struck by a bolt of inspiration.new players who buy the boxed game get an interbus shuttle...so that is something the dev's feel won't imbalance things. but since newbies get it, what would make it a good reward for a bitter vet?nothing. unless of course, the bitter vet shuttle was re-skinned to look like oveur's beer ship! (as seen in the video here.)so i propose that all players who have played for a lengthy time (my personal selection would be 5 years, but i'm sure the timeframe could be negotiable) should get their very own beer shuttle with which to fly amongst the stars."
10/12/2009,"you have played for 5 years but do not remember getting the apotheosis? long time vets play eve because it is one of a kind and fun to play. new expansions are probably the #1 reason why people play eve for so long not because they get some worthless ornamental ingame item.if anything, people need to be rewarded for turning their trial account into a paying account and some rewards for new players to keep playing for the first 3-6 months to get over the newbie hump and understand the game fully and realize how awesome it is. vets don't need anything, really."
10/12/2009,"actually, i wouldn't qualify for the beer shuttle if it was set at 5 years playing, i'm not a bitter vet...merely slightly cranky working my way up to bitter. (although i remember my apotheosis, but that was a ship everyone got, not just the vets (not a complaint, it was a nifty little shuttle, merely a statement of fact))imo, the reason vets play any mmo for years is because they enjoy it, and not for the trinkets...but little trinkets can be fun."
10/12/2009,i'd go for the 'i played this space mmo for over 5 years and all i got was this t-shirt' t-shirt.
10/12/2009,"according to the gm's, a csm member can bring any idea to vote, even if it has no player support. i'd like to see this changed. main reason:this forum is useless to a point with these rules, the csm do not need player support on anything to bring forward, so whats to stop them ignoring this forum all together and just voting on ideas they have all the time? the players might as well stop supporting ideas.(extream view) yes it would be bad thing but it can/could happen as there is nothing inplace to stop it.details can be hashed over but something like a csm member cannot bring to vote an item that has less then 20-30 player votes of support."
10/12/2009,"agreed. maybe something like this. ""for a proposal, request, idea or demand the thread in question must be at least a week old and have a minimum support of 50% respondents to that thread.""however, just before we get too deep into this topic i would like to point out a good reminder about ccp's actions.mazzilliu pointed out that a previously unsupported topic was picked up by ccp regardless of the lack of support simply because it fell in line with something they were doing. this indicates that they aren't serious about making csm a strong political body to promote ideas and suggestions that the players themselves find would improve the quality of the game. on the same token, not many players have the time or resources to play ""watch-dog"" on the assembly hall either. therefore i don't see anything really being contributed from this."
10/12/2009,basing any hard rules on what the csm is allowed to discuss on the number of supports is absurd. that number is so easily ``stuffed'' that it isn't funny.
10/12/2009,"the least problem is bringing any issue for discussion due to simple fact that if issue is not valid, it will be voted down."
10/12/2009,"while i like the theory behind the idea, the problem you'll find is one of vallot box stuffing by alts."
10/12/2009,"not supported. the entire point of csm is that you elect people you trust/believe in, and they have freedom to show themselves."
10/12/2009,"this reminds me of a recent us congress vote for pay raise even when we're getting lectured on how broke our country is from these same people. it's in nobody's self interest except the members of the body of voters. the players are obviously happy with the way the system works, even if the system is horrible. come up with a better proposal, or throw it away totally. personally i think the entire election system is a crock. it's not well published, it's not well maintained, and it's very much in favor of large alliances. it's sad when i read goon responses to a goon csm on here where they blatantly say i was told to support this so click. same goes for all the other csm's. most of the major support threads on here are a csm and his alliances backing after they were told on their private forums to go support it. if you look through the actual supports, it's 10% or less of independent voters even commenting on most issues. the forum is woefully under read, woefully managed, and poorly done.i think before the csm tries to force longer terms, maybe they should take a harder look at what makes this system so bad. for starters, how about an option to support or disapprove of a thread. i've seen 1000 post threads get 100 supports and 900 alts or replies detailing the thread more. surface value would say that there are 900 rejections of the topic, when really it's just a stiff debate between posters. how many threads get passed up because of this mistake?what about better publicity and handling of information from devs and csm. open ts night 2x a month, open csm only forum where topics can be debated by them for everyone to see. open ask-a-dev forum where issues regarding csm get a post, and no replies allowed until someone in the know answeres the question.how about an updated csm section on the website.open csm debate sessions on irc.etc.all those issues are far more important than the longevity of a csm."
10/12/2009,mazzilliu says alot of things....none of which where said by ccp or quoted or documented.as for the op... not supported... you need to outlaw alt posting in assembly hall before you can allow such things to take place.not that it prevents people from using alternate accounts... it still eliminates the problem of alt posting.and ironically i have to agree with yaay's sentiments... the csm should be looking at other things other than prolonging there lifespan.good idea... but you got a few roadblocks to bust up first.
10/12/2009,"during one of the fanfest videos posted on youtube, the browser team says ""someone said something about oauth and openid, we may make our own""....crack smoking?so how did ""making your own"" browser work out?straight off on the same path again? brave.... and stupid.every single social network is going openid and oauth.while ccp walks off in their own direction with nothing in hand....most of the new functionality being talked about is exposed through javascript hooks (so 1990s) which means only ccps new browser will work. out-of-game most sites designed for this browser will simply error.this could mostly be done with standard remote authentication schemes without locking any browsers out.then the social network has none of the features of any standard social network.no opensocial?..... without openid and oauth api access there is no real increase in functionality for api users.why bother? if users have a choice between ccp's dodgy social network that fails at most things, and a 3rd party that offers all the modern convienences.... why would a user visit the ccp wasteland?need a clear picture from the social network and browser teams explaining why they are deciding to go off in their own direction. are they in-fact planning to not implement any open standards like they keep hinting?"
10/12/2009,"the real world:stand-alone/web app:* eve players authenticate via openid with 1-2 clicks.* application is given oauth tokens for the user, no more api keys.* application can interact with eve via shellextensions or local api/library.* api encryption provided via oauth.opensocial app:* user can install the app on social network of their choice, ccp, facebook, myspace, avatarsunited etc.* application can authenticate user with openid/oauth and consume eve api on their behalf.* application can interact with eve client via shellextensions, or browser addon/toolbar (which then uses local api/lib).* api encryption provided via oauth.eve client integration:* browser addon/toolbar or os level shell extensions all browsers could be made to support the new hooks.user options:* user can use the browser of their choice. software that tries to do everything, usually does everything poorly. thus users like to have software specifically built for each purpose. i.e. browser for browsing, spreadsheet for doing spreadsheets.... benefits:* all browsers and all applications benefit from newly exposed features.* users can use tools with igb or external browser equally.* apps writen for cosmos work on facebook and elsewhere.* developers can use existing libraries for managing authentication and apis.* developers outside the eve community could develop apps for eve and cosmos where they see a market.* ccp benefit from countless hours of existing work.* many, many, many more!ccp's world:stand-alone apps:* still require api keys.* can't trigger interactions with eve client.* no encryption is provided.opensocial app:* sorry our social network isn't social.eve client integration:* only available from ccp's browser when used in-game.benefits:* security, as only the igb can use anything or benefit from any new features.user options:* user is unable to open urls in external browser (or choose their default browser)* removal of shellexec: extension means external browsers have zero access to eve.* users who choose to disable igb are met with brick-wall.* user has no real options. igb or nothing.result:* miss out on each new feature being leveraged across the whole net within any technology.* cosmos sold-short, can't provide what others can, no unique selling point.* igb the only way to access anything, killing user choice."
10/12/2009,fully supported.this cosmos thing could be so much more useful if ccp would ditch the whole not-invented-here mindset.
10/12/2009,"i did some easy readup on openid and oauth.since i know nothing about how these mechanics works, i can only asume that openid and oauth somehow interacts with the client during the session.since the ingame browser will (bah all those layers) using awsomeium, they said something about the site not being able to interact with the client. or at least not send stuff to the client since it all gets rendered into a picture. perhaps that's the reason that this will not work?i do however think that ccp is a bit overprotective with their white/black-list."
10/12/2009,"i would like to know if it would be possible to have the logitech g13 advanced game pad supported by the client. one of the main features i am looking for is to use the analog stick to control the drone cam. it would also be nice if the client would register the g keys when pressed, so that i do not need to assign a control+d key assignment to use the short cut all drones engagejust a simple request.thank you for your time."
10/12/2009,"wow that's a great idea, i second that"
10/12/2009,play eve with a joystick (found in technology lab)
10/12/2009,its not about flying with the analog stick. there is a bit more to it than that. looking for eve to recognize the g keys and that the analog stick will move the drone cam.
10/12/2009,"this should be an option, yes."
10/12/2009,"soz, i had to bold the important bit."
10/12/2009,so lets kill the game experience even more then? i mean jeez if your having to remove avatars just to make the game load quicker then might as well give up now..at least make it optional.
10/12/2009,'nuff said. i'm tired of having to play with the windows every time i join a new fleet.
10/12/2009,"in all honesty, role playing may be the reason why this should be supported. what if characters were to be married. what if there were a corp that had an initiation ritual and all members got unique nicknames such a sharkbait (ooh a-ha!).i can't say as i would support this as it. it needs some serious consideration, but yes, i think something should be done.no, i don't think i'd ever actually use it since i wasn't silly enough to pick redlion so many years go."
10/12/2009,"well, i'm living in hope for ccp to follow up on their nice words during fanfest about rp.but i do think ccp needs a push by the csms!"
10/12/2009,"i refuse to agree with lark(even though in this case he's right)*sigh*if you really came into this game with the idea of role playing (and hey, i love role playing - been playing d&d since i was 12, which was too long and too many kids ago to remember clearly), then you would have actually put some time into coming up with a name that isn't darth fubarl337dud3 or some crap like that."
10/12/2009,i came into this game for 14 days trial or was it 10 back then. and made a stupid name and an ugly face.
10/12/2009,i'm for anything that reduces the population of lo sec ratters and miners even more. lo sec is just way too populated with prey right now anyway.
10/12/2009,"worst reply ever.while i agree that this change is not going to work, not posting why or any kind of explanation whatsoever is just as bad as trolling.i think it would not help pirates at all.not being able to feel safe for a carebear is probably the reason why they dont go to lowsec.see what i did?you say: ""they will not be able to see the pirates""i say: ""they will think everybody is a pirate unless they can see their high security status"""
10/12/2009,in 0.0 it makes sense.... no law...in low sec... doesn'tconcord may not show up... but they still enforce the law(via your sec rating and opposed to cocorddoken/faction police)... that means if your flagged as a -10 criminal... your going to light up like a christmas tree.concord paints you as a pirate to everyone else... or more accurately... a criminal as some -10's are not entirely pirates... not that there would be much else.so your real life comparison is reaching at best.either way... role play or not... not supported.you wantted to be in the career of piracy... you pay the consequences for it.unless your talking 0.0/whs... because concord doesn't give a crap about it. :) other than just watching and keepin stats.
10/12/2009,"i don't think your real world analogy is very strong here. concorde monitors the stargates, they know exactly which ships and pilots are in a system at all times. as long as the technology would exist to know which pilots are in a system, it would necessarily allow them to determine which of those pilots were pirates. 'pirate' in the eve context simply means ""someone who has commited sufficiently numerous acts of piracy in the past' which you could tell at any range you could identify the pilot."
10/12/2009,"eve is all about choices and consequences. you choose to initiate battle on players, you suffer a sec penalty. there is a way to keep your sec rating above -10, but that involves shooting down npc rats (i.e. showing to concord that you're a good guy, too, and take out rats they don't like). it might also involve not podding pilots, as that suffers the sec status even more.that too boring for you? that's okay. that's a choice, and there is consequence.buffing something by removing the consequence of choices has never been supported on the forums, from what i've seen."
10/12/2009,"what you really want is for local to be removed (or put into delayed mode) for low-sec, and for some improvement to the directional scanner by which we can detect that someone is in our space, eating our cookies, and popping our friends.i'd even support that.what you're asking for won't help because you'll soon be marked red by any corp that's dealt with you."
10/12/2009,"here's a solution that may work...the plex can stay in the same system or even open it up to the same constellation, but it respawns after all the rats are killed and players can only re-enter the respawned plex every x hours or x days (a gate lock after you've already done the plex that drops after alloted time has passed).this would allow players to go thru the separate respawned plexes with random alts, but at least it would make them work for their money."
10/12/2009,"i don't like invincible plexxers, and if cloaks are a problem in plexes, simply disable cloaks there! not like the game needs more people using cloaks to hide from a fight."
10/12/2009,a change...a change that we can all believe in! :brofist:
10/12/2009,nvm
10/12/2009,"pretty self explanatory.cans help to organize inventory.for example you can have:missionloot in one can,fitting modules in one can,treasures and useless items in one can,industry stuff in one can,items you trade in one can and so on.its somewhat annoying because now all the fitting modules have to be in main hangar, which really makes inventory management harder. it may not apply to everyone but i am sure many would benefit from this."
10/12/2009,pretty simple question: how would the fitting manager know from which can it should pick the modules?
10/12/2009,you could tell him? select container from list?
10/12/2009,its still a mystery why we dont have all faction/deadspace stuff on market.
10/12/2009,"if you genuinely believe that, you're living in a fantasy land. alliance blocs didn't happen because it was easy, they happened because it was necessary - you and your friends made them necessary. alliances that stood alone got smashed by a certain band that was big at the time, alliances that worked together didn't. in the end, them, working together, destroyed you, essentially solo. coalitions work, and any strategy that works will be replicated. you seem to be suggesting that if your proposal passed, pl, goon, mm, rzr, tcf, ra, and a half-dozen other alliances would either merge or become enemies. that's just not going to happen, and you know it's not going to happen. ultimately, you're trying to use the csm to implement your nostalgia into game mechanics. not only is that a doomed effort from the beginning, but even if you succeeded, you'd fail. the game has moved on, and you can't bring it back to the way it was. you may have enjoyed your model of alliance structure, but 0.0 is a pressure cooker that destroys inefficiency, and your ideal has been found lacking. it might conceivably be possible to take enough of a hatchet to the game mechanics to make it optimal to build that way, but removing colour-coding of names in local? please."
10/12/2009,intention : goodidea: awfull
10/12/2009,"i don't assume that overnight, blue would turn to red. i expect that the greater wear created by maintaining blues in a structure that's not easy for them would over time wear relations. you'd see more friendly fires, less coordination on the battlefields (ie less need to have friends), and less overall wellfare brought by having an obvious friend in that blue square. uncertainty creates destruction. one of the truths now is, people hate dealing with long blue list, because it's a constant necessity to maintain and coordinate everyone on who is blue. imagine how much harder and therefore less likely it would be to have large naps when the ease of blue is gone. one mistake that people make imo is that bob died to the swarm of enemies that came upon them. yet those corps are still blue, they're gaining strength every day, and they are certainly becoming a threat again. bob collapsed because its core values were degraded. old hated new, new hated old, nobody understood what the purpose of bob was and it was a lingering image of something that was once good. if anything, what happened will be lead to a renewed, restructured bob, or it now. some people who were once part of the old ways will be gone, and the new found image and culture can thrive. good for them. the nap brigade on the red side didn't break bob, it kept them alive longer than it should have. the blues destroyed the old bob. it was not their way, it was not their philosophy, and it created a huge internal grudge between players. and that all powerful threat that was bob, it destroyed alliances 4-5 times it's size. i don't consider that a reason for people to react with 20,000 man naps. what it did do was force entities like the northerners to reassess their weaknesses and fix them. the mm, and rzr of today are so much better organized and combat hardened than the old, they'd present a much greater challenge solo."
10/12/2009,":troll:yaay you should be more then happy with all the stuff ccp abathur and ccp greyscale did in ccp new expansion dominion, internally known under codename ""the return of the molle"".now on more serious note, you idea is awful, and i would ask you would you propose the same 1-2 years ago when your alliance biggest strength was the zoo you were bringing with you in your campaigns.regardless of politics i proposed on iceland even more ingame mechanics for maintaining coalitions, but its bit offtopic know and my lunch is waiting for me.edited cause i suck in grammar"
10/12/2009,"actually vuk, yes. it's pretty well known that my personal feeling in bob caused a lot of head aches. especially on the last run. but it wasn't just me. i've truely hated what blue list are doing to this game.one of the reasons rqm failed so miserably in fountain was sels, aka abathurs take on how to run a coalition. he blued w/o reason, caused a lot of problems doing so, and the total cluster**** that resulted was the final failure of rqm. rqm had a lot of potential both before and after the split. before it all came down to communication. the leadership were all being told different things that didn't match up, and that lead to a lot of decisions that angered a lot of people. the second wave of failures came when sel decided to play numbers. anyone who know's sel knows he could run a good military, but was/is horrible with the political landscape of this game. that said, i like the idea's behind the new sov, i'm holding judgment on the actual execution. and that's partly because i've had to work with the source. something a lot of people don't know is during the first major attack on bob, back when we held feyth, i was very adamant about letting that space go early on. probably about 2-3 months before molle actually ordered the withdraw, i was constantly pushing for a withdraw and refocus. i hated what we were doing trying to hold onto allies that didn't deserve to be held onto, i hated losing friends who were much more powerful because of the idiotic politics. that so famous speech where i was effectively telling rise to get their **** straight and use some common sense was a reflection of that frustration. i did not like the huge territory we held, i didn't like the long blue list, and i hated everything that resulted from it. even more so, i hated the major wars we had to fight against 3000000000 enemies. it was fun the first few rounds when even with everyone attacking, they hit different regions and we could respond to smaller fights all over. it got miserable when it simply became about stacking numbers to win. the joke of warfare today is the temp blue crap. enemies become friends in an instant with a standings change to server a purpose. it's impossible to deploy any small army against someone because the fear is not the known enemy, but rather then unknown invited guest. order needs to be brought to the list of blues and reds. it needs to be more about coordination and not just something as simple as shoot the reds, ignore the neutrals and don't bubble the blues. it needs to be complex, confusion, that requires more effort than figuring out who's color blind.i don't fall into the usual category of the people i've been around in this game. i look for the fun and the challenges. i'm not one who waits for fights that i know are winnable every time, i take fights where it comes down to opportunities and execution. sometimes i win, sometimes i don't. sometimes it's my fault, sometimes it's just poor execution from the pilots. sometimes fights we should have never won, we come out with an unexpected of flawless victory. i don't mislead people, everyone know's that about me. while i may have been around people who do exploit the facets of this game that i hate, it doesn't mean i'm one of them."
10/12/2009,"+10 to attributeskill the learning skillsnothing else needs to changethats it, no point refund...nothing. ****es lots of people off so probably the right answer."
10/12/2009,"i have no idea what you mean by this. you mean in the order list? a bit wacky, but maybe. a ""region"" column in the order list i can definitely support."
10/12/2009,well exactly what i saw coming has happened. they buffed the guns a bit to make up for nerfing the guns.factor in reload time and the still limited range of the drones. revelation is still the wordfilter for dreadnought.add on top of that... gallente dreadnought skill bonus: 5% bonus to capital hybrid turret damage and 20% bonus to drone damage and hitpoints per skill leveltraining that to level 5 sure isnt worth it now.while say revelation's bonus makes a big difference. moros now is revs weaker brother.
10/12/2009,"i (like many perpetual low sec dwellers) don't view low sec as a stepping stone to null sec, as it is often referred to. my desire is to see it offer a unique game experience that is not available in either null or high sec nor is some confused hybrid. that experience could be created from tweaking a wide variety of existing mechanics: the natural resources available; mission, plex, and exploration sites/drops; market offerings; manufacturing capabilities; and ship/pos bonuses (or nerfs) to name a few. some kind of interrelated system or station control leading to increased profit opportunities but which is contestable would be cool, too. coming up with a holistic and balanced set of features would surely entice players from all play styles to make low sec their homes. however, until someone puts in that kind of thinking we'll continue to see what we're seeing now: either unrelated but highly focused proposals for specific mechanics changes (like reducing aggro timers) or more nebulous idea collections like the op's. a comprehensive makeover is what's needed to make low sec unique in its own right rather than the mediocre middle child that it is now. the op and other posters hint at some good ideas for this and i'm sure there are many more in other posts. the question is to what extent ccp is willing to consider changes to low sec. guess we won't know that til a feasible big plan gets formed up. meanwhile, i hope people keep throwing ideas out there for everyone to chew on."
10/12/2009,"i like your ideas and i think lowsec must be made profitable.implants manufacturing is a good idea, but most important, rats in lowsec should be the same as in 0.0dominion is supposed to make 0.0 interesting for organized carebears, i think lowsec with good rats (and no bubble) is going to attract a lot of ratters.about the battleships gatecamps: i think it's the best we can get, instant locking ceptors are too much for the poor little carebears. the real threat right now is all those sensor boosted hics."
10/12/2009,"how about someone who runs around asking everyone ""wouldnt it be cool if.."" or ""will this work?"" i can come up with lots of ideas, cant guarantee their quality, though. cant program them either. my best qualification is a rather darkly vivid imagination, unfortunately that is coupled with a rather undeveloped ability to actually write things down so they dont get misinterpreted."

10/12/2009,"similar things have happened in many other decent games to what is described in the op, tbh. ultima online for example"
10/12/2009,[snip]i'm gonna call shennanigans on you right here. you're utterly fos.
10/12/2009,"actually, if you read the study that came out of that particular incident (guy's name is david myers), it is quite fascinating. the idea was to examine how digital cultures in online games developed moral codes that were actually contrary to developer intent and establish whether they were valid as something of a test lab for sociologists. in that particular case, it wasn't particularly that twixt was a bastard (which he was), but rather that coh's players had developed a code of ethics around pvp that were not by design and would be considered completely ridiculous in other games (the standard eve player would laugh in your face if you complained about half the stuff he did). in essence, he simply used the game engine as designed and was nearly unstoppable as the social boundary in-game was such that no one on the other side of it stood a chance."
10/12/2009,yes. i have an idea - you shoot me in lowsec. you gain gcc. i teleport you to highsec. i win. that is exactly what he did. lamest excuse for a pvper ever.
10/12/2009,"note i said ""half."" while that particular tactic wasn't exactly high skill, it was permitted by game mechanic. a better example of why he was hated would be more akin to you ratting in 0.0, me jumping in and killing you without so much as a hello, and you complaining that i was somehow outside of acceptable behavior. as i understand it, coh had developed a gentleman's code for the pvp area that actually made pvp unacceptable without both parties agreeing to it. myers made waves by ignoring that particular bit of the code and sticking to the developers' stated reason for the area's existence.*edit* while i think the op is a bit of a bastard online (and i personally think that how you conduct yourself online says a lot about you in rl, at least on some level), he at least puts forward a coherent argument, which is more than can be said of others. if his qualifications aren't bull****, he's probably the kind of person that should be involved in examining game mechanics changes."
10/12/2009,"the guy didnt pvp. he teleported people into coh's version of concord. it would be more akin to someone with a -10 sec status getting thrown into a 1.0 system.. but even that isnt a fair comparison. it would be like throwing someone with gcc into highsec.. ohwait. i just ****ing used that analogy. because its right. i read the article, and it basically is him being a troll. sure, game mechanics allow it.. but thats because nobody abused it like he did. if more people did that, than you can surely bet that it wouldnt be a game mechanic anymore."
10/12/2009,screw the article. it's trash. read the study itself.
10/12/2009,"miscommunication here. in the world of intellect, what you just linked is called an 'article'. in the world of the common man, the crappy news stories on websites are often called 'article's as well."
10/12/2009,"yeah. he is doing an appeal to authority fallacy by appealing to his personal position as a phd nice guy (i suppose that is the opposite of an ad hominem attack).yeah ninja salvaging might be a nasty thing to do, but i don't give a damn if you're a phd, nobel prize winner, or a homeless drug addict with an internet connection who sells the organs of newborne puppies to pay for his gtc...i just don't like people who claim to be better than other people because most of the time on the internet... its a lie.either way the op makes me want to go ninja salvaging after reading that wall."
10/12/2009,confirming this.
10/12/2009,"the ""appeal to authority"" fallacy is when someone claims that they are correct in an argument because they are an authority.i just indicated that as someone who researches behavior, eve online holds a lot of appeal for me. i also suggested that i would have something constructive to add to the csm; experience modeling behavior systems. at no time did i announce i was right about some argument simply because i am in graduate school.i presented so many pieces of evidence regarding my in-game activities that could be used to argue that i am a bad guy. great job not using any of those in your crappy argument."
10/12/2009,then why bring it up? as you have something to prove your character. i know plenty of people who are saints and good guys in real life but do pretty mean things in online games.and i know anti-social people who don't talk or lift a finger who are saints online so it cuts both ways.that doesn't make them bad people because no one calls a quarter back who tackles someone extra rough a bad person. its part of the game.

10/12/2009,"how will you petition ccp to change things in place that they put in, and want in, this game to further complete their vision for the world we play in? hasn't happened so far, what makes you think you can change that by getting whiners to, hopefully, vote for you in droves?"
10/12/2009,i'm sorry but you want to change what eve is about? i'm a carebear in my hulk and i'll be quiting if what you say comes true.
10/12/2009,"i must say that, as a carebear, i care for the carebears. in my term, i tried to give them an enjoyable game, not a game they could play afk. pve's problem is that it's too easy currently, so most people don't care about participating unless they're also working on homework/reading a book/etc.pvp and pve in this game are uniquely intertwined, each of them reliant on the other for the success of the game. while aspects of both sides need improved (wardec system, mining, suicide ganking, mission running, etc), they do not need to be made easier.i endorse the survivability and enjoyability of this game. therefore, i will not be voting for you."
10/12/2009,"hrm... now that i think of it, protecting my faction hulk is okay and all, but what sort of guarantee can you give me as far as faction interdictors go? i mean, are they okay by you too, or must all such ships be reworked?"
10/12/2009,"i agree with the above poster, also note imo, high seccers make to much money.they should limit it or raise low sec isk gaining( from rats/mining/missions/complexes) and 0.0. so there will be more incentive to go out into those areas, anti pirates will start to come alive again.right now the risk vs reward is bullcrap, because you can get more reward in high sec then lowsec and set a macro to do it for you with no trouble.kind of lame and goes against what eve is about."
10/12/2009,"you aren't a csm member, so please dont raise issues in this thread"
10/12/2009,"hi,i'm aynen, in real life known as matthijs, and i have a question to you, the playerbase of eve. having researched the csm in an attempt to learn how it functions and how it was intended by it's creators, i discovered what i consider to be an indiscrepancy between the two.in a documentary by femke wolting and jorien van nes there is a small bit about the csm's creation and it was stated there that csm members would be similar to chieftans, representing their people, which in the case of eve is the playerbase as a whole. however, i do not believe that this is the case with all of the members of the csms that have come and gone. as stated by a current csm member in a csm panel at fanfest 2009, he, and other members where ensured a seat on the csm by being backed by their alliance. this to make sure that said alliance's interests where well represented.another thing that was stated during that panel was that some csm members would run having a certain agenda, which they used as a filter when looking on the forum for issues raised by players. this means that only issues that fit into their personal agenda or that of their constituents would be represented, or at least would get higher priority. in spite of the fact that groups who can ensure a 'seat' on the csm have to be pretty large to make this happen and therefor represent a decent 'chunk' of the playerbase, there are casualties to this tactic. a csm member without prefered constituents or a personal agenda which he/she may apply as a filter to choose which issues to raise as a csm member would, theoretically, be less vulnerable to leaving some groups out in the cold to favor others.with democracy being what it is, you cannot prevent alliances from backing up one of their own in an attempt to gain additional power, and it remains to be seen if a csm candidate without his own agenda or prefered constituents would get voted on at all, which brings me to my question.would you vote for a csm canditate who has no agenda, or alliance background who's approach is to raise issues based on number of votes on this part of the forum only?i'm considering to run for this reason, but there wouldn't be any point if there is no demand for such a csm member.my personal background as a moderator on a self-harm forum has given me years of experience in seeing things from other people's perspectives, and mediating for them, regardless of wether their views are similar to my own. that experience has tought me that democratic systems benefit not from fractured politics, which you get in a constituent system, but from unbiased representatives of the people.do note that i'm not asking if you'd vote for me per s<U+FFFD>, i'm asking if you agree with the premise that unbiased csm members without constituents would do a better job of representing the playerbase as a whole, and thus be more effective at making everyone's eve experience better, which might lead you to voting for such a candidate in general.if you have conflicting opinions about this topic, please post them here so we can all debate about them.thank you,-aynen"
10/12/2009,"hello aynen,i can say that as a member of the npc corps, i didn't have anything close to a support base. the only thing i ran on is a level platform and my reputation in the game, and i still made it (barely). it's much harder for somebody without a major alliance to succeed, but it's not impossible. look at, for instance, ankhesentapemkah or lavista vista. they had reputation in the game, and this helped them get into the council.as long as there are alliances, there will always be a pretty sure seat for them on the council if they choose to run (bob didn't run for a seat in csm2). that's politics, and the system works."
10/12/2009,couple of questions:what was your policy on picking which issues to bring forth while you where a csm member?did you ever feel overshadowed by the csm members who reprecented alliances?what was your agenda?

10/13/2009,"everybody i assume has their own stick, i have brought the dead horse.lets give it a whack.i've searched and searched, and though i've seen millions of threads about the issue, i've never seen any reason that it has a) not been answered by ccp directly, or b) not been addressed by any of the csm's.its trivial in the long run, but its such a simple fix that it baffles the mind why it has gone so long unaddressed.the assault frigates are designed to be heavy tacklers, able to withstand punishment that inties can't take. they get in close, lock down a target, and hold on for dear life.all of the assault frigates can properly do their job, with the exception of one.the poor retribution. with its single mid slot.lets be honest, if your an fc, or a pilot, and somebody brings a retribution to your gang, you know that you have just been given mediocre dps, and an extra target, and that is it. it brings nothing to the table that most t1 frigates do not bring on their own.this is not to say the retribution doesn't have potential, and in small gangs with other people tackling, it can do a task, its just currently a task that any cruiser or frigate of the t1 variety can do as good or better.the ship post dominion will get an after burner bonus that makes up the af ""4th bonus"" that has been missing. the problem arises when you look at the slot layout on the ret, which is different from every other af. it has one mid, meaning it can't utilize its ship bonuses and still tackle.i know some will say ""bring a friend, its an mmo"", but at that point your just trolling, simply because why would you ever fly a heavy tackler that can't tackle? don't fit an ab and fit a point you say? ok, sure, let me go out and tackle at the whopping 300 m/s a fit retribution can attain, i'm sure people will just sit still and wait while i motor over and point/scram them.the solution?simple, the ret has a 5th high slot that is arguably useful. some people like salvagers, some like nos/neuts to help power the ships systems. none of these things will serve the ship better than having a second mid slot to tackle with in conjunction with its ab bonus, bringing it inline with the other af's in its role as heavy tackle.so we move the high slot to a mid slot.the cpu may need to be adjusted a bit, but tbh, i doubt it. the wolf has the same cpu as a retribution (the two lowest by 20 cpu btw, so perhaps they both could use a mild cpu buff in comparison to the other 6 afs) but can easily fill its intended roll of heavy tackle with its fitting numbers.i know this has been done to death, and that its probably a bit late to get it into dominion, but if your buffing af's, how can you possibly over look the black sheep of the family and not see it needs to be reviewed so that it can do its job properly.if they change won't happen, i'm curious to see a response as to why one ship, is being denied in its intended role."
10/13/2009,"/signed.i'm all about ship diversity, but the poor retri is just... urgh. i love flying it, too, and it's kind of like ****ing a big girl, it's all fun and games until your friends see you doin' it."

10/13/2009,"pretty sure we mentioned the retribution in the assault frig topic at the csm summit in iceland.if it doesn't get looked at... well, amarr need at least one fail ship."
10/13/2009,"they have the legion too, so that makes 2 maybe more. i approve this message."
10/13/2009,"not supported.i disagree with the original premise that the assault ships are all designed to be heavy tacklers.the retribution with its single mid slot is one of the heaviest tanking and heaviest hitting frigates in the game.i personally fly one on a regular basis, and yes while i get some funny looks in fleets... when they see me drop out of warp and watch that 'ceptor, stealth bomber, whatever that is frigate sized engaged literally vanish int two volleys they change their minds.i can take out cruisers easily, all i need is some tackle support. if you want a heavy tackler, use the vengeance. it has low dps, but a high tank, and tackling ability.the only thing the retribution needs is a hair more speed to make it a more flexible tank and spank platform. if you give it a second mid slot, even at the expense of a low or a high, it will become over powered to an insane level."
10/13/2009,in one of the videos of the fanfest ccp pretty much admitted the retri sucks in every way......so im assuming they are now gonna do jack all
10/13/2009,"i understand you like the ship. i like it too, it was the first thing i ever specifically trained for when i started playing.but whats your role in fleet?dps?ok, you do dps. less than the cheaper omen. in fact, your only barely doubling the dps of an ac punisher, with similar hp numbers.aren't you tired of being the only af in the game that can't tackle if your first on scene?you've limited your role in a fleet to ""over priced underpowered dps/ target""the ship is sadly lacking in its practical areas of use, because it is almost always outperformed by a cheaper ship.liking the ship (which i do) does not mean that you can't admit to its faults.with the ab boost currently in place for testing, the af's become quite frightening, with a scram fit, often times you'll find them killing vagas, curses, and all manner of other ships in the ffa's (bs get bent over fyi).all save one, because the targets they are fighting simply mwd away, or warp out. the top speed of the ret when comfortably fit with tank/dps and an ab is around 800m/s, and while bursting that may jump you into range to apply a scram, to help you hold your target so you can apply your dps, you, sadly, don't have any way of making that happen at all.every combat ship in eve can hold a target down save one, and that just seems wrong somehow."
10/13/2009,"i've simply never used it to tackle...and the comparison to the omen is bad because the guns on the retribution hit everything far more consistently. focused pulses only go so far.i've always run mine with support from a crusader, or a veangeance. our corp is crazy amarr heavy... but any tackler will do. it does have dps issues, i'll grant you that because it can be out dps'd by a crusader easily... the enyo has the same issue.but, i am forced to agree with you. if all the afs get more speed... there is no point to field the retribution anymore."

10/13/2009,support this thread or puppies will die :(
10/13/2009,"simple case, some guy is going around a trading hub (let's say jita) in a nano fitted shield buffered battleship with plenty of smartbombs in his highslots, getting chased around constantly by concord is not discouraging him in the least.his ship is fully insured so it costs him peanuts to do this, concord don't pod, and he's only doing it for whatever goes for satisfaction in this line of work.he has an alt in fleet that he warps to so that he can smartbomb, escape with his pod and the alt loots whatever's left.my suggestion would be revoking insurance rights to people with -10 standings, i don't get how someone who's an enemy to every legitimate player in the game and (if you want to stay in character) an enemy of concord and ""the state"" can still receive insurance services.let the flaming begin."
10/13/2009,"simple, insurance is not about roleplay, it's about making pvp more viable for everybody including -10 pilots."
10/13/2009,"first, let's clarify what you're actually trying to accomplish:do you want to get rid of people smartbombing the exit lane on jita 4-4?do you want to revoke insurance for certain players/activities?pick a proposal and discuss it. you may not be any more successful, but you might actually get some debate on the topic.that being the case, why can't i insure the contents of my freighter? i mean that would make pvp more viable to me and other people who are subject to being ganked while flying slow lumbering beasts of burden. at that point i could adopt the same ""whatever"" attitude that the gankers have, because my actual losses will be as minimal as theirs."
10/13/2009,"last time suicide ganking was 'balanced' ccp had the choice:buff concord response timesremove insurance for concorded ships.they chose the former.do you think if insurance is removed it will discourage the act? not likely. those who gank for profit may have to tighten their belts a bit and go after higher value targets or work together in smaller, cheaper ships. as for those who do it for fun. well, to purchase and fit enough destroyers to take out a hulk costs around 5.5 mil (if that). that's pocket change even without insurance.tl;dr if you're carrying anything valuable then tank your ship, don't fly afk and get used to the fact that it's very cold in space."
10/13/2009,"why do you keep posting stuff i agree with. it makes it very, very hard to continue to think you're an *******.i did make one minor correction to your post though."
10/13/2009,"i am pretty sure smart bombing jita 4-4 is a bannable offence just as baiting/griefing in beginner systems is. petition anyone you find doing it.penalising -10's is hardly a solution to something that is completely unrelated to piracy. something that might be worth adding is removal of insurance if mail has a concord npc on it (hs to be npc, not sentry!). highsec suicide squads have zero risk for what can be huge rewards .."
10/13/2009,thanks dear. you're not as much of a tit as i used to think either.
10/13/2009,"protip: due to the station size you cannot smartbomb at jita 4-4. i do believe it is possible at the main stations in amarr, rens and dodixie (or at least one or two of those). the myth of it being a bannable offense i believe comes from either zombie corp's blockade of yulai or miz cenuij's massacre in jita icebelts/stargates. both of whom ceased i believe after a warning from gms (and only because they were spawning so many concord it was lagging out the nodes).hisec 'suicide squads' risk everything. they risk sitting there for hours and not finding a target. they risk their target having a sufficient tank on his vessel. they risk getting a terrible drop (i've had upwards of one bil go up in smoke with only a patheticly small drop). as money making activities go it is probably on a par (on average) with ratting in a good 0.0 system or cruising through level 4s with a tricked out marauder.regardless. it is still relatively uncommon. it's only because those that get ganked are hysterical morons who feel that their important internet pixels shouldn't have been taken from them by ebil piwates in 'safer' space. if these things were that important to you then why didn't you protect them better yo."
10/13/2009,"what can i say, i was rather irritated with you, and i never learned to bite my tongue.i got over it, i think."
10/13/2009,"trying to promote discussion on an issue that ccp is failing to address, that's all.mainly bringing up the issue itself rather than a catchall answer to the problem.regardless, the idea that someone who gets attacked by concord not receiving their insurance payout is a great idea in my opinion and i'd totally support that."
10/13/2009,can i come to the wedding?oh.. not supported!
10/13/2009,they are not failing to address anything. in my time playing eve concord have had 3 major buffs. the only issue is that you're not willing to take the steps required to protect your investments.
10/13/2009,"ditto to this, if you're that worried about the contents of your freighter, get a corp mate to fly by you in an interceptor with dual webs. that freighter will be in warp before you can blink, and never sit in a gankable position long enough to be a target.i don't want pirates to have it easy, but i also don't want carebears to think it's ok to just wander the cosmos risk free. semi-trucks with valuable cargo are hijacked all the time in the real world. get with it, life isn't safe wear a helmet!"
10/13/2009,"it wasn't a freighter that got popped, it was a t2 frigate and a pod.i think we're agreeing on some things and disagreeing with others though.we both agree to some extent that we want other people to experience the game differently.my position is that i would prefer not to have people who exploit weaknesses in the insurance and clone system to enjoy their game at the expense of others.your position is that you would prefer people who don't exploit the game at the expense of griefing others to suffer the exploits of others. i think it's safe to assume that we should agree to disagree on what's probably a years old dispute between people who view success in this game differently.comparing a suicide bomber to a carjacker is kinda lame though."
10/13/2009,i can see how that is some pretty bad griefing. concord are after him for absolutely no reason and are going to kill him for no profit at all.that's a good thing. those bastard concord are out of control. at least when concord is griefing... they arent doing that much damage.damn concord always thinking of the easy cheats. they just show up from nowhere and start shooting. it's terrible.what does that have to do with concord griefing?
10/13/2009,if you do not give these people the opportunity to 'exploit the game at the expense of others' then they won't. i'm assuming you were carrying some valuable cargo.
10/13/2009,"from an earlier post, just for all the fail idiots.what do you prove it ?salvage is the mini profession.but salvage from other players wrecks not is a mini profession. nothing talk about exploit. exploit and stole salvage not equal.ccp told many things, like when they change ghost training after 5 years. and we will work on it, ccp change this unlogic rules while it is not modified.and i tell you again.ninjasalvagers=parasites!!!!they can't kill anything, they can't scanning wrecks just the mission runner's ship. (if the salvaging is a mini profession they why can't scan the wrecks)they can't use tractor beam on those wrecks. (if not belongs for anyone the wrecks, why just the killers can pulling them ?)they can't pick up loot from wreck without criminal flag.and they make more money/ shorter time risk free than as the mission runner."
10/13/2009,"not supportted.salvage belongs to anyone who salvages any wreck. got it?because it can't be spellt any simpler. please note that it really has nothing to do with wreck ownership anomalies.that's why salvage material is created in the salvager's cargohold. it's really more like mining than looting cans.and for the parasite argument... that's rich... they are just competition for the salvage profession. oh, right, some poeple just can't grasp the fact that it's a multiplayer game where you can't go solo.yes, they just don't know what they ask for, aren't they?"
10/13/2009,"try to destroy those wrecks in highs sec if those wrecks not belongs to anyone just who salvaged them.oh no, you will die from concord!!!! but who killed the rats can destroy them, because belongs to him those wrecks. and more thing, try use on wreck right click.you not see everyone on info panel just one person, who killed the rat.""it's a multiplayer game where you can't go solo.""????? oh i see the ninjasalvage it's a multiplayer profession. lol and salvage items created salvagers from wreck, not from your empty cargohold. so, the parasite it's true, because your ""mini-ninja-profession"" (not equal with simple salvage skill) need a person who kill the npcs, but not you did, because you have just a salvagership and salvager not kill npcs. megafail again.you said: ""just competition for the salvage profession.""if just competition a salvage profession, tell me what happen when someone kill the npcs in own mission and want to salvage the wrecks, but can't because someone stole his work under five minutes which he worked lasting until thirty-five minutes ?your body does not produce the blood in order that a leech sucks it out. it is not necessary to remove these parasites from yourself according to your notion.i hope for it you will live with many leeches hence on your body because of tomorrow, which you do not want to remove."
10/13/2009,"allright, let me repeat myself: salvage belongs to anyone who salvages any wreck. where did i say anything about wreck ownership? oh, here:aww... did you just read too much into my post, didn't you?the wreck ""ownership"" refes to the owner of the loot. not the salvage.pve -> loot belongs to ratter -> wreck flagged as his (because loot is spawned and had no prior player owner). pvp -> loot belongs to victim -> wreck flagged as his (because loot has a player owner whom just lost his ship, but not his ownership rights).there are some anomalies, like shooting empty wrecks, true. they should be adressed, so everybody could destroy an empty wreck. erm... yes it is..? so.. your point being regarding this?edit: spelling."
10/13/2009,"hun,how many times do the devs have to say no to this for you to accept that it's not going to change? we're up to 6 or 7 flat refusals from them already, with supporting explainations, but apparently that's not enough for you. what's the magic number? how many times do they have to say ""salvage is free for all"" before you accept it as a fundamental part of the game?just let go of the apparent inconsistency. eve is full of inconsistencies - it's notorious for it, in fact. but one thing that ccp has remained consistent on is that consistency is not as important as game balance.ccp prismx said: ""no-one with any perspective thinks that hi-sec mission rewards should be increased"". that is what is at the heart of this issue. you need to make a case for mission runners deserving better rewards if you want to reserve the salvage rights for them.(good luck with that... )seriously man. just accept it and be happy with your bounty, mission reward, loot, standings, loyalty points and a head start on the salvage."
10/13/2009,"this is terrible... did you read what i said above? your post does not say why it is bad to do this.you post does not say why it should be that way it is, it just describes how it currently works. if you do not read even the first page of the thread, just do not post.the entire point is that if it is illogical, and does not make sense it should be changed.no, it refers to the entire wreck, because other person cannot shoot the empty wreck. now, for some reason you can destroy my wreck byother means, salvagingthis is irrelevant as i am not asking for a pay increase...can anyone tell me a valid reason why i shouldn't be able to shoot a ninja looter, not just state that i sould not, but state why?"
10/13/2009,"oh man, now just anomalies, when just one simple person can destroy those wrecks without concorded :ddddwhat about your tractor beam? why can't pulling my wrecks ? :d because belongs to multiplayers ? :ddddddddno because belongs to killer !!!!! that's it not anomalies.info panel tagged for killers, wreck tagged for killers for tractor beam and not tagged for anyone else. i told just destroy those wrecks in high sec if belongs to everyone (if belongs pve rats) if do you want.but can't because your post as i told megafail and you just making one's apologies nothing other.you keep silent about the parasites, of course. and one other thing more:the ninja salvager earn more money than mission runner without risk.a blockade time for an 6-10 months old charater is 30-35 minutes with one ship. earn ~18-20 million from bounty.a ninja salvager earn from salvage items if he just salvage the bs wrecks in mission 6-10 millions under 10 minute or shorter time. (and not need 2 months learning time)and the parasite ninjasalvager not waste his ammo, not need 100 millions for battleship with full modules etc.so ninjasalvager parasites worsen from agentrunner, because they earn more money without risk from the work of other ones."
10/13/2009,"kids let me tell you a story:a long long time ago when you killed something in eve, there was a can with loot wich belonged to noone.if you dropped a can it belonged to noone. miners got their ore stolen and couldnt do anything about it.then the carebears started to whine about people stealing their stuff.ccp changed it.and now ?carebears defend their cans and get killed doing so.or they ignore the thief and whine even more on the forums.now we have the same problem with salvage.do i support the change to ownership of salvage ?hell yes !!!"
10/13/2009,you can read ccp's view on ninja salvagers here.
10/13/2009,"please explain me the purpose of this post. it does not contribuyte anything to the discussion. i am well aware of ccp's opinion on this. if you did not know this game is for players. csm is there for a reason. this forum is there for a reason. if we clearly state that this has to be done, and give good reason for it, it will be implemented. ccp isn't making a game for the hell of it, it is for subscribers, mechanics get outdated and times change. now, times changed, the mecanics need to be changed. there is nothing that can't be done if we raise our voice as one!that is exactly what i want. the smart mission runners that know how to protect themselves will get rewarded. the smart ninja salvagers will make even more cash. the stupid ninja salvagers will suffer. the stupid mission runners will suffer. smart people get rewarded. that is what i want to happen. there is no longer excess salvage lying around, therefore there is no need for mechanics where you can salvage everything. now salvage is a valuable resource that players are competing for, but it is not a good competition when it is all about who will click the button ""salvage"" first, let's let the cannons speak. almost every singe character has ability to salvage, so there is no need to it to be the way it was, it is time for a change. now can all thick sculled people that have nothing to say except that ccp will not change it leave? i don't ask for concord protecting salvage, i ask for concord to stop protecting ninja salvagers, and i cannot see how they deserve this protection."
10/13/2009,"it's not meant to. it's meant to reinforce my point that the discussion is meaningless. ninja salvagers are exactly what ccp had in mind when they created salvage in the first place. they're not an error or a mistake or a problem, they're an intended result."
10/13/2009,"i have an easy solution.spawn the loot can separate from the wreck. now there is clearly no ownership on the wreck, only on the loot can. viola, problem solved."
10/13/2009,"this issue is one that bugs me. not because people ninja... piracy is piracy and it's spice to the game.what bothers me is the available recourse to the player stolen from.i've run small corps, and allowed ninja work to happen. however, i've always had the standing rule that if you are to ninja a wreck, you are required to take loot too.the issue isn't the salvage being taken, the issue is there is no recourse. if loot is stolen the pve player has the option of bringing his corp in and smacking around the ninja. if the ninja gets a pvp ship out so much the better.so if there is a change that needs made, in my opinion it would be to simply block the ability of a salvaging module to lock onto a wreck that doesn't belong to do while you're in a noob corp.at least that way if you get people stealing wrecks, they are in a war decable corp, and your corp has an option do deal with them.in my view the real issue are the pirates that hide in noob corps like cowards."
10/13/2009,"that is exactly the issue, ninja salvager is not attackable, or declarable, if he comes in and steals you loot you can't shoot him, declare war on him,he is absolutely invulnerable unless you want to suicide gank him.de'veldrin- i repeat my question again- why should the ninja salvagers make as much money as mission runner after just 2 days of training, and be completely invulnerable and risk free? i might not understand much, but the little that i do know is that ccp did not mean to create an activity that is easier and more profitable then lvl 4 mission running while being absolutely risk free.every single activity in eve has a risk to it, even mining and trading the market. you can get can flipped, suicide ganked or prices might not behave as you predicted, and you will loose isk. it is a effort&skill vs reward and risk. all except ninja salvagers- this is the only profession that involves absolutely no risk and brings more cash then mission running, with no skill involved (2 day training)."
10/13/2009,"actually ninja salvaging isn't that profitable. especially after the new rigs went in and the salvage prices fell. it takes time to scan down a bs, all to get just a wreck or two if the mission runner has half a brain.then you have the ability to warp in and out causing the salvager to use more time. the time to isk return on ninja work is pathetic. i can make more isk running level 1s!the mission runner is going to make more than twice the isk on the first bounty payout...salvage isn't that valuable.of course then there is the ultimate solution... train to a marauder and salvage as you go. or learn aggro control and use an alt to salvage. if no wrecks are on the field, there is nothing to be lost.in that regard it's like mining into a can... foolish."
10/13/2009,your question is based on the mistaken assumption that salvage belongs to you before you actually salvage it. that assumption has already been addressed ad neaseum in this thread. i'm not going to rehash it with you again.
10/13/2009,why would you answer a question that clearly shows that you are wrong..
10/13/2009,"i think i should really support this thread now. and then get tons of popcorn for all the ""i shot the ninja salvager and he killed my faction fitted faction bs"" threads. what do you think?"
10/13/2009,"you haven't given a good reason for it other then the old reason of ""the salvage is mine and i want the isk from it"". ccp feels that mission runners make to much isk already. be thankful that they have made level 4 missions easier and faster to run.my experience with mission runners when it comes to taking loot has been the following:the stupid ones shoot and the smart ones don't.if ccp makes it a flaggable offense for taking salvage out of a wreak it's just going to be a lot more of the same. nine times out of ten that lone rifter taking your loot has five guys in the next system over, with bigger and badder ships then yours, who have shield/armor repping bots just hoping for you to pull that trigger and stupid enough to not watch local. all because of a little salvage."
10/13/2009,this.
10/13/2009,"ok, now this is getting personal. first of all i want to make it clear that i am not a carebare mission runner, i might not be a professional pvper, but... now, lets respond to you post.1st of all, i do need have to be grateful for ccp making missions faster as i barely run missions. 2nd out of all missions that i ever ran, i never had any salvage stolen, so ninja salvagers do not decrease my income in any way, so letting me shoot them would not increase my income. ofcource if you are dumb enough to shoot something you cannot kill you will probably die, that is obvious. i cannot see how that is bad. what do you say if i wait for 4 of my corpmates to arrive in pvp ships? i do not shoot what i cannot kill, or at least what i cannot escape.you know that i could do it just another way round? station a small fleet, run a few mission in a hub and wait for someone dumb enough to take the salvage? even if he has 20 friends, 9/10 times they would arrive too late. . my reason is that ninja salvaging is completely off the scale on reward vs risk vs skill required like comparing to all other professions. i still do not see any reason for ninja salvager to be protected by concord."
10/13/2009,"ok maxsim: you would think absolution vs hurricane - the command ship will come out on top. wont you? or your super mission battleship with almost 1000 dps will also beat the battlecruiser/commandship/battleship the ninja looter/salvager throws at you. it would no?hint: the absolution lost to the hurricane. (neut and tracking disruptors ftw)and so did many of the guys in battleships to the much smaller ships. often you cant really say ""my ship will beat his""."
10/13/2009,"you know competent mission runners can make 20mil in an hour (or less) off bounties alone right (risk: dcing, doing something stupid and dying)? i really doubt that ninja salvagers make that.the risks for ninja salvaging have already been outlined somewhere else and i don't feel like going into it."
10/13/2009,"it is not up to the detractors to prove their point, it is up to you to prove beyond the standard 'hurrrr the wreck shows up as mine in the overview so therefore salvaging is clearly broken'. nothing you have posted shows that this is an idea of such grandness that having ccp rewrite their code is called for. though honestly i'm quite fond of my ""the wrecks should belong to the npc corp"" idea, but it would make tractor beams useless so i guess it is not such a good idea."
10/13/2009,"we would have already checked who you have in the surrounding systems. and good luck in getting 4 of your buddies sitting around doing nothing while you run a mission hoping that a ninja salvager would come in. in my experience most mission running corps will not do this. they get bored after about 10 minutes.again, good luck with stationing a small fleet on the off chance someone will get into your mission and ninja salvage it. they will get bored real fast. and if the people getting into your mission do it specifically to ""farm"" mission runners they will not arrive to late. the guy in the salvage ship will be able to tank you long enough for them to show up. they will be watching local specifically for your small fleet and will disengage if local spikes to much.i am just telling you, based on my experience in ""farming"" mission runners, what will happen if you get your way in getting salvaging to be a flagging offense. i hope you do get your way. there are a lot more stupid mission runners then there are smart ones. and the stupid ones seem to always have faction mods on their ships."
10/13/2009,"i'll say yes: that means there'll be more idiots to shoot my salvaging ship, and more people losing their valuable mission ships."
10/13/2009,where is this? i havent seen this.they really dont. the extra 15-20% is easily defeated by overloading and/or simply making them run away which breaks transversal and kills you. at the same time. the speed can actually muck things up.the difference is noticable for the snakes. the advantage isnt there really. as you still need to operate in the 20km range. this is why from a game balance pov; it isnt unbalanced.the ishkur goes from 39m to 30m. the small weapons generally go from near full hit from size to 3/4 hits. which isnt that bad... though in my experience it's more of a tracking issue most of the time.they generally will benefit with the other implants. crystals vs slaves for example.pretty sure they commented that due to their sig you pretty much cant get lock fast enough to stop those bombs from happening. not that the command link necessarily will improve that. not to mention... pirate implants arent exactly allowed in the tourny.
10/13/2009,"i totally agree with mynxee on this. finally people are putting forward the fact that csm should be proactive in their approach as a body to do good, rather than harm, and without the need of assistance from ccp. all games are to some degree a sandbox in which the players can create and destroy empires based on the actions on one or more people. for example, take that eve university group that teaches new players how to play the game. they have, by no small feat, achieved something even csm has failed to do and without any assistance from ccp might i add. perhaps it's time someone builds up another corporation that teaches people about csm and it's importance and the importance of continued education of csm and eve.furthermore, i don't post on any other characters and i think ccp should make it that you must elect one and only one character to troll the forums with."
10/13/2009,"you guys are supposed to be player representatives not some kind of junior game designers, you know that right ? ccp has plenty of qualified, payed, experienced people doing that, if you're going to bring your own personal ideeas to the table instead of what the community actually wants we might as well disband the whole damn thing. if you want a job at ccp apply for that instead.as far as i'm concerned csm members shouldn't even be allowed to make any kind of proposal that is not directly related to the internal workings of the csm meetings. because **** like this happens, they post a thread about it, they ignore all feedback and decide ofcourse that their proposal is awesome and should be brought to the dev's attention.why even post threads like this at all ? next time just ask your own alliance on the internal forums what would help them most and what kind of insider information they'd like to have, that's all you guys are good for anyway, officialising the kind of crap the csm was initially thought to prevent."
10/13/2009,can ccp do anything about losing drones when disconnecting... even if it's only in missions.i think ive lost 4 or 5 sets of ogres in the last 2 days :(
10/13/2009,"after you come out of emergency warp:fly back to your drones -> right click on them -> scoop to drone bay -> done.non issue. and yes i am heavily using drones myself. but i usually forget more drones to ""lets fly to next belt and forgetting to pull my pets""."
10/13/2009,"vincent, when i was in the csm, we brought this issue up. ccp is going to fix this, and said the fix should be relatively simple...we'll see. i don't expect them to take too long on this issue, as this is a pretty common complaint."
10/13/2009,"op seems to be losing these drones to mission rats. doesn't take mission rats long to shoot down stationary ogres, so there are none left to scoop up when you reconnect."
10/13/2009,"unfortunately, ccp takes their sweet time with some complaints, no matter how popular. i mean, without knowing how many employees they have and exactly how many active projects they have going, it still seems like they could allocate a few coders for couple weeks to little issues like this."
10/13/2009,"how about this:your redock timer after aggro is your signature radius... simple fix.maybe adjust it a little bit so a bs isn't stuck outside of a station for 10 minutes, but enough to keep them in space for a bit and make capitals killable inside dock radius."
10/13/2009,just adding rr = agro would work just fine for caps at stations thanks
10/13/2009,"the lolsilly 15 minutes suggested would make it practically unfeasible for everyone in a non-cloaky ship and a life to actually, you know, pvp, so you get a hearty ""bugger off"" from me.the ""ehp was lower"" argument fails to mention that the timer was lower too; and 1 minute is really enough.capitals are killable on station.the only time you really have a problem is when you've got rr gangs and such fighting other rr gangs and they deaggro/jump; but if you can't break the rr to kill a single bs in the timeframe (capital rrs excepted; but meh for breaking everything to be able to do capital rr gang station hugging ***gotry), you can't break the rr anyway."
10/13/2009,"disallow any offensive/remote module activation within docking range; no more docking games, no more lame neutral docking rr, no more need for undock camps. problem solved.treating a symptom is never better than destroying the disease!"
10/13/2009,"great idea, especially the individual timer!"
10/13/2009,yes! do this! help channels are full of these spammers and it takes way to long to report them. having it log the post that's reported would be great for helping to prevent people reporting innocents
10/13/2009,good idea... but what if you get people who report falsely?
10/13/2009,"supported, only if ccp is sane about it.it needs to log at least 5 lines before and after the reported spam. it needs to log who is marked as the spammer as well as who did the reporting. ccp needs to clearly adopt some sort of policy to allow them to automatically ignore accounts that are repeatedly wrong when they report spammers.i think they do all of this anyway within the petition system. so perhaps the best idea would be to simply auto fill in the required petition with the relevant information before the player gets an ok button to send it?right click done is nice, until your mouse aim is off. don't forget about all the people who play while intoxicated. :p gms have to sift through all that insanity."
10/13/2009,"if it were me doing the program, i'd handle it in two phases...first there has be a threshold to what flags you as a isk spammer.say if 25 players report you in 30 seconds then you and everyone on your ip address gets muted for 6 hours and the logs forwarded to ccp to verify the truth on the matter.that said, it shouldn't ban your account so if a bunch of goons decide to hop on a public and target people then they won't be auto banned from the game but rather mute you publicly for a while.that said if you constantly flag someone like this who is not a gold spammer, ccp she take the privileged away from you or mute the person who reports falsely.and when ccp has reviewed the logs and determined the isk spammer is really one he bans the account rather than mutes it revoking all transactions from that ip."
10/13/2009,"i like it. that said, it should only copy the post in question into an automated petition(and maybe do a 20-minute block, if that's not too much work). no bans, no mutes, just a petition. let the gms ban you if you need banning."
10/13/2009,"there is a thread in general discussion, where there is a guy asking why he cannot use ecm to stop a guy from cargo scanning his ship to determine if he would be a good suicide gank target.now, being able to randomly ecm folks without it causing concord intervention sounds like a bad idea all around. with that being said, why not have cargo or ship scanning generate aggro? and not corp wide aggro either, just between the scanned pilot and the scanner.you don't like your ship getting scanned? you can do something about it. and scanning everything as it passes by suddenly becomes a bit more hazardous.so what say you all? good idea to help try and curb the suicide gank rate? (well, the targeted ganks...the random ones won't be covered.)"
10/13/2009,"no. scanning should not trigger aggression. just stop flying on autopilot if your stuff is of any value. if you use ap, you deserve to be suicide ganked."
10/13/2009,while i'm sure you'd relish this change zedrik others would not.just remember that agro is a two way street if the hauler pilot decides to go and ecm his scanner. hell a change like this would make me go and train my alt for a bustard and fit a rack of remote eccm onto it. given the amount of 'grief' that the change to can flipping mechanics created i think on balance the carebears don't know what's good for them and should leave things as they are.
10/13/2009,"why is this a problem? are absolutely zero miners and zero haulers existing in eve because 100% of them are being suicide ganked? i see the smartbombing bs gangs in jita and more often than not they don't kill a darned thing (and i km ***** for great justice)the thing is that cargo/module scanning is not an offensive action and should not be the same punishment as stealing.lastly this will cause more lame high sec aggro problems like pilots freaking out when someone goes red and shoots a beam at them but isn't really attacking, etc etc."
10/13/2009,"i posted this idea here a long time ago... but i explained in a bit more detail...got a lot of support and didnt see that eaven mentioned by the csm later onso again supporting my/this idea (and also i dont think i'm the first or that the op is the last to think of this)and hope someone in the csm notices this this time around, so we atleat get an official answeredit:did a search:my thread on this"
10/13/2009,ability to set mass sell orders up on different items on the basis of market average and lowest sell price would be cool.
10/13/2009,"i think initially, is dont get too complicated or it will never get through, just something simple to start with, then constant improvements thereafter..lets get it in there first..."
10/13/2009,it will never happen i think. the database hamsters would go on strike if it was implemented.not sure what use it would be as you would be throwing away insane amounts of money over time.a majority of buy-orders are a fraction of the real/mineral value of items so a multi-sell would just line the pockets of the profiteers.check the buy-orders for anything not best named and you'll see what i mean. even a taxed-to-death reprocess is better than the nickels and dimes on offer for most items.
10/13/2009,"well the point people have made is that they have they options to decide what to sell for etc, and not just sell from buy orders. the point the ops is making and which i agree is that we just want the ability to sell multiple items at the same time. so supported.."
10/13/2009,would be a welcome addition
10/13/2009,yes please
10/13/2009,vv
10/13/2009,"let me start by saying i love the way local works in whs. i'd love to see the same mechanic applied to 0.0, but the idea has been shot down enough times that i won't waste time suggesting it again.instead, how about something of a compromise? i suggest removing cov-ops cloaked ships from local. keep the local count up-to-date, but remove cloaking individuals from the list. doing this, players will still be able to tell that there are cloaked ships in system, but they wont be getting free intel on pilots who really should be invisible. i'm also hoping that this might give black-ops ships some love (as a fuel bay just doesn't seem to do it)."
10/13/2009,"i agree with this and have suggested similar before.cov ops cloaks being removed from local makes total sense, they are supposed to be cov ops after all... no point to black ops if everyone can just look in local...it would allow people to truly do sneak attacks and stealth missions."
10/13/2009,watered-down solution. full recent speakers mode local in 0.0 is the best option by far.
10/13/2009,"watered down? sure. after seeing the flame fests that anyone suggesting applying wh local to null-sec, i'm not eager to go down that path. i also think cov-ops ships should have a bit more going for them other than being able to warp while cloaked, and some sort absence from local might do the trick. i really want to see black-ops used on an alliance scale, and a change like this may encourage that.i'll have a look, though, to find the idea you mentioned.edit: forgot the switch to liao. x.xedit two: i think you're talking about this?"

10/13/2009,"how about a change to this ideathere already is a fleet align optionit just dosent align a fleet, it just brodcasts a marker for alignmenthow about:when a player sees the broadcast to align to he just has to cick on it and his ship alignscurrently the broadcast is useless because if the fc uses it you spend more time searching for it on the screen than aligningso noone uses it... insted they use voice and then you have people who dont speak english well, and eaven worse fc's who dont speak english well, sound problems, bad mic-s, etc... etc.."

10/13/2009,i love this idea... :d!

10/13/2009,"the reason you see ""vet rewards"" in other mmos is because they are trying to hold onto their subscribers.take ultima online for example. since it started losing it's playerbase around 2002-2003 it's been throwing ""vet rewards,"" and holiday rewards, game anniversary rewards (etc) at the players. it's gotten to the point that the vetern players still playing uo have started *****ing because they still haven't gotten this years gifts :pi don't think eve has a subscription problem, and i'm not sure a shiny new module or ship that would never-ever-ever leave the hanger would draw in new players or keep those intent on leaving."
10/13/2009,"sentry drones uses 25m3 each. my proposal is to reduce the size of them to 15m3 on bonused gallente ships. on this way u can carry some more sentry drones in the dronebays so that they will be used more often.sentry drones have different optimals and for pve/pvp it requirs sometimes to carry 2 different types (expecialy t2 versions). a set of 5 takes 125m3, a third of the dronebay on l4 skills. sentry drones get left behind/killed alot because they cant move very fast back to the drone bay. it would only apply on the ishtar, dominix, sin, eos."
10/13/2009,"so we're going to unbalance these four ships so you can carry more sentries? sorry, no. by your own example (on the dominix, i assume), you're only using up a third of your drone bay to carry a set of 5, which tells me you can carry at least two flights of sentries, plus one of the following:a) a flight of heaviesb) a flight of mediums + 2 flights of lightsc) a flight of lights + 2 flights of mediumsd) a third flight of sentries.what the hell else do you need?"
10/13/2009,"ditto, the previous. if anything, i would argue that the sentries needs a slight increase in size, to reconcile against the fact that long range guns use more pg to fit.here, let's get back to a reasonable change request. i request that your character's name be chanced to caldari citizen blah because cick lunt, is simply a letter transposition to a series of words in direct violation of the game's tos."

10/13/2009,"this has been brought up in a related article, csm term limits page 5, which is concerned with gaining greater coverage presented before the masses of eve online so that everyone, not just a few big alliances and independent voters with spare time on their hands, can understand and comment on csm issues.here are the current problems which have caused this issue:poor eve online search browserlack of in-game advertising, a simple pop-up randomly on the startup screen isn't enoughlack of structure information about csmthe search function on eve is a joke. let's face it, who here will try to rebut that? i can search for a friend's posts by typing his name into the search bar and i'll get about 50,000 hits. his name isn't smith so what the hell is the go? recommendation is to improve the search function like ccp is doing with the mail system etc or remove the requirement to search related articles.the second issue is that the only advertising for csm i have seen is a random pop-up that comes up maybe once or twice a half year for me. does this really get the message across that ccp wants our ideas and opinions? imo not really. advertising should be a consistent thing, especially for something important like csm (unless it's not important like i would have a lot of people now believe).lastly, evelopedia is a shocking mess. i'm more comfortable reading the australian tax legistation acts than i am with evelopedia and if anyone has seen the itaa 36 they know what i'm talking about! a simple re-structuring so that everything important is given a title. for example:purpose of csmthe purpose of csm is to....benefits of csm...policies csm must follow...furthermore the csm link given on the eve website has very little information because it is most concerned with elections rather than providing information."
10/13/2009,"structure-etc. of the csm is ever evolving and the people working on it 1 year from now will not be the people you are talking to now. the people on the csm 3 do things completely different then the 1st and 2nd csm do things. csm 4 will probably also do things completely different. csm 5 is right out.with everything turning on its head over and over again you are not going to get solid documentation, much less documentation that is accurate or up to date. organization of the evelopedia is not the major issue. we asked for a devblog to write about our experiences and what we did, and we haven't gotten it yet. we dont really have a lot of tools to get the word out except to a few people who are interested and paying plenty of attention in the first place."
10/13/2009,"mazz: explain to me how not having a devblog is keeping the csm from documenting its own work, because i don't get it. there are any number of mechanisms you could use for that. blogs? the wiki? the forums? come on. also, there are plenty of channels for getting the word out that don't involve ccp doing the work for you. twitter? facebook? links in your in-game bio? other eve-related forums and web sites? the blogging community? in-game channels? do you guys ever even consider these alternatives?to the op: the problem of players being unaware of the csm or how to engage in the process of being ""officially"" heard by them has little to do with ****ty forum search functionality. it has everything to do with a nonexistent effort to reach players, share information, and encourage their contributions in making eve online a better game. certainly ccp could use ""official channels"" to help correct that but even if they didn't lift a finger, the csm delegates are empowered and in my view have the primary responsibility for doing it themselves.personally, i'd like to see the csm charter require delegates to contact a minimum number of different players in-game each month to share information about csm. just a quick chat to share key links and answer a few questions--similar to the way in which isd stars greet new players to make sure they have the info they need to get started. if each of the 9 delegates contacted 25 players, that's 225 players a month who become informed. how many will they then inform? what might be the impact over the course of a year with such a proactive approach? there's nothing like personal contact to make a memorable impression and encourage folks to get involved.also, why is there no official csm chat channel in-game? can csm delegates not be trusted to conduct conversations with players in a civilized fashion? are csm delegates too busy to talk to players? do csm simply not want to interact with players? any delegate for whom those answers are yes is unworthy of their position in my view.as for the wiki, any active account can log in there and edit its pages, add categories, etc. taking the initiative is all that's needed. this entire issue is a real hot button with me because it all ties into my philosophy of how csm delegates should do their jobs...one expectation of which is that they be very proactively engaged with the player base. i am disappointed that doesn't seem to be happening and really tired of hearing excuses about ccp not providing tools and support. stop relying on ccp and make use of alternatives. just get on with it."
10/13/2009,"@argonis totally agree with you. with cosmos coming hopefully all those issues will be solved.for 1st two terms we were using ankh wiki, and then at the end we migrated to eve wiki, but i think that we are still missing some issues on eve wiki.@mynx - i a"
10/13/2009,"if csm is incapable of writing a clearly structured format for all csm which contains the vital information about csm from it's activities to the conflict due to it's incentives then all csm delegates should be removed from office and new ones elected. eve online has massive super corporations that act much like business (i know i invest in some), we have share market websites, player video advertising. almost every decent corporation in eve also has the following: corp website, vent, forums, wiki (some), killboard.as for the search function it wasn't to improve player information but to actually find articles on eve that your looking for. eve's search function is like typing in raven and getting hits for baby lotion...it's ridiculous and needs a serious overhaul."
10/13/2009,"poor troll 2/10problem with structure maintained by delegates is what will happen after 6 months when delegate/s running mail server, wiki, forums, googlesheets or whateva leave the office. there was never lack of will of csm to maintain their own ""tools"" as csm 1 and 2 had their own wiki, and csm 1 had their own emails, but if csm needs to migrate all of data every 6 months its huge waste of time. especially cause we were promised certain tools by ccp which was supposed to be implemented soon(tm).or even better you can run for csm, and if/when you get elected you can give a shiny example to all of previous and future candidates how csm should operate."

10/13/2009,"didn't think you could. anyway, going to look into that.furthermore, on vuk's post. are you implying that your incapable of structuring the basic details which never change for csm. specifically, purpose of csm, benefits of csm delegates etc? i consider that i've explored quite a bit of the eve website in search of csm information compared to the avg user and earlier, even i didn't know that csm delegates received free subscription - only the payment of travel, accom and meal expenses. the amount of money ccp invests in csm is ridiculous for the little work we've actually seen occur in comparison to other volunteer fields such as isd etc."
10/13/2009,"are u incapable of reading what i am trying to explain you? basic structure of csm is there and exist from day one. till now there were always delegates who were doing two terms in a row, so there was not much problems with basic procedures (tbh if u go tru couple of meetings minutes u will be familiar with the way csm is operating), also there is more information here and even more herewhen it comes to the ""tools"" for csm i firmly believe they need to be provided and owned by ccp to prevent any potential problems or misuse of data which will be ""stored"" there. and if you are just mad cause of 9 ppl who sacrifice their free time to make game better on the best way they know get trip to iceland and 6 months of game time free, then i can only recommend u to run for csm again, take place from those incapable delegates and prove you can do the job better."
10/13/2009,"argonis valentio trolling the csm and calling for the disbanding of the csm at the drop of a hat itt.weve already given you the answer. if you cant understand or dont want to understand we cant really help you any further. if you think you can do a super good job you should try to get yourself elected, you definitely have the charisma.i didnt know we got a free subscription until they sent me an e-mail directly saying i got subbed. but its really a tiny amount of value compared to the trip to iceland, and just to make sure that every csm member can show up for meetings during their term.theres only a couple of constants for the csm: we tell ccp to do stuff and ccp tell us yes or no. we also get free trips to iceland."
10/13/2009,"where are the benefits csm receive clearly outlined in the document? hidden among the data you will find the free trip to iceland etc but you have to be looking for it. furthermore the 6 month subscription isn't even listed in there. under sensitive topics such as the one mazz raised earlier players don't have full information which often enough can lead to major lapses in judgment.furthermore, here's a bit from the scope of csm, ""...this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness, understanding, and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base"". where are the policies and procedures ccp has put in place to prevent the abuse of such a system?the ccp council is responsible, in part, for preventing this because they review the work of csm. however, here is a section under the role of the ccp council ""it is however necessary for the csm to prioritize its topics should the ccp council not be able to accommodate a reply to all topics"". i would like to now point out the obvious flaw in this approach, there's no one monitoring to see if csm are doing their job. for example:i become a csm representative and i want to extend the time of a term from 6 months to 3 years, i create a topic to push it through. it goes to the csm delegation and passed. how do i hide the obvious lack of eve player support for the issue? i create a list of the low-support topics and prioritize them based on support. i don't place the least support on my priority list because then it would seem blatantly obvious but i choose something in the middle. now i, and the other csm delegates, have a good list of prioritized support-lacking topics for ccp to shuffle through making the absurdly unsupported topic seem normal. while you may be genuine in trying to make the game better, i can tell you there are a lot of people who don't want to. do you think the accoutants for enron had the best interests of shareholders at heart?i'm not saying i would do a better job. in fact, i might do a better job by making sure i do the worst possible thing so that ccp is forced to review the csm. tbh that could possibly be the best thing you could do for a company like ccp. what i am saying is that everything of significance about a topic should be brought to light, even if it seems like the most unlikely contributors to the decision to be made. basically, more accountability.as for mazz, yes i believe the csm should be disbanded. the truth is, assembly hall is nothing more than the features and ideas forum. the only difference is that ""elected"" players spoon feed ccp with dribble such as extended terms. csm is a face, for ccp to say that they respect the players. they could do this simply by giving a damn when it comes to customer support services etc.want examples? here's the only moderated thread on this forum which is supposed to be moderated constantly for off topic/troll."
10/13/2009,"re: your first part, it doesn't work like that. every issue is considered and no issues are rubberstamped just because of their position on the priority listre: your second part, you are throwing a fit on the forums. i think you ought to do it, the drama will be awesomesupporting this thread for throwing a fit"
10/13/2009,"lets focus onto this cause this is something which bothers you the most.possibility a: ccp are ******s, so when csm says give us 3 year terms, shares of ccp and huge fish tank for each delegate, they will just agree with that, and in 6 months you will have darius and myself sitting in ccp ceo office, while nathan and hilmar will massage our feet.possibility b: ccp knows their job, so when csm bring some utterly selfish of stupid issue they will just say noktnxbyethe fact is that csm has no actual power in decision making whatsoever. ofc if 9 of us scream that something is horribly wrong ccp will for sure think about it, but ccp has final word on any issue we raise. back to your subject...there is remote possibility that in the future csm will be consisted of 9 horrible delegates. ccp will for sure be aware of that, so dont worry your game is safe from glory chasing csm delegates."

10/13/2009,"it's a bit cumbersome, but it's so rarely relevant. there are times i buy/sell from 3-4 orders at once, and i generally just trade with the last order on the list and let it fill from the top three as well. oh no, i spend an extra 2 isk on my half-dozen battlecruisers. i can't see this mattering enough to be worth the extra lag, or the annoyance of players having to learn the different system. sure, there'd be plenty of harm. the eve markets make millions of transactions per day. you want to incorporate an extra check into every single one of them? the server people would hate you. besides, it wouldn't help anything - people would just trade with alts, if they had any reason to do it in the first place. my point being that while you and i pay fees to trade on the nyse, there are people who don't, and they're usually the ones with the hefty wallets. i don't know the exact mechanics, but i'm pretty sure that most stock markets charge fees by the year, not by the trade. in other words, the marginal cost to a self-trade is zero. in eve, it's about 1%, depending on skills and standings. if anyone was going to try to manipulate a real stock market with self-trading, they'd be someone big enough to have their own traders naturally, meaning it'd cost them nothing. hence, rules. in eve, it costs, and we're also entirely accepting of things like insider trading that would land you in jail irl. if you pay the broker fee, i see your order when i do a market search. if you don't, i don't. that sounds like advertising to me. and if it ""forced"" people to accept the posted prices, there'd be nobody actually posting those orders in the first place. judging by the fact that it works just fine, i'd have to say that your criticism is misplaced."

10/13/2009,"stupid idea, would only lead to even more imbalance in the militia numbers. no carebear will suddenly start to pvp to keep his mission income, they will just sell the character and buy a new one, or create a new one exclusively for mission running.with the min/max attitude of players, newly rolled characters would be more likely to be running caldari missions, thus we end up with a ton of players that have the standings for caldari fw and very few with those for gallente fw.i've got another idea though for improving rewards, that also would solve the problem of overcrowded mission hubs:if a faction occupies a hostile station system, have the stations change ownership to a corporation of the occupying faction, and move the highest quality lvl4 agent of that corporation there (only moving agents from highsec space, no shuffling around lowsec agents).rewards will be improved as the missions are gonna take place in lowsec instead of highsec."

10/13/2009,"the ability for csm delegates to tie up meeting time with frivilous concerns is similar to the filibuster ability of the us legislative branch. while i think a lot of these issues being presented by certain candidates are pretty inane, they are who we voted into office, and we're suffering for the vocal minority (even the largest alliance has a mere 2% of the total playerbase).ccp designed the csm as ambassadors between the company and the players, and that's all we are. ccp still has their own release schedule, and will continue to be their own think tank as well. this is not to say that the csm is without power, but you'd deceive yourself if you think ccp gives them any more power than any member of ccp has individually. we're simply spokespersons, and i was honored to fill that role during my term."
10/13/2009,"not supported, the purpose of the csm is to bring up player concerns. their own ideas are just as valid, as a forum is a bad place to have this sort of conversation anyway.but all of this pales to one basic fact... ccp owns the game, their ideas come first, their desires come first. they will do whatever they want to do and no amount of player complaining is going to change that.you can say well i'm a paying customer they have to do what i want... and your logic is flawed. you subscribed to their content. ccp defines that content, and the day it stops being entertainment your real vote is to desub. when ccp sees mass amounts of new accounts pouring in after a change, they assume success, mass accounts leaving, they assume failure.the csm, means nothing, this forum means nothing, it's all in the money."

10/13/2009,"no...........openid would allow you to securely login to other sites using your eve credentials (without exposing them).then using oauth the 3rd party site can make hits to the eve api on your behalf without any further api keys or the like.opensocial allows you to run social graph aware applications that can be installed on any social network.these technologies are the basis for any social network being built today. there is no one except ccp considering doing a social network without these technologies.a crapton of existing content/work/technology out there and ccp is rolling their own.so ccp is making a calendar..... great.... why not just implement opensocial so i can choose from the 5000 existing calendar applications?ccp will be in the same boat they're in now in another 8 months. dealing with a custom built non-stanard system that doesn't play well with others.the other half of the picture is most of the features of the social network are only accessable using the igb.it could all be done in any browser, all browsers, including igb. instead everything is locked into igb. no choice."

10/13/2009,"i think you're exagerating:- any site can check if the client is the igb or not so there's no reason for you to ever get javascript errors- cosmos as a ccp site will have internal access to the eve database beyond what is safe to be exposed through the eve api or sent through igb headers, so there's no reason for cosmos to be dependant on the igb and not available on other browsers- having third party apps access the game client directly is a horrible ideea"

10/13/2009,i don't think they have much options to accelerate this process. nevertheless it's getting a little
10/13/2009,"before anybody else feeds the troll, please check him out ingame. corp, standing, bio quotes.if he runs, decide if you want such a person representing you. i'd love to see a csm meeting ruled by trolls. (rolls eyes)mike"
10/13/2009,i'm a fairly big carebear. 5.9 sec status. 9.9 amarr standing.none of these are issues.it actually happened a couple days ago for the first legitimate time. i pulled in my orca and pulled in everything close for him also.how many times have i gotten guys who came to get flagged so i shoot them. allowing them to go back in pvp ship to get me? few times. i even shot em once. warped out grabbed neut domi. killed their geddon. wasnt even a good fight. they never did post their loss. dying to a carebear is to embarrassing it seems.
10/13/2009,"it sure does. before people would post their ideas and it was ccp denying them. now it's the csm denying them.1. less work for ccp; iow they dont have to read posts.2. ccp isnt the bad guy.3. csm takes all the blame.gm issue is a funny one. they get spammed with so much crap... they have to copypaste. but that copypaste almost never answers anything. infact hardened petition metagamers have devised ways to break the copypaste.furthermore; gms have been tricked into so many things so many times they are on epic short leash.add on top of that leash... they have been given a set of rules so vague that if you take the smallest thing out of context or have a legit char screwing up... the innocent person gets penalized.just think of this. someone isk spams(or says something racist or something) rookie help(why ur in there i dont know) you copy paste and hit enter ingame after ud opened the petition window. but it just went to local. you notice you didnt paste into window. you never even notice local because its uber tiny. someone else petitions you for isk spamming. you then get muted and/or banned. sorry but the rules are rules. you stay banned and/or warned.^^^ happened to me. though not banned obviously.the other good one i've seen. person x petitions wartarget y. saying ""it's very unusual for my war target to be on @ this time. i just killed a bunch of stuff... i know him irl though we havent talked in years and he wouldnt do that. y just happens to be using vpn/proxy iow unusual ip address. banned."
10/13/2009,"this.bringing ""democracy"" into eve as if we needed it is both pretentious and idiotic. a meta-gaming democratic system (functional or not (this one isn't)) is the opposite of the sandbox philosophy of eve and... well, ms. gossip summed it up pretty well really."
10/13/2009,"i better read ur post? or else?if there's no fighting happening... then there's no issue relative to the wardec. creating limits to the system wont suddenly generate more attacks. they can only limit the amount of destruction.the problem is? sure it's pretty stupid that there can be literally no reason for some wardecs... would love to develop a new wardec system that brings in at least some layer of diplomacy ingame as a mechanic... but that'll be just fluff.the problem is?oh please. i've had some of the best empire war people wardec my alts. where do we go? wormspace and 0.0? wardec people arent going to 0.0. the few who have tried... which tbh was hilarious... got killed by our enemies lol. was pretty funny. wardecs are lame and can be ignored.not really? canada is at war in fghanistan... but we arent exactly attacking them ww2 style or something. my point is that war isnt exactly a destruction thing; it can just be a ""we beat you."""
10/13/2009,why make the thread public then? go do this on a mailing list or private channel or irc channel. wherever. jita park speakers cornera less formal venue to discuss or debate whatever you wish regarding the council of stellar management.seriously... what's the issue. let non-csm elect issues. during the meeting you can divide the issues csm elected ones first and well derp last. just set the topic up and see if any csm would like to comment. then vote. very quick and easy.
10/13/2009,"don't worry, the non-csm players voice is already being ignored. read the whole thread that is linked and then you will realize resistance is futile."
10/13/2009,if you don't want community feeback don't do this thread in the public side of the forum.and sort the csm x ccp meeting minutes out.
10/13/2009,if you put away your kneejerk dog-in-the-mangerism for a moment you might find that cyprus black was merely suggesting relevant issues that a current csm might consider looking at before raising to the council if they wanted to advocate them.given your own recent penchant for advocating threads with extremely minimal public support it might be novel if you found an issue bring to the csm that the people did care actually care about.
10/13/2009,cry more. he needs to convince a csm member 1 on 1 to raise the issue not spam the thread with issues. its just a bad thing to encourage since people just end up spamming up meeting threads to hell with their pet issues.
10/13/2009,mazz i need to remind you that you cant raise issues which are not at least week old.
10/13/2009,"its going to be a week old by the time the meeting happens, thats all that matters"
10/13/2009,you sound a little bit peeved there mazzilliu? maybe you should try and get a bit of fresh air.
10/13/2009,"sry my bad, i was in troll mode today so somehow i messed up the dates. sry one more time."
10/13/2009,its ok i think everybody is in troll mode including me
10/13/2009,"while i was a csm delegate, i had to carefully weigh the potential effects of each forum thread before i could endorse it. i managed to eliminate about 80% of threads just on the impact on the game or the practicality of programming the new code. after that, i gave my support to some threads, but might not champion them based on my own opinion from years of playing this game. the ones i did champion were sometimes knocked down by other delegates, but sometimes made it through. you have to have a very level head and a very thick skin to be a delegate, as you are going to be flamed a lot for the choices you make, whether wise or not.quite often. to be honest, i felt my major friction was with darius steel during my time in the csm, as he had a very pvp-centric approach, and i endorsed pve. that's not to say that we never agreed or he didn't surprise me, but he seemed the most often at odds with me in my term. the only other alliance-representing delegate was vuk lau from morsus mihi, and he was pretty laid-back. most candidates really didn't represent an alliance, but more represented a playerbase (ankh represented fw, lvv was finance/trade, omber was veterans, etc).when i first composed the website that demonstrated my platform, i made clear a lot of items which i think should be in the game, and was honest about forum concepts which i supported. i feel this honesty helped me at the voting booths. one thing you should always keep in mind is that you represent the players, so asking their opinion is a good thing, and being involved in an npc corp meant i had a large group of diverse players to get feedback from.my 'agenda' was to improve all aspects of pve - trade, mining, manufacturing, etc. i feel i was able to provide some input to ccp about these issues and got them promoted on the items. ccp also asked me for my input in various features they were planning on implementing, including dominion, and i provided it where i could.if you're planning to run, i wish you the best of luck. it's tough to get elected, and even tougher to constantly endure the mudslinging while working your butt off to represent your chosen constituency to the players. your heart has to be in it, or you will crumble or make a mistake, such as has been displayed already."
10/13/2009,"this is exactly what has been bothering me since when i first heard of the csm.if your name is on the list, you'll get my vote. more i cannot do unfortunately."
10/13/2009,"in my experience as a beta-tester for lionhead studios i had the oppertunity to talk with game designer peter molyneux on several occations. one of the things he tought me was the importance of leaving things in the hands of the right people. theoretically, the average game designer is better at coming up with gameplay solutions to gameplay problems than your average gamer. this is why i would try not to represent proposed changes from the playerbase, but the underlying problems that promted the need for change. this means that i'd leave it open to the game designers exactly how they wish to fix the issue without attempting to enforce a player-issued solution. when browsing the forum for proposals for the csm, i'd attempt to find the underlying reason for the proposals instead of arguing the effectiveness of the proposal itself. this way, basically all proposals have an equal underlying base: the reason they where proposed in the first place, that something is bothering the issuer of the proposal. what the solution turns out to be is practically irrelevant, as long as it gets fixed.that's the theory behind what i'd choose to do as a csm, and what i encourage other csm delegates and candidates to do aswell."
10/13/2009,"this concern is exactly the reason why i founded take care, and why we have succesfully had a candidate in every csm to date.a candidate with no ingame affiliation and no personal agenda, that would respond to emails and personal chats, and who does what is right for the eve game as a whole. we have advisors that represent different playstyles and who inform our csm whenever there is an important issue or problem which they feel should be brought to ccps attention.if you want a neutral person to look at your interests, contact erik finnegan (the current take care csm) or any of the take care advisors and we'll look at it."
10/13/2009,"do you feel that additional csm candidates following similar philosophies would benefit you or would they only devide the votes, making the chances of one of them reaching the csm less?"
10/13/2009,":sirens: wrongif myself, goon or pl reps were watching for particularly morsus mihi, pandemic legion and goonfleet interests, we would vote for more powerful doomsdays, cutting some 0.0 - empire entry routes, increasing demand for dyspro and prom, introducing sov5 and untouchable regions etc.the most important issues 0.0 reps raised and the most time we spent in ""brainstorming"" with ccp were actually about promoting and opening 0.0 to more ppl and making it actualy more fun.wrong again. it is totally irrelevant who will raise what issue as long as it is raised, and tbh i thing that 3 csm offices raised like 90% or even more of all (including semi relevant) issues posted in assembly hall. for the iceland meeting we covered all 65 issues regardless of the area of the game covering it or personal agendas. alliance background is irrelevant at least in my eyes. i need to dig up my quote from rawr forums where i said to my members who dont want to vote for me from whatever the reason are they should vote for f.e. meissa, herschel, oz and several other guys who showed me that they have enough of game knowledge, not huge egos and ability to maturely discuss about all aspects of the game, and none of them have any significant alliance or political background.the only problem i see with ""empire"" candidates is that they suck more or less in 0.0 (esp. endgame) and pvp knowledge, while most of the serious 0.0 guys on top of nulsec knowledge knows a lot about carebear activities aswell. in short, i would recommend you to apply for csm."
10/13/2009,"vuk lau, you said about 90% of all proposed issues where raised by the csms. where there any time constraints that made this difficult to achieve or is the length of csm meetings flexible enough to accomodate for discussing all features? in other words, is filthering even required?i suspect that if issues where raised based on the proposed solutions rather than stricktly the underlying problem only then you'd often find ccp's response to be 'we've allready tried this solution' 'we've allready discussed that solution' and 'yah that's not gonna work'. in the experience of past csm members, is this true?"
10/13/2009,"sometimes we had extremely long meetings (hi omber zombie) but the ammount of the issues was never a ""big"" problem. i was always trying to look impartially to all issues and only thing where i lacked knowledge was faction warfare but both csm 2.0 and csm 3.0 had delegates who were kind enough to get me into details. from that point of view i think that we were discussing most of the issues raised with adequate ""dedication"" or f.e. if its minor ui tweak which is perfectly logical we spent one or two minutes on the issue but for certain issues we spent a lot of time discussing them.same goes for meetings with ccp. we spent minutes on some issues with simple ""yes we will implement it in next patch"", ""yes its in backlog"", or just simple ""no"" and sometimes we spent hours."
10/13/2009,"personally i think there should be some way you can interrupt the macro miners from their nefarious actions. there are 25 belts in my home system and rarely more than one miner in each. one day last week i logged on within 6 hours of downtime and every single belt was 100% mined out. this isn't a case of too many miners, rather macro mining locusts."
10/13/2009,simple... if someone gets more than 25 blocks within 10 seconds then it should flag him as a gold spammer and auto silence them for and 6 hours on public channels and auto petitions a gm to review the text to make sure it wasn't a troll or a collective attempt at getting someone banned.
10/13/2009,"i thought of this, too. then you'd get a large corp/alliance griefing legitimate people."
10/14/2009,"and now ati/amd's new eyefinity tech is out, which means i can turn 3x 24"" monitors (or 3x 22"" which i have) into a 'single' monitor...i can't imagine the text at 3600x1900 or 5500x2750 or some nearly unreasonable resolution (depending on whether you leave your monitors horizontal or flip them up to vertical). but eve on 3 monitors as a single screen...!"

10/14/2009,"what a rediculous idea. however as is the norm with games, console releases come first to create a cash flow and then pc release afterwards. to all those who mentioned the macro thing with farming accounts or whatever using multiple clients. 3 words - power of 2. they encourage multiple accounts.but either way i think it will end up on pc maybe a year or so after the console release. i really hate this whole console take-over-the-world thing though because i've invested a hell of a lot of money into a computer which apparently means nothing if there's no games coming out on it. and not a snowballs chance in hell am i getting a ps3 or xbox for any one game.but for the record opening to the massive console market is a good business move, but they wont risk screwing the thousands of pc users that pay them. so patience."
10/14/2009,"ccp: shooter on a console are different as shooters on the pc. we want to concentrate on developing a good console shooter.""translation: ""making a shooter compatible with more than one system is too much hard work""i support this topic, not just as a pc gamer or a console gamer, but as someone who sincerely believes this will be a massive failure if it's not released on pc.distribute it via steam or something, it's worth the hard work ccp."
10/14/2009,this thread still drawing epic emo tears?
10/14/2009,"i agree, i don't own a console, and i don't want to buy one, but i'd love to play dust.i like to play fps on pc, not console."
10/14/2009,i mainly play pc games and only own an old xbox so wouldn't have access to dust 514... so i agree make it available for pc users too... as it looks great and i prefer a mouse too a gamepad any day playing a fps.aluthin
10/14/2009,"i think everyone who supports this is missing the point. ccp is making dust a console only game to bring in more casual gamers. eve already caters to the hardcore gamers out there. dust will bridge the gap between the hardcore and the more casual gamer. i have introduced some of my xbox friends to eve and they played for a month and quit. the same guys will play cod4, halo, red faction, cod: waw non-stop for weeks. they enjoy the ability to jump into a game play get some action and quit. they didn't enjoy jumping on a vent with some serious business alliance members.there are plenty of shooters available out there on the pc. let the console gamers have this one. i for one enjoy console fps over pc fps any day."
10/14/2009,"complex instead of deadspace then, a nice c is clear enough."
10/14/2009,you just know ccp are still arguing about which shade of pink to use on the officer mods.ff66cc is a nice rose style colour

10/14/2009,omg i bumped this thread!!
10/14/2009,supported
10/14/2009,this would be a massive improvement./signed
10/14/2009,"i supported it almost exactly a year ago, and i'll support it again.it's frustrated that it still hasn't been taken seriously by ccp."
10/14/2009,"sound oriented with regards to the ship is my preference. so, how about having a feature of choice here. the object i view with the camera should not be binaural but rather mono through the front speakers only.i'm surprised by the lack of feedback here. perhaps enough has already been said in all of the previous post apocrypha forum sound threads already. and, perhaps, that ought to be enough for ccp to go by."
10/14/2009,"the retribution is an odd little beast, because it's a frig that's completely unusable solo. that said, as part of a mixed gang, it's the scariest frigate in the game(bar possibly bombers, but those are a whole other kettle of fish). i'm not a huge fan of frigs in general, but the ret is one of the ones i actually like more than most. there aren't many ships that can apply that kind of dps to frigate-sized targets. if the ship isn't good enough at its role, boost its ability to perform its job, don't change the job. give it a fifth turret slot, and fitting to match. i don't think it needs it, but i don't fly amarr - if i'm wrong, that'd be the right boost. but personally, i love the idea of a one-mid ship being somewhere in the ship list. it's an interesting design challenge, see what you can do with that limit and still have a usable ship. similarly, i'd be all for a 0/1-low caldari af existing, just to see how scary the rest of its stats can be and still result in a balanced ship."
10/14/2009,"and ""assault ship[frig]"" is meant to ""assault"" targets.not tackle them.not that i'm saying you shouldn't or can't... just pointing out that the original designed intention is to provide dps.now i've not looked at the specs for a retribution... but most amarian ships typically have very few mid slots due to the fact they are armor tankers and tend to favor low slots over them.odd's are its much like the destroyer hull in this case...can't support this as your attempting to slap a sticker on said ship to make it just like the rest of them.if it don't work... get someone else to do it or use a different ship.not all ships are equal... equalizing them tends to be a big mistake.diversification is what makes this game so great.i will not deny however there are some ships in need of some boosting... but this is not one of them as far as this context is concerned.if your going to change this ship... boost its role... not something outside of its intended scope."
10/14/2009,supporting a second midslot for this terrible ship
10/14/2009,give it another mid yo
10/14/2009,"supporting the support in this supported support thread.amarr are seriously lacking in the frig department imo. retribution has single mid, vengeance has lolrockets. giving retri another mid would go a long way to fix that. then it's just the issue with rockets ."
10/14/2009,give it moar mids
10/14/2009,not need cry anymore :dccp chronotis > you might also be interested to know that slot-changing rigs are in their last stages of internal testing
10/14/2009,"you got trolled, bro.edit: grath told me to support this, so i am."
10/14/2009,"right, because everyone uses a curse for ""recon"". your logic is foul.+1 support. give the little guy a chance."
10/14/2009,"seriously if you are in a frig and still need a tackler, something went wrong."
10/14/2009,"supported.also, more cpu (also for wolf/enyo which have cpu problems themselves). current fittings are beyond stupid. you cannot ""gank"" when you cannot support enough damage mods cpu wise. there is little point in a af which can neither gank nor tackle, and only very marginal usability in a af which can't tackle."
10/14/2009,"yeah, i agree that the retribution is somewhat gimped in purpose. especially since its clear that ccp has abs in mind for afs, having that second mid would be necessary for a scram."

10/14/2009,"hope you meant faction police... concord don't chase... they ""show up and kick yo ass on the spot""as for the main issue your obviously implying... i think restricting it to -10 people is not enough.revoke insurance for all instances of criminal actions in any cases and you may dent it.but as its been pointed out... this doesn't stop them... just makes it harder.so i can't really support this due to lack of foresight... but yes it is a problem none-the-less."
10/14/2009,"who pvps in a freighter? i thought freighters where meant to have an escort or something.anyyhow, get a friend with a logistics ship to rep your shields and move on.you can not do everything solo in eve and expect to be safe all the time."
10/14/2009,"i do not supportth eops post as people need to insure their ships to pvp, that includes -10 people.what i believe should happen is that if your ship is killed by concord or the police, then your insurance is invalidated..."
10/14/2009,"you're familiar with the concept of non-consensual pvp, right? i mean no one pvp's in a freighter by choice. and the shield repping idea is great, unless they bring enough alpha to the party to make it useless.my point is, if the purpose of insurance is to make pvp more viable, then let's make it actually do that. let me insure my cargos, so that i can care as little about what happens to my ship as you care what happens to yours."
10/14/2009,"honestly i do not see high-sec suicide gankers as a big problem. i think they are well withing the cage, attacking only the targets that has disproportional amount of isk carried vs there tank. nothing stops you from putting 2-4 meidum shield extenders on your industrial ship, and warp core stabs. everyone can do that. if you are carrying a blueprint, use a fast ship or a tanked ship. that will save you from vast majority of suicide gankers."
10/14/2009,"some subjects people discuss because they are involved in it and some people discuss even when it doesn't affect them, just in principle.this one's pretty simple, if you run missions or are not a troll you agree that salvaging is theft, if you're a salvage thief or a troll you argue that it's not.i support this thread."
10/14/2009,"i do run missions to make my isk. i am strongly opposed to salvage flagging.not everyone is prepared to wreck a whole profession just for their own selfish advantage.still, luckily this is all moot, since ccp have made their opposition to this extremely clear. they're not going to make salvage flaggable no matter how long and loud you whine. and if they do, they'll do it in some way that gives you what you ask for but not at all what you want. eg: making combat mission deadspaces lo-sec, reducing mission income in some way, or some other, more devious amendment.make no mistake: ccp have realised their error in making hi-sec missioning too good for the level of risk, and they will not do anything that skews the equation even further. they're far more likely to increase risk and decrease reward."
10/14/2009,"please do because i would really like to know what they are.salvage yield is highly variable because yield of every singe wreck is random withing certain limits, but you can make some healthy amount of cash from it. traidor disloyal- i know that the odds are not in favor of a mission runner, but killing a ninja salvager is nothing impossible and isn't even that hard if you are ready and know what you are doing. that does seem to be true. so you are telling me that every single ninja lotter and salvager that tried to steal something from my corpmates checked all 5 system around dodixie with the total population of about a thousand people before stealing the loot? you might be doing that, but i am absolutely sure that not all of them do."
10/14/2009,"that's a pretty bold statement. it's also false since i can offer at least one case that proves it's wrong. that being me.lately i've been spending a lot of my time running missions building faction standing (and cash). i have had a ninja raid a couple of my missions - i still don't think it's theft. annoying, yes, theft no."
10/14/2009,"maybe. but the people i have been playing this game with for the past 2 1/2 years know what they are doing when it comes to ""farming"" mission runners. unless we are activly hunting war targets there is always someone there to give the ""mission farmer"" help if he gets in over his head.maybe not all. and sometimes we don't. the trick is to check the attributes of the corp the mission runner belongs to. you take the number of people in the corp and figure that at most 1/2 to 1/3 may be on at any give time. you also look at the age of the corp and the person who started it. and take your chances from there.my experience has been that a majority of mission runners are by themselves, with no backup. and even if they do have people in the same system they usually wont get help. and in the off chance help does come to them, the help has no idea what they are doing except how to explode spectacularly.and, by the way, i don't like ""farming"" mission runners. it's like work to me. i'll take two hours to hunt a war target down. i'll make 30 jumps just to kill a war target mining in an astroid field. but ""farming"" mission runners is not fun for me. you can get very wealthy doing it but it's not not my cup of tea."
10/14/2009,"ok, out of interest- would it be bad or good for you, personally, traidor disloyal, if salvaging would result in aggro?"
10/14/2009,"i would be for it due to the fact that the people in my corp use mission busting (taking loot) to cause the mission runner to go temporarily insane and shoot at them and thus causing the salvaging of the mission runners wreak. but that is just me. i'm more into war decs and salvaging ships that way.i also understand where people say that mission runners do make a lot of isk for very little risk and thus mission runners do not need the extra isk. i also understand where ccp is coming from in that they seem to like conflict and that salvaging wreaks from missions by people who did not generate that mission is a good thing.there really is no downside to mission running. you can be half asleep, watching tv, or rubbing yourself and has long has you pay attention you will not loose your ship. traders can miscalculate on trades. miners can have the mineral floor fall out from under them. industrial people can have a bad day at selling stuff. mission runners could fall asleep at the keyboard and if they have a good tank nothing will happen.i have a character that mission runs (besides being a cov ops pilot). in the 3 years i have had that character running missions she has never lost a ship. she has bought exactly one frig, a drake, a raven, and a nighthawk to run missions. she bought that nighthawk a year ago and she has never come close to loosing it. mission running is an easy, no brainer way to make isk in game. the npcs are a joke if you know what to do. the only thing that adds spice to it (and causes me not to fall asleep) is the chance that a ninja might come into my mission. i doubt that will ever happen. i can run missions for a multitude of agents for all 4 major races. the agents i run missions for are not in mission hubs. and they are high quality level 4 agents. i don't run missions for caldari navy.i don't want to take isk away from the mission runners. but mission runners already get lp (buy stuff from store and sell on market), they get bounty, and they get loot, and if you are fast enough and not in a mission hub 9 times out of 10 the mission runner will also get the salvage.a little bit of risk for the mission runner is not really all that bad."
10/14/2009,"re slave/crystal, i've always thought it was sort of nifty how they separated those two. i'm all for crystals working on capital modules, though. re talismans, i find them incredibly nifty, though i'll agree that rof is a bit weak on a set of modules that tend to be good at capping out the person using them. perhaps a multiplier on the effect would be a more interesting ability, though it'd run the risk of breaking cap transfers. this seems ridiculous to me. if a 20% speed boost doesn't matter, why do people fit overdrives? it's a free boost to your tracking, and lets you engage/disengage faster. i'm not convinced that they're worth the isk, unless you're a machariel pilot, and i think that the quantum rise nerf was a touch too severe, but saying that they're useless is dumb. you don't know how the tracking formula works, it seems. resolution/radius is not a separate calculation, it's a multiplier on tracking. capital guns hit frigates 100% of the time if both are immobile and in range. shooting a frig(radius 40) with a battleship gun(radius 400) just means that your effective tracking is divided by 10. dropping your sig radius to 3/4 of what it was before makes your effective radial 4/3 of what it was before, which is a nice boost. it still feels like a very weak bonus to me(unless you pile on a gang linked ragnarok or something equally absurd), but it doesn't do what you think it does to turret hit rates. whether pirate implants are allowed in the tourney or not is kind of irrelevant. he was using the tourney to give an example of possible tactics, not commenting on what mods/plants were used to implement those tactics."
10/14/2009,you forgot how pathetic virtue implants are now that probing is so easy to do...
10/14/2009,you forget how easy it is to hide from an unskilled prober.
10/14/2009,is the csm still going to bring this travesty of an idea to the attention of ccp???please tell me after all of the replies to this thread your still not going thru with it are you???
10/14/2009,already did. muahahahahahahaahahah
10/14/2009,so what did ccp say?
10/14/2009,i would scoop them... but it takes my dominix a long time to travel sometimes 50km to them... usually theyre dead before i can get back into the room
10/14/2009,"are you a noob or what?if you are in a mission you can be far away from the warp in point.not talking about the multi-stage missions!stfu if you don't know what the f* you are talking about.i support this idea, it's stupid loosing the main weapon, nobody else loose anything while warping out, and camera drones warp with the ship, so......."
10/14/2009,"a simple recall to bay on disconnect would be nice... granted drones might not make it back in time, but you'd have no balancing issues."
10/14/2009,"i have noticed that if you warp out while theyre returning they do stay connected, but it's kind of hard to click return when youve been disconnected :)"
10/14/2009,awwwww did some one get ganked i personally dont see any problem with high sec ganking thats why you dont play internet spaceships afk
10/14/2009,this.
10/14/2009,"assuming that this doesn't make the server people want to punch the lot of us, i'm all for it."
10/14/2009,definately would help out in the long run...
10/14/2009,i say remove sisters of eve and other ways to get tags up for empire factions or allow pirate faction to be raised like tags or running for sisters ect.
10/14/2009,i like this
10/14/2009,"that would be very stupid, from a game mechanics and rp point of view. cloaking hides you from scanners, not from local. if you want it to hide you from local, i say you're gonna need to show up on scan. you can't be hidden from both. and hell, say the cloaking produces a large amount of interference thereby greatly increasing your signature radius and making it easy to probe you out.covert ops ships are hidden enough... people need to stop complaining about how null-sec is the same as high-sec, because there's no reason for it not to be."
10/14/2009,the current implimentation of local as the omniscient intelligence tool is what is stupid - from a game mechanics and rp point of view.
10/14/2009,well. not really. it follows basically the principles you got atm in air traffic. if you enter a certain controlled space your plane sends an identification number and some more details about your flight. similar in eve.if you enter a system your ship broadcasts to a system beacon that relays to the other ships.
10/14/2009,"thanks for the support ;)more importantly, thanks for civil discussion."
10/14/2009,"an idea that i had pop into my head a few days ago. i've been refining it since then.a tier training system: (tier: a row or level of a structure, typically one of a series of rows placed one above the other and successively receding or diminishing in size)so, the current training queue is already the largest tier, tier 1.my proposal is to implement a second and possibly third tier. (three is probably overdoing it, and wouldn't serve much of a purpose due to the slow speed i have included.)a two tier example would be this:tier 1 training at normal speeds - normal 24 hour training queue. (original)tier 2 training at one third/quarter speed (takes three or four times longer to train) - 6 hour training queue.as you can see, the second tier is much smaller, one forth the size and one third/forth speed overall. this would allow players the choices of; a: work a long skill in the first tier at normal speed, while also side-studying a 'shorter' skill, taking three to four times the normal speed. b: work faster skills in the first tier while chipping away at a longer skill in the second tier.c: work on their main specialization. (mining for example.) yet also work on a alternate skill set, (industrial or fighting.)i've thought of including an isk price/needed skill-set to unlock the second tier, or you 'rent' the second tier for some price. i am not too sure about implementing that part of the idea though.in summary, the purpose of the tier system is to give players the opportunity to either diversify or specialize easier. it would also serve to make players log in more during the 'long-haul' of one month or even multiple month skills, during which players may leave the game until the training is done, or quit entirely because they feel they are getting nowhere."
10/14/2009,"while the idea has merit... i can't support it.the training queue makes eve the most unique game around.by allowing players to train more than one skill on a single character would cause alot of issues for those of us who are training right now.the only way this would work and i stress if on this one.... is if the training time would be penalized for the first tier for use of the second tier.in reallity you are abusing a system that was designed for one skill a at a time.people would achieve skills much more quickly... not good.the only thing i find rational in this case is the ability to queue up skills (or share rather) between alts.not sure if its currently doing this but i've heard its a rather likable idea.your likely to get trolled... so i'll throw in the obligatory ""ibfgb2wow"" rant response and take my leave.o7"
10/14/2009,"1. i believe you mean players that just join? as i said, i've thought about requiring a skill-set or isk price for running the second tier, it would not be cheap or easy to get. other than newer players matching up older players, (which it would not be cheap or easy for them to do.) i don't see any other problems. mind elaborating on any that i seem to be missing?2. the first tier would stay the same. the second tier takes three to four times as long to train skills. maybe you were confused on that point, the second tier is not faster, it is much, much slower to use than the first. maybe it should be increased to five or six times if it seems four is not slow enough...3. refer to response 2, it would take a lot longer, a normal one hour skill would take four hours, and only leave room for one more skill. remember that i propose a 6 hour limit queue for the second tier, instead of a 24 hour one, severely limiting how much you could put in.4. this system does not share skills between alts, it limits it to one character, and would have the same limitation of one character learning at a time.5. ""ibfgb2wow"" ibf - no idea, gb2wow i would imagine means 'go back to world of warcraft.' i used to, it's too easy."
10/14/2009,"surely having two skills training at the same time, both at half speed would be much simpler to implement without the balance implications... if anything along those lines is needed at all."
10/14/2009,"so basically, you want to increase training speed by 25-33%, and make the system more complicated at the same time. sorry, i can't support this."
10/14/2009,"i like the idea. it's interesting.however likable or even ""good"" ideas shouldn't always be implemented.if i understand you correctly and the second tier would, essentially/in the long run, be training skills at the same speed or less than you can train them in the first tier (today's method)...then i would say why? for example, some have suggested before to be able to have two skills train at the same time, both at half speed. why? train one, and then the other. with the skill q that we have today, this is completely unnecessary. do you have a long skill going but want to feel like you're making progress? once or twice a week switch to a shorter skill. if you have skills you'd like to progress that take less than a day, you can even add those on to the beginning of the q and your long skill will pick up afterwards.so, solution in search of a problem, i guess."
10/14/2009,"lol, i read somewhere this:ccp chronotis > you might also be interested to know that slot-changing rigs are in their last stages of internal testing"
10/14/2009,"the only way this would remotely work is if it follows fille balle's idea that they begin to work like rigs.a lot of time and discussion goes into the design of every ship to make sure that it is balanced. not necessarily to prescribe a particular function for the ship, but more to prevent it from serving multiple functions at the same time. want a really heavy shield tank for your drake? fill your low slots with shield power relays, and put 2 large shield extenders and a myriad of resistance amplifiers in your mids. heavy tank, low dps. other way around if you want high dps. 3 bcs in your low slots, mids have a medium shield extender or two along with an ab and target painter, t2 launchers in the highs. heavy dps with meager tank. you can't have heavy dps and heavy tank, and that is important. but to implement this system without some major restrictions, you are pretty much massively buffing every ship in the game and forcing everybody to start using completely different fits.. and those who take longer to develop their new fits will be destroyed before they can test them.not supported."
10/14/2009,ok the you can access them at pos's. now my proposal is to make it more obvious somehow. possibly by displaying it on the right click menu on the ship maintenance array.
10/14/2009,not true. no support.
10/14/2009,you already can add and remove drones using a ship maintenance array.open the fitting panel for your ship when you're in range of the sma and click the drones icon.
10/14/2009,"you already can, though i'll admit it's not obvious. anchor a ship maintenance array at your pos. fly up to it, right-click, use fitting service. at the fitting screen that pops up, click on the little drone icon at the bottom left. congrats, you've accessed your drone bay."
10/14/2009,"seriously, ccp, were you guys too lazy to give it a paragraph description in its info box, or is black rise such a crappy region that you just don't care?"
10/14/2009,"""this is an area of space that was discovered and settled the same day that the empires went to war with each other. while the coincidence is remarkable, experts assure us that it is all perfectly in keeping with known laws of physics, and was not in any way a frantic kludge designed to make a game mechanic possible.""seriously, i do support this. a minor issue, but a really easy one to fix."
10/14/2009,why not
10/14/2009,reasons1.) low sec lacks reason. a.) have fw that has its own issue b.) we have pirates running about fighting one another and trying their best to grief2.) high sec has too much profit with no risk. a.) if you are a mission runner learn to look for combat probes see them then dock or go to a safe and warp between safes until the 15 aggression counter is gone and then log off. b.) play smart you won<U+FFFD>t lose your ship end of story.3.) will give people some kill mails because mission runners don't know the basics of living in low sec or in 0.04.) would give pirates something to shoot.5.) would fix the issue of great isk p/hr with no risknow i don't live in low sec i<U+FFFD>m out in npc 0.0i also don't see how many pirate battleships manage to get into high sec.
10/14/2009,no. it would just lead to people moving to lvl3s. and there are plenty lvl4ql20 agents in lowsec with higher rewards than their highsec counterparts. didnt really help either.all your suggestions wouldnt really fix lowsec.greetings from someone living in lowsec and 0.0
10/14/2009,"how about a lot of skillpoints, oh wait..."
10/14/2009,"no. eve doesn't need more players. people need to stop suggesting things that make it super easy for newbs to get into the game. you and i got into the game just fine with the way things are now, and frankly, i don't want to play this game with people who are babied for the first couple months because then they won't understand how the game actually works, or people who only continue playing through their first couple months because they're being given things for having a subscription because most will lose interest once the handouts cease."
10/14/2009,"check this out:ccp chronotis > yes, to a limited degree we are re-introducing ""nano"" gameplayccp chronotis > but, it will be mitigated by a return to the old webifiers strength, combined with a large sig radius penalty per speed mod fitted"
10/14/2009,why not just make webs script able? have a script that gives your web 75% reduction in speed but it cuts the range in half. simple fix no need to rebalance anything.
10/14/2009,also a good idea.supporting this topic in hopes it at least gets looked at by csm/devs.
10/14/2009,"sentries are fine, people use them quite a lot. not supported."
10/14/2009,not supported...learn to use drones more effectively.
10/14/2009,"*sigh* can we go back to productive discussion now? i might not agree with you two on everything, but mazz and vuk, i gotta say thank you for remaining participatory in this discussion. you've both shared enough across several threads that i understand you feel frustrated and that many csms have enough to do in rl and otherwise to be willing to sacrifice more personal time on csm than they already do. to sum up, the situation's not perfect, but there's been some progress in the organization department even if it's not always apparent to the player base. okay, that's a good start. guess you gotta be on the inside looking out to really understand what the obstacles are. i hope to be doing just that for csm5."
10/14/2009,"it seems that ccp went back to the drawing board with this one during the last year.personally i feel the incarna should be more of a game in the game. it should have its own goals and mechanics, kinda like dust 514, though more connected to eve 'classic' than dust 514 will be, due to the fact that it uses the same client, and centers around pod pilots like 'classic' does.i would not mind that you could play incarna as your primary game experience and just use your pod pilot ability to move between stations. this of course would mean that incarna would have to be able to work on its own as a game. (in game mechanic terms, not actually.)having it beeing 'just' a social tool would be a bit of a waste."
10/14/2009,"considering that there are still many existing features in eve that need work, i wouldn't want them to make incarna too massive in terms of how much resources it takes to make it. i feel incarna is important, but not all overrulingly important."
10/14/2009,"that's right my friends, it is now in the on position i'm throwing my hat in the ring as force for truth, justice, and small gang pvp.cc'd from declarations of war:""with over a year and a half behind the wheel of noir. ive established a lasting and very public reputation for integrity and exacting standards. you can call me a pvp candidate, yet i have no ties to partisan 0.0 power blocs, grief tactics, or pirates. what i do have is a strong desire to see small gang pvp become increasingly relevant and fun, promote diversity and balance among shiptypes, and make sure issues raised by the exciting new changes in the dominion patch are highlighted so this expansion can to live up to all our expectations.but pvp isnt just about the pew pew. as ceo of one of eves most in demand mercenary outfits, i have proven myself to be a sound businessman. additionally, my clientel is a wide spread of the eve community from 0.0 alliances, to wormholers, to the industrialists which keep the ships flowing. i think that competition is healthy, and i would advocate the removal of barriers to competition like npc sell orders, suicide gank insurance, and other price ceilings. as an obligatory wave to my fellow mercenary ceos as well as all those who seek our services, i also support game mechanics which support the business side of the mercenary industry including protecting both merc and employer from scams.and finally, i am running to hold ccp to a higher standard. the gm department needs to be improved for ccp to continue to have a positive relationship with its player base. ccp needs to admit the problem and work with the csm on a solution to increase familiarity with basic eve mechanics and thoughtful reading of petitions. this will drastically improve the first line of customer service and promote the healthy growth and stability of the subscriber base.if you have any questions for me, about me, or about my position on a certain issue i can be reached via eve mail or by comments on the blog. watch this space for more announcements and highlights of q+as or my posts on the csm forums.-alekseyev karrdeceo, noir.""answering voter q's #1 (rr, ecm, cloaks, more)corp/alliance chat motd as part of corp management reformsupport for csm publicviews on price controls explained3rd party apps for eve's web 2.0 portalbookmarks and probing need love!eve tribune interviewdiplomats (corp management buff)lowsec, fac warfareplanet risk csm debates round 2"

10/14/2009,"i'll be voting for you with at least one of my accounts so you have at least two votes including yours :phowever, would like to hear your thoughts on the following:1) do you think anything needs to be done to make small gang/solo pvp ""better"", is stuff fine as is, or do you think they need to swing it towards larger fleets some more?2) how do you feel about the ecm mechanic? does it need a nerf, a buff, a change, or to remain unchanged?3) what do you think about cloaks on interceptors? should these be a more viable strategy?4) what areas of the game do you hope to influence?"
10/14/2009,you forgot rr mechanics.
10/14/2009,"oh, that too. i was too busy trolling about the ****-fits that have appeared on the noir. killboard over the past week :p5) do you feel that rr mechanics (neutral and outlaw) need to be changed? or are they fine as is?"
10/14/2009,good question.
10/14/2009,"and finally 6) how do you feel about the overview? could it use an upgrade to not be ****ing ******ed, or is it fine as is and i'm just a whiny soab?7) rock pokemon are annoying? c/d?"
10/14/2009,"what specific complaints/suggestions do you have regarding the overview?also, all you need is a squirtle."
10/14/2009,"mainly how difficult it is to create overview tabs, how silly the states category is with the algorithm it uses to determine if a ship should appear or not appear on your overview.grass at the start is apparently the best, but i had no connection with the grass or water on offer, and chose fire because to be the best pok<U+FFFD>mon trainer in the sinnoh region you really need to have a connection with your pok<U+FFFD>mon."
10/14/2009,"yeah i guess creating tabs could be easier. switching bracket profiles could probably be streamlined, too.i honestly haven't played since red & blue, but you are of course right. the first 2 badges you receive are against rock and water types, so grass is the best to start with."
10/14/2009,"sorry to upset the rock and mickey show, but this... rring a crim without a gcc should not give you a gcc.. sure, rring them when they have a gcc is fine, i mean your actually helping an active criminal then.. but rring a gang mate that happens to be -5 or less should not get me shot at by gate guns when he can sit there quite happily all day long."
10/14/2009,"you're right. outlaws need to have perma-gcc, that would actually make sense"
10/14/2009,"i was referring more to ***gots parking 8 npc corp guardians on a station in highsec and there isn't **** you can do about it, but yeah, the gcc thing needs looking at, too."
10/14/2009,"hmm, almost as good as lana running, and since im fairly sure i know your stance on most things already ill say yes :-p"
10/14/2009,you have my nine votes.don't forget to send the isk in a manilla envelope (shhh)
10/14/2009,you know you have the votes of the final noir.as your super duper powerbloc brothers we will be proud to support you (also you have tfs in your employment history and that makes you pretty damn special <3)
10/14/2009,you are such a hater poastedrot!
10/14/2009,:d
10/14/2009,already been raised by yours truely darling (you can give me a rub down later).
10/14/2009,"eh...already voting for istavaan, but if i had another account i might.tbh the truth and justice thing is a turnoff"
10/14/2009,i of course shall be voting for my good friend and ceo..and... damn... i did a snappy job on lexa's sig... doncha think? :)
10/14/2009,"yeah, and how well did it go.. every c&p csm needs to raise the issue until its fixed. (also, im still voting for you lark, im just hedging my bets as alek would be the only other person i might have voted for)"
10/14/2009,"i am (or was) one of the biggest proponents of logistical ships. i still like them and think they are awesome. but even i will admit to it. it has gotten out of hand with all the remote repping neutrals. this is coming from the person who has an alt (or alts?) created for the sole purpose of remote repping my main and other players in combat for isk. pvp is fading very quickly in empire and has all but dissapeared compared to years ago. players are so leery of other players using neutral remote logistics. it was falcon alts coming in and jamming that was the big pain, now it's neutral repping. not whining, and frankly i don't even care if it is fixed, but it is an issue that certainly deserves looking into.edit: if i vote for anyone, it would be aleks."
10/14/2009,i approve of this product/service.
10/14/2009,easy fix.. cant dock while you have a yellow timer of any sort.. would also create tears from mission runners... (ok a more reasonable one would be to limit it to player based yellow timers...)would also fix the moros 'issue' and the 'i have a carrier so im immune if i stay in docking range' issue...
10/14/2009,"i like aleks, but just posting that you're running for csm, and then leaving the thread?i'm not going to vote for someone unless i know what types of changes are going to be brought to the table.knowing aleks i'm sure that wardec mechanics will be brought up (dropping alliance to avoid pos takedowns and things like that)remote repping not causing an aggro timer.all in all, i'm disappointed in the lack of effort put forth in announcing your candidacy."
10/14/2009,perhaps this is just an attention getter thread and the meat will come later?
10/14/2009,op posted on 14th. you should give people at least 24 hours to reply to something given people have real lives outside internet spaceships.so wait.
10/14/2009,think i'll stick with isstvan. gl though!
10/14/2009,got my 4 votes
10/14/2009,also my votes.
10/14/2009,i would rather vote for joe phoenix.
10/14/2009,thats why your votes are automatically rejected by the servers..
10/14/2009,i expected more from you... you have let me down.i need a better troll to look up to now.
10/14/2009,"more than happy to give you all my votes.i'm convinced that with the grasp you have on the game, most if not all your proposals will be relevent and well thought out. there's always a first time though. i cannot stress the importance of pushing the neutral rr issue, it has to be resolved."
10/14/2009,vote for alek!
10/14/2009,i'm waiting for larkonis to make some last minute entrance into running for csm again (although they'll probably let him in after the cut-off date as he is that cool).if that doesn't happen i'll be voting for alek x 4.
10/14/2009,"well, if you're looking to get all the corps votes, i might make a couple suggestions:1) repeal that egregious 100% tax hike you hit us with to fund the ""alek's ship replacement program""2) it would be nice if a little more of the contract payouts made it to us than was going to cover your pathetic e-o poker losses."
10/14/2009,you'll have my vote...if the podcast comes out soon.
10/14/2009,"? erm.. did you lose another ship or something? you seem tense, or something"
10/14/2009,"this would go a long way in overcoming the bad overview imo, allowing customizable data to appear next to the targets...same crap you can add to the overview now, just listed on your current selected target...less columns needed when you can just flip through targets to get the info...please visit your user settings to re-enable images.oh, yeah and alekseyev has my votes..."
10/14/2009,aleks u have three of my votes!!!!!! u better ****!n win too....ur an awesome fc and a great leader and im sure u have great ideas for high sec war fixes that need to be addressed. especially some that we have dealt with together. also together i mean with u.e. since u probably dont know directly who i am cause im a nobody......next time u see solty tell him to get the **** out of the channel btw way itll be good lols trust me.
10/14/2009,"you have my vote, babes"
10/14/2009,"no u. as this is a real life commitment i do expect that the op for candadicy be more than 2 lines long, but as you can see already, with him being a very popular capsuleer (imo), people are willing to blindly follow him no matter what issues he currently supports.please don't get me wrong, i like aleks a lot. i think he's funny, runs a great corp, and declarations of war is the only eve podcast i listen to. (i'm looking at you jimer)this whole running for csm seems very last minute."
10/14/2009,wow you really are that full of yourself
10/14/2009,...and my axe
10/14/2009,"yeah, i get that.but i also give people the benefit of a doubt that they are capable of being a good csm member when all the evidence in game points to this.so, i'm waiting until he puts out his spiel before i make a decision.but, it would have to be good to steal my vote from lark or istavaan"
10/14/2009,well i was going to throw my name into the csm ring but since you my boss i suppose you be more good that ill ever be. perhaps next year ill throw my name down for the forum community :pyour my vote =)
10/14/2009,"thanks for the support everyone. i suppose i should have planned ahead and had the heavens part when i announced. maybe a choir of angels... promise to do better next time ;)as to the questions in this thread i'll put out thoughtful answers tomorrow, after i'm confident i've passed some pesky tests hehe."

10/14/2009,"i like the idea, my overview isn't big enough to have all the iinformation i need displayed on it.although; to decide which ship im going to shoot sometimes i'll take a look at the overview, set transversal to 0, and pew pew it... having to click through all the targets to see which isn't moving would not be ok with me :)perhaps an overhaul to the entire locking system is needed, where your targets are locked go on the left hand screen vertically(naglfarly) down from your neocom; and then velocity, range, transversal would be displayed there.and maybe a 'organize by' button on the top left so you could organize by distance, speed etc... hell it could even be placed just to the left of the overview since it won't have to take up the entire screen anymore."

10/14/2009,"when people sit down to play a game of chess it's an understood and agreed upon competition. people aren't suddenly challenged to chess games while they try to go about their daily business, and losing in chess more often than not doesn't cause someone to lose anything of any value.it can't be compared to causing misery to random people in a video game simply because it satisfies them on some primitive level. i'm not making a giant moral judgement about people who engage in such behavior, but lets be honest; they are doing it because they enjoy making others suffer. they are sadists by every definition. they should at least have the balls to admit that instead of deluding themselves and others."
10/14/2009,"stop. this is different from undocking in eve how, exactly? you might tell yourself that you ""should"" be immune to unexpected aggression, but that certainly doesn't mean you are; and i think most people understand that at some point. if they don't, that's a failure on their part."

10/14/2009,"go. everytime we leave our house in real life we accept the possibility that we could be shot by a mugger or killed by some psychopath for no reason at all, so us having prior knowledge of the chance makes the people who do it justified somehow?i'm not saying people should be immune or anything, don't try to twist my words. all i'm saying is the people who engage in such behavior should be honest with themselves and others about why they do what they do, instead of creating delusions and justifications that allow them to see themselves as righteous while they go about cruel and sadistic behavior."
10/14/2009,"note to self:next time you get mugged, press ctrl+q and wake up safe in the real world.edit:seriously, please just re-read everything you have posted in this thread and think about it for a minute. you are saying that when you log on to a counterstrike server you should be left alone because you aren't asking to be shot? you are saying that when you log on to a combat game, you haven't actually agreed to engage in combat? eve, by every definition is a combat game. why do you think practically every video of the game has ships blowing each other up?how would you like it if on your next mission the npcs turned around and said ""actually, we don't want to be shot. go away."" and jammed all your weapons? consider that, then consider whether eve is the game for you."
10/14/2009,every time you read a reply on the forums you run the risk of catching stupid.dumb people on the forums are therefore automatically griefers and therefore obviously both mentally unstable and evil psychotics in real life. ccp should pass on these players details to the proper authorities so they can be put in mental institutes for the criminally insane.
10/14/2009,"in themepark games people roleplay being evil by getting different coloured armour and maybe some better ofensive magic. you may get a different cut-scene or too as well.in eve, people roleplay being evil by doing evil things. in-game."
10/14/2009,"but you won't see good people deciding to 'roleplay' as evil and cause others misery in a video game. you'll just see people who have those desires but can't act out on them in real life. good people are good, in every circumstance you put them in.they might want to think everyone is like them, and because a monkey can be sadistic too it's part of our nature and that makes it ok, but i can tell you that's not the case. some people are aversed to causing emotional suffering to others, even through a video game.this is the last time i'm going to repeat this, but my only point is that the people who decide to 'roleplay' evil shouldn't try to claim their victims, chosen at random, deserved it somehow. if you're going to be evil, don't be a ***** about it. you like causing others misery, and that's why you do it."
10/14/2009,"maybe you never heard of this?man, i hope you survive the rl learning experiences you have in front of you. it's probably good you're playing eve - this way the shock wont be so bad. i'm guessing you're maybe 18 or 19 or perhaps in your early 20s? no-one with much life experience could possibly say what you just said."
10/14/2009,you can repeat things all you like but you still have a poor understanding of roleplay and what in game behaviour signifies in the attitude of the player.
10/14/2009,"it goes far beyond your little link there. check out the lucifer effect for added madness.most people are weak minded. they follow the herd, doing whatever everyone else is doing, easily influenced by someone else, whether it's an authority figure or not. they don't know how to think for themselves.not everyone is like that, though."
10/14/2009,"if 500 people are waiting to play chess and you make a point of only playing the kid with the helmet and the mittens pinned to his coat, yes."
10/14/2009,"and yet, people who do think for themselves can still meet this criteria of ""goodness"" without an external reference. are we dealing with some sort of platonic ideal of goodness, or is it more of a case of deterministic moral universalism?"
10/14/2009,"i live a good live vicariously and release my urge to do harm by baking fluffy cupcakes. transdimensional evil monitors my anguish metastasis through string cell hypertabernacles, thus my dissonance is halved and my resolve pustulated.in short, im a spazz irl as well as ingame."
10/14/2009,"yeah, i believe that subconsciously, or at least on some level, everyone knows 'right from wrong' as it were, they can sense it in every fiber of their being. carl jung said all mental illness is due to people refusing to experience genuine suffering. as soon as they start feeling guilt or remorse, it bothers them, and they come up with a different perspective on things that makes them feel better about themselves, but it's a delusion, and that's the point where people start getting out of touch with reality and what they're really doing."
10/14/2009,"frigging terrible idea. this is a solution in search of a problem. i have a counterproposal: lock thread, ban op, gas supporters. i promise that it will make the game a better place."
10/14/2009,"/cookie cutter response 6473ok so from my point of view the wardec system has three fatal flaws.1) its too easy to hide from wardecs. players can just dock up or whatever and wait it out. pvp in empire sucks and is boring. it just leads to general frustration on both sides which i think is also why so little players in eve participate in pvp due to bad first expierences in empire.2) the wardec system is abused. there is a ton of crappy alliances in empire that runs around declaring war on various parties without fighting. i think the op is partially correct in the assesment that if you don't fight often enough, and you are the one who declared war in the first place, concord should revoke your rights to that war (with possibly banning you from declaring war for two weeks or something like that, just brain storming)3) if you declare war it should have weight and purpose. it should be expensive to declare war and suddenly have concord turn a blind eye to you blowing someone else up in high sec. the government would have been dismissed a long time ago for not cracking down on concord!so what is the solution? ive not thought too much about this but possibly base wardecs around lowsec. not sure of the mechanics of how this would work but in addition to fixing wardecs, you could give low sec a purpose too cause frankly at the minute its an empty dump with the occasional decent groups of pirates (veto, sniggwaffe), gate campers and faction warfare fleets running through it. possibly introduce a lesser version of the wardec for casual pvp in empire.i dont think too many people are too happy about the state of wardecs right now other than privateers (lol)"
10/14/2009,do you vote on csm members based on game knowlage or based on verbal skills? (the csm does have to convince ccp of the player's points of view after all)
10/15/2009,good idea.
10/15/2009,"giving carrier's a drone repair bay would be most useful for sure. i agree totally that the new bay should not add more drone space. i say that and believe that it may be necissary to enlarge the drone capacity with the new bay, but make it so that drones can not be inside the bay when undocking. the reason i say enlarging the bay might be necissary is because if you think about it as a whole it makes sense. if you take space away from the drone bay, you could be limitig the number of drones you can carry if you can only launch from the drone bay. for instance, with max skills, you can have 15 fighters launched. if you only have enough room for 15 fighters and nothing else in your bay it would be a set-back and not a step forward. personally i like to keep not only fighters in my bay, but a mass of different types of drones to cover most situations i could find myself in. i just do not want to see that precious space shrinked in the process of making carriers better."

10/15/2009,support legion supports.
10/15/2009,i've been asking for this for years now./ben
10/15/2009,"erm... what?retribution - 150 dps in a 20km sphere (!!!) and 200 dps in a 7km sphere with enough tank to make it a real pain to take downvengeance - dude, it's a vengeance, they're awesome. ""i've got a point and f### you if you think your fleet is breaking me before my friends arrive."" epic.malediction - oh you're 200km from me. oh look i'm right next to you with 3 points.crusader - but it's just an inty what can... augh i'm melting!!!purifier - 300-500dps from a frig with better fitting stats than the only other contender (the hound). add to that a (usually - damn you vagabond!! ) poorly tanked primary damage output and these hurt.sentinel - mini curse. totally awesome if flown well.punisher - poor man's vengeance. still good.crucifier - poor man's sentinel. anyone who doesn't like tracking disruptors in his frigate gang needs his head examined.there's no other race that can field a viable and (almost) well rounded fleet simply using ships of their own race. is it the best fleet you can field? no absolutely not. it is however a solid fleet quite capable of ruining people's days.i love flying retributions. they're simple and fun to fly. sometimes i do wish i had a second mid slot, but then i wonder what it is that i'd be doing with it. tackling people is the job of an inty or the vengeance. the retribution is not a solo ship, nor is it a wtfbbqpwn ship. what it is is a good solid fleet ship that complements ships like the ishkur / arty wolf by supporting them in both their engagement spheres. in that context it really doesn't need the second mid.not supported."
10/15/2009,plz fix this red-headed stepchild.
10/15/2009,lol csms.what a joke
10/15/2009,"a lot of the ideas are good individually. omnibusing them is silly, though - as a rule, the csm process hates omnibus stuff. split out the individual ideas and start bringing them up. i'd support most of them."
10/15/2009,this. packing multiple suggestions/ideas into 1 is bad.
10/15/2009,"the reason i put them into a omnibus is because 1) there are 16 ideas total, at 5 min a pop that 1hour and 20 mins of posting2) if i were to to post all of them at once i would probably get flame posts about spamming the forum because it would take up the page.3) by giving each one its own post that would be 16 different threads i would have to watch for responses, and i dont want to spend that much time reading the forums.so instead i was hoping to get comments on which were the best one or two ideas, and then post those 1/2 ideas as proposals in their own threads."
10/15/2009,"no there is no need of so much changes, just bring the weaponry in line with other races.1650 arty are laughable at best"
10/15/2009,your post actually made me laugh out loud jason. 5 out of 5 stars.
10/15/2009,i wonder if there is room for a mechanic where pilot sec status vrs system sec status modifies insurance payout.so a lower sec pilot in higher sec system gets less %....opens up loopholes surely..... maybe some math that'd work.....
10/15/2009,"so a + sec status player that loses a ship anywhere but highsec gets a reduced payout as well?'cause intentionally putting your ship in risky situations surely necessitates some form of compensation to the insurer given the lack of terms on taking out the insurance right?or is this idea of your just a bitter, childish knee jerk response to the idea of 'griefers'?dont answer that, i'm teasing"
10/15/2009,"i agree that new players can be totally viable in any part of eve, but its easy for newbies to think that isn't the case. i've been leading a corp of week-old players into wormholes for the past week -- and occasionally even killing sleepers!however, capitals and tech-2 ships just say ""screw you, newbie"". you can get along fine without them, but the game holds them over your head, taunting you. you can't get at the coolest stuff without playing for months, no matter how ingenious or profitable your character is.in the same way, i think all the little ""+5% to ____"" that advanced players get merely for having subscribed for months or years is an unearned advantage that punishes new players just for being new.i fully agree that new players need to know what they are doing and be creative to be successful, but the tech 2 skill grind cannot be defeated by any amount of competence or cleverness.i don't support massive sp bonuses to newbies, i support fewer hard time-based limitations."
10/15/2009,"i think i earned that just for subscribing, in my case, years. in about three weeks i am going to start training some skills up to level 5. about 7 different skills. it's going to take me 112 days (about 4 months) to complete all 7 of those skills. are you telling me i don't deserve the benefits those skills are going to give me?"
10/15/2009,"a new player can fit and fly t2 stuff in the first few days/week. but why shouldn't you have to wait for the cool stuff. i had to wait 18 years before i could move out of my house. 15 of those years i had to wait before i could even fly a '99 grand am. another 3 years before i got my own apartment. another 3 years before i got a house.eve != rl and should not be compared to it. my point is that eve is modeled in some ways after that real life grind. some players keep playing so they can get their characters into new ships, others to be able to do more stuff, etc.um, it's an earned advantage. they've been subscribers for months or years to earn it.what you really mean is you want to be able to grind like in wow to gain your levels quickly. this is not wow as was deliberately crafted to not be similar. in fact, the real time skilling system is a main reason why some like to play this.but yeah, i don't see any reason why new players should have to wait for end game stuff.edit: i fail at quoting."
10/15/2009,what 'end game' stuff? titans? expensive deadspace modules? why should a noob be able to have them right away or even get them quickly?imo the skill training is just fine and when you actually achieve something you feel alot better than if you could have gotten it after a few days.
10/15/2009,"wrong:the ninja salvager earn more money than mission runner without risk.a blockade time for an 6-10 months old charater is 30-35 minutes with one ship. earn ~18-20 million from bounty.a ninja salvager earn from salvage items if he just salvage the bs wrecks in mission 6-10 millions under 10 minute or shorter time. (and not need 2 months learning time)and the parasite ninjasalvager not waste his ammo, not need 100 millions for battleship with full modules etc.so ninjasalvager parasites worsen from agentrunner, because they earn more money without risk from the work of other ones."
10/15/2009,well if that's the case why don't you sell that bad ass battleship and go get some scanning skills and salvage someones mission? make a whole lot of isk. others will see how well in the isk department you are doing which will get more people to say salvagers are ruining eve with the insane amount of isk they make on other peoples level 4 missions. after about half of the high sec population starts to ninja salvage the other half ccp will step in and nerf the ninja salvagers. you can then go and buy yourself another bad ass battleship and go back to running level 4 missions in high sec.you have a win-win situation there. what's the problem? are you scared of getting shot at by the mission runner? are you scared of a little risk?
10/15/2009,quoting the only sensible person in this thread.once the op and others get over the whole tired argument of percieved ownership and think for a moment about the consequences of what they are asking for then you might be worth taking seriously. till then this is just the same generic whine thread that pops up once a week.
10/15/2009,"i could see it being an option for either the corp name or no icon at all...either way, the avatar sucks processor power and should go."
10/15/2009,agreed! gettig rid of the avatar for a corp logo seems a bit silly. you would still have the issue of images loading. you don't really need an image next to the agents to know what they are about.
10/15/2009,"i've got a better idea, minimize and dont even load or search for the corp standings and the character standings, just the faction...that all. click on the corp or character bar and voila, the info pops up. make it all minimized and dont make it load or look on the server for the information.lots of times, if i look at the standings page, i only look to see if my corp is red or blue to him if i'm not too sure. you know, the useful stuff cause i dont really give a damn if he talked to x agentfor the op: if i understand your explanation with the new ""system"" you would see the logo, the name and the standings plus the (i) sign. so in other words, more data to load cause now you got the logo to get. if theres an option to get that info and by default the client does not get the info like i explained above, it would be a really good idea."

10/15/2009,"sure, you could turn off your transponder . . and then the gate won't let you access it. so you don't get to jump. the original point makes sense. local is a record everyone gets to access, in return for being able to jump through the gates. the real problem is not local, it is logoffsky and cloaking. many hunters say they want local removed. however, what they really want is prey not to logoff or ss&cloak once they show up on local. if logging off left your ship scannable for a longer period of time it might even the odds for the hunter. if a cloak on a non-dedicated cloaking ship (cov ops, bombers, recons) had some fuel use or timer then cloaking would not be as much a problem and again the hunter could choose to wait out his ratting raven prey, or look for easier less observant prey elsewhere. or alternately, new scanning skills could be introduced to give a small chance of scanning down cloaked ships. cloaking would still be a viable option, however, you couldn't afk it. the raven would still have to uncloak, rotate safespots, and recloak. giving the hunter a chance to scan it down, or kill if he warps back to a previous safespot that the hunter decided to camp. and ships that can warp cloaked would still have to move, or risk the possibility of being scanned down eventually. the same mechanics would ameliorate the afk harrassment cloaking that occurs. sure you could pop into your enemy's system in your bomber. because you can warp cloaked you have the advantage as a hunter. but you sure couldn't afk for the day and go to work. so, you see local is not really the problem, and it makes sense in the game. unless we are to remove gates and make players constructed gates, use of those gates requires a sacrifice on the player's part. if you use it you leave a kind of record of your entry for all to see, and you get to see a record of who has entered your current system and not left. it's really pretty fair. it is the other game mechanics that need tweaking."
10/15/2009,"no, that doesn't make sense. if that's the way it worked people who enter a system via a wormhole wouldn't show up in local, would they? or via a cyno field?"
10/15/2009,"well you got me there. your argument is valid as far as people entering from those means. but for people entering from gates it makes sense to know they are there. also, there are still the problems that it's too easy to logoff or cloak. this is all a theoretical exercise anyway.if local were to be removed there would have to be radical redesigns to how players scan and get intel. why would anyone invest any serious infrastructure in 0.0 if you have no way to know of a threat before your expensive infrastructure is getting hammered, and by the time you pull together a response, destroyed? removing local without replacing it with something useful would kill 0.0 population just as dominion is trying to increase it."
10/15/2009,so when you're at a big alliance's home with 20+ members in the system you want to continuously count the number of people in system to see if there's one person cloaked?
10/15/2009,"simple comfort tweak. just add an extra optional column that counts all objects in the overview from 1 to the sum of all objects. the numbers are not attached to any object unlike for example the name of an object. they are in a fix order, so all the calculating can be done on the client side. so it is basically like a row number in a spreadsheet, but you only get a new row number if you get a new entry instead of already having them there. so there is nothing automated, it's just an index.# name1 dummy12 dummy23 dummy3with a new object in the overview:# name1 dummy12 dummy23 dummy34 dummy4or# name1 dummy42 dummy33 dummy24 dummy1advantages:- easier fleet surveillance/reconnaissance because you don't have to count blue/red dots or ship types in your constantly changing overview or your scanner.- fast composition check on asteroid belts. no more asteroid counting to check out which belt is the juiciest. - you can sort by corp/alliance, check the battle participants numbers and make a great post in a public forum about blobs and naps with accurate numbers before the battle, without waiting for kill board data.- bonus easier target calling. you can sync all overviews by sorting by name using the same filters and then call the number instead of the name. so it'll be ""primary #12"" instead of ""primary zchruf30"" ""what? repeat please."" ""shoot zchruf30 in an apoc"" ""what? spell it please"" ""z-c-h-r-u-f-3-0"". helps with bad accents, because almost everybody can pronounce a number in english. if you sort differently or use different filters on different clients this won't work because you get different numbers. as stated it's just a bonus, to get something extra out of this idea. the target calling part is not an intended feature, it is just an example i came up with, on how you might profit from such a numeration. you can still call by name or distance or whatever you like. it is not like you have to make no effort to get standard overviews and settings for everybody in a 200+ multi-corporation/alliance fleet to even have a basis for this to work.there might be more ways to profit from this but in the first place it is all about counting disadvantages:non i could think of. well, except for the work needed to implement it. --------------------------------------------- to sum it up, counting stuff gets easier. doesn't change any game mechanics or the game-play, because people are already counting (and target calling), but it'd be less annoying and optional.edited for more clarity.edited again for even more clarity"
10/15/2009,awesome idea
10/15/2009,i like it.
10/15/2009,"obviously a very good idea... and since such a column can probably easily be made user toggleable, won't bother those who don't need to count accurate numbers when scouting a 300-man hostile fleet..."

10/15/2009,razor spam?anyway not supported. next time you will ask for something that locks and shoots for you?
10/15/2009,"ok, maybe a little cleaning up of what it is designed to do.the main purpose of the second tier is to reduce the 'deadlock' feeling effect on a player. deadlock meaning training a long skill, a couple weeks or even a few months, and not being able to do anything else except wait for that skill to finish and move on with their eve experience. this was the same thing that made me leave eve for a while, but i've continued since in my two years since starting eve.yes, it would increase overall training speed. four times slower, but in a separate queue, would be a 25% increase, which is probably too much.as i said, still refining it, and here i believed was a good place to do it. maybe have it so the second tier can only hold one skill at a time, like it was normally before the queue was introduced. that would reduce the time a player could be training a skill, effectively cutting that 25% increase in time by half or more at four times as long.also, for restrictions on how soon a player could use it. would 5/5 learning skill be required? or a one month timer, or maybe after their double-time speed training of 1.6 mill sp is over."
10/15/2009,"i get deadlock, and i know why it's annoying. i'm doing a 17 day skill right now, and it's hardly the longest i've trained. but i don't play this game to rack up new skills, even if it is nice. i play it because it's a good game. just because it takes longer to hit the ""next level"" doesn't mean i'm deadlocked at all. i'm just training a long skill. if i need something, be it a skill i forgot or just the satisfying feeling of a new skill or two, i can pause, switch, and resume, with no loss. this isn't necessary. you're just juggling the same thing, presenting it differently, and calling the problem solved. you see ""no deadlock"", i see 20% of my sp gain being spent on my second-best skill to train, not my best. this won't fix anything except your own perceptions, and dealing with those doesn't require a change in game mechanics. sorry man, but no support."
10/15/2009,there's a ton of no brainer proposals on the table but i hadn't seen this one mentioned.give us the ability to set motd for corp and alliance channels.thanks!
10/15/2009,again
10/15/2009,"been proposed, don't think the csm has ever taken it up though. still a good idea the second time."
10/15/2009,sounds logical to me.
10/15/2009,there are too many reasons for the corp/alliance chat to have a motd. in general it would be a great asset to the leaders of said corp/alliance.
10/15/2009,i know we brought it up to ccp in january. it should come with revamp of alliance and corp uiyou can see it here
10/15/2009,i could rant and insult ccp about this but meh its getting tiresome
10/15/2009,i like it.
10/15/2009,the issue was technical due to the fact that the channels are mandatory and unmoderated. the security mechanics put in place to make sure non-corpies arent able to join the channel by any means... then having nobody as op to kick/ban those people. afterall it might be seen as exploit and easy ban... but what are the chances the logs show something enough to ban the person and in a corp with perhaps 100 people online all the time... being the most likely target... chances are you would just have a bad time.support nonetheless.

10/15/2009,"introducing logic into eve, one proposal at a time."
10/15/2009,"some modules don't have metal levels other than 1 and some don't even have tech 2 modules.as an example, the tractor beams only have:[small tractor beam i] (meta 1)[capital tractor beam i] (meta 1)it would be useful to have different meta levels (dropped from rats) and also t2 variants (from invented blueprints). at least we would have performance options. also maybe different sizes for modules but that would depend on the kind of module."
10/15/2009,"i can't say i'm against this and i really like this idea but you have to know what the consequences for having (ie: medium tractor beam)a meta level modules or different size when we currently dont at the moment.i can already see the implication of having a bigger tractor beam which logically would give us more range on it. faster isk cause you don't have to do 20-60km to get all cans together (which i do sometimes) or get there in the first place.but yeah, i do support this. at the same time, since we got the bpo for the tech 1 standard items can't ccp make the npc drop named items...not a ton but just a few cause t1 from npc come on is this a joke."
10/15/2009,most of the modules that don't have meta level options don't need them. not supported.
10/15/2009,"can i counter with all the drone enhancement modules?it is the only weapon system without t2 modules to enhance it and wit (as far as i know it) only 1 meta level module, give as a reward for the gallente epic arc."
10/15/2009,"even though this is already possible, why isn't it on the (infamous) right click menu. i mean, when i first started playing eve i can't count how many times i was told ""when in doubt, right click!"" i know it is a bit trivial, however i feel that it is important to stick to simple. this game is complicated enough without having to dig to access your drone bay at a pos."
10/15/2009,"because it requires the ship maintenance array, and you don't want the code generating the right-click menu to have to check nearby pos structures before it can generate the menu."
10/15/2009,why not make it a right click on the ship maintenance array. then there would be no checking for pos arrays.
10/15/2009,"it would still have to check range - but it does that already to see if you can access stored vessels, so i really don't see a problem with doing it that way."

10/15/2009,the sin has a agility bonus and the panther a velocity bonus. its impossible to speed tank battleships with such a large sig radius. the bonuses are useless compared to the tracking bonus of the redeemer and the ecm bonus from the widow. my proposal is to give them bonuses that are in line with the other black ops bonuses. here is also an discussion going on in the ships and modules category.
10/15/2009,i get the distinct impreession that you don't fly a typhoon... if you had... you'd think differently... the typhoon has a very strong speed aspect... it's oneof the few things that makes it a popular ship in most circles...now granted your talking about the panther...but it's roots are the typhoon.. even though it's not considered a speed tank... it is a rather fast battleship in comparison to others...so in conclusion i'd have to say not supported...
10/15/2009,"better yet, why not give it a ""historical"" description. provide an event or some such which names a player to have found it or some such. that way you get player involvement in the history of eve happening more.why do i suggest this?the description of a heritage asset under the australian government is, ""a physical asset that has historical, cultural, environment, scientific or educational importance to the community"" and the reason they hold heritage assets, ""to bring the community closer together"". if ccp is serious about bringing the eve community into a more active participation of the game development then they should perhaps look at this option. of course naming a player in the description of a region doesn't qualify as a heritage asset but it would enrich the cultural and historical value of eve."

10/15/2009,"when i got my first chance to vote for csm i pretty much voted for a random person.why? because i know nothing about the csm members, i don's know who they are where they come from, etc. i think next election we should have a link next to each candidate's portrait that goes to his personal page, with his own ""speech"" and also possibly a discussion thread. would be even better if questions could be asked.why: i was trying to find information on a number of csm members and i found it very troublesome, and managed to find sort of complete information only on 2 or 3 candidates. maybe i did not put enough effort. maybe i wasn't doing it right or looking in the right place. that is not the point, you should have information easelly available, users should not spend hours looking for it. there are people wondering why players do not vote. people do not vote because when they click on the add they see 20-30 faces that they do not know, and have no idea on who they are, know nothing about them, they feel confused, somewhat lost. video interviews or some sort of campaign would be awersome, but if you whan to become a meber of csm you should be required to at least write a small page about yourself, and what you are planning to do."
10/15/2009,"afaik there was page with all candidates where you could see their campaign messages and there were links to their websites. also most of the delegates had their threads in jita park speakers corner, there was even a sticky with compiled links to the threads of all candidates."

10/15/2009,"as a standalone idea, i'm not a fan. none of the wardec mechanics are based on mutual agreement, and letting one side set all the terms is too powerful. as part of a bigger wardec change, though, i'd be for it. if mutual-consent wars were added, setting limits on them would be perfectly reasonable."

10/15/2009,"what?i'm currently developing a website based on the dutch stemwijzer, a website that allows you to compare different political parties. i plan to have this operational before the csm4 voting starts. the website presents the user with a list of statements (""pvp should be optional"", ""trade orders should have a 1000 isk minimum increment"", etc), and compares the answers the user gives to the answers given by csm candidates. using this comparison the website then calculates a match percentage, neatly identifying which candidate represents the user's views the best.how?the website works in the following way:candidates receive a password that allows them to log on to the website. here they can answer the statements, their answers are stored in the database. they can edit this information at a later time(1). the answer options are ""strongly disagree"", ""disagree"", ""no opinion"", ""agree"", ""strongly agree"". while we are gathering candidate profiles, user matching will be disabled, as they can only get reliable results when all candidates have finished their profiles. these profiles illustrate the vision of each candidate.once all (within reason) candidates have filled in their profile, matching will be enabled. users fill in the same questionaire as the candidates did, and we calculate a match percentage. additionally, we display a table of all questions and all candidates that shows the user where his questions match and differ from the candidates.development versionthe website is"
10/15/2009,"ranking/scoring mechanicintroductionthe current system turns every answer into a numeric value, ""strongly disagree"" being -2 to ""strongly agree"" being +2 (so it gives you the range -2, -1, 0, 1, 2). additionally, each candidate can mark a certain number of questions as being 'important' to him or her. important questions count double.a user's answers are compared to the candidate's answers. matching answers increase fidelity with the candidate, differing answers decrease fidelity with a candidate. the candidates with the highest fidelity scores are the best matches. the biggest fidelity increase is +2, and the biggest decrease is -2 (+4 and -4 if the question is marked 'important').the questionthe question is, how to compare and score candidate and user answers. i'll explain the current scoring mechanic and my justification, and would welcome comments or constructive criticism if you feel it should be different.case: user and candidate have the exact same answerfidelity + 2. the only exception is when the answer is 'no opinion', in which case it is fidelity + 1. justification: absence of an opinion is not valued as highly as an opinion. other than that, answering exactly the same thing indicates high fidelity.case: user and candidate have the similar answersfidelity + 1. examples are ""strongly agree"" vs ""agree"" and ""strongly disagree"" vs ""disagree"". justification: while the two answers aren't identical, there exist still a general concensus.case: user has 'no opinion'fidelity + 0. the only exception is when the candidate also answered 'no opinion', in which case it is fidelity + 1. justification: if the user has no opinion, the candidate's answer is immaterial, unless the candidate feels exactly the same way.case: user and candidate have differing viewsfidelity - 1 or fidelity - 2, depending on the difference in view. ""no opinion"" vs ""(strongly)agree/disagree"", or ""(strongly)agree"" vs ""(strongly)disagree"". we substract the highest number from the lowest number, giving us a range of -1 to -4. a difference of -1 or -2 is fidelity - 1, a difference of -3 or -4 is fidelity - 2.justification: the -1...-4 range is normalized to -1...-2 to avoid counting strong differences in opinion heavier than equally strong agreement.discussion point: should this be changed to -1 -> -1 and -2...-4 -> -2? one could argue a difference of -2 already indicates enough difference in opinion (""no opinion"" vs ""strongly (dis)agree"", ""agree"" vs ""disagree"") to warrant the most severe reduction in fidelity."

10/15/2009,"ofc i disagree. there is much more ppl then game designers who will implement particular change, so its irrelevant for this issue. knowing game mechanics is essential for csm delegate cause without having extensive game knowledge you are not viable to discuss about them. if there is a problem/issue. csm needs to identify it, propose the solution, aswell as all pros and cons coming with a solution. even game designers propose official solution it still needs to get amen from senior producers and ofc from programmers cause if it cant be implemented due to code/sw/hs issues even the best proposal is useless."

10/16/2009,"research of topics already considered by csm seems to indicate that this one hasn't been considered (unless i missed it), although similar/related ideas have been discussed or mentioned in the features and ideas forum.i want to be able to set the d-scanner range with a single click on a range value rather than having to select the slider button and move it to the desire range. please replace the range slider with either a radio button for available range settings (5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 180, 360) or some kind of segmented, labeled bar where you click on the segment desired to select a angle.sliders are annoyingly time consuming to use. my proposed change would allow faster selection for every angle option and instant accuracy (elusive 15 degree angle, this means you). (updated to change ""range"" to ""angle"" the paragraph above, in keeping with the topic.)[b]if you post in support of this idea, please don't forget to select the ""support"" check box before submitting your reply!!!/b]"
10/16/2009,"yes, yes and thrice yes. the angle slider on the d-scanner is incredibly frustrating to use. would be nice if there were the option to chnage the range units between aus and km as well."
10/16/2009,"definitely supported! need something like this for the distance as well, which should of course be able to be switched to au, too."
10/16/2009,"isn't this the part where i should say ""zomg you want to make scanning people down and ganking them easier!!!!one!!eleven!!uno!!""actually, it sounds like a good idea - that angle slider is a huge pita especially trying to hit the smallest angles."
10/16/2009,what? make the ui more intuitive and less frustrating? who wants that sort of crap in their internet spaceships spreadsheets online?
10/16/2009,yes
10/16/2009,yes!
10/16/2009,100%
10/16/2009,agreed

10/16/2009,yes!
10/16/2009,"my original post is confusingly written as originally presented, mixing the terms range and angle inaccurately. now that it has supports, it is not allowed to be edited. i knew i shoulda waited for that 4th cup of coffee to kick in before posting. anyway, my original intent was to focus on angle selection. what i meant to express was this:i want to be able to set the d-scanner angle with a single click on an angle value rather than having to select the slider button and move it to the desired angle. please replace the angle slider with either radio buttons for available settings (5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 180, 360) or some kind of segmented, labeled bar where you click on a segment to select a desired angle.sliders are annoyingly time consuming to use. my proposed change would allow faster selection for every angle option and instant accuracy (elusive 15 degree angle, this means you).of course, easier range selection would be nice as well. what comes to mind is a combo box where you can type in any value up to max range, or select preset values from a dropdown menu. in a perfect world, those preset values could be part of the user's custom configuration of their eve client via the options window."
10/16/2009,"i'll support this, whether you're mixing your terminology or not/signed"
10/16/2009,"as to the underlined bold bit, how bout tackling?can you make me a list of frigates, cruisers, and battleships that have a single mid slot? tackling isn't just the job of inties and ""the vengeance"" (and when you said vengeance you should have said every other assault frigate in game), its a role that can and should be able to be filled by every combat ship in the game (and actually can be filled by every other combat ship in the game.why would a second mid make the ship a ""wtfbbqpwn"" ship (your words, never would they be mine)?it would simply allow it to fill a role besides being meat in a fleet, as its currently the only ship in game restricted to one single roll in a fleet.so obviously when it only has one possible use (mediocre dps, honestly, fly an omen, or a maller, its cheaper and does more damage, and has a hardier tank in either case) so of course when placed in this less than ideal context it wouldn't need an adjustment and we could continue on our merry way.unfortunately if that were the case there would be other ships in the game that were unable to tackle, or only had a single mid.one mid.if such a change was made, and you still felt the need to not tackle with it, thats your choice, maybe you want to set it up with a tc to allow it to hit farther out (god knows it ****s on tracking), or maybe a sb to achieve inty style lock times to stop those cloakers from getting away.maybe a target painter on those obnoxious inties circling your fleet, or some form of mild ewar.the point is you would have a choice of doing something other than mediocre over priced dps."
10/16/2009,fixed.
10/16/2009,"you've completely misunderstood the roles that assault frigates are meant to play. there are 2 af's for each race - one for heavy tackle, and one for dps with tank. if you've got a wolf in fleet as a tackling ship, then you've wasted a pilot in a misused role. if you've not brought enough dedicated tackling ships in your fleet that you need to load up your dps ships with points then you need to seriously reconsider your fleet makeup. in that context why on earth should the retribution have an extra mid? tackle is taken care of. ecm is taken care of. the mids on damage af's are to reinforce any areas of your fleet that you want to shore up - not form the core function.if you're going to compare af dps to cruiser dps then i'm sorry but by that argument we should just pack up all af's right now, because they will never compare favourably. sure the ishkur can do 300+ dps but compared to almost any gank cruiser that's really very poor (to the point of pitiful given the dps you can get out of vexors for example). incidentally i never said that adding a mid would make the retri a wtfbbqpwn ship, i was merely pointing out that, unlike the (relative) glass cannon which is the ishkur, you can't possibly expect the same close range dps from it.so then if we're to compare dps then we must compare it to frigs in general and af in particular. in these terms it comes out near the top (second in class - the wolf just doesn't cut it and the harpy... and also very much in the upper range for frigs in general). the key then is the role it performs. it fits in as followsishkur - wtfbbq close range gankwolf - wtf alpha long range dpsretri - wtf inty melter, close range hi dps long range hi dpsharpy - wtf why are you flying this?it fills that role atm quite admirably, and as i said before if you're in the position that you have to use the midslots on your dps frigates then you need to reconsider your fleet composition.the retribution (like the coercer - also 1 mid slot) is explicitly a fleet ship. fleet ships specialise to a role. retri does. works as intended. it's not like you'd suggest a damage bonus to a kitsune, so if you're ok with specialisation there, why not here?"
10/16/2009,"not so much. against a single target, even up to bs (but especially up to bc ehp) the retribution will almost always be on the top of the killmail. arty wolves have less dps and ishkurs have much less range. in longer single target engagements of course the ishkur wins. if anything there's an argument for dropping wolves from fleets completely - in the discussions we have in firetech over balanced fleet compositions the argument is explicitly between ""all ishkurs melt their faces!!"" and ""mostly ishkurs with some longer range face melting please"". it also depends on what prey you're hunting. if we were all still in factional warfare, then swapping some ishkurs for wolves is a no-brainer. when most of your skirmish engagements are in frigate hulls, the ability to make 10-20% of the enemy fleet detonate on your arrival on the field was something i used many times to great effect. in any case to reject retributions out of hand is to miss their power and their versatility in fleet."
10/16/2009,"i understand you like the ship, but look at it.the other ships you name can all now fit a scrambler and use it in conjunction with their ab bonus to hold a target down so they can apply their dps.all of them (fyi the coercer kinda sucks too, but thats destroyers in general and an entirely different topic).every other ship you talk about can scramble a target to disable the mwd of the target. they are all also marginally faster than the retribution as well, shedding even more light on the need of the ship to be able to scramble targets, to keep things in its sphere of influence.yes other wingmates can have this, but you can't ever, unless you give up your ab, which means that an default in the ships current slot layout prohibits you from taking full advantage in your ships bonus systems.how would you keep your dps on target? by always depending on somebody else?why would you fly the ret when every other af you named can and does have the ability to pick a target and apply dps, and keep that dps on target via a single 2ndary ewar mod?as i said, the retribution was the first ship i ever purposely trained for, i know exactly what its like to fly the ship, and i remember the times when the fight simply progressed beyond my sphere of influence and i was helpless to effect its outcome because of the ships failings. i probably flew it just about every day for 3 or 4 months prepping hac/inty skills.thats a long time to get pretty intimate with a ship and i feel pretty confident that this would improve a good ship.is your 5th high slot really worth that much to you, when even ccp admit the ship is flawed?"
10/16/2009,"the ship is fine. no need to change anything. if you need tackle then fly another ship. if you need high dps, low sig radius and good warp speed, fly the retri."
10/16/2009,this.each ship is unique to itself...and as such you don't need to force them to be all alike in the most common roles you deem necessary for said ship.as i said... the assault ship[frigate]'s role is dps... not tackling.if you want to tackle you get an interceptor or a partner.your assumption in the basis that this ship is only able to take on smaller prey is wrong.this ship can take on anything larger... it's also normal for amarrian ships to have few mid slots.if ccp sees fit to change it... i'm not gonna go emorage... but i still say there is nothing wrong with this ship.
10/16/2009,"heya fool, wondered where you got off to the retribution is probably the only focused af of the bunch. it does damage (at range i might add) and tanks like nothing else.it is the amarrian design philosophy condensed into a single ship providing a constant stream of 150-200dps in a 20km sphere around it. damage support and lots of it.in a gang it is devastating and solo it will kill most softer targets before they can even make it to warp (a single bump and a lse omen is in hull by the time he warps, now that is power).second mid slot has to come from somewhere. remove a low-slot and the ship is gimped, remove a high-slot and the fitting options drop to 1-2 with practically no deviations.so pray tell, where should this slot come from if the ship is to remain ""intact?give it a little extra fitting and a 5th gun mount. all options remain viable and it gets to do its job with even more efficiency"
10/16/2009,one word:teamwork.
10/16/2009,"yes!!look, i know your pain. i've watched targets warp away from me because the ship i love has no point to keep them in place whilst i kill them, and i raged at the time too. one day though i simply accepted that i was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. there are other ships in game that you (presumably) accept are so specialised that you can never fly them solo (kitsune for one). i don't see why this isn't the case for the retribution. with the exception (perhaps) of the ishkur i would argue that no af is a solo ship. the heavy tackle boats have the dps of an asthmatic fly who has just returned home from the shops carrying a particularly heavy bag of shopping, and the dps boats (generally) lack the tank to take down their target before they themselves die. a pack of af working together in a properly balanced fleet though really is something special. the fact that i still go to frigate gangs as my default roam almost every night i log on is testament to that."
10/16/2009,"i would love one more mid on my retribution. it would certainly be less ""lolwtf"" in gangs."
10/16/2009,"i love the retribution for missioning, combat sites, and other carebear activity. i prefer having the fifth high slot for a salvager."
10/16/2009,"i almost daily fly logistic ships in low sec and something that has really started to bother me is how 1 logistic ship is just not viable for one single group of people. i am here talking people with a -5 or worse sec status.basically you get criminal flagged for repairing someone with low security status, even if the guy hasnt agressed anyone.i really dont see the point in this ""feature"". in high sec, if a low sec status person does something illegal he gets criminal flagged anyway, so changing it wouldnt make people immune to concord anyway.basically its just making a shiptype unuseable for a small group of people when fighting between each other. im here talking about pirates in general. when a blinky shoots a blink all is fine, when one of the sides show up with a logistic ship, that one gets ****d by sentry guns (and the sudden change of primary target).does a fix to this even hurt anyone?"
10/16/2009,"i'm not a -10, but if this works like you suggest, i support changing it."
10/16/2009,"as i recall, the evolution of gc for repping a criminal was because people were farming cosmos sites for invention materials right after t2 invention was introduced. a farmer would sit there and rep all the rats to keep anyone else away, and rep his two or more chars as well, it was something along those lines.personally i have an issue with the neut remote rep as it is now as it is creating opportunities for metagaming in pvp, which is bad imo.if they can separate ""rat criminals"" from ""player criminals"" then i can agree with the solution to a degree. if you are repping someone, then someone else should be able to shoot you too, but the gate guns on you does seem a bit much."
10/16/2009,i do indeed agree with you. this proposal is not made for metagaming in high sec (or low sec for that matter). all i want is to be able to fight other pirates without getting shoot at as the only person in the fight by sentry guns.repping rats should still give criminal flag. however it cant be that hard to code a difference between repping an npc and repping a player.
10/16/2009,signed
10/16/2009,you can also be guilty of aiding and abetting a crime if you help another person who is sought for criminal activity (i.e. negative sec status is exactly that) .... i think this is working as intended and should be left alone.
10/16/2009,low sec is the domain of outlaws. we should not get flagged for helping our own unless the one we're helping has aggression toward a non-outlaw. then i can see the point of flagging someone for remote repping another outlaw.
10/16/2009,i already raised this in iceland brosef.edit: that's the one.
10/16/2009,"totally agree.a lot more needs to be done. pirates are screwed over way too hard in this game, in favour of damn carebears!but on a serious note if the person you are trying to rep hasnt got gcc then you shouldnt recieve penalty just for helping him.it even happends if you are in the same corp! stupid."
10/16/2009,"i dont think you heard the op... its pirate vs pirate. tbh i dont think the police would mind them blowing up each other in lawless space.the whole thing was implemented because of a high sec issue, as so many times before low sec was forgotten and again pirates are screwed over.if the pirates agress a non-outlaw, any logistic ship on the field will get criminal flagged like anyone else still anyway..."
10/16/2009,because i wonna shoot you as soon as you leave the station.

10/16/2009,i was in the same boat as you. i made it 4 months before realizing how damaging my attributes would be long term and rerolled. wish someone had told me about achura back then :pnot signed.
10/16/2009,"to the op there's a game starting for you real soon ""dust514"". no skills points no training but i do hope you like the grind to get anywhere. but i guess you'll complain cause you're not getting any experience points when your not doing anything and want it all for no pain also."
10/16/2009,isk is more important than sp. give new players more isk :p
10/16/2009,it's clear for me than 65k tu begin it's really to low for the begining. and give 5 m sp it's clearly not the solution.but why not give to the new player 400k sp (give by basic profession like before). and you increase the boost until 2 m sp.with 400k you can play a little and you keep the booster.
10/16/2009,"ya, i definitely do not support this unless the ""new player"" is going to be paying a premium for it, else, everyone that wants to make throw away characters for griefing will be getting a big assist from ccp."
10/16/2009,"well, so far this thread has had complaints of:-people saying that getting past cruisers takes 35-70 days to be remotely effective.-people saying you can't play this game without over 5m sp-people saying that learning skills are a waste of time-people saying that new players can't do anything in the game without tremendous isk buying or another character financially supporting them.well crap! i must have been doing it wrong all this time! i mean, i'm a 3 1/2 month old character with half of my basic learning skills at 5, and most of my advanced learning skills at 4 (and very happy that i can use those skills to control the speed at which i ""level""). i started on my own, haven't used rl money to buy in-game money, haven't been funded by another character, and withing 2.5-3 months, i was flying battleships in level 4 missions with no problems.to all of those people who were complaining, i apologize most sincerely for playing incorrectly, and will proceed to think that i can't do anything cuz i don't yet have 20m sp yet....i might as well sit in a station and train instead of playing the game, earning loads of isk in my self funded battleship with mostly t2/faction fittings."
10/16/2009,"malcanis' law: when a change is proposed on the forums to ""help the new players, it is always to the greater benefit of the older, rich players."
10/16/2009,"as has been said before, any benefit for new players will benefit long time players more. they will make a second account/character and take advantage of it way better then a new player.in eve, the fun in the game lies in the journey, not what you reach in the end. a hypothetical player with all skills maxed (which is impossible) will have nothing more to look forward to, and even though that player can do anything, it will likely get boring. in any case, you can be effective at any level of sp and there are plenty of corps willing to teach you properly, helping you have fun from the get-go. try referring your friends to corps like the eve university, they take on any newbie and can teach you all the valuable lessons. also, with dominion, supposedly the whole tutorial system will get yet another revamp, helping new players experience the true nature of eve better and from the moment they first undock.[tl;dr]no changes brought up here will have the intended effect, and the entire concept is flawed, not supported."
10/16/2009,"i have been playing this game for a lil over 2 months i have about 3.3 million sp and a hulk, now we all know what u can do with a hulk so saying u need 5 m sp to start out with would be unrealistic and would cause a new player to miss out on his/her development period.the key to eve is patience, if u do not have any do not play."
10/16/2009,"well, good for you that you are so hardcore :pi for one agree that the game needs to be more accessible for new players. in lots of ways. one of em would be raising the double sp/h thing to 3mil or sth. and also making sure that they know they are able to do lots of stuff before they have 15mil sp."
10/16/2009,"yay another one. i'll try to be brief and summarize few bits i think are relevant.-at first, wrecks dropped a can or nothing, depending if there was loot. -later, due to some underhanded griefing tactics probably, the killer of an npc got ownership of the can-life was grand, mission runners got bounties, loot, lp for their troubles -salvage was introduced, but probably due to performance reasons it was deemed necessary to merge the wreck and the can, in a bit of a compromise: wrecks would inherit the ownership of the can so that mission runners would not feel like they were robbed out of previously gained privileges, but salvaging the wreck would be free for all- wrecks with loot in them were changed to drop a can if salvaged before looted so that the free for all - part of the compromise would work better- mission runners noticed that the newly introduced salvage could increase their income by good 30%, but there was a problem, if they didn't put an effort in it, some scurwy dog could salvage the wrecks before they could- mission runners decided to ignore the free-for-all part of the compromise and instead actually tried to use the good stuff they retained in the compromise as some sort of twisted proof that free-for-all actually meant free-for-me-unless-i-don't-want-it.so here we are. the core reason for these threads cropping up is that a good part of the mission runner community can't handle contested resources, probably because due to the nature of mission running they haven't had to do so before. the risk argument is just hypocrisy. the risk is in the isk, so to speak, competition is the risk any salvager (including mission runners) has to deal with. so, it's really not about increasing the risk for the ninjasalvager, but removing the risk from the mission runner and turning salvage into a guaranteed profit. the fact that a wreck only exists because you shoot it is irrelevant, although it does give you a significant edge if you want to salvage yourself and gives you some additional options for dealing with the competition which a ninja salvager doesn't have. the perceived problems with the ownership issue are understandable if you consider the above timeline, however, the one simple move that would unify the whole issue for all types of wrecks is actually by removing loot ownership from the person that killed the ship, not to give wreck ownership as well. but then i guess that'd feel a lot like like betraying the other end of the compromise so i'm sure quite a few people would object to that.my view on changes that might be necessary?- empty wrecks spawn with no owner- if a tractorbeam is activated on a wreck with loot in it by someone else than the owner, the wreck loses ownership but drops the loot at the same spot in a can with the ownership intact- probing wrecks out of a deadspace pocket should be possible (out of a deadspace pocket to avoid the inevitable outcry of how probing mission runners was again made easier). if zillion wrecks in a system would lag out the probing system, you could instead have mission deadspace spawn a temporary (until last wreck expires for example), probeable warpin to a 'spaceship junkyard' at the time of mission completion.these changes i feel would turn the system both more logically consistent and still be in spirit of the above compromise, and make different breeds of salvagers slightly more equal than they are now. after a while i suspect people the amount of these threads would somewhat diminish since it would be more apparent that wrecks are intended as free for all.also, if there isn't one yet, a tutorial bit explaining the basic ownership/aggro/concord mechanics might be in order."
10/16/2009,"ccp employees have stated in several posts on these very boards that salvaging, as a mini-profession, is working as intended. salvage materials do not exist until a wreck is successfully salvaged. since it doesn't exist, it doesn't belong to anybody.the moment a wreck is successfully salvaged, the recovered materials become property of the salvager. if you are not said salvager, that salvage does not belong to you.it is a very simple concept. the problem isn't with salvaging with a profession, it's with your ""gimmie, gimmie!"" attitude and belief that eve is a warm and fuzzy place where carebears are safe from the cold, empty, black of space.good morning, sunshine! it's a beautiful nothingness outside today."
10/16/2009,"yawn.that old straw again.you'd think that there were no cans out there - oh wait, there are. any ninja that actually wants to trigger aggro can do so. just take one, measely unit of ammo out of a wreck.the option is already there - and yet it is used only seldom.therefore, no real change. this threat is just to scare people and it is an entirely empty one."
10/16/2009,"a common misconception.in international waters anyone can salvage anything. however if you want to dock anywhere and not get sued you need to take that salvage to an admiralty court and they then divvy it between you (the salvager) and the original owner. the only exceptions are warships and ancient ships.go ahead and do a wiki for maritime salvage, it's all there."
10/16/2009,"the real, honest problem here is that for those who weren't around for the 'history' the current system makes precisely zero sense.what's the difference between a gun and an armor plate? well, none really. except there is. why is one yours and one not? well because you need a salvager for one. huh?it's immersion breaking, which is why the first time folks run into ninjas they're like ""huh? that's got to be a glitch!"" intuitively it makes no sense and it's not ever going to in its current incarnation.there are lots of possible fixes. one would be a 'claim' system but that should be short. another would be a system that allows the wrecks themselves to be scanned out. tractors should work on everything (it makes no sense that a puller beam cares about ownership).there are lots of different things that could be done. the current system is going to cause these threads as long as it stays as is because no one gets it. and suddenly ninjas endlessly quoting hoary text from a couple of years ago isn't much help because the explanations in that text don't make any sense to anyone except those who:1) want it to be true or2) were the ones trying to do the explaining.to everyone else, it's bafflegab that flies about as well as a neutronium duck.so, thus, some kind of change is needed, so i'll support the op (although that's not the only change i'd do as it's unbalanced - fixing tractors and allowing wreck scans seem fair compromises for balance)."
10/16/2009,"my first blockade took me a full six hours although that included flying into the mission space in my own salvage ship a bunch of times before the wrecks vanished.one of the reason that mission runners get bent about ninjas is that their ships are cheap, their skills are low (one can do very well with a 2-3 week old character) and the pay is extremely high with very low risk.if the ninja player had to put in months of grinding both isk and status in order to make the income they get, i'd have more sympathy for them. but being able to make l4 class income in a 2-3 week old character in a ship that doesn't even cost a million isk with close to zero chance of losing the ship is kind of broken. it's another reason that mission runners get kind of perturbed.and, yes, they could 'join them rather than beat them' (and some do) but a lot of them just don't enjoy griefing folks and that makes the 'profession' kind of unpalatable for them."
10/16/2009,if they allow supercarriers to dock then im going to get one and not do anything else except play docking games with something with the ehp of a medium pos until ccp sees how dumb it is.
10/16/2009,"+1 to any of the ideas in here, station games suck"
10/16/2009,"first of all sorry for my english it has improved in the years, but it is still bad ...so watching the fanfest in youtube i came up with some ideas you may like, or may not.on the previous fanfest there was talking for the missile turrets on ravens and generaly missile boats, where designers didn't want them shown for various reasions so here is my tought on that:- small opening panels to shoot missiles out of them?- flares to attrackt missiles (we all know the existing defender missiles are pretty useless)may be in all ships or just the missile boats in high slot modul or separate hangar in the ship like drone ones with limited space or ammosome toughts on mwds and afterburners:- if you fit mwd you can get separate boosters outside the ship like the tech3 models or may be a little biger boosters on the existing ones and when you fire the mwd or afterburner you get more blinding light behind the boosters and posibly longer trails (some shaking of the ship might be cool as well)?some toughts on thermodinamics:- overheating your capacitor incase someone is neuting your cap (may be similar defence like eccm)?- smoke, fire, sparks, electrical spikes all over the place when overheating variuos modules that can be seen etc?some thoughts on cloaky ships scanning (a lot of ppl have seen in movies some spaceship is following another spaceship via engine trails):- so may be we can find afk cloakers by scanning thier engine trails and the person who is scanning them can warp near the cloaker and try to decloak him or something?well that's on my mind for now compiled in an hour - sounded better in my head, but who knows you might have similar thoghts or this have been posted already ...feel free to add more stuff or just modify those."
10/16/2009,- small opening panels to shoot missiles out of them?makes sense. they'll probably do something like this. - flares to attrackt missiles (we all know the existing defender missiles are pretty useless)may be in all ships or just the missile boats in high s
10/16/2009,"i support this.often enough i fly a fully loaded hauler to/from a pos (either bringing fuel to the pos or taking stuff from the pos) to a nice market hub and i get scanned on almost every gate in the vicinity of said market hub.there is absolutely no defence possible against suicide ganking.scanning is a way to figure out if you're going to have any reward from ganking a ship, why shouldn't the possible targets be able to make sure they do not get scanned?"
10/16/2009,"while i do not agree with the op's proposal, i do agree that there should be some non-aggressive defense available against cargo/ship scanners.the best idea would be either a low-slot mod or a rig that ""cloaks"" the ship, meaning that scanners aimed at the ship will return no results."
10/16/2009,"actually, if i am not mistaken, there is an unpublished module or rig that does exactly that. so the question is why is this unpublished?seems ccp already took a look at this ""problem"" and decided to leave it as is, mm?"
10/16/2009,then wouldn't the better solution be that if a pilot scans your modules/hold that it instead preempts the passive targeting system?

10/16/2009,heeck even getting the option to select a group of things to make a queue of sell order dialogs would be a massive gameplay improvement for those trying to make a sizable quantity of sales.
10/16/2009,"i support this guy quitting and going back to wow.also, i like the standings idea. kind of bites that you can permanently ruin your opportunity to mission for pirate factions when the rest of the game is so open ended.i think there should be some ""grind"", or at least a time frame (once per year?) built in. shouldnt be something the rich can do at will.edit to add- you could also reset your sec status to 0both would have to be balanced so it wouldnt be something you could do at will"
10/16/2009,"sisters of pirate evecorrupt agents with minus 40 quality or whatever would work with -5 and below.just some special agent with no standing requirement but whose missions are likely to give heavy standing hits for empire factions.not a big fan of the 'just pay isk' idea, but whatever.if missions are going to be the way ccp wants everyone to make isk, they need to throw the 0.0 factions a bone on this."
10/16/2009,"while watching the fanfest 2009 videos, a question was asked about covert op ships that are in a fleet and cloaked not being able to see each other.the response (from ccp) was that the ships are ""removed"" from the universe.my idea is to have a module (yes, it takes a slot and can only be used on covert op and related ships) that can be ""linked"" to another module of the same sort in another ship. the ships would need to be in a fleet and they would use a unique password to stay associated. with this module, covert op pilots would know where the other covert op pilots (in their fleet) were located.the technical details:-- each client knows where the pilot's ship is even if it's not in the game universe. otherwise collisions and the ""cloaked ship"" render couldn't happen.-- the module would use a fleet id (i assume there is one to keep track of the fleets) and the password to encrypt the location being transferred between ships.-- the location is encrypted on the client and sent to the server which forwards it to each ship in the fleet. if someone doesn't know the password, they cannot decrypt it and therefore cannot know where the covert op ship(s) are.in practice:1) ships fleet up.2) covert ops ships engage the module and are prompted for the password. the module stays active until the ship is exited or docks.3) the module connects to the server to register.4) when there is more than one ship connected with the same password, the location of the other ships using an active module is communicated and the overview shows the location (possibly with the cloak-breaking distance indicated...a ""bubble"" around the ship).5) as the ships move, the client updates the location and sends it to the server.6) the server receives the locations and ""broadcasts"" it to the fleet. only those with a module will be able to decode it and render the location.bonus:-- different squads could use different passwords to only show the people in their squad.-- fleet commanders could have a new warfare link that would allow them to store a number of passwords up to their level, allowing them to track that many different sets of covert op ships.the best part of all this is that most of the work is not done by the server. i envision it as a tagged packet that doesn't need to even be processed by the server other than to send it out to the members in the fleet. each client would decode it on their own (a quick process) and the locations added to the rendering engine."
10/16/2009,"putting a cloak on your ship is already pretty powerful, i doubt it needs a buff that much.it would need a downside such as making the ships probable, after all to communicate with other ships in the fleet it must be sending some sort of signal which could be detected by other ships. this way you get a situation where you can now organise a large gang of cloakers and allow them to see each other while also making it possible for others to come hunt you down."
10/16/2009,"very good to hear. i'll help promote this channel in my own public channel and blog. but i do hope to see some pretty steady csm presence there, otherwise it's kinda pointless."

10/16/2009,can we get this stickied.thanx
10/16/2009,i support this quoted idea and want too add that its maybe a good idea to remove black ops from the directional scanner.
10/16/2009,"i'll start with a declaration of interest and say that, despite the offensive / defensive benefits of a persistent local, like the op i'm an ardent supporter of making nullsec local behave in precisely the same way as wh local. that being said, i don't support this. it doesn't address the concerns of the carebear (ie omg you can't make us watch the scanner whilst we afk rat / mine! it's unreasonable!) and it doesn't really help the roaming gang to pick up targets. it ends up as the worst of all options. the point about assets being attacked without you knowing that there's a fleet present seems on the surface to be valid, but is in fact not. intel on fleets moving through a system comes from the people that live in those systems. if they're seeing fleets moving through alliance space and not lighting up the intel channels then ceo's need to remind themselves of where the kick button is. that'll stop that kind of behaviour. forcing ratters to have scouts would not only protect them, but it'd mean that not even a cloaked fleet could get into your space without detection. a conventional fleet shouldn't even need scouts. where i do see an issue is with local reporting - states and suchlike are very poorly updated in the local window - usually it requires the window to be repainted by minimising or moving to a different tab - which means that local would have to poll the server at a fixed (fast) interval in order to allow for decloak - recloak effects to be detected. i'm sure messaging would get around it but my concern is that it opens a door for unnecessary lag.to jump on the new meme, ccp need to htfu and remind all the complaining carebears that nullsec is supposed to be a dangerous and scary place where monsters could be lurking."
10/16/2009,"honestly, i think the easiest solution for those that don't want to be listed in local would be the introduction of a secure comms module. it could be a mid slot or even a rig, but there has to be a cost/value balance to it.as far as the argument over no one showing in local in w-space, it's fairly obvious if you're familiar with the eve backstory. all fluid router communication in known space is monitored and regulated by concord. wormholes being outside this range of influence and not included in the concord reporting protocols."
10/16/2009,"and if i am on a cov ops mission, and i know the space is controlled my enemy that will blow me to shreds at the first opportunity, and i am cloaked and hiding, why the hell would i broadcast my it, and especially my flight information to anyone?"
10/16/2009,"items i would like to propose.1) ok do we really need to show npc corps in our employment listing, i dont see the point to be honest, when you have played for a while and of course moved around in corps it does make a list quite long. do corps really want to know if you have been ina npc corp? me personally no. and also on another notr it would cut down server load if you remove bringing in all the npc corp listings too, i bet considerably..2) either have the ability to clear your employment after a set time, or have a reduced list of say 1 year, its like your real life cv people are not really intersted what you did like 3 years ago, its pretty much your last few roles. now obviously eve doesnt expand to the number of years your real live career does so the 1 year sort of apportions it correctly. and to be honest people worrying about spies, well i dont think someone who was in a rival alliance/corp 2 years ago is a real threat to be realistic.again this would help out on server load considerably.ta.."
10/16/2009,"no.point 1) the blanks in your employment history would be just as telling as having the npc corps listed anyway, so this would be a pointless change.point 2) if you were a spy at one point, i'd really love to be able to see that, regardless of how far back it went.it sounds to me like someone has something they're trying to hide."
10/16/2009,"hide something? absolutley not..just think theres is absolutley no value showing npc corps, no one when looking at history is interested in someones npc corps.ok your first point, you wouldnt show blanks lol, how silly would it look with blanks in the listing lol..all you would show are real corps - simple if then statement would suffice easy fix :) and of course it would have another impact on server load quite considerably, so im afraid i cant back your first argument.on your second item, well if there were spies 90% of the time you wouldnt even know it, unless they were dumb. thats what a spie does keeps concealed lol..and then when enough intel is found its just like a normal personal leaving a corp, without anyone knowing anything..so again understand what your saying not not really valid for a no :) again showing less unnecessary history better impact on server load...i mean ok if you want to make it a 'something to hide' issue then ccp can create a api call for you to see the full employment history out of game if you so wished to..happy?that way less load on server, less cluttered history..and available out of game if really needed...everyones a winner.."
10/16/2009,"there is no point not to show them anymore than there is no point to show the, rather not waste ccp time on something that really doesn't matter."
10/16/2009,"my first point probably wasn't clear - the blanks would be gaps in your employment record - for exampledec-01-2008 - dec-15-2008: some player corp adec-29-2008 - feb-3-2009: some player corp bthe blank i refer to is that 14 day gap between entry 1 and entry 2.as far as being able to see if you were in an enemy alliance or corp - heck yes, i want this, even if it was five years ago, because it's going to drmatically effect how i handle the interview and recruitment process. putting it on the api is fine, but this is information i want before i even talk to you - to decide if it's worth my time to even consider your application.and you may indeed not have anything to hide, but calling this a server load issue is nonsense. the server load for these calls is going to be miniscule compared to say, calls for loading the market window, and given the optimization i would expect ccp to have put in place around their database (given that games with lag are usually dead), i'm anticipating that your suggestion would have an effect small enough you wouldn't notice it.if you're worried about your history being cluttered up - quit corp hopping. that's a lame reason to request a code change. that's like the thread a month or so ago to be able to redistribute skill points so the skill listing would be ""less ugly"". make smarter choices."
10/16/2009,"1) this is pointless, and serves only to make the history harder to read. i'd rather be able to see that someone left the game for a year and got booted to an npc corp, instead of having to count the differences in dates. also, you make it impossible to tell when a character joined the game, which is a seriously bad thing. 2) again, no. not even so much because of spies, more so because of game history. as it is now, i can read an omgrawr quote from 2004, and go look up the corp histories of the people involved. someone can talk about where they were during some ancient war, and i can go look up what alliance they were in. your proposal would remove that ability."
10/16/2009,wow have you guys all just left the same anger management class? judging by the time you must of just gotin from school.. calm down have some sugar..ok it isn't just about server load there's also the client side speed up and infact it dies make alot of difference and if you have come from a enterprise development background every bit of performance improvement is important. did you start screaming when ccp removed corp descriptions? based on the same reason? no! but really that was a pointless change but was still doneand can you stop obsessing about it being 'something to hide! ' it's not that at all get it out of your head also if you actually read my second post i did say that if you really wanted to see the full history you could by a simple api call.. but inyour moment of anger you didn't see that...and wasting ccp time huh? this is an absolute simple and easy fix to do and simple code change...so i'm not really understanding why it's a problem especially when the history would be there if you wanted it..ok let's also make it an option to show/dilute history to stop you crying like girls..
10/16/2009,"wow, i thought their imput was pretty sound, and didn't detect any crying, whining, or anger.i'm starting to think you're a troll and this thread should be ignored."
10/16/2009,"what about being able to have different font colors for different corps?so going back from the current, each unique instance of a corporation is given a new color.for example: corpjumper goes back and forth between thiscorp and rookiecorp regularly. and has only been in three corps: originalrookiecorp, thiscorp, and rookiecorp.when the color toggle isn't on, all names appear in the same color (i think it is white), but when activated the current corp (let's say thiscorp) and all previous instances remain white, the previous corp (and all previous instances) may be yellow.so corpjumper's employment history could look something like:thiscorp (white)rookiecorp (yellow)thiscorp (white)rookiecorp (yellow)thiscorp (white)rookiecorp (yellow)thiscorp (white)originalrookiecorp (red)or better yet, what about being able to color code corporations in the employment history based on your (or your corporations) standing to them."
10/16/2009,"its just about clearing up the clutter, it seems that some people like the clutter, i dont thats my opinion we all have different views, i personally dont want to see all the clutter unless i want to.so my idea to make it optional benefits everyone.. i think thats reasonable but doesnt seem to be much feedback on this so not much point continuing..about the colours, perhaps but that might make it worse lots of info and colour? might be a bit messy..."
10/16/2009,i would like to propose that if you are going to lower the drone bay on carriers would you just move that space to the ship maintenance bay.
10/16/2009,"they're not lowering the space, just segregating it. you'll get something like (current bay - 5000) space for fighters, and 5000 m3 for sub-fighter drones."
10/16/2009,chances are that we wont be getting more space at that change. so the change itself will be a nerf. limiting the number of sub-fighter drones we can have. again only further limiting the freedom of eve. iow. the sandbox is starting to appear to be more cookie cutter all the time.
10/16/2009,your kiddign me.....how the hell is removing the ability to drop 1000 t1 warrior drones when you die bad? what *possible* advantage coiuld be gleaned from it remaining?
10/16/2009,a counter suggestion: stop blobbing? then you wouldnt need to count fleets of 300 enemies.
10/16/2009,"an excellent op. i like the whine too, but needs cheese."

10/16/2009,"i can't see ever supporting this for your primary character, but it just might work for alternate characters on the same account. only being able to train one character at a time basically makes the other two character slots useless for any practical game play. if a system such as this were implemented for the second two slots, it would be a nice benefit to the players without upsetting the overall balance of the game.primary - normal skill timesecondary - 4x skill timetertiary - 10x skill timejust a thought."

10/16/2009,"nerf the orca's cargohold and add on to the ore hold. the orca is a mining support ship, not a barge.then give us a medium freighter class.probably two tiers:1st tier is a standard freighter (200km3 cargo max?), can't load things in space etc.2nd tier would be a freighter with a 600km3 ship hangar that can only unload to a station or a ship maintenance array.would definitely make high sec a more colorful place."
10/16/2009,"i'm neutral on this subject.on one hand i can see a need for a ""small freighter"" that has no module or rig slots and has a cargohold of exactly 120.000m3, big enough for one general freight container. no extra cargoholds either, just a 120km3 hold. however, the only real argument i can give for it to be added is that it would fill in the size increment gap and be a real step between an industrial/transport ship and a freighter. if people are complaining about hulls, the easiest solution would be to either make this a t2 orca or a new t1 hull from interbus.on the other hand, we have the orca. except for the very strange decision to not allow the orca to have a 100km3 cargohold (or 120km3 hold to fit a gfc) it does the job perfectly, and then some.the only real ""hauling"" ship that's needed is a freighter-sized ship that can carry unpackaged ships inside of it - and nothing else."
10/16/2009,1. bring the pirate fw stuff coming in. allowing expansion of the empires or pirate sov.2. sleepers discover wormholes and start to come through. joves open up their space and come to save us... or at least try?3. pirate vs antipirate system.

10/16/2009,moved from assembly hall.
10/16/2009,"okay, so you want to move a good chunk of level 4 agents to low-sec? this would improve things how? already, level 5 missions are in low-sec, and those are rarely run except for the few corporations who extort the agents.you want to reduce profitability in high-sec to barely at all profitable? where 70% of the playerbase remain? this would improve eve and the number of subscribers how?you want bubbles to be usable in low-sec? i can't say how many times this has been suggested and shot down in the course of eve.from your page, i see that you did some pve stuff, then went to pvp and have never looked back. how would you improve pve, or do you even care about that aspect of the game? what about high-sec wardecs?given your answers so far, i really can't justify giving you my vote, as some of your ideas would harm the game greatly imho."
10/16/2009,"my mother always said that if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all... but then i again i think she's a cold hearted haradin. here we go.already been raised and taken to ccp. do some research brosef.already raised and noted. ui is getting a massive overhaul (soon tm).so you want cruise missile kestrels back but want bombers nerfed. stealth bombers were always the ginger stepchild of the frigate class and now they're good you want them sent back to where they came from? +1 to bombs in lowsec, -9001 for suggesting them not being allowed to be fired near gates (the exact places where you spend 90% of your time when pvping). i know you've suffered greatly at the hands of these ships recently so i'll let you off.if you don't want to be stuck in it then don't buy one? super cap proliferation is already a huge problem and one of the things limiting it is the fact that you are unable to dock them.just like level 5's... oh wait. if this is your idea of a way to repopulate lowsec then you need to get something done about your myopia dawg. sentry guns and the drone issue have already been raised by yours truely brosef.wait, you want to bring more people to lowsec yet this single act will drive more people away.good to see you think in such clean cut, rigid ways.tl;dr this appears to be a manifesto to improve pvp for you and not 'the masses'. i agree with some points but many are way off the mark. let alone my opinions on your real life personality issues"

10/16/2009,nice sig bro. who made it?
10/16/2009,so frigates capable of command ship dps is good right? then where's my bs capable of dread dps? a frigate doing volleys that high is ridiculous. ya they're paper thin. but when used by good pilots that have lots of damps in gang it's a little overpowered.
10/16/2009,remember when the bombers got changed to how they are now? you probably weren't in united back then but the guys tested them and liiza's conclusion was that their damage was terrible and that stealth bombers are still useless also nice to see that the experience of this pvp candidate is mining in bobs industrial corporation and after that 99% (ok maybe 95%) of his kills are sitting on a gate ganking people 10 vs 1

10/16/2009,"claw stfu, we're talkin fps games. unbalance i didn't think you guys had cod4, only jogvan did. it's the only decent fps out there, game developers suck lately. but hey at least we get battlefield 3 (in 2011)."
10/16/2009,"i'm in full agreement with the idea of making this a rig-centric mechanic representing a pilot's ability to tinker with his ship's off the rack setup. i am also in agreement with the idea that it shoud be limited to a downward movement (high to med or low, or med to low). this offers the possibility of tweaking a few other things that people are grousing about already in the assembly.swap a high spot out of your retribution and use the ab bonus and point a target. drop some high slots off a destroyer to surprise someone with some ewar. i bet with an extra mid slot you could get a mean shield tanked dominix (and they're not bad to begin with). the point is, it gives you more options, and more options are better-er, even if some are silly. those are the ones that make for the best killmails."
10/16/2009,"the easiest way to do this is to make high/mid/low slot modules that give you an additional slot of the particular type you want. in this way it removes the existing slot by filling it, while providing the additional slot somewhere else.i'm not saying this is the best way, just the easiest.while i like the idea, i think that the skill requirements should be very hefty, and there would need to be some pretty major restrictions with fitting or some pretty hefty drawbacks for using such a module/rig.examples of how i'd try to use/exploit the system: move the megathrons's 8th high to a mid/low, presto, instant cheap vindi/navy mega. dominix- move highs to mids/lows, no explanation needed. raven, move empty highs to mids, extra lows to mids. scorp, move extra highs to mids/lows for more ew and a decent armor tank. i could do this all day.you *really* open up a can of worms with this. everything that makes a particular ship special with it's slot layout gets erased with this concept. would it be pretty fun? maybe at first, but everybody gets to do the same thing eventually. so what's the fun in that? geddon with it's 8th high to a mid... typhoon with 8 lows... redeemer with five mids..."
10/16/2009,"i'll agree that drones are under-supported, and i'd be all for a wider selection of drone-buffing modules. i've supported proposals to that effect in the past. but as much as more drone modules are needed, more tractor beams simply are not. i'm not going to support a generic ""more stuff"" thread when half the stuff in question would be silly and/or useless, even if the other half might be good."
10/16/2009,that i can actually support.
10/16/2009,we also need an options like: - approach fleet to... - jump fleet throught... - selfdestruct fleet... (a kind of world of warcraft readycheck command)
10/16/2009,"1. i don't think you can ever stop making small gang pvp more fun. fixing station docking ranges, neutral rr (empire especially), making sure the af 4th bonus is spot on, balancing ecm and sensor damps, and giving small gangs a legitimate roll in attacking 0.0 infrastructure are what i think should be prioritized. i don't think these changes will swing things *away* from large fleets, which will still maintain their role and in fact will benifit from some changes like docking range and ecm/damp reform, but rather make small gangs more fun and, in 0.0, more significant.2. i'd like to see adjustments to the duration, depending on where ccp wants to go. if they want bring all ecm into line and have the ship to ship version just break lock like the ecm drone and burst ecm then the duration should be shortened to 5 seconds with the cap use cut by 75% to match. if they are wedded to the ""cant lock"" mechanic, the duration cut from 20 seconds to 10. this will be very beneficial for the following reasons. 1. overheating ecm's will damage faster 2. the increased number of attempts will lessen the effect of non eccm'd ships being completely and totally crippled, double/tripple eccm'd ships from being completely invulnerable 3. it will increase the role of player skill in ecm management due to more frequent opportunity and need to move jams around and 4. stealth nerf to cap ships online, particularly carriers in small scale fights since the increased number of attempts/successes coupled with their tragic lock time will make sub cap gangs supported by ewar more competitive against them.3. i think ships aside from cov ops, bombers, force recons, blockade runners, and black ops (ie things that can use black ops jump bridge) should have their cap regeneration suspened while cloaking. and that said cloaks should have a small cap use when active (1 per second maybe?). total effect of this should be yeah, cloaking an inty is a very viable tactic, but not an indefinite one. you want to lock down a system afk or be otherwise unfindable, use the stealth ships that were designed for it or deal with the occasional need to decloak and recharge. yes i'm aware such a change would bite noir. in the ass, i'm fine with that cause it'd be good for the game.4. empire pvp, 0.0 pvp, 0.0 infrastructure development, removing ceilings/floors in the market, corporation/alliance management, and the merc market. i'd like to say wh since i'm a big fan but aside from increasing the things players can build in them (infrastructure opportunities but not sov) i can't think of anything that's wrong with them.5. remote effects need to generate an aggro timer as it applied to being able to jump, dock, and be probed out. i read lana's point, and i think it's a fair change that remote repairing a -5 shouldnt give you gcc unless they have one too when you rep them.6. i think the interface could be more intuitive and easy to navigate, but otherwise i'm fine with it. for some reason mine wont save distinct tabs (changing one changes them all) but i think that's just me7. c"

10/16/2009,tjv is fully backing your candidacy to csm. as a big supporter of small gang warfare i couldn't think any better candidate for the job.recently i saw a good post about how killrights should be transferrable from one player to another. that would allow carebears to pass suicide gankers and pirates killrights to mercenaries to take care of them against a bounty. would allow lots more 1vs1 in highsec and keep gankers on their toes. can't find the post now but i think the idea is great and you should think about including it into your agenda.ackwellcommanding officertiera javelin ltd.
10/16/2009,"a. aggro timers for docking into stations need to be much longer. i'd almost want it based on ship size so then you might have a chance to kill both frigates and carriers that decide to undock and shoot you.b. neutral remote repping/boosting should give the same aggro timers as hostile actions. c. locator agents should offer some incredibly expensive option of giving you like 30 minutes of ""live tracking"" on a target. one thing hindering small group pvp is your ability to even find out where your target is. so with this option, you pay many millions of isk for the ability to know right when your target docks/undocks/jumps and to where. there could also be an agent you pay for a set time period of immunity to locator agents. d. revoke insurance payments on ships if concord is involved, or reduce them to minimum payments.e. a separate ""enemy's list"" that notifies me about logins/logouts in a different way than the buddies list."
10/16/2009,"i agree with all but c. it takes practice and a bit of luck, but the good merc corps make their living with the current system just fine, i remember we(when i was in noir.) chased a cruiser over 40 jumps in a circle not once actually seeing him, and wound up catching him 1 jump out from the original location. live tracking is nothing but handholding for those that are to lazy to work a little harder (in my opinion). even if you do not know the location of an entire corp, but you get 1-3 active member's names and run those, youll end up in a hornets nest if you explore the surrounding area.. unless it is highsec corporation with 100members only 3 losses and0 kills in its existence that i cant find anywhere :'(but yes to a,b,d,e :p.. or at least fix the current address book so it updates properly :-\"

10/16/2009,"i think when you say ""work a little harder"" you mean use alt scouts/extra pilots. we can bring more pilots and alt scouts to try to find someone, but why not just introduce a tweak to an existing mechanic that would let one person track down and fight another person?"
10/16/2009,"i do not have any alt scouts and in a 2man(or 3?) corp.. and i manage just fine finding the targets generally, and the ones i cant i havnt even seen online. you can use that single agent every 10-30minutes and there are usually multiple ones in the same area. space them out by 5 minutes and you have a pretty decent idea of what the target is doing and where, if you do not know the area or the likely routes then learn them, the system is fine."
10/16/2009,because high sec needs to be safer amirite?edit: i suck at quoting.
10/16/2009,"in before this gets moved to features and idea i'm voting alek because of his reputation and the reputation of his corp. his integrity and morals are highlighted by his corps standing on neutral rr. because they believe it's wrong, they don't use those tactics themselves even though it places them at a disadvantage. there's no reason why they can't, it's game mechanics (atm) but they keep to their values. +3also, as backup, he has a jimer with a rant script loaded"
10/16/2009,"despite having only talked to you once or twice, i think that this is a vote well-spend.good luck sir."
10/16/2009,"transferable kill rights might make them more interesting if you also scrapped the bounty system and merged the two ideas. may give incentive for anti pirates to actually go into lowsec and give pvp besides their moral/rp imperative, as well as a bounty hunter mini profession. honestly though, i think the priority is low. i'd like to see in game tools that support merc services generally, and if they were put up i could this ""kill right market"" being a facet of that down the line.in response to zhang:a. dont think there's anything wrong with a flat timer, it just needs to be longer than it is now. b. exactly what i want.c. locators are fine as-is. if someone asked me if they had to be changed, what would i change about them? i'd make them a little cheaper and i'd scatter a few more around the game.d. reduction to minimum payout is what i have in mind. e. better than this, just make the buddy list more folder friendly. currently it's a nightmare to create, add to, and manage folders. i tried making an enemies folder once. lasted about a day before i deleted it. i'm not making this an issue though because it's my understand that such things will be taken into consideration in the upcoming cosmos web 2.0 thing.thanks for the support la vista!"
10/16/2009,"strongly agreei happen to like that question, mister."
10/16/2009,"thanks for putting this together for the good of the eve community, dierdra. the fact that you've already served your two terms shows how much you care for the game, and not for the trip to iceland, et al. kudos."
10/16/2009,"this sounds very interesting! can't wait to see it in action. here are some proposed statements (obviously biased toward my play style!):the 15-minute gcc for outlaw actions is too long.boosts to low sec should conform to the intended ""personality"" of that space, e.g., profit opportunities should come primarily from black market and ""organized crime"" rather than industrial activities.new players should be given a limited opportunity to experience pvp with each other as part of the tutorial.unnecessarily cumbersome game mechanics related to contracts, the market, and science/industry should be streamlined or eliminated.pirating as a profession needs some love from ccp.bounty hunting as a profession needs some love from ccp."
10/16/2009,"this is a very good idea. gives the csm election a chance to also be about policy, not just politics or persons.one question: who gets to formulate the statements? since you are not rerunning for the csm (but has some inside experience) i trust in your abilities to do this - but perhabs make a thread for others to post suggestions for statements."
10/16/2009,"i don't have any statements atm. but i can think of an addition to this.i'd like to see candidates say how much experience they have in the various things in eve; pvp, roleplay, mining, etc.i would not vote for a candidate who lacks experience in a field i think needs improvement."
10/16/2009,"this wont happen because there is nothing we can do to prevent a candidate from marking himself as being an expert in all areas, even if this is not the case. to quote a certain fictional doctor: everybody lies. the website displays the links to the candidate webpages (on step 3 and step 4), as well as the candidate's description taken from the official eve online candidate page (step 4). this provides extra information on each character.it is the goal of this guide to help people figure out what candidate(s) match their own vision the best. we cannot actually assess the quality of a candidate - this is still up to the individual.if you read post #1, you'll see: ""if you have any suggestions for statements, do not hesitate to post them in this thread. any other feedback is also appreciated."". i will also be contacting current and former csm members, and post statement seeking topics on the special interest forums (mining, crime and punishment, etc). this will be done once i move the website to the new host."
10/16/2009,"based on feedback i've made the following changes:- candidate maintenance page now remembers a candidate's previous choices- display candidate avatar on step 3 and step 4- display candidate real name, corp and alliance on step 4also, the website should receive a visual overhaul soon(tm)."
10/16/2009,"well done, i was just considering doing something along these lines. i have a few suggestions about the site itself:have candidate profile pages which show their answers without requiring the user to answer the questions themselves. (the links on steps three and four are 404ing right now, and they're buried behind a form which i don't think google will fill out...)ask for a link to a public skillsheet site like chribba's eveboardask for the date of birth of the candidate's character, to see how long they have been playingsome of the questions i came up with don't fit well with the agree/disagree pattern, but they could perhaps be adapted:in what space do you spend most of your time?highseclowsec0.0w-spacehow do you make most of your money?tradingbuildingminingmissioningpiratingexplorationrattingother?i'm having trouble coming up with specific statements to suggest, but something along the lines of ""what areas of the game need love"", including perhaps some of the above, but also the api and poss."

10/16/2009,im voting for ya
10/16/2009,this is in the assembly hall why exactly?
10/16/2009,moved from assembly hall.
10/16/2009,"okay, so you want to move a good chunk of level 4 agents to low-sec? this would improve things how? already, level 5 missions are in low-sec, and those are rarely run except for the few corporations who extort the agents.you want to reduce profitability in high-sec to barely at all profitable? where 70% of the playerbase remain? this would improve eve and the number of subscribers how?you want bubbles to be usable in low-sec? i can't say how many times this has been suggested and shot down in the course of eve.from your page, i see that you did some pve stuff, then went to pvp and have never looked back. how would you improve pve, or do you even care about that aspect of the game? what about high-sec wardecs?given your answers so far, i really can't justify giving you my vote, as some of your ideas would harm the game greatly imho."
10/16/2009,"my mother always said that if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all... but then i again i think she's a cold hearted haradin. here we go.already been raised and taken to ccp. do some research brosef.already raised and noted. ui is getting a massive overhaul (soon tm).so you want cruise missile kestrels back but want bombers nerfed. stealth bombers were always the ginger stepchild of the frigate class and now they're good you want them sent back to where they came from? +1 to bombs in lowsec, -9001 for suggesting them not being allowed to be fired near gates (the exact places where you spend 90% of your time when pvping). i know you've suffered greatly at the hands of these ships recently so i'll let you off.if you don't want to be stuck in it then don't buy one? super cap proliferation is already a huge problem and one of the things limiting it is the fact that you are unable to dock them.just like level 5's... oh wait. if this is your idea of a way to repopulate lowsec then you need to get something done about your myopia dawg. sentry guns and the drone issue have already been raised by yours truely brosef.wait, you want to bring more people to lowsec yet this single act will drive more people away.good to see you think in such clean cut, rigid ways.tl;dr this appears to be a manifesto to improve pvp for you and not 'the masses'. i agree with some points but many are way off the mark. let alone my opinions on your real life personality issues"
10/16/2009,at least we know who the comedy vote this year is
10/16/2009,nice sig bro. who made it?
10/16/2009,so frigates capable of command ship dps is good right? then where's my bs capable of dread dps? a frigate doing volleys that high is ridiculous. ya they're paper thin. but when used by good pilots that have lots of damps in gang it's a little overpowered.
10/16/2009,remember when the bombers got changed to how they are now? you probably weren't in united back then but the guys tested them and liiza's conclusion was that their damage was terrible and that stealth bombers are still useless also nice to see that the experience of this pvp candidate is mining in bobs industrial corporation and after that 99% (ok maybe 95%) of his kills are sitting on a gate ganking people 10 vs 1
10/16/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
10/16/2009,so are you getting modern warfare 2 jogvan? you guys need to play something besides tf2 and l4d. that way i can pwn you in other games too.
10/16/2009,"i'll be getting it, but you never play with us on games anyway, maybe your too good for us"
10/16/2009,"liiza why do you want to be larkonis so much? he's really not that cool!btw i loved your question 18 minutes into the csm fanfest panel you are so single minded it's unreal. i'm sure you think getting into the csm will help you win the lark vs liiza, neo's vs united war going on in your head. you getting onto the csm will not get lark perma-banned for larkonis gate, it really won't."
10/16/2009,"claw stfu, we're talkin fps games. unbalance i didn't think you guys had cod4, only jogvan did. it's the only decent fps out there, game developers suck lately. but hey at least we get battlefield 3 (in 2011)."
10/16/2009,"greetings renegades, rogues, pirates, scammers, trolls and dullards. i am larkonis trassler and i want to run for csm 4. i am a pirate by trade but in my time in eve i have mined, missioned, fought in hisec wars, killed pirates, died horribly in bubble camps, flown capitals, lost capitals and fought and fc'ed numerous :goodfights:wait... aren't you that **** who resigned from the last csm due to less than honourable actions?yes, yes i am. i made a tremendous error of judgement which was a result of a slightly hilarious chain of events. i let down those of you who voted for me and ccp. regardless it's water under the bridge (which is where all you trolls should stay too).have you no shame?not really. i'm hoping to be re elected to the csm in a peter mandelson-esque return to glory albeit without a portuguese manboy at my side and the penchant for buggery.so what did you get done last time around?i championed many issues and brought forward a few of my own. among them:boosting web strength on minmatar recons and easfixing logoffskia few tweaks to gcc mechanics and sentriespirate faction ship improvementsto name but a fewhowever, as a csm virgin one felt slightly overwhelmed by it all and not really sure of our role. yes there is plenty of documentation out there but just like the art of love my first time round was akin to a few hesitant gropes followed by a few half hearted thrusts and a trail of bodily fluids stretching from a hip to an inner thigh. there is much more to do and so much more to achieve.the csm is in it's infancy. people are expecting the world from this body of 'internet spaceships politicians', that's simply not going to happen for the moment. delegates are not devs, they're players pure and simple, there in some part to bridge the gap between ccp and the playerbase.so... what are you standing for this time around?a greater passage of information between ccp and the csm and the csm and the playerbase. it's been pretty woeful this term with the 'monthly' q&a's becoming more like 'annual' q&a's. i took some time out from trolling the forums and put in some time reading them and contributing to assorted discussions, however i often didn't take the time to respond to evemails and convos. this time around i'll make more time to do so.as far as game changes go:ewar: ecm is still overpowered (more in terms of the mechanic, not the strength or range of the modules) and other ewar needs shaking up badly. damps were overnerfed and target painters are underused and undervalued.lowsec: despite discussions conducted by csm 3 lowsec is and will continue to be the ginger stepchild of the universe for some time. i want to further push for changes to lowsec and how it operates.faction warfare: fw needs a distinct shake up. increased lp rewards are great but there's so much room for improvement. occupancy still means nothing and there is no benefit to being victorious beyond personal gain. i'm all for introducing economic knock on effects for empires who perform well and those that perform badly. small gang pvp: at the moment there is nothing to incentivise this at all. with the majority of isk on a vessel being tied up in the hull and rigs even maintaining say a 10:1 k/d ratio the average pvper is going to struggle to make a profit. a rebalance to the system so that more isk is tied up in the mods and less in the hull would benefit everyone. i'd also like to see revisions to loot drops whereby mods have a higher % chance to drop if there are less opponents on the km.hisec wardecs: are easily avoided and under certain mechanics alliances are able to become all but immune to the effects of them. while wardecs should not become a griefing tool i would like to see changes to the system to make it harder to avoid a fight if someone comes and picks one with you. i'd also like to see a reversal of the 'alliance p' 'nerf'"
10/16/2009,"i'll reiterate that the csm are not devs, they can merely suggest changes if they have popular backing. i'll also say that i'm willing to support anyone's issue if they approach me directly and i agree with it, even if it's not part of my 'platform'.hold on... you can suggest all this stuff on the assembly hall what can you offer the csm?continuity; with (i believe) only two other previous members running again this term i believe i can share my knowledge of the system and how it works with the csm newbies much like an experienced older partner.solid no nonsense approaches: i don't mince my words, if i don't like you i'll say so, if i think you're talking out of your backside then i'll bung a cork in it.on a personal side i'd perhaps like the chance to redeem myself a little.i hope to further develop what has already been a cracking and productive 18 months and be part of the process which helps evolve the csm concept."
10/16/2009,"you've got my vote (all 3 of them!), i for one think you were framed by vicious carebears!"
10/16/2009,"oh well if johnny is in, im in!"
10/16/2009,will vote again.
10/16/2009,"apart from the faction ships, did anything else change?"
10/16/2009,confirming that you'll get at least 1 vote from me.
10/16/2009,you have my votes. good luck to your campaign.
10/16/2009,"the iceland summit was only six weeks ago broski. just because you are not getting instant gratification doesn't mean you won't get it at some point. think of the csm as more of a tantric experience, do not judge it by your western standards.i'll reiterate for those of you that are unaware of how this works:issue raised in assembly hall.issue championed by a csm delegate.issue debated in a csm only online meating and voted on. if voted 'no' then qq.if yes:issue goes to iceland summit or a csm/ccp online meeting.ccp say either: 1. that's cool, we were working on it, lets see if we can prioritise it a bit more. (see it in 3-12 months)2. that's cool, we never thought of that, we'll add it to the backlog (see it in 6-18 months).3. that's not really what we have in mind for the game.4. not technically possible right now but we like the idea and maybe look into it a little.5. not technically possible at all.6. grand slam: your idea isn't at all technically feasable and it's completely awful, who elected you and what are you doing here? go and mix up a cocktail of whiskey and sleeping pills for yourself.obviously there's room for a little debate with reference to points 3 and 4 and we were able to sway them on more than one or two issues in iceland."
10/16/2009,i'll be voting for you (again).
10/16/2009,"people who make such a mistake knowing they're putting their candidacy on the line for something silly are not worth to be voted for. all the ""but it's the piraty thing to do"" bullcrap is just that, bullcrap.the csm is already a joke but if at all possible i'd to have some people there who think about what they're doing."
10/16/2009,i endorse this product and/or service.
10/16/2009,"1. post with your main.2. anybody who votes for you is an idiot.you took advantage of multiple systems during your csm. i don't think you can be trusted to do anything honorable, even though i generally agree with some of your viewpoints, i don't think you can deliver anything else except total fail, i wouldn't be surprised if ccp actually denied you to even be a part of the csm."
10/16/2009,and my axe
10/16/2009,"took advantage of multiple systems? unless you call the young boys in his corp systems then i'm not sure what you're talking about...will be getting my votes again. (official lark csm4 sig, add it to your sigs for monster support)"
10/16/2009,"i voted for you last time and you embarrassed yourself and the pirate community, so no."
10/16/2009,"plan on breaking more ndas made my ccp? which i might add, is real life contracts? sheesh. you lost my respect for your actions. trust in-game is one thing, but you broke ccp's trust on you out-of-game which is a far worse offense than any piracy or scam you've ever done. those who vote for you...well...wow. just wow people. tbh, hope they reject you out of hand when your application gets put up. --isaac"
10/16/2009,"you have my sword! (and my vote too)don't balls it up again like last time btw, are you running on trassler or trassier?moderated.applebabe"
10/16/2009,"i'm sorry, but are you accusing lark of behaving like a politician?"
10/16/2009,"confirming 50, under and i are systems. he will be getting my votes."
10/16/2009,you know who my main is.i would like to know the multiple systems i took advantage of. i seem to recall only acting on one piece of information and being caught soon after. if anything you could say (especially in these days of politician's and expense scandals) i was the most cost effective member of csm 3 as i got all my main issues discussed in person at the iceland summit but ccp didn't have to spend money on a flight to fanfest or accomodation for me. savings that they can pass on to you the player.discussion of moderation removed. zymurgist
10/16/2009,and what? that's ok for ppl to behave like that? --isaac
10/16/2009,"well it is how we run the entire western world, and if you don't like it young man i suggest you move to communist north korea!"
10/16/2009,"ah, i see. so you are evading a forum ban by posting with an alt/alternate account? wow, that's honor right there! the second system i'm referring to is where you entered into the tournament, solely to resell the slot and not fight in it yourself. it was a cheesy thing to do and isnt the kind of behavior id want in a csm candidate. and i dont see how they are passing savings on to me, because last i checked my monthly subscription fee was the same amount of money its always been."
10/16/2009,you made broad generalizations on the 3 biggest issues in lowsec. how about you provide details on fixes instead of stating the obvious.
10/16/2009,i see you got a new campaign sig banner.....
10/16/2009,"wow, your one sad person."
10/16/2009,you got my votes. gief moar isk value on modules and more drops from small gang encounters.

10/16/2009,lulz
10/16/2009,"but that $15.00 gets spent on something other than a plane ticket and hotel room.what i don't understand is why people get chastised for playing the game in a way it was meant to be played. do you see ccp complaining about him scamming his tourny slot? if the devs accept it as fair play. who are you to say it's foul/underhanded/immoral/wrong if it's a part of the game?edit: wtf, i seriously missed the snype for this? guess i fail worse than voogru"
10/16/2009,"unlike a certain other c&p-centric candidate who shall remain nameless, you're actually amusing and likable, and clearly you have given some thought to improving the game in beneficial ways.however, not even waiting for a decent period of time after you were kicked sends the wrong message and is too blatant a power grab. if the csm is to evolve into something valid and useful, your behavior cannot be rewarded. i assume the only reason ccp didn't give you a life ban from the csm is because it didn't occur to them. for this term, ccp would be completely correct to block your candidacy.you will not be getting my vote; hold off running again for a year or so and next time display at least the pretense of contrition."
10/16/2009,"you have my votes, primarily cause i think ccp needs a kick in the balls regarding low-sec.as for the other stuff. meh. just try not to get caught next time ya noob."
10/16/2009,"you, sir, might know something about eve. judging from the quoted statement eve is exactly where your horizon ends.larkonis, it'll be interesting to see what kind of scam you plan to pull off this time. well, by now you might even think to know how to bypass ccp's security mechanisms. maybe you should get my vote again, just to see you fail. again."
10/16/2009,"op is tl;drbut you have my vote ofc. in fact, i think you might have all of them. you were far more entertaining than some of the boring ***holes that got my votes last time tbh."
10/16/2009,"oh boy. you do realise that the 'sale' of my tournament slot was not only allowed by ccp but thouroughly endorsed. you also realise that i robbed blind the person who 'purchased' it. the pilots flying under my alliance flag in the tournament were my corpmates through and through. if you think that slots hadn't been sold in the past then you'd be wrong. just because i operated in the open instead of in a clandestine manner doesn't make it any better/worse. as for alt posting. well, if i'm paying for two accounts i should have the priviledge of being able to post from two accounts amirite? hardly evasion broski."
10/16/2009,"this is a srs topic, so i will make a srs post!you say you want to improve ccp/csm/playerbase communication - can you expand on how you think this can be done?"
10/16/2009,"i'll venture a guess that ccp isn't that dim-witted and that there might be more to the story than we've been told; i don't care and i'm satisfied with the way it was handled. water over the bridge. moving on...lark, i like you and believe your game experience, play style, and viewpoint are worth having on csm. two things you mention--csm continuity and improved communications with players--are important to me. plus you have experience where it counts. too bad i've promised my votes to that other pirate buddy of mine. is it too much to dream of having two savvy low sec pirates on csm at the same time? imagine the synergies to be had in championing low sec changes that make sense! i guess the universe is telling me i need more accounts..."
10/16/2009,"a lot of people say they're on our side in the csm...but only larkonis has acted accordingly, he ran on the platform that c&p stands for....and apart from the getting caught part (n00b) i dare say he proved he's the genuine article."
10/16/2009,"now, a srs post from me.i'll be voting for lark for several reasons:1) i seriously doubt he'd pull that stunt again2) at least i know where he stands. how do i know the next guy won't do the same thing?3) this is game. i mean, really. he'll be representin' my internet spaceship, i'd prefer somebody who can laugh about them.so will the campaign colors be rainbow? if so i think we should hold some parades."
10/16/2009,"what?i sorry, but no gentelship, no truth, no brosef - and most important, no hounourourourour!!!!!!!!!!you have my 2 votes, and whoever else i can ""persuade"" to vote for you."

10/17/2009,"let this thread die already.3m sp until the bonus wears off is far overpowered, imo, it should still be like in empyrean age (since this is when i joined i'm going to assume this is when it first happened) where you choose a career and specialization and get roughly 900k from the beginning."
10/17/2009,"don't sit in station for 6 months, quit for a year or so. ccp is slowly moving towards what you're hoping for. if you come back in a year you'll be able to join up on what is becoming the fps version of what this game used to be. ccp can't just jump to the level you want as they'll lose a large number of vets. they have to gradually phase in the changes that are homogenizing and dumbing down this game in order to keep those of us who have been playing for a few years. they do want people like you because you're where the money is but at the same time they want to keep us around long enough to make leaving too painful for us. it's the natural way all the good games eventually go. don't worry, despite all the negative feedback your post is exactly what ccp wants to see. the more people like you suggesting the ""ridiculous"", the easier it is for them to pass their more gradual changes toward blandness, the longer they suck the cash out of us vets."
10/17/2009,they need to go back to how it was before apocrypha and have players choose professions and be given skills in that area but at the same time they need to be told they are not 'locked' into a certain path. i also would like to see the return of spending attribute points on player creation so you can make your char unique. i think everyone starts with the same basic setup now? regardless of bloodline or race.instead of making it easier they need to give the new player more information so they can make informed decisions on what to train. on the point of it taking too long to get started: part of that is the absurd cost of some of the skillbooks like all the advanced learning books which are 4.5 mill apiece. what new player will have that starting out unless they are given it? however i do not support the changes in dominion on making the exploration related skills easier to get. training skills should always really mean something.
10/17/2009,sounds like a good suggestion.
10/17/2009,this.
10/17/2009,"i'm saju somtaaw, and i approve this message"
10/17/2009,great idea.
10/17/2009,a system that makes it appear like something is there that isnt. essentially a system that gets your ship suicided. however at the expense of the suiceder.
10/17/2009,you mean like a ship bpc? :3
10/17/2009,"no. i'm also against a system that allows people to change the items they have to something other, unless concord gets nerfed from it's current state. concord is only the way it is to balance suicide ganks, so a system that unbalances things again should be countered with a concord nerf. didn't think about that. they always cause a lot of exitement before the inevitable disappointment."
10/17/2009,not supported. dont fly on ap if your cargo is of any value.
10/17/2009,"i don't like the ""show something that isn't there"" idea... but a kind of module that scrambles attempts to scan cargo makes sense. the scanner would know you were jamming them, and they'd have to decide if it was worth the risk to attack without knowing for sure what is being hauled."
10/17/2009,"balancing suicide ganking shouldn't even be part of an issue. suicide ganking is grief tactics plain and simple, while also very enjoyable. the heart break a suicide ganker feels when they loot the freighter wreck only to discover out of the 20 billion isk value only 100 million dropped is palpable and harsh concidering he spent 4 damn hours sitting in a system bsing on vent getting bored as hell godfuuuuuuuuuuudfsjlah;lkdshfsj. ahem pardon me, but yeah i agree a modual that lies about what is in the cargo hold isn't all that great, but maybe a counter measure that gives back either a partial return or no return. this would make haulers have to decide between buffer or ewar (assuming midslot) but it would have to be an activatable module so afk haulers maintain their spot on the bottom of the food chain.i think i am rambling."
10/17/2009,"1st they should create 4 new types of isotopes. these only exist in 0.0 in their respective pirate race. so like serps for gallente.they then come out with pirate capships who use these isotopes to go around.these capships will be designed around the racial ewar/recon system. so the blood/sansha carrier would have capital sized neuts/nos. gurista-ecm/remoteecm, serps-damps/extremerangepoint, angels-webs/nano"
10/17/2009,angel nano-carrier is easily the best suggestion i have ever seen.***************************************this concludes my participation in opposite day.
10/17/2009,"i have visions of a carrier speed tanking a battleship fleet going 15,000 m/s. this is something i want to see if only so i can call it the g4yest thing i have ever witnessed."
10/17/2009,this is a good idea . everything in this game has a counter except ship scanners . it seems imbalanced to me to have a module that has no counter . i also find it quite ridiculous that people say that if someone autopilots that they deserve to get blown up . yes auto-piloting may not be wise and if you want to keep your stuff it would be a good idea to not do that . but people need to take responsibility for their actions . just because someone does something stupid or unwise does not give you a right to victimize them . that is like saying that a woman who walks down the street in tight clothes deserves to be ****d . if you want to spend you game time being a vicitimizer than do that just don't try to paint the victim as the bad guy when it is clear you who are choosing to act poorly .
10/17/2009,"in hi-sec it should be considered agression.only police and customs should be able to perfom these acts in empire hi-sec... anyone else is doing it for nefarious purposes at best.... excluding war targets, or course."
10/17/2009,^pretty much this^
10/17/2009,"looking at someone is not an aggressive act. there are numerous ways to prevent suicide ganking, like carrying fuel in portions 2 jumps away from the market hub, fitting tank on your ship. fitting warp core stabs helps. just do not carry more then 100 mills worth of isk in a hauler near a market hub."
10/17/2009,"that's not a very strong argument. i have my cargo scanned regularly during alignment; cargo-fit orcas and freighters (with no option to be nano'd!) offer ample opportunity to be scanned. i'm not using autopilot.however, aggroing the scanner to the scanee wouldn't be a terribly useful change.* freighters cannot, under any circumstance, respond to being scanned. they have no slots.* engaging somebody scanning you in an industrial/transport/blockade runner/orca ... well, i'm sure there are people who would do it, but that's just stupid. nobody in their right mind would do it while hauling stuff.* cargo scanning doesn't exactly have a huge skill requirement. i get scanned by npc corp alts regularly; i assume there are mains waiting at the next gate to do the actual ganking. being flagged to the guy with the cargo scanner in your freighter will not allow you to even destroy the guy scanning you, nevermind the people who are about to gank you when you drop out of warp at the next gate. by the time you can react, you've probably been scanned anyway.to discourage it in any meaningful way, you would probably need a sec status hit to be associated with scanning. but that is a disproportionate response...i think everything is fine as it stands today. if you're worried about getting ganked at the next gate, dock up and wait a while.(lolspelling edit)"
10/17/2009,why not have one just for them the same way we have a rookie help channel?
10/17/2009,how do you propose we find answers to their problems ( or make experienced players answer their questions ) ect
10/17/2009,we already have one - eve new citizens q&a.
10/17/2009,supporting my own
10/17/2009,"according to the fanfest presentations, this is already going to happen."
10/17/2009,"the one billion isk for a complete reset of standings would work well. i could see that as paying one of the pirate agents to hack the concord database and reset the standings of the person. obviously, the agent would not want to do it that often for fear of being caught in the hack, so the once per six-month period would make sense.i also like the idea of smuggling items to reset faction standings. it would give people a reason to buy stuff from the faction stores or market, then remove them from play to increase standings. obviously, the standings boost would have to make it worth the cost of the lp, but not insanely high.either way, something does need to be done. i support this thread."
10/17/2009,"no. i kind of like the way that we can't see each other, but even apart from that there are some points to consider.the first is that although the ship model is removed from the universe, the player is not. he still has a position on whichever grid he's on for the purposes of aoe damage and decloak calculations. the question then becomes what you mean by ""seeing"". surely a better compromise would be to see the brackets on your overview / in space but keep the models removed from the universe. less overhead and more in keeping with being cloaked.the problem i have with this being a module is the principle of active module activation across a jump. all modules de-activate on jumping and i don't know how easy it would be for ccp to code a whole new behaviour.ultimately though this is not the issue they need to fix. as i said, i like not being able to see the rest of the fleet - it adds to the immersion. we all know, however, that the underlying issue is decloaks. as things stand atm it's clearly broken. it's a potentially harder problem to fix, but i'm certainly of the opinion that they need to exclude cloaked ships (and only cloaked ships - regardless of fleet membership - so the neutral hound i accidentally decloaked yesterday in my cloaked falcon wouldn't have been decloaked) from decloaking other cloaked ships. this would allow fleets to warp together whilst cloaked, and give good power to spies too - one person uncloaking whilst in warp would cascade uncloak the entire fleet. pushing for halfway solutions i don't think helps gets us to the behaviour we'd like to see."
10/17/2009,"cool idea, i'll hang out"
10/17/2009,not supported because i like to troll.
10/17/2009,"it's good to be able to chat with the ones, that are representing player base's opinion to ccp"
10/17/2009,just put local into delayed mode. problem solved.
10/17/2009,"we've all experienced desyncs before, they are nothing unheard of. especially if you have wireless, you might see desyncs such as shooting at something that isn't there, or losing a ship because of incorrect capacitor or shield readouts. things of that nature.as of now, the only time the client gets a full refresh is during a session change. because of unstable network conditions, differently configured machines, or simple protocol errors, i don't believe this to be adequate. i'd like to propose the client be refreshed every 30 seconds to improve client <-> server synchronization. it would certainly reduce the reimbursement petitions, which is always a good thing.i really don't see why this shouldn't be done.fake edit: dammit, are the forums being a **** again? i shouldn't have to login 3 times to make a post."
10/17/2009,"and it would certainly increase latency and resource usage on both the server and the client, which is obviously a very very bad thing. there are better ways to resolve desyncing than forcing a full re-sync on a pre-determined interval.until they find said better ways, how about you stop playing the game on a crappy connection that causes de-syncs... that's not ccp's fault."
10/17/2009,"yeah. my dedicated non-wireless 8mb/s connection has been giving me hell lately, like not being able to have insanely low response times to a server located halfway across the globe. it's also causing my cpu to run at a different clock frequency than the server blades. yes, i'll change my crappy connection to direct ethernet to tq right away."
10/17/2009,no...employment history is just that...npc just indicates gaps of non player corps...removing them would make it harder to discern.nonissue
10/17/2009,"if you don't like clutter, you're playing the wrong game my friend."
10/17/2009,"i would like to propose an idea to make mining a little safer for the actual miners mined material....i just witnessed my first ""can tip"" as players call it and find it very frustrating cause you don't get kill rights against someone who steals from you i understand its legal to steal cargo i understand concord cant do nothing about it even though i wish they could but i find it unfair for a more experienced player can steal my mined cargo and what ever defence i can put up and retaliate against and i cant do anything about it cause that player is better cause after the player stole from me i went to get a ship to extract my mined goods upon leaving station the same player the stole from me was now in a well put together amarr assault ship he blew my cargo ship up right outside station then i got my drake to retaliate same player blew my drake up as well and nothing could be done my corp mate couldn't really help i had no kill rights and no concord to help so i really think something should be considered or done about this"
10/17/2009,my eyes
10/17/2009,i remember two years ago miners were asking for a means to fight back against the can flippers. you got it. live with it.
10/17/2009,"i don't have the slightest clue as to what you said, but i think the solution to this is to make it so that an industrial sized vessel could not be filled up by only 3 minutes of mining. if this were so, giant secure containers would be good for more than just storing ammo at a pos.but since your proposal is really illegible, i can't support it, because i don't know what it is."
10/17/2009,o_onot supporting noob whine/post/illegible
10/17/2009,"i almost don't want to take the time to dignify such an idiotic post with a reply, but others have already done so, so not much more harm can be done here.a. god damn, i thought people had figured out by now that just because you're on the internet doesn't mean you don't have to use periods.b. you are obviously new to the game so i will say this as lightly as possible... learn a few things about the game before complaining in the csm forum about how your ship got blown up. you can kill people that steal from you. they put your minerals in a can of their own so when you took them back you stole from them. they could then kill you. they did. that's how the game works, and i don't know why you don't know that. there was even a popup when you took ore from them telling you that you can be shot when you take it. how less subtle can it be?it's people like you that make can tipping fun for people like me, so i hope i won't regret explaining how can tipping works.anyway people, to sum it up, celticwolf is asking that there be some way that you are allowed to defend yourself... such as kill rights or something... when somebody steals ore out of your jet can, and then wondered why he got blown up when he was just taking his ore out of their containers. so he's basically asking the csm to add things that are already very firmly in place and have been so since the beginning of the game. sounds like this guy needs a mentor. 1, 2, 3, not it."
10/17/2009,"there are solutions to this can tipping problem, even one that you can do solo. obviously, you should avoid having ore in a jetcan, but here are some other things you can do:1) solo-friendly - mine in a hulk outfitted for expanded cargo. my hulk has 13k cargo space, and that's a fair bit to mine before returning.2) time-consuming - mine until your hold is full, then return and repeat.3) dual accounts, low sp - mine with a friend in an industrial. as soon as you put the items into the can, have him take them.4) dual accounts, high sp - mine with a friend who has an orca. your mining yield will be higher, and you can deposit the ore directly into his cargohold.these are your options. neglect them at your will."

10/17/2009,i'm interested in your thoughts about the market ceilings and floors.thanks in advance

10/17/2009,"if i remember right, route 5"
10/17/2009,"they suck man-ass. i mainly refer to npc goods which can easily be purchased off the market in nigh unlimited quantities and then used to destabilize markets shared by player activity. shuttles were such an item back in the day because they could be refined for a large amount of trit. this trit which could then be dumped onto the market, driving prices down artificially. i also think insurance qualifies, which is why i want to reduce its ability to affect the market by reducing it to the default payout in cases of concord and self destructs. while not a mineral source, you do have the situation where a price can become so low on the market that people just buy the ship, platinum insure it, suicide gank or self destruct it, and walk away with a profit. in this case it's helping to keep prices artificially high. insurance should be thinking-ahead-way to reduce the pain on the wallet if you lose your ship, not a price floor. this will also have the desired side effect of making suicide ganking more selective, which is a balance i think needs to happen now that npc corps are getting taxed (i'm referring to a rather nice thread about a corp that near-randomly suicide ganked people on a pipe over a period of time and wound up making double digit billions. having trouble finding it though, if someone has a link handy please post to thread)"
10/17/2009,both of my votes it is then.
10/17/2009,"route 5, 6, 7 and 8it's fairly rare even in those areas though, you have to poke around for a bit."

10/17/2009,"here are some questions i could think of:now that sovereignty is being overhauled, what area of the game desperately needs attention next? market/trade, mining, wardecs, lowsec, pvp, othermany complain that level 4 missions are too profitable. what should be done to balance this? move level 4 missions to low-security space; remove t1 meta 0 loot from missions; reduce payout of npcs; increase mission difficulty; other; nothingi'll update this list as i think of new questions."
10/17/2009,please keep in mind that the only answers should be ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. we're not looking at various options. just statements that people agree or disagree with.
10/17/2009,"great idea, will try to toss a few statements your way. selection is biased to my platform but i tried to keep the wording neutral:improving the processes/outcomes of and customer relationship with the gm department is important for ccp's long term success.station docking areas should be made to more closely match their modelsactivating a positive remote effect someone (remote repair) should cause a one minute delay on docking/jumping and keep your ship in space for up to fifteen minutes after a disconnect, just like aggression.the strength of sensor dampeners on t2 gallente ewar ships is inadequate. information warfare links should be rebalanced or redesigned.target painters are not frequently used because they are not frequently useful.targeted ecm mechanics make them overpowered compared to other forms of electronic warfare0.0 infrastructure should only be vulnerable to large fleets of organized players supported by capital ships.the most enjoyable pvp consists of less than 30 players a side.market competition is a form of pvp.indefinite cloaking is an issue that should be addressed.the interface for customizing your overview tabs is easy to understand and use.suicide ganking should be a viable tactic.suicide gankers should not receive a full insurance payout.corporation and alliance chats should have messages of the day similar to other chat channels.price ceilings and floors undermine eve's free market.mercenaries are an important part of the game and the hiring process should be supported by in-game mechanics or tools.csm representatives should be held to a higher standard of conduct than ordinary players."
10/17/2009,"i was going to do another voter information service like i did in the last election, but this is way better than that, so i'll just give you some possible questions. - amarr are currently overpowered. - caldari are currently overpowered. - gallente are currently overpowered. - minmatar are currently overpowered. - ccp should make the user interface openly moddable by players. - scamming should be prohibited. - epic arcs do not currently live up to their promise, and need more work. - action needs to be taken to remove 0.01 isk order bumping from the game. - there should be explicit in-game support for coalitions of alliances, beyond setting standings. - tech 1, meta 0 loot should not be dropped by npcs. - players should be able to set their own skill levels on the test server. - the csm does not communicate with players enough at present. - local chat should be changed to delayed mode immediately. - pos mechanics are fundamentally broken, and need a complete overhaul. - all level 4 missions should be moved to low-security space. - jammers are too powerful compared to painters, dampeners, and tracking disruptors. will add more if i think of them."
10/17/2009,can we please have an official update on these minutes?surly given the fact the the csm's existence is based on representing the player base to ccp and reporting back the actual communication to the aforementioned player base should be paramount!i undertand that ccp need to vet the minutes and that we just had fan fest but come on guys!please try and avoid the trap real life councils seem to walk into with astonishing ease and remember you were elected to serve not for the love of that office.-cj

10/18/2009,"this idea, just makes sense.slow repair facility.however, i would suggest just rendering the drones unusable while repairs are being made,example: ""your drone bay is currently locked while repairs are underway,repairs should be completed in 4 minutes and 37 seconds""/supported"
10/18/2009,"yes, good idea, but not instant repair, say 20 hp/s for carrier 50hp/s for mother ship (just think of some better numbers tho)"
10/18/2009,"supported, as long as doing so consumes nanite repair paste or some other similar resource, so it's not free, and you can't do it forever without a -minimal- amount of logistics.also, for sake of ease of implementation, it should probably be something that just starts repairing everything in your fighterbay when you start it (by rightclicking your carrier?) at the same time. everything else is probably going to be a ton tougher to implement.i like the thought of it locking your fighter bay while repairs are in progress, though.in addition, given that fighter and dronebays will be seperated soon, maybe only let the repair thing apply to fighters, or something."
10/18/2009,"i support this, however there should be some consequence. for example the repairs require you to have maintenance personel in your cargo/hangers. the more personel you have, the quicker the repairs can be done, but at a cost of sacrificing space in your bays. also repairs should take capacitor as the maintenance personel would need to use the ships energy to make the repairs."
10/18/2009,fix plz

10/18/2009,"concerning pos fueling requirements.with the advent of dominion and sovereignty changes i would like to suggest a change to the way pos' are fueled.rather than having to gather all the required resources. i'd like to see the creation of a new pos battery to replace all of the components required. allow the pos battery to be manufactured (create a bpo) and put it on a timer such as 30, 60, 90 days. this should significantly reduce the number of calculations performed on every pos on every moon in eve and allow for better logistical support of an alliance, corporation, or individual tower.a secondary battery called a reinforcement battery could replace stront and stront timers in 6, 12, 18, 24 hour increments allowing multiple reinforcement batteries to be installed on a tower.for tower mods and armament either leave the hvy water/liquid ozone required or change these mods to use cpu and power as part of the pos battery.cheers"

10/18/2009,supporting the idea as well.
10/18/2009,"/signedper the reasons stated above, mainly that this is the faction cap booster equivalent of the ages-old faction ammo, and that these will become necessary for any pvper to compete just as faction (or t2) ammo and rigs have in recent history, faction cap charges should be easy to buy on the open market."
10/18/2009,.
10/18/2009,"supported. any pilot that brings one of these to a fleet deserve to be shot by his own team mates (and podded), give it 2 mids already."
10/18/2009,"i hate to rain on your parade grath, but ccp have (at least temporarly) aborted plans to introduce the ""15% ab boost per level"" any time soon. apparentely some bright chap fit a 10mn afterburner to an af and ccp are looking into ways to make the bonus only apply to 1mn ab's.anyway, to quote chronotis from the respective thread over in the test server feedback:the thread has been unstickied as well."
10/18/2009,"i think retribution is the only af for a defensive proupose..... i like it i suggest another way to make that ship better 4 hi slots1 med slot6 low slotsthis way my favorite ship will have a sense in the game. and i don't want to change it to have a mid slot more, ccp will take it from the lower making the retribution a suicide assault ship."
10/18/2009,"supported because yeah obviously.take away the utility high, add a med. duh."
10/18/2009,or maybe we could have disruptor that fits to high slot. would fix all the ships with too few med slots.
10/18/2009,"this. this ship is worthless as it is, and it will stay worthless until it gets another mid slot."
10/18/2009,"the fact that some players call this their favorite ship in the game makes me seriously doubt the intelligence of certain amarrian pilots. give this ship another mid slot, or just delete it from the game all together (probably just as well)."
10/18/2009,got my vote. i always belived that frigs should beable to tackle and run an af or mwd.
10/18/2009,"hi therethis might already have been discussed, if so then ignore this thread.the gap from industrials to freighters is just huge - not just in cargohold but also in skill requirements and specifically ship cost. what is missing in my opinion is a ship type to cover that gap. industrials cover the high-sec hauling of smaller amounts, transport ships cover the low-sec part and freighters cover the hauling of very large amounts of goods. a ship covering the area around 120'000m3 to 150'000m3 would be very welcome imo. what's floating around my mind looks like this:- 120'000m3 to 150'000m3 cargohold fully fitted / rigged (3 rig slots, 5-6 low slots, 2-4 mid slots, no high slot)- medium cost, around 60m- slightly more survivability than an industrial (25% more shield / armor), but at the same time slower and bulkier (takes more time to align)- possibly the requirement of having advanced spaceship command in addition to industrials (of any faction) at lvl 5- manufactured by ore (as to only have to create one type of ship instead of one for each faction)"
10/18/2009,"call them medium freighters, give each race two variants1st tier would be the kind of hauler you're describing.2nd tier would be a freighter with a ship hangar that has... lets say, 600km3 space. enough to fit a battleship inside.give them some fluff. say the first tier caldari medium freighters were made by kaalakiota to ship war supplies into the border lands. 2nd tier gallente m freighters would be made by roden shipyards to transport warships to this and that place etc. it'll give me something to rp about.i'm tired, so yeah sorry if my ideas seem lacking in description. fill in the blanks for me. still think it's a great idea. thumbs up."
10/18/2009,"this was already discussed, two years ago. which is why we now have orcas in the game, which fit your specs almost exactly."
10/18/2009,"not really. the orca is a support ship for mining operations.what i'd like to have is a hauler, that requires hauling skills and not mining leadership skills. see it as a large industrial or a small freighter, whatever you prefer. it can move around things but it won't boost other people's output in any way - and therefore it wouldn't require one to train skills totally useless for hauling. that's also why it wouldn't cost you some 250m isk, it would be more in line with transport ships or slightly below in terms of cost."
10/18/2009,it seems to be popping up over and over again. the orca is the ship your are looking for. that it gives nice mining bonuses is nice on top.
10/18/2009,"it's a dual-role ship. one of the roles is the small freighter, almost exactly as you outlined. the other role is mining support. it does both well. throwing another ship into the same niche would be silly - the orca was designed to fill it, and they did a good job with it. just because it takes funny skills doesn't mean it's not the ship you're asking for."
10/18/2009,"i think it'd be great if there was a 120km3 hauling ship in addition to the orca. it wouldn't hurt the game, and ""there's the orca already"" isn't that great of an argument unless you're arguing from the standpoint that you hate having diversity in the game."
10/18/2009,"""good morning pilot, how do you feel?""(and an aura voice saying that. please)"
10/18/2009,something like that? why not.
10/18/2009,i think it sounds a bit too warm and fuzzy for a cold universe.and i think you should stay where you were the last time you were logged in. i feel it would make life too easy.

10/18/2009,overal... it's ok
10/18/2009,latest revision looks good.pattern is right that changing the weapons alone would risk making acs on nonbonused (especially active tanking) ships too good.and with the new arties minmatar ships would be something more than useless in sniper fleets.

10/18/2009,"hi not sure if this has been brought up but here goeswar dec-ing and empire wars have been way over looked by ccp, for instance when a corp/alliance war decs an apposing corp/alliance there is a fee that's all good but if a person or corp leaves a war deced corp/alliance there is no penalty to either the individual or corp as a whole other then a nice eve mail saying x corp has surrendered big whoop-tee-doo how about spoils of war, now i don't know what the penalty should be but if they have surrendered then there should be a fee associated with said surrendercome on ccp and council lets address this matter i for one want to see something introduced in the next patch that use empire care bears can get some benefit from not just new paint and pretty planets.well thats about it let the carebears start whining about this thread lol"
10/18/2009,"pretty much everyone and their dog is aware the empire wars are broken beyond all understanding. your proposal, while interesting, isn't all that unique.frankly, what's needed is a complete overhaul of the mechanic, not just an additional step in the process."
10/18/2009,"i don't see it as a step but as a fix, right now every man wimp and his pet turtle can leave a corp/alliance when someone declares war on them, penalize them it cost isk to dec there wimpy asss so it should cost them to chicken out too. so i would call this a step in the right direction while we sit and age for the war decing re-build that will never come :)"
10/18/2009,"when you can find a way to keep this from being used strictly to grief smaller corporations into oblivion, i'll consider supporting it.maybe.until then, no."
10/18/2009,"1: your topic is misleading... you should change it to ""war abandonment""people are going to assume your complaining about those who grief in war-dec's.2: you have a valid point... but like de... i won't support this without a great deal of thought and balance being added to the equation."
10/18/2009,"no you all fail to see the point, its not about griefing a corp into inhalation or anything like that its about the use of surrendering with no penalty everything in this game well almost has a consequence but with wars too many can leave a war without a consiquense what i'm saying is fine if you wish to leave a war then there should be a fee paid thats all as it stands there is nothing for the victor you fight in 0.0 for a reason you kill for a km well with war there should be a price at the end its not just about griefing its about balance right now there is no balance for the war mongers in eve."
10/18/2009,"you also fail to see that if you declare war and stay docked for the whole duration, there is no consequence to you. you also fail to see that 2mil is pittance for a license to pop stuff in highsec. you also fail to see that there is no point in wardecs apart from freeing up a highsec moon or griefing clueless noobs. the first one is valid, but as for the second one, if you're having a hard time griefing noobs, then you should just quit now, because it's not gonna get any easier.wardec's where supposed to be a way for people to disrupt the supply lines of 0.0 alliances, but with neutral hauler alts and all the metagaming, this is no longer the case.i agree, wardec's need an overhaul, as they're pretty much a wasted mechanic atm, but you fail to adress the other issues. if you look at the big picture, you'll understand that wardecs aren't in favour of neither attacker nor defender as it stands. if you want to change the mechanic, you need to make sure it stays that way.thank you.ps: not supporting this, as there isn't even a suggested fix, and only one side is represented."
10/18/2009,"i guess you've had your fair share of war dec's lol you sit there and spout crap about sitting in dock, all i was getting at if you bothered to read is there needs to be a penalty for people who quit a war and want to sit in a npc corp fine if you do want out of a war but there needs to be a penalty to do it that's all i fail to see why your getting your pretty panties tide all in a knot and yes the whole war decing needs a rebuilt and as i said great if it ever gets done but in the mean time lets get a couple of things fixed/changed dang man who cares if you support butt sniffers anonymous but at least read what i'm getting at properly. oh and the 2mil is for a corp decing a corp its 50mil for alliances."
10/18/2009,"quit while your ahead nooblet... you don't know who your dealing with here. (thumbs ""fille balle"")"
10/18/2009,"it costs 1bil to found an alliance. if you can afford that, 50mil is pittance. and you failed to read what i wrote. i agree, there should be a penalty. but there also need to be a penalty for the attacker if they don't engage. yes, i've had my share of wardec's, and every time it was declared by a bunch of loosers looking to grief some noobs. then they learned that they where picking on the worng guys. then they docked up and waited it out. no consequence.that's the bit that you fail to understand. there needs to be balance. if there's a penalty for the defender, then you also need to implement a penalty for the attacker. for balance. get it?and lern to use periods ffs. punctuation is not a city in afganistan."
10/18/2009,per :
10/18/2009,"fascinating idea, and i like it in principle, but i'm not sure it's workable. problem is determining ownership of the ore. jetcans are corp assets, not personal, and multiple people can fill one. not to mention that when you stack items together, the game forgets their history - there's no way to tell whether half the stack came from you and half from me. the only way i can even think of to do this would be to have a specialized jetcan that is individual, not corporate, and that gives the person taking from it the option to pay their going rate for it(they wouldn't be forced, of course, since we want to still allow can stealing). that's a complex and ugly solution, but it might do what you want. still, it sounds like something better done by players than by game mechanics. i'd love it if it worked, but i'm not sure that it really could."
10/18/2009,"in the code, you'd just have to keep the history of ownership of the ore around as long as the container is owned by someone in the corp or fleet.i think keeping the ownership history around as long as the container is owned by the corp/fleet then it shouldn't be a problem. the mining director would be able to set the going rate for each ore based on a contract. of course, he could set up veld for 4 isk and then when the mining op starts, lower it to 0.0 ... that would still allow cheating. (btw - i love how we try to design the possibility for cheating into this ... i love eve)"
10/18/2009,"you're saying ""put it into the code"" like it's easy. inventory code is complex, well-optimized, and not something you want to mess with unnecessarily. stacked items don't have histories, they have typeids and quantities. to the best of my knowledge, that's it. you want to store more, even in that one narrow case, they have to completely redo how they do all inventory, everywhere. any time you'd open a container, hangar, cargo bay, whatever, it'd have to get the ownership history on every single stack of everything. the hamsters would be screaming. it's the same reason that they can't colour bpcs differently than bpos. it's not that they don't want it to be easy to work with, it's that the server architecture doesn't work well with the proposal, and the proposal isn't important enough to justify rewriting everything, with all the attendant bugs and diversion of dev man-hours."
10/18/2009,"when i had been training for arround a week, i was waiting at a gate with my fleet and i got my first abaddon kill as a team, even a new player can be usefull in a fleet, now 6 months on, i still like the role i played that night, tackler, now a tackler needs arround 3 hours of training from the start and ur there, and in my opinion its the most fun role to play in the fleetof course if u playing eve by ur self and trying to teach ur self how to play, u got no chance, so find ur self a corp and not a cearbear mining one, if u havent got the balls for pvp and wardecks then get a pve corp, but u have no idea what ur missing"
10/18/2009,"one last bump, but looks like its not a big deal to most people and most likely wont see time of day with the csm, let alone on ccp's plateoh well.side note... ccp where are my hull rep drones the csm brought up to you!"
10/18/2009,"don't know why this has so little support, it seems like a good idea to me. i'd prefer the 1 rig improves heat resistance of all mods option but the 1 rig per rack option is probably better balanced."
10/18/2009,"my frustration is simple, the way that actual graphics of the shield effect on the ship looks, my proposal is to make shield graphic effect looks again round or oval shape like it used to be...the reason for this is:1. ending some graphic bugs on some ships (like joints or spaces between areas of the ship, and so on).2. having a oval or round shield is more rationale for the majority of players, when generating a shield or an electro-magnetic shield usually it have a round or oval shape, like the electro-magnetic shield of the planet... the shape of such of these in general are round or oval...3. and shield beeing oval around the ship can show animated effects of interaction with it when happens, like beeing hit bye a missile it wouble or waveing wen hit by a laser or iradiating by overcrossing with others ships shields and so on... these things making the overall gameplay way better, because when you play eve the most of the time is spent with ship in space and shilds online... thanks!"
10/18/2009,"because we all know what a real shield looks like.i think that because its wasn't possible/feasible for ccp to move hits to shields away from the ""center point"", then moved shields closer to the ""center point"". it looks like missiles actually hit the shields (or pretty close), instead of going through the oval shields."
10/18/2009,actualy i spend most of my time with shields and armour both offline.... although it would look nice for the few seconds when they are there
10/18/2009,real men hull tank?
10/18/2009,"not supported, i prefer the ship hugging shields.however, it would be nice if ccp would do something about the damn sounds when you have hardeners activated."
10/18/2009,"i am referring only on shields, of course it will be nice to have sounds asociated with some specific shields or armour and hull' interactors or activators, but again i thinking only on shields because shields seams to have a graphic problem or inconvenience, as far i can see hardeners and other repairs (and stuff) effects looks ok, there are room for more anyway, but that shields are really on edge...the poit is ccp could bring back old shields at least! the old ones were much much much..."
10/18/2009,oh jeese. i dont even have the stones to troll like this. dayum.
10/18/2009,"this idea is so good that i feel i need to present you with an award of some kind. so without further delays, i hereby present you with a check for eleven internets!"
10/18/2009,"supported, or at least give us the ability to toggle it."
10/18/2009,i agree. it doesnt fix everything but its most of the way
10/18/2009,"excellent idea. scrappy ship should be fast, frail and make things go boom in spectacular ways."
10/18/2009,"yes this needs to be fixed. i spent a few months ratting on a slow and unstable internet connection, and getting disco'd would result in 5 minutes logging in and a 20 jump trip to a station that i could dock in to buy new drones. this is not fisable on a daily basis, nor should it have to be."
10/18/2009,/signed
10/18/2009,"docking timers are fine. what i think you don't realize is that a huge side-affect of this change would be people would be even more cautious to engage- leading to even fewer fights, and fewer kills. i'd support a scale up for docking timers of different classes of ships- but i don't think any subcap should have to wait more than a minute to dock- it's plenty of time to give it a go, and if you don't kill them in that frame, so be it (this from someone who has missed a drake, raven, and cnr kill due to docking in just the past 5 hours). if you really wanted to get rid of the problem, you'd take your fight off station. no support here."
10/18/2009,"after the fiasco of the sisi event last weekend i'd say no.it was full of muppets shooting anything with titans.personally i used it to test stuff i could realistically use on tq such as different turrets etc to see if i thought it was worth training them on tq, sure i undocked in a dread to shoot a titan that was abandoned outside the station in highsec and got insta-popped by concord (man i want one of those battleships)having armageddon days on tq is a bad idea, let alone armageddon weeks. they serve no real purpose apart from having a laugh and flying stuff you can't normally fly."
10/18/2009,"i think an armageddon day would be awesome. i bolded what i consider to be the whole point. armageddon day might be hard to setup, but i thik the lolz from the event are well worth the time ccp could spend on such a wild event again."
10/18/2009,"armaghedon day cammed a week ago, you probably missed it"
10/18/2009,"except that was intended to be an actual test for dominion capital changes. then again, i guess it was going to happen regardless."
10/18/2009,"*thumbs*there's no point in having armageddon day on sisi. the performance/loginqueue-mess that was last weekend attests to that.either needs to be a big cluster, or... don't. d:"
10/18/2009,"irl, cargo transfers happen among naval vessels. it would make sense for the same thing to happen with freighters in eve.the orca's could be mining directors/foreman and the freighters could haul for them. i'm seeing some mechanisms where by orcas ""dock"" with the freighter and the cargo is transferred like in the in-station trade mechanism."
10/18/2009,why just orcas and freighters?but i see a major problem: hold space.i think the main reason ccp requires trades to happen in stations is because there is a lot less requirements. in station trades just require you to have a few of your 1000 or 999 (i forget which is the limit) slots open.
10/18/2009,"i'm willing to bet money that ccp does not want freighters to be able to be directly involved in a mining op. at best they should pick up the ore from a station and/or pos and haul it elsewhere.you want a humongous cargo capacity while mining, fly a rorqual.not supported."
10/18/2009,"freighters are specifically prohibited from transferring cargo in space for exactly this reason. nobody wants to see hulks jetcanning into a freighter, not even if there's an orca in the middle."
10/18/2009,"and if 5000 people falsely report you? don't get me wrong, i'm all for this, but the logs should be checked before taking any action. i can totally see someone (not mentioning any names here) abusing this. i think some sort of punishment for abuse should be implemented. like a 3 day ban. you know, just to put people (again, not mentioning any names here) off abusing it for lulz."

10/18/2009,ok so now if you're in a gang. you can just drag your mission from journal to chat. however only gang people can see it. nobody else can click on it.i propose making this work for everyone regardless of gang.newbs and pros then can drag and show the mission to everyone.now pirate roleplayer losers. dont go bah no supporting missionrunners. if you as a pirate find ur way accidentally into a mission channel and a newb links a lowsec mission. you know exactly where to go to find a mission runner in lowsec.
10/18/2009,makes perfect sense to me. would help a lot in the assorted help channels.
10/18/2009,"some of these i like. the missile port are a good idea, the overheated cap, not so much. while we're on the topic of graphics, i'd like to bring up the graphics for the beam and pulse lasers. beam lasers are a steady beam. i'd like to see just that - a single, solid steady beam lasting the entire cycle time, perhaps with a bit of drift off of the target and extending past it for a period of the ""shot"". i know this part would be difficult to implement, as hit anims are fairly static and not dependant on the target's sillouette from the attacker's persspective. that's bunches more processing to determine that alone.pulses as they are now ar so similar to beams it's laughable. i'd make them more like the projectile or hybrid graphics im that it would be a projected energy blast - think fast moving missile and you're on the right track. in either case, and with all the other weapons too, i'd like to see a graphical representation of the shields. perhaps not visible at all times, only when hit and not necessarily representitive of the shield's strength, but it would be nice to visually see when you've gotten through the shielding and are hitting the armor.the same goes for the division between armor and hull, but that's harder to see, usually is over really fast, and hull damage already has a graphic on pc ships (i'd like to see it on rats though).just my $0.02 isk :)"
10/18/2009,"no support for op, but i like this idea."
10/18/2009,"i raised it as an issue for a csm meeting, but isd renamed my issue due to excess profanity.here's the current name for it:"
10/18/2009,"i do support the idea of faction capitals. however you might wanna look into those bonuses. nano carrier is prob what makes this suggestion go into the dust and be forgotten. anyway, make it web+damage or web+extreme tank or something like that. or for lolz target painter+web for a very expensive rapier!"
10/18/2009,"capital tp's and web's ftw! with 100km range. wouldn't be that bad imo. but the real question remains: would you need say, cladari/amarr carrier trained to lvl3 in order to use the sansha one? because i'm ok with crosstraining subcaps, but capships? i can't even fly any capships yet..."
10/18/2009,flagging a scanning alt isn't going to help much. if anything should be done and i doubt suicide ganks need yet another nerf then a mod which hides some of your cargo would be better.
10/18/2009,not supported.
10/18/2009,before or after 8 and 9?
10/18/2009,"actually that's not a half bad idea.. cast 8 is in production, recording 9 this evening. we'll kick the idea around after we're done recording 9 and see if it's feasible.i'm definitely going to be making an appearance on planet risk to talk w other csm candidates but some kind of super q+a would be something i'm up for if we can make it work."
10/18/2009,alek why do you hate arazus?
10/18/2009,"i've read your page, and i must say that you seem like a very valid candidate. however, i do have a few questions regarding your position:1) why did you choose to be a member of goonswarm over the other alliances, aside for personal reasons? do you see a benefit to join an alliance with such often questionable tactics?2) i noticed you didn't mention mission running or factional warfare in your history. how much experience do you have with those?3) what area of the game needs the most attention in your eyes, and what would you do to improve it?i look forward to hearing your answers."
10/18/2009,"hey, thanks for your questions.firstly let's get 'the goon question' out of the way. i joined a corp within goonswarm back in may or so this year as the big invasion of delve was in full swing. the corp i joined had a lot of friends i'd known for a long time outside of eve and so it seemed natural to hook up with them after my last corp disintegrated. i was also looking for experience in large fleet fights so the prospect of joining in with the largest conflict was particularly attractive. the 'benefits' that i joined goonswarm for were the opportunities to fly with friends and to take part in the kind of epic scale fleet engagements that had attracted me to eve in the first place. if you check out my killboard stats then you'll notice that almost all of my kills (and losses) are in fleet fights of varying sizes (you'll also notice that i am a terrible pvper but let's not dwell on that).i know that goons have a reputation however the game is just as important to us as to anyone else. many of the current and upcoming improvements to the game have been brought to the table by goon csms, a lot of testing and number-crunching is done as well as a lot of development work on third-party tools that have benefited almost everyone who plays the game (evemon being the most obvious example).missions and factional warfare.if you look up my employment history in game you'll see long periods in the scope, you'll also see i have some very high standings with npc corps like federation intelligence, federation navy, creodron and spacelane patrol. that should answer your question about my experience with mission running. i spent most of my time between player corps running missions in empire to build up my wallet and buy some shiny toys. i also took the time to shepherd my industrial alt through enough missions to get his standings up for l4 r&d agents. i haven't tried factional warfare myself. i was in an alliance when it launched and we were too busy fighting for our space up in vale of the silent at the time. i keep thinking of starting an alt just for fw but i've been too busy with my main to get distracted with a time intensive alt.what area of the game needs the most attention?there are a lot of different areas that i think need some urgent attention and i'm hesitant to pick just one as the most important. obviously the upcoming dominion changes will shake up the game in a big way and i think it's critical that ccp gets that right. if there are major issues with the way that the new sov system and 0.0 rebalancing works then i would say that this will be the most important area in the short term. assuming that ccp mostly gets dominion right then the next thing in my sights would be the new user experience. new players are essential for eve's long term survival and, at present, i don't think the game does a good job of drawing them in. a whole raft of things contribute to this, some of which are also problems for more experienced players such as the ui, the various management interfaces and the difficulty of getting accurate information about game mechanics or systems. i'd like to sit down with ccp and work through all of this to untangle all of these knots to make the experience more streamlined, more transparent and far more user friendly.of course as well as these existing issues, there are also other points on the horizon - dust 514 is coming and eve players have a lot of questions and concerns about that - especially with the planetary management stuff, ambulation looks to be on the way at last and we're long overdue for a low-sec overhaul. i'd hope to bring these questions to the devs along with the current or imminent issues faced by all of us."
10/18/2009,"i can vouch for goons during my term on the csm. darius was the spearhead that put the 0.0 revamp into full gear, and i've noticed that avalloc has also championed a lot of interesting topics. i don't mind goons personally, i just despise their tactics (dj was all about pvp and turned down a lot of reasonable pve topics, for instance).that said, thank you for answering my questions. assuming no other candidate comes to the forefront, you have my vote."
10/18/2009,"hiya, hope you dont mind me asking, but are you the same ian c who ran the european closed war beta? (and of previous daoc fame?)"
10/18/2009,please list all upcoming changes to the game that the goon csm's are responsible for.
10/18/2009,"yes.marlona, most of that info is in the meeting minutes."
10/18/2009,"oh, cool.well, you got one of my votes :) i got in the beta on one of the first waves and i thought you did splendidly there, have no doubt you'll take a csm post seriously and have a positive impact. we could use an 'all round'-representative on the csm imo. eve needs to be better for everyone, the whole ""nerf pirates, boost carebears! boost low-sec, nerf high-sec"" rhetoric gets me down. good luck with the campaign."
10/18/2009,i must have been very tired since i managed to miss the obvious :). anyways a few suggestions:- kill rights should be tradeable- player piracy in low sec currently isnt worthwhile
10/18/2009,does this mean you've found a way to prevent a candidate from being dishonest about his views on the statements?
10/18/2009,"there is no significant difference between a player choosing to cross the boundary into lowsec or 0.0, and a player choosing to open fire on a ninja-looter in highsec.either way, the player is making a conscious decision to assume risk.ninjas are totally ""in touch with reality and what they're really doing"". they are offering mission runners a chance to engage in pvp on extremely unfavorable terms.all this talk about good, evil, and mental illness is totally ridiculous."
10/18/2009,"simply saying something is so, does not in fact make it so"
10/18/2009,there go with +4 votes.good luck in the csm.
10/18/2009,"your making me leave my comfy spot under the bridge in c&p, to troll you here... this makes me unhappy.fail 1fail 2fail 3and also bubble girl says no too...please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
10/18/2009,ive worked it out.its the fanfest next year that we have to wait for before getting the mins published.even a yes/no/wait for details on each issue would suffice.skunk
10/18/2009,"lol,wonder how many carebears actually care to vote for you.you do not have my axe"
10/18/2009,"give up, aaron. humor s doesn't get capital joke."
10/18/2009,"the csm is nothing more than a convenient platform in which ccp generates some good press and makes you feel they listen.although they have implemented a number of small fixes based on the csm these would probably have seen the light of day without the csm, after all the devs do read the ideas and some of the ones in dominion etc are on the boards in one form or another and not part of the csm."
10/18/2009,...and my bow!
10/18/2009,you've got mail
10/18/2009,yeah the timer annoys the hell out of me. it should only be 30 seconds or a minute at max.
10/18/2009,csm 3 meeting 10 - sunday october 25th 16:00the tenth issues meeting of the third csm. issue submission deadline is october 24th 16:00. this is a public thread for council members to post their topics in. this is not a thread for pilots to make agenda suggestions.agenda:1: spanish localization (maz)2: accessability focus group (avalloc)3: trading navy cap boosters (maz)4: selling multiple items at once (dv)5: aggression timer length (maz)6: replace titan models with monster trucks (maz)
10/18/2009,"is this thread where you publish the minutes? if not, please link the correct thread where you do publish the minutes."
10/18/2009,"the minutes of tonight's meeting are published on the evelopedia, and a raw log is available, too, as usual."
10/18/2009,<.<>.>im going to have to hide from the feds now. im starting to wonder if goons have been using him to leverage some debates on capitol hill!
10/19/2009,"signed!!and please bring back the old cloak effect which comes from the back to the front of the ship, too."
10/19/2009,signedwant old cloack and cyno effect back
10/19/2009,signedwant old cloack and cyno effect backjepjep
10/19/2009,"none of the players i talked to prefers the new jump effect over the old one. it is time to get the bang back and make it bling. while all other effects are great (well, i kinda liked the matrix pos shields better than the current one), capital jumps are a major disappointment as they are no different than jumping a gate. this really needs to be improved."
10/19/2009,/signed
10/19/2009,this quote is from march. it is now october.obviously this topic still needs all the support and attention it can get.bump!
10/19/2009,needs moar lightning.
10/19/2009,"you are a moron. if i could hand-code extra security measures in eve, i would. but guess what genius, i dont have access to the source code, so the next best thing is asking ccp to do it for me.how is asking for extra security measures not taking security into our own hands?i support this idea, there is no harm in implementing it."
10/19/2009,looks like a good change to me.
10/19/2009,"/signedccp must be control any change in personal data ( email, name , account pay method ...) and game data ( character ...)so before any change they should send an e-mail of confirmation with old good know email address or send a or downright sent a mail by post with blocking of the account in case of change of personal coordinate (the accounts being non-transferable)"
10/19/2009,supported and signed
10/19/2009,yep i was so looking forward to this until i saw the console only thing.
10/19/2009,pc please
10/19/2009,"the more i read about it, the more i am realizing that this is a business decision.ccp already has a game that is doing pretty well on pc -- eve.now they want a game that will do well on console, and thus double (or triple) their revenue -- dust.they won't make dust pc because everyone knows that a pc gamer would a** r*** any console gamer because a mouse/keyboard allows much better control. they also insist on dust being a linked universe.so, dust will be console only. i f****** hate consoles, but i might get a ps3 so i can watch bluray and play dust. after all, its one of the best bluray players out there.tl;dr -- f*** you ccp, you greedy bastards. i will still buy your products. lead me."
10/19/2009,"being locked out of what could very well be an extremely great game on pc sucks. we've seen the success of bf1942, bf2 and it's numerous clones, so the demand for action oriented games with a good rts part mixed with cooperative first person shoot-them-in-the-face is there.so, yeah..i'd like to play a game like that again.."
10/19/2009,seconded
10/19/2009,excellent idea. well thought out concept for it too.
10/19/2009,"interesting idea, but riddled with flaws:just like having rigs is not mandatory, but if you want to compete you'll want the best to compete with. if the other guy has crews, you'll want them, too.needing a rig in order to fit crews makes no sense, from an rp standpoint, which seems to be most of your justification for this idea. the crews already work inside the ship. rigs are cool things you can do to mess with the ship for better results, just like instead of buying brakes from the manufacturer i could rig something up with some cork and sheet metal lying around (not recommended ).and in case you missed it from my post above: the crews already work inside the ship. when you fire missiles, the crews are in the bowels of your ship to reload it.and what about that ""oh crap, i left my crew in station""? rp, you can now not turn around to redock. you have no crew to operate under your commands."
10/19/2009,"this was brought to the csm and ccp and shot down. here are the reasonings:1. there are already a lot of things which can modify ship stats.2. adding more things that modify ship stats just mean there is a lot of re-balancing work that needs to be done to prevent the inevitable overpowered ship3. when a new stat modifier is released and rebalanced with respect to everything else, that means people who don't get this new thing for their ships will be at a disadvantage to everyone else.4. with mods, rigs, skills, implants, gang bonuses, etc etc, players already have enough **** to worry about, and they have a long enough list of things they ""must have"" to be competitive."
10/19/2009,"one of the big problems i have with the assembly hall system is that there is a support button, but not an unsupported button.why is this a problem?it means you cannot be neutral. in order to gauge how well an idea is liked, you have to compare the number of supports to the total number of posts. this creates an atmosphere of ""if you arnt with us, you are against us"" because it means if you dont post with an explicit support, you are reducing the apparent support level.i propose a ""not supported"" tick box. if you tick ""not supported"" it deducts a point from the ""supported"" tally.this means an item can have negative or positive support, but more importantly allows people to post constructive but not explicitly supportive posts, without seeming to cast a ""not supported"" vote."
10/19/2009,obviously supported.
10/19/2009,supported.
10/19/2009,"i'd almost prefer that the thread summary have explicit thumbs-up/thumbs-down counts, not a total, but that's really secondary. yes, this has been asked for since day one, and with good reason. it'd sort out the mess immensely. supporting it, again."
10/19/2009,not supported.
10/19/2009,but how can we tell?
10/19/2009,"/me strikes one up for ""neutral"""
10/19/2009,"i think ccp is worried, with justification, about attracting trolls, griefers and troublemakers to this forum. since you can't just give thumbs down, people are more likely to actually bother typing reasons why the idea is bad. certainly this is not always going to happen, especially on the 101st thread about salvage ""thieves"", but i doubt devs bother with those threads either. i'm guessing that from the perspective of developers, the current system is much more fruitful.i do agree, that there is no way of immediately show you are neutral, but i doubt this is an actual issue. it will make some ideas look to have less support than they actually have, since the op had a lacking solution or understanding, but i think it is pretty foolish to think that any changes are made on the basis of the number of thumbs up compared to the total number of posts. it only shows there is interest on the matter and how the playerbase is feeling about the issue/solution proposed, but the actual arguments in the posts are propably much more influential.i'm not sure why there is any real need to fix problems of appearances, since popularity isn't going to get your idea passed anyway. it is the good reasons and ideas you have to provide and usually can provide on popular matters, that will decide the issue."
10/19/2009,"supported.not because i think it is good to thus open the door to ""vote no because i dont like you"".supporting because it allows you to show ""i have seen it and want to vote against it"" as opposed to now where a lack of support vote may mean anything from: you have not even seen the thread, over you have seen it but have not decided yet, to you are adamantly against the idea/motive."
10/19/2009,yes please.
10/19/2009,thumbs up to thumbs down.
10/19/2009,sounds like a reasonable idea.
10/19/2009,"not supported, as this is based off the flawed idea that the number of thumbs up posts (as compared to the total number of posts) is what indicates whether the idea will be brought to ccp by the csms. this is incorrect.the thumbs up feature on the assembly hall posts can allow the csms to easily eyeball the threads. they can see by the number which topics have caught the eye of many people and then go into the threads themselves to see what kind of support (or lack thereof) there actually is for the idea.tl;dr - there is no # of thumbs up per # of unique posters formula that makes the idea presented to ccp. it just allows csm to notice threads to look at."
10/19/2009,"not having it makes you sound like you're against the topic unless you click the support. i've sometimes not involved myself in discussions where i couldn't quite decide, and i've supported topics without being sure what the suggested topic actually means.this button would be helpful."
10/19/2009,"supported, not just because it makes sense, but because the ability for users to vote for and against proposals anonymously was promised in the original draft for how this forum was supposed to work.there was never meant to be a requirement to post to support an idea. actually coding in the originally promised functionality for this forum would get rid of a large amount of spam from the topics in the form of posts simply put in to bump up the support count without adding to any discussion to the idea being put forward.it'd also get rid of alt supports by tying the ability to vote in each topic to the account rather than the posting character.having said that, i seem to remember supporting this very issue a couple of other times in the past."
10/19/2009,"and this is wasting the csm's time.let me show you why:hypothetical thread:2000 posts on thread, 500 supports.looks pretty promising, eh?except that in that thread, 500 posts are supportive, 500 are neutral and 1000 are negative.if there were a ""not supported"" box, that tally would have shown -500 instead of 500, and the csm would have known that it was an unpopular idea.instead, they have to tunnel though the entire thread to get an overview o just how unpopular the idea is.if you have a way to show your liking for an idea, but no way to show your disliking, it cannot help but create misrepresentation."
10/19/2009,totally and utterly unsure of support or not. maybe
10/19/2009,supporting... in spite of the idiot trolls.
10/19/2009,"so this thread is intended to go straight to ccp and completely bypass the csms. the reason: the csms are the problem (and i highly doubt they'll bring up the issue of their own failings).after observing the last three csm elections and reviewing their performances, it's crystal clear things need to change for the better. the entire csm process needs to dissolve and be rebuilt in order to function as intended. currently, it's broken.though larkonis' indiscretions are awful to say the least, the damage to the csm credibility was imo much worse.he may be called an isolated incident and that would be fine if true. sadly, it isn't. when csms like mazzilliu bring up blatant self serving issues like this, it further hurts the csm credibility. especially when the player support vote is 3 for / 133 against(3 for is herself, an alt, and some other guy)somehow this ""issue"", despite receiving less than 1% thread support, made it onto the table with ccp. isn't the whole purpose of the csm process to represent player interests and bringing them to ccp in an intelligent and structured presentation? can anyone honestly say this csm is speaking on the players behalf?unfortunately, it gets worse. with the recent ccp fanfest, a csm panel was hosted to a near empty room, the video posted on youtube. look who strolls in late and with poorly chosen words (14:15).really? is this really why she ran for csm? a free trip to iceland all expense paid? a simple phrase that's disturbingly insightful into her intentions.and yes it does get worse. there are alliances ingame who have guaranteed spots on the csm panel due to their sheer size and voting muscle. nothing personal goons, but having multiple guaranteed seats just isn't right. i could point out further failures of the csm process, but the point has been made.ladies and gentlemen, we can do better than this.we, as a playerbase, are not being represented by those whose sole purpose is to represent us.ccp i implore you. disband the csm and restructure so these failings never happen again. reform the csm with clear and public guidelines and structure. define what is expected of them and what their purpose is. give us the tools to determine which issues the csms bring up and which ones they don't. form an inside panel to review csm performance so we can finally be rid of their ""sleazy politics"". become more transparent and public with the ongoings of csms. we're sick of this shadowy process. we're sick of being left out in the cold.there may yet still be hope for salvaging this broken csm process. but we can't do it without your help ccp.oh, and i like pie"
10/19/2009,"yes, some candidates get elected that imho do not deserve to be elected. some of them consider the csm a joke, and the players are the targets of that joke. however, they do get elected by the players.reformatting the csm won't do anything to help this facet. the fact that mazz raised the issue in a csm meeting isn't at all surprising. what is surprising is that the measure passed.when i was in office, you can see by my history that i raised some issues that didn't get good support, and therefore didn't even bring them up to the csm. some of the issues that got a lot of support got shut down by my other delegates. however, this is a democratically-elected council, and this is part and parcel of the tale.if you think this is wrong, use the power you've been granted by ccp to change it by doing research and voting in people who are responsible. don't whine about a system that does somewhat work, even if it isn't perfect.less than 10% of the playerbase voted last time. we can do better, but that might actually require some *eek* effort from the players. go to the polls and vote, and encourage friends and corporate members to do the same."
10/19/2009,"first of all, supporting my own thread and just for the record, i have voted for candidates whom have shown a lot of initiative towards cleaning up this mess. however they've always been a letdown afterwards. even in the last election for csm3, i voted for someone who later turned out to be a complete asshat. i'm sure someone out there will liken this onto sleazy rl politics, but it doesn't have to be and that's the entire point of the thread. we can do better than this."
10/19/2009,jealous much?i doubt you want their jobs lets be fair.fanfest was awesome thank you.
10/19/2009,"agreed... but the problem remains none-the-less.even if i was to run and (possibly) could pull it off as i have a bit of an ace up my sleeve support wise.<.<;;;(don't look so shocked... just because you hate my guts doesn't mean there's isn't a large contingent of people who do like me : o p )i don't think its worth the effort or trouble in all honesty.that should say something to you people... think about that for a bit.for starters... the csm has no checksum in place for crap that mazz pulls.one voice against a pile of csm's who abuse that power is not going to help me whether i'm in it or not.secondly... the obvious brick wall of communication is likely nda's and that's not good for someone (such as myself) who scream in the face of stupidity.thirdly... i'm a rather contrary person... people don't like me because i don't hesitate to shine a 100 million candle spotlight in your face if your a moron.not likely to win points there... even for the fact that i would never pull the crap mazz did... or lark (which was minor in comparison imho which should have cost lark more than he had to pay but mazz did far worse).ccp should enforce a strict set of rules concerning the submission of ideas and the process of which they are benched.and i refuse to accept mazz's ""pathetic"" excuse for why she pushed it forward without proof from ccp itself. none of that nda bull####.i would support this proposal under normal circumstances but bunyip has a valid point.so i'm torn at the moment... but i agree... there is a serious problem... and it needs to be resolved... pronto.if they can bring any idea to the front of the list with minimal to zero public support... the csm should likely be shut down and scrapped to be replaced by something with a little more accountability than it has today.not an easy thing to fix to be sure.this is supposed to be (i really hate using this word) democratic process in which people bring forth ideas... they are critiqued... tested... and then the csm votes those things that are popular.but this is nothing.... the csm are praticually dictators who agree to cooperate and vote on things.... we are just the peanut gallery who have no sway or control over the situation.they choose to listen or to ignore... or laugh at us.that's not how this is supposed to work...if ccp intended to push this forward they would have never have bothered with the csm in the first place. they would bypass them entirely... after all they are in charge and at large.so all it comes down to is this... if the csm is really who they are... then who do they answer to?sure as hell ain't us."
10/19/2009,"according to a gm who likes to sleep in odd places.""there is no fixed number of votes required, the csm decides which issues is being given priority.""so they could just ignore this forum and bring issues to ccp that they dream up the day before.which makes voting a waste of time for players if the csm members want to ignore it as some do.supported but good luck getting the csm to raise this one."
10/19/2009,all i hear is bawwwwww
10/19/2009,"i get that you're ****ed. for that matter, i agree with some of the reasons. mazz's issue was largely idiotic, as i said in my reply to it, and the fact that the csm passed it flabbergasts me(though to be fair, 3/136 is 2%, not 1%). i would never have voted for it myself. i like a lot of what mazz has to say, and i think she gets a bad rap sometimes for being too sarcastic, like in that quote, but she's far from an ideal csm. that said, this is how democracy works. you elect fools, you elect slackers, you elect people most interested in lining their pockets, and you elect people who have grand visions and never deliver on them(and no, i am not referring to anyone in particular with any of those). democracy is not perfect, and it won't be perfect until every candidate's innermost thoughts are known to the voters, and every voter is an expert on every issue. needless to say, i'm not holding my breath on either of those. the problem here isn't the democracy though - it's that you're expecting too much of it. you're making the perfect the enemy of the good. and yes, the csm we have is a good thing, warts and all. yeah, you elect lark and watch him self-destruct, or you elect...well, most of them have proposed a silly issue or two, so i won't even single out mazz. you also elect the body that finally managed to kick ccp's ass hard enough to make them realize the skill queue we'd been screaming for six years was something that we really did want. the csm provides a good cross-section of the players, and they have enough weight behind themselves to make ccp listen to the will of the players as best our representatives can advance it. i'm not going to mess around with that system just because you think you can do better with the next set of rules. you can't - this is what democracy always looks like. there's a reason churchill called it the worst system except for all the others. it is, but i wouldn't give it up for the world."
10/19/2009,"realy ? but they wrote the truth.csm a joke. most of csm members elected from alliance mail from 0.0 corps. binding vote it's not so fair against other candidates.need an other solution for vote. maybe a popup window in eve when starting the client before the next election will be started and maybe ccp will be get better result as 10% of eve players. i could show you in the hungarian or other forums, how working this.""vote for this guy, he is blue for us and we can talk with him for our own interest"" blablaand other things. because the whole csm is 0.0 players, most of problems focused just to 0.0cry for cloak,cry for cloak mwd etc,logoffsky and about them does not change nothing. they just like it the dirty and tricky things which dodge from the normal game.that's fine when a freighter logged off at gate when the warp phase just started and you can't kill him, because you can't target the ship even then if you scanned in space after then the pilot have 15 minute aggression time?but csm didn't vote the changes."
10/19/2009,"personally the csm has been utter failure since it started imo. its all about who gets most votes and egos, well if your in a large alliance then of course your going to win.its about personal preferences for those alliances not for the good of the whole of eve and thats was what it was supposed to be. maybe thats what ccp intended it to be, as the majority of players going to use the full depth of the game are the large alliances? maybe...remember your supposed to be the voice of all players of eve, i saw one thread that because ccp decided not to answer or give suggestions to a problem they closed it! keh? your supposed to push ccp on matters and get an answer, again that was the point of csm, otherwise whats the point!?however csm was supposed to be that conduit between player and ccp, really i hear nothing, and you only see stuff if you go look for it.something needs to change big time, so supported..i think at least change it so that you must of played eve for at least 3 years to apply!. and the people voted just dont know how to work as real stakeholders and drive issues through.maybe ccp need to hire a set of independants, but there again if they not going to listen to csm then they aint going to listen to anyone.any perhaps thats the real problem ccp not coming to their side of the bargain?.."
10/19/2009,"you're absolutely right. everyone on the csm represents 0.0 interests. especially the e-uni dude, and that erik dude who is a carebear, and....owait~edit: as for the figure saying that 133 people disagreed with mazz's issue: that's disingenuous at best, and completely dishonest at worst. there's a group of about six or seven posters who represent the vast majority of posts in that thread. they don't get multiple votes. go count the number of people who posted in the thread, rather than the posts, before trying to analyze the support it got."
10/19/2009,"posting to vote support.i think those who have been following these things have an idea of my views on the matters.apart from that i do object to one point raised by the op:thread support. it should not really be a criteria or requirement, in deciding whether something gets raised or not.does anyone even read the first post of every thread in assembly hall? it's like being forced to read the features and ideas section.so, lack of threadsupport is no acceptable reason to drop something.otoh, a lot of support can be mustered simply by certain people telling their pleebs to go vote it. not it those exact words, but it does not take all that much, due to the lack of attention these things generally get, to make it look like a lot of support, compared to the majority of things.therefore, drop the notion that thread support (=thumbcount) should matter, it is not realistic with the current level of participation by the general population.btw, i would like to point out that the csm minutes from the last meeting with ccp is still missing from the official page:"

10/19/2009,ahahahahaha.u mad~
10/19/2009,you weren't the only one that cringed at that comment.there was no further input from that end of the table after that.
10/19/2009,"to add to your nerd rage and list of my indiscretions, i raised this issue with zero supports and even zero posts! thats like, even less support then my term limits issue. i didnt even post to support it myself. you should probably make a youtube video or something about it.if you want to audit the performance of the csm, you can do it right here from the comfort of your own computer chair. plenty of the issues on that list were raised by me, some of which were extremely popular issues. youll probably ignore the full list of what we've actually done and keep complaining about how we don't represent da people or something like that, though. and i can totally understand that, everyone has a right to cry on eve-o for very little good reason. re: the csm panel- well im glad i accomplished at least one thing there by trolling you people irl. the entire csm panel was us answering a small handful of questions for an hour. almost all of it was stuff you can look up. fanfest is for parties, our actual work as the csm was in private and all held early on the first day. i attended all of that.also, ccp don't read the assembly hall forums. but i'll save this thread so i can show it to my voting base next re-election. for some reason they like it when eveo posters get trolled and cry on the forums about it, especially when it's for pretty much no good reason. this will get me more votes next time around.supported for trolling (a half dozen of)the assembly hall posterssigned,(kisses and hugs) the most diplomatic diplomat in pl and a real girl in real life-mazzilliuthis post is disappointing it doesnt even contain scandal involving the people you listed. larkonis has no big alliance backing him."
10/19/2009,"actually, yes, quite a few of us are, indeed, angry about the situation. although, to be honest, i'm more irritated about mazz's flagrant abuse of her power than i am about larkonisgate.the csm is a lot like a communist state -- it looks great on paper. once you get real people involved, however, it rapidly goes to ****, because (most) people are inherently selfish and out to line their own pockets. it's just how we're built - evolution ftw.what's really needed are two things:1. increase the vote count. the reason these lare alliances keep getting their members on the council is because they poke and prod their members to vote. we need to get a similar movement out among the non-alliance players - push the idea that they need to get out and vote. at least then if they win, they'll have earned it instead of walking into the spot.2. increase oversitgh of the council from the player side. part of the issue is that once elected, a csm member has no incentive to do anything they promised to do except actually show up to meetings. as my dad would say, they have no skin in the game, and thus can pretty much do what they want, as long as they don't incur the wrath of ccp. if anything, they are beholden to their alliances/corps pretty much because they're the people that will make their lives the most miserable if they don't push their agenda.@the op: if you'd posted this a month ago, i'd have back it with every thumb i could muster. i've come to the realization since then that the csm can probably be saved, but only if we get more players involved.edit:mazz snuck in a post on me while i was writing this.screw it, disband them. no more free trips to anywhere for anyone.if the members of the csm themselves are going to treat the position like a joke, dump it. i'd rather ccp spent my subscription money on new hardware than sending asshats like mazz to iceland so she can be an attention ***** in rl as well as pixel land."
10/19/2009,"haha, a dozen of you are mad more like. the function of the csm has always been for people to raise issues to ccp to improve the game. we still do that just fine, and ccp seem pretty happy with the count and quality of issues raised so far. you (dozen)guys act like we are stealing money from da people or some terrible crime. its pretty funny"
10/19/2009,"btwneed clear and clean rules.first: ""supported"" and ""not supported"" button for this forum.second: when an idea reach a minimum supporter count and reached over 50%+1vote must be move to csm vote. 1(100-200-300 or other numbers; find out)1 vote from 1 account. binding alliance votes cause ban.(as in pandemic legion :d)players controlled csm - csm controlled ccp"

10/19/2009,"so pathetic. you need more ally member from ventrilo or from corp channel. just yell there, my csm lover cries and need help in eve.com. alts and members go to defend :d"
10/19/2009,"i too, think this csm is nothing but a sham and a fraud.it goes against every principle of democracy that *goons* of all people should be allowed to be voted in and the fact there's even representatives from pl just goes to show how broken the system is. ccp should ban them all.much like the op dirty wizard, i too believe that the csm would be much better if it were comprised solely from members of the other side of eve 0.0 politics.i also support where dirty wizard is going with his idea. representatives should be that. solely representatives. during their term in the csm all members should have their ingame accounts frozen to prevent distraction from their duties. they should also be taken to iceland and kept in solitary confinement to prevent being conataminated with bias from human interraction on the matters that they are currently considering. the facility should be known as ""the box"". once accepted onto the csm they should be immediately flown out to iceland and placed in ""the box"". relevent reading material can be passed via a dumb waiter, as well as the necessary foods and liquids. this allows the representative to work for the people without interference or distraction until their term comes to an end and they are released from ""the box"". early release from ""the box"" should not be an option except in obvious cases of medical emergency or death.i believe ""the box"" will allow the csm to act more fluidly in considering matters of extreme importance in the eve-universe and put to bed claims of bias."
10/19/2009,"this thread is shaping up to be pretty good... i don't even know where to start.for those who haven't realised it yet, you've all been trolled massively by a dainty little azn girl. grats. through your ignorance and short sightedness you've pretty much allowed it to happen./whiteknightas for the other 'issues' here. 4/9 current csm members are from big 0.0 entities, hardly dominating it. and it's only right in some ways as 0.0 is the supposed 'endgame'. of course these people are going to be able to generate lots of support and lots of political capital quickly. if you're unhappy about it then make more contacts in game or qq more and get back in your hugbox.if you have a problem with the way things are being done then either run yourself, try and make some constructive posts or cancel your sub. making inflamatory and ill informed posts just makes y'all look like mongs and if this forum is filled with flamebait then noone will see any of the constructive posts.with reference to the 'thumbs up' and maz's post. the 3 supports are all from individuals, most of the 100 or so posts on that thread were made by a dozen or so people. the system in it's current form is a bit broken. i forwarded issues which didn't have 'majority' support or even much support at all. the forum interface especially with regards to the csm stuff is pretty woeful and should hopefully get a revamp with spacebook/cosmos. blame ccp for that, not us.as for the old 'what has the csm done for us!?!?!?!' crowd. it's barely been active for 18 months. we're only just starting to see the labours of csm 1 come to light. it's not a case of raising an issue, ccp rubber stamping it and then getting it in the next hotfix.regardless, you should all grow up a bit. the amount of nerdrage your are generating over a quasi political advisory group in an internet spaceships game is staggering. it's like the phantom menace all over again.next thing you know we'll be having rl assassinations with delegates keeling over left right and centre, the victims of snipers, poinsoners and bomb makers."
10/19/2009,"woah now. i wouldn't go that far. imo the goons have just as much right to be in eve as anyone else. the fact that they have multiple guaranteed seats on the csm is what troubles me. anyways, what i would like to see happen is a change in the way csms bring up issues to ccp, instead of bringing whatever they feel like.i would like to see them given forum tools to set up polls. a csm would review all the threads regarding an issue, condense and rewrite it into an intelligent and unbiased format, and set one-click voting options.those with high vote counts would be allowed to be brought up while blatant self serving issues with nearly zero public support will not be allowed for discussion *cough*mazzilliu*cough*the fact that this thread is actually getting supports should be evident enough (hey i'm just as surprised as you are )btw, csms should be held accountable for their words and behavior on the forums. i cringe when i see an elected csm trolling and behaving badly. it's shameful. it tarnishes the csm credibility and brings upset and negative attitudes towards the whole process.trolling and general asshat-ery behavior from a csm should warrant closer ccp observation and possible review to dismiss. you want to be an official representative of the playerbase, start behaving as such."
10/19/2009,"honoure (i like the way mazz represents me, btw~)"
10/19/2009,"right here, what de'veldrin, wrote is how i feel. if the position is going to be treated has a joke then put em all in clown suits so we can at least get a laugh at em when they do the csm panel at the fan fest. drive a little car on stage and have the csm reps all bail out of it beeping each others noses and throwing pies at each other."
10/19/2009,"okay, now this i can totally support."
10/19/2009,yes... the csm has totally become a laughing stock of eve online.supported.looks like pl has become the new goonswarm... heh.
10/19/2009,"i completely agree. the csm should be representative of the needs and views of the voters. as a avid troll and dedicated voter, the fact that some of the csm members don't troll is offensive to my sensibilities, political/moral beliefs, religion and sexuality."

10/19/2009,"i'd vote for youto op: sorry, but that's all i have to say on this matter. thank you."
10/19/2009,"hey guys i've had the best idea ever.pay me, and i'll raise whatever pet issue you want. it can even be a really stupid issue. or even this one.to make this scam proof, i am going to ask to get paid at the rate of one 30 day plex license per assembly hall thread. so if i end up going back on my word, youall can ban me!i'm going to set the deadline at the 23rd of october for thisbuy a piece of history todayedit: i agree with this idea with the amendment that the csm get bathroom breaks, and free icecream and brandy is provided on request. also ccp need to take the csm out on runs periodically so we dont all get too fat."
10/19/2009,"awesome idea. i got this thing i want you to take up with ccp. how about having some filter function on the forum, so that players that are easily trolled can't respond to a post for, say, 30 minutes or so, giving them enough time to think about the post they read? meh, who am i fooling, some people are too dumb to know they are being trolled, and would probably never catch it."
10/19/2009,you serious? i'd figure you've grown tired of me. :)
10/19/2009,"i am so outraged by this csm and its level of corruption because of mazzilliu. i put all the data into this graph and as you can see the level of corruption is growing and spiraling out of control in direct relation to how many posts mazzilliu makes in this forum. please visit your user settings to re-enable images.it will be so out of control that ccp will no longer be able to control the csm reps. they will build mazzilliu a throne room with a niffty gold chair, that has massage built in even!!!! ccp employees will be forced to bring mazzilliu offerings of pineapples, brandy and icecream. or face mazzilliu's wrath. i may have to create a totally new thread so we can really get to the bottom of this and get rid of mazzilliu forever. or the spiral may continue and engulf all of eve. the repercussions of this could cause tens of thousands of people (in real life) to only give up and down thumbs as answers. then because some gangs may think they are throwing gang signs the gangs will ""cap them in their nerdy asses"". i for one do not want to get a capped in my nerdy ass. so support this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."

10/19/2009,"popularity has absolutely nothing to do with whether an idea is good or good for eve. bear in mind it was the playerbase that absolutely insisted to ccp by overwhelming popular support to have can flagging introduced to the game. they were warned what would happen but they demanded it. so it was introduced and the people that demanded it got blown up in hillariously comic fashion as a direct result.also, if you had the courage of your convictions you wouldn't be posting on a 2 month old alt"
10/19/2009,if you first realize the purpose of the csm. the point becomes fairly moot.csm exists because of pr. before the csm... any issue unfixed for 3-5 years is bad ccp. now... why isnt the csm doing something about this problem. bad csm.no point doing anything tbh. just dont vote for mazz. csm voting should be soon.
10/19/2009,"a dude called corstaad ganked me two years ago when i first started playing eve. i remember this, and if he ever arrived in the same system as me i would dock up.you propose to give him the option to change his name, so i dont know when he arrives in system. im hardly going to go though the id page of all 100 names in a caldari system before i start mining there.name changes are ******ed. not supported."

10/19/2009,makes sense.

10/19/2009,all faction charges should be available via market.
10/19/2009,"what diversity? an orca fits between 77500 m3 and 140951 m3, depending on fit, plus 50000 m3 of ore. sounds quite a lot like ""120km3"" to me. in order for it to be diverse, it has to actually be different."
10/19/2009,"the ""difference"" you are harping on about is to be able to haul one general freight container, whose volume is 120km3. the orca cannot carry a gfc because it's carrying capacity is divided between two cargo holds.i'm pretty certain that the requests made two years ago specifically requested that the ""mini-freighter"" was to be able to haul one such container. the orca can't. therefore the demand for a genuine mini-freighter still stands. the orca ""almost"" does the job, but since it doesn't do the job fully the proposal lives on."
10/19/2009,"i agree chrar, thats a great idea. besides the orca has 80k of basic cargo space, with 400k specificly for ships, and 50k specificly for ore. my suggestion for the skills needed are:-spaceship command level 5-[racial] industrial level 5also for the cargo, 140k - 160k of cargo space would be nice. finally the cost should be about 60 mil - 90 mil so its not too cheap and about a sixth of an orca's cost(377,000,000 isk in amarr)."
10/19/2009,"let me ask you something.whats the point of carrying 1 freight container?unlike other containers, it isnt larger on the inside.proofand even if it was, the orca is larger then 120,000m3 anyway.the only point of gfc's in a freighter is to organize stuff, otherwise most freighter holds end up a mess.if your hold can only take 1 gfc, you might as well not use it."
10/19/2009,"who cares? i fly a real freighter and i don't touch gfc's. they're worthless for anyone who isn't trying to organize corporate hauling, and even then, couriers work better. ""carry one gfc"" is a measure of size, and the orca meets that measure. if your goal is to haul physical gfcs from one place to another...well, i suppose i could tell you to fly a real freighter, but really i'd just tell you to find something worthwhile to do with your time. nobody hauls gfcs from point a to point b intentionally, so the fact that the orca can't is utterly irrelevant. it hauls as much stuff as a gfc fits, which is the whole point. just because people phrased their desires around the assumption of it only having one cargo bay instead of three does not mean that the orca fails at its role of being a small freighter. quite the contrary, really - it carries significantly more than its proponents asked for."
10/19/2009,the orca has (with lvl4)40k m<U+FFFD> corp hangar (seems you missed that)79k m<U+FFFD> cargo bay50k m<U+FFFD> ore hangar.400k m<U+FFFD> ships.
10/19/2009,"1. with those skill requirements, you've already trained for a freighter, pretty much (just need advanced spaceship command lvl 1). you've very nearly trained for a transport ship; just a couple more days for industry v.so for skill requirements, you're not getting anything ""in between"" a freighter and industrial/transport ship.2. you don't set the price. ccp doesn't set the price. they can set the mineral requirements, but the economy sets the price.2a. your 60 - 90 mil price tag is what transport ships cost. it is not ""in between"" freighters and transport ships.2b. an orca's cost is already about 1/2 - 2/3 the cost of a freighter. it is the in between ship you are looking for.3. an orca fully fitted has 128km3 of cargo space. that's going off the old data on the item database here on the site of basic 30k. if the basic cargo space in the game is actually at 80k now that is much more.so even not looking at the corporate hanger and the ore bay, you've already hit your target mark for the amount of cargo the orca can carry. the orca can also carry a bs or two, while we're at it, so yes, the orca is the ship you are looking for.and yes, ""there's already the orca"" is a good argument. just like when people try to ask for t2 shuttles, and we point out that we have frigates and interceptors. when you are asking for a new ship class it needs to fit some sort of nitch or need that we don't already have. otherwise you aren't asking for diversity, but you are asking for murkiness.what you really are asking for is to reduce the cost and skill training of the orca and maybe give it a bit more cargo space. you won't get far just begging to reduce your cost."
10/19/2009,"it's called the orca. yes the orca is a mining support ship but it also costs half the cost of a freighter (so fills the cost gap) and hauls the amount of cargo you're talking about. it's also very good in that role so we don't need another one.also... the skill reqs of a freighter over a transport are negligable. your suggested cost of 60m is laughable, have you looked at the price of transports and freighters?"
10/19/2009,"the only real advantage the orca has over a freighter is a the higher warp speed.ehp is lower, as is cargo - understandably. however, even the align time (with expander in low) is almost as slow as a freighter.with my skills its a mere 2sec according to eft.so if i need to carry 120k, what advantage does the orca really have?"
10/19/2009,"actually, from the stats i'm reading, the orca doesn't have a higher warp speed.however, the orca aligns 2/3 as slowly as a frieghter, so not twice as fast, but almost. the orca also has a lot less mass. the freighter has a lower intertia modifier, which helps the align time in comparison to the orca, but the lower mass of the orca means it can get up to speed faster. the freighters give a bonus to velocity for each level, which means it actually takes more time to get up to 75% to warp than at a lower level. the orca doesn't have that problem.finally, you can fit and rig an orca. you can't fit anything to a freighter, so you have some more freedom there to fit for faster delivery vs. cargo hold size."
10/19/2009,"dretzle, please get the facts right:freighter warp speed 0.75au/sorca warp speed 2.7au/s1.95au/s is a huge difference. if you ask me.about the align time:my alt has 38.5s time to warp with a cargo rigged (t1) and cargo expanded (t2) orca.the same alt in the freighter has 45.2s.45.2s-38.5s=6.7s faster alignment. doh!oh and if you web both of them, they are into warp in less than 2-5s! doh!(team work rocks btw.)"
10/19/2009,"please forgive me. i don't have the eve client on my current machine, so i'm working off of data only available from the database dump, as utilized on eveiverse.com, which is apparently out of date. it showed them both as 1 au/s. edit: i also didn't see the warp speed multiplier stat, but even with that i think my orca warp speed is still off.the item database on this site doesn't even have the warp speed listed, that i could see. but you further helped show the advantages of the orca as a hauler.also, i did forget to mention that advanced spaceship command skill gives a bit of an increase to freighter align time that the orca doesn't have, which allows the freighter to come more in line with the orca for alignment."
10/19/2009,"still want. if the orca is such a great mini freighter, then maybe we can make a compromize? how about we remove all the mining prereqs? i we can do that, then we have a solution and everybody's happy (actually no, i want somehting a bit faster and more agile, but i'm willing to compromize if you are)."
10/19/2009,you arent really crying about less than 30days training time are you?besides it wouldnt make sense. the orca is a 2 roles ship. and the 2nd role requires the mining part.
10/19/2009,"sure.why stop there? i would like to train it when i start the game and for it to be the most agile ship in the game.oh wait, those are called frigates.in other words, we've already made a compromise. it's called the orca. the compromise is you get what you want with a little wonky skill requirements for your purposes. there's a drawback for everything. i could go for the largest freighter in the game (the charon) in one shot by training caldari industrial 5. or i could go for the largest industrial in the game (mammoth and itty v), but have to cross train to caldari if i wanted the largest freighter. i could go straight for a freighter, or have to train a bit differently if i really want an medium freighter/orca.get a freighter or transport ship otherwise. the training difference between an industrial and a freighter isn't huge and between a transport ship and a freighter is teeny."
10/19/2009,"use an orca.now, as per the freighter vs. orca align time argument, an orca aligns faster with base stats, but add in advanced spaceship command v and racial freighter 4 and your freighter align nearly as fast as an orca. of course, when you add in cargo expanders (or i-stabs for align), the gap closes very quickly."

10/19/2009,"wootz! only one problem, some ships only differ because of their unique color (as in the domi and sin) why did they not add like a few globs of mass around the edges to make it at least seem like they tired, ah well. sweet idea though!"
10/19/2009,"i don't see the problem here as the info is still on your overview and scanner. besides, whatever engine you got in your car, it still looks the same as that one with a weaker/stronger engine.for the coloring: imagine 33 standard white trucks next to each other. can you tell which one is from hauler transports co? if they all have an own color scheme, like in rl, then you could tell which one belongs to which company without even looking at the corp info.coloring would also give ship manufacturers the option to watermark their label on the ships (like big fluffy ship productions makes pink thoraxes, <bzzzzzzzzzz>). you can repaint them after assembling for an x amount of isk. when you let your corp do the paining into the corp's default color it would be cheaper.as stated before, this can be done with just 1 byte network traffic that's only transmitted once for each ship. lag? what lag?imo this would add a system to eve where people can distinct themselves from others, which is quite needed if you ask me. i support this, just like all the other 255 times before this one."
10/19/2009,"i actually came up with a good solution that got a lot of support from the forums but failed to pass the csm council. by adding a mere 3 bytes per ship, you could have two separate areas with a wide range of colors. the texture map would only need to have the color areas separated, and could have an unchangeable color as well to prevent the pink or black ships that would result for many players.the resulting color spectrum is visible via the link below. this easy map could be disabled in the escape screen to allow for faster graphic processing for fleet battles, and would add very little to lag. perhaps the current csm could bring this idea up, since there's a different crew this time *nudge*nudge*.color spectrum"
10/19/2009,"customization could be client side, with regular downloads from a seperate server for people with this option turned on which would reduce lag and stress from the main server which would also cause any lag to be client side only, obviously having a colour slider would be easy but then you couldnt have this:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.-t'amber"

10/19/2009,"this wouldn't be very workable because there is no way to ensure that anything 'purchased' from the orca would actually pass to the seller. market transactions 'delete' items from the hangar of the seller and 'recreate' them into the hangar of the buyers in stations. to use current code the orca would have to have proprietary hangars for people to access, this suggestion opens itself up to large numbers of market exploits. the market window would need to indicate that the seller's item is floating in an undetermined point in space, on player x's ship. the sort of transaction you want is probably something that could be handled on a case by case basis between two players that have a modest level of trust between them.i think the direction that is most likely to get a 'bazaar' ship would be some sort of large ship with dock functionality like a station, that can never itself dock and somehow possesses proprietary hangar space for other players."
10/19/2009,"oh, from your explanation it sounds like their doing a deep copy and then deleting the original ... i can see how that would make this difficult.just to be clear. the idea here is that ore is purchased ""by"" the orca.it appears that containers have the concept of owners (really a corp). i was just thinking about how to extend this to the individual items in the container. that would help make this all possible.the portions of code that defines a target from where a market transaction could occur would have to be modified to include jetcans and the orca's hull. (i assume it would have to be generalized into an interface: imarkettransactionsource, imarkettransactiondest or something similiar). that would certainly be some significant changes.sure would make for some interesting capabilities for mining directors though!!"
10/19/2009,"afaik, ownership of specific items is currently handled via what 'location' they are in, a location being a hangar, (assembled) container, (assembled) ship, whatever. only locations have owners, individual items do not. especially not item stacks, which have an id, a typeid, a stacksize (signed 32-bit int, for whatever reason), and a locationid, and nothing else. afaik, this is all the rows that the generic inventory table contains, everything else is fetched via typeid as soon as you e.g. do a showinfo.attaching owner info to item stacks would probably either require a seperate ownership table referencing item ids (sounds like a hackjob?) or messing with the heavily normalized and optimized inventory table itself. especially the latter sounds like a major cluster****, and is probably not going to happen for the same reason bpc/bpo seperation is currently not happening, as mentioned above (well, one of the reasons, anyway).the idea is interesting, but i doubt it's even remotely feasible.edit: for a singleton (not-packaged item), i assume the item being moved is simply a change of it's associated locationid. how movement of stacks is done i do not know. it should be possible to check wether moving a stack from one place to another changes it's itemid, if it does, it's a copy, if it's not, it just had it's location changed. i'm not sure how i'd go about doing this, though."
10/19/2009,"you, good sir, are exactly the sort of person that eve is aimed towards. (despite all the added mechanical help newbies have been getting more recently.) the op, however, is not. eve is admittedly a game that kinda requires an older player to take a newbie by the hand and walk him through the early bits (for most newbies, that is, there are exceptions (*coughinnominatenightmarecough*)), but they've been trying to work on the new player experience with every expansion. i figure you gotta give ccp points for at least trying. dominion will add another two tutorial lines. let's hope eris does good work on those. :dalso, in case this isn't obvious, op not supported."
10/19/2009,"errr no..sorry but alot of us had to start from scratch too, if they did that then they would have to give everyone those extra skill points too..however i do agree ccp need to do something for new players, active people hasnt gone up for a long time, even with the massive advertising. but really that would mean changing the whole mechanics of the game.personally they need to reward more, instead of this feeble bounties etc. they want people to play for longer, but not much good if they cant even get them to stay in the first place.with all the advertising i dont think ccp want this to be just a niche for the few game anymore so you have change ccp..adapt or just stay where you are.."
10/19/2009,"the new ones are seriously much much better looking.the old invuln effect was, for instance, horrible. now it looks very nice."
10/19/2009,you are right about that... but we still mising oval shields :))!ups sorry for reporting... by mistake...
10/19/2009,"i posted something like this a couple of years ago on one of the forums and it seemed to get a general nod. so i have decided to step up and submit something to the council for their opinion on this.backgroundi run a multi national, multi timezone, multi language and multi-dexterity(i.e. some diasabled) corp. now, some of us are very good at typing in english, but for the most part there are varying degress of this. alot of my members also don't have the benefit of using teamspeak or eve voice et al due to a numebr of factors and reasons. we also work in nullsec and lowsec systems. this puts a number of my members at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to being attacked, as they sometimes find it difficult to communicate quickly what it happenning and where they are.so, one thing that might be able to work to give an edge is the ability to trigger a distress call to alert corpmates/alliance members or others in the system that you are under attack and/or need assistance.the concept - setupa player can customise how their distress call works. this can be done at a ship level or a player level (still undecided). essentially there are three options i have thought of:1/corp alert2/system alert3/alliance alertyou also have the option to receive or ignore distress calls based on the three opions above - mechanicsyou are under attack and you want to trigger the distress signal. this can take the form of right clicking on your ship and selecting ""send distress call"" or a hotkey. depending on your preferences and the preferences of others the distress call will be then sent out.other players who have opted to receive the signal will get a dialog box on their screen (similar to the downtime countdown box) informing them of the person who triggered the alert and the system where the alert was triggered. the location of where the distress was triggered will be warp-able and will display on the pilot's overview(but only for those who have opted to receive the signal in the first place). this will allow pilots to move as quickly as possible to their comrades to provide assistance.obviously, there are a number of things that need to be reviewed, such as whether to expand this feature to include blues on your ""likes"" list, whether agressors will have this feature as well, how to avoid people crying wolf, preventing abuse, network and bandwidth overheads, etc. however, considering the wide diversity of players that play eve, i believe this will be a welcome feature for all players, as long as the paramaters and rules of its use are balanced.thoughts, anyone?mj"
10/19/2009,"actually, i like this idea. most of my corporation also doesn't use vent/ts - largely due to language barriers (my german/danish being terrible - of course so's my english) and while we have an advantage of being fairly small and quick to respond to one another in corp chat, a popup alert might be a nice add-on feature, especially when we're in a wh/lowsec running an operation.the details may need to be worked out, but i like the idea.supported."
10/19/2009,i see no harm from this feature.
10/19/2009,certainly worth thinking about.
10/19/2009,"this would make carebears feel safer in low sec, so i want it, it's a desert out there...it's a dangerous option tho, as i will cerntainly enable my system to receive distress calls, and no, i won't be there to help."
10/19/2009,"that's not unlike a modern distress call. you've no way of knowing if the person who intercepts it will be coming to help or hurry your destruction along.i can also see if being used by pirate hunters to lay traps, so ..."
10/19/2009,"indeed! however, the mechanics could allow you to ignore certain types of distress calls, especially if they are not from your own corp/alliance. but otherwise, you could very well be the hero and go and resuce people or get yourself blown up in a trapmj"
10/19/2009,"i agree. make the distress call available to everyone. someone in an opposing corp or alliance should be able to receive the distress beacon, too. so you could be painting a target on yourself, or you could be calling for help.and the possibility of using it to lay bait and traps would be amazing, too. especially if people do it right and have two ships pretending to duke it out when others arrive to join in the killing, then spring the trap."
10/19/2009,"make sure it's off by default, we don't need people spamming public ones in jita."
10/19/2009,"this is just my opinion but i think it should broadcast to the entire system rather than a select few. it's like lighting a flare, anyone who's looking can see it and respond."
10/19/2009,"awesome idea , i totally support this . no docking after aggression at least 10min , maybe more . and ,at least ,we wont spent ammo on station hugging players ."
10/19/2009,"i support this. not so much because of docking games, but in light of dominion sov changes, where most fleet fights will take place on gates.but i'd say doubling the timer is enough."
10/19/2009,15 minute would be better than :dand other thing if someone docked up with global aggression flag would be pay minimum 10 million isk penalty payment to station office. (except low sec)
10/19/2009,"supported, but make it on tranquility this time, not sisi."
10/19/2009,no! never again because of what happened during the super cap event. and having it on tq is definately not the answer.
10/19/2009,"dear ccp, gentle readers,one thing that is puzzling me (and others who's discussed this in my hearing), is why the ship maintenance array (sma) does not have tabbed storage for ships? unlike corp hangers and pos storage bays.whenever you open a heavily loaded corp or alliance-used sma, eve lags for many seconds (up to a minute if your connection is questionable) as it loads the ships and their icons. if the sma were divided into configurable tabs defaulting to such as ""general"", ""restricted"", and even corp-specific and limited tabs, that would significantly reduce the server access load, increase corp/alliance security, and organization. ideally, implementing an audit-log of smas would help as well. it's amazing that containers have such logs, but not smas.so: while doing dominion sov changes, why not make smas a configurable category for corporations, like other storage?discuss.--krum"
10/19/2009,"yeah, this makes no sense to me. maybe ccp is intentionally creating security holes to keep stuff interesting? if so, this goes into the same bin as ""anybody with corp research access can cancel any corp industry job"" - too clever by half. supporting this."
10/19/2009,and while they are changing the sma anyway. it could at least be a bit bigger. its just to small in size.
10/19/2009,why is that?
10/19/2009,"i would like to announce my candidacy for csm.my main platform is about looking for the interests of faction war players, no matter which side they are on. so far csm, in regards to faction war, has been dominated by people motivated more by their personal agendas than game play interests.i dont promise to pull down the dyspro moon from the heaven and hand it to you (symbolically speaking) because i dont believe that is even possible as member of csm. i also dont claim to have knowledge of 0.0 pos warfare or sov. however, what i do know is the faction warfare mechanisms inside out, both high-sec and low-sec and all the issues which lower fw enjoyment. i feel that if ccp is to make corrections to many of the currently flawed mechanisms, i am qualified enough to consult on it. i am also long-term resident of low-sec space and feel that i can also speak on their behalf, whether they are -10.0 or 5.0this is what i offer, it may not sound much but it's something i believe i can deliver instead of making unrealistic promises such as ""i will remove concord"".15000 fw players deserve a voice to csm and here is what i would like to fix if i get into csm:bugs: faction war complexes are riddled with bugs, some which lead to game crashing while others deal with timers and npcs inside the faction war complexes. these must be fixed so people have more enjoyable experience.npc disparity: npcs defending the plexes need to be adjusted somewhat. right now, amarr and gallente plexes can easily be speedtanked by a t1 frigate, while caldari and matar can rely on missile spawn to discourage anyone staying too close to timer. solution here could be some missile armed ship for every faction which makes speed tanking harder, but not entirely impossible.missions: people are returning from 0.0 to farm isk in faction war missions. while low-sec is definetely more populated now, i dont think ccp had this in mind initially. missions need to be scaled back somewhat by removing the option of continuously declining the missions.occupancy: right now occupancy only matters in regards to npc ships inside the complexes. i would like to give small benefits to side which holds occupancy. some solutions here would be reduced repair costs on stations, reduced pos fuel needs and so on.plexing reward: there still is little reason to actually plex if more lucrative opportunities exist (= missions) unless you are a diehard plexer. provided that bugs regarding plexes can be fixed, ccp could try to introduce some nominal rewards, such as loyalty points, for taking to encourage more small gang fighting over them.damar rocarionbrigadier general"
10/19/2009,pervs approves this candidate.
10/19/2009,"i have no doubt that behind the smack in local you are a good guy damar (who doesn't enjoy a bit of good smack talk?). however i find it hard to believe that you could be the voice of all four militias.that said, perhaps you could outline your views on the current imbalance between the minmatar/caldari vs galente/amarr plex npcs."
10/19/2009,why? do you think maybe ankh was? does one have to go through at least three different militias to qualify like ankh did? backstab your former fleeetmates to demonstrate knowledge and experience in all fronts? do you honestly think that damar wants to get elected to persue some kind of personal or pro caldari agenda?or do you just question his capability and knowledge and not his motives? because i am getting a bit of both from your post.
10/19/2009,"first, i didn't bring up ankh and i dont really understand why you did? unless you think that damar should stand on a 'i'm not ankh' platform? i don't think that's what hes doing, but perhaps that's why you will vote for him?second, and to the point, all i know about damar comes from the persona he projects in local and his posting on these forums. neither of these things lead me to believe that he is able or perhaps willing to act in the best interests of militias other then his own.i do however look forward to hearing more from him but it will take more then what hes written in the op to persuade me."
10/19/2009,"as far as i understand, current issue with many people is that offensive gallente/amarr plexes can be speedtanked. this applies to medium and major plexes (if someone has to speed tank a minor plex, he is doing something badly wrong). it is indeed possible to take a major amarr/gallante plex with properly fitted t1 frigate* while matar/caldari requires specially fitted tank (such as enyo/ishkur) or multiple warp outs which i've seen amarrian inties do.now, the best solution in my opinion for a fix would be to simply give missiles to all plexes, either to npcs (many gallente npc ships already shoot defender rockets so why not missiles?) or having the initial spawn in plexes to be mixture of missile and gun batteries (perhaps even a webifier). this would also eliminate initial ewar from plexes if ships carrying it would only spawn after timer is started and perhaps urge more people to attack them. defender would still receive dps bonus from them of course.and yes, killing npcs should be required in all cases for plex to capture which would immediately help in regards to self-running timers.damar rocarionbrigadier general* ab punisher worked for me in gallente majors while i hear vigil works well enough for amarr but i lack personal experience in conquering amarr plexes so this is hearsay."
10/19/2009,damar has had the ear of the amarr militia for some time just as we have had his. he has proven to have a thorough understanding of what is wrong with the current fw system on all sides of the war. as he shares the burning passion that i myself have for this corner of the universe and since i am certain that he can be unbiased when called for he has my vote.
10/19/2009,"sorry. having had much interaction with damar, through his main and the many alts and his best friends the pervs , this statement is quite frankly not credible. his repeated emotional outbursts in local, his vociferous ,real life hatred of his opponents in faction war is out in the open and is quite well known, by even causal observers.i do not believe he could put his emotions aside to deal with faction warfare as a whole without making sure the interests of his self identified faction was paramount. as far as he understands it..... he does understand and doesnt want to give up faction advantage. the problems people have clearly and repeatly expressed which he has dismised are that caldari npc's are overpowered with ecm/missile spam and that this leads to less pvp as people dont want to be perma jammed while fighting. that he has any proposal for npc changes is surprising in that a recent thread he started in warfare and tactics he expressed no such need for any npc changes at all. it was just so much whining by the gallente faction players . in that thread were many suggestions by numrous people much better than this thrown together idea to to appear that he now supports npc changes that he has never in the past.i strongly suggest that this canidate is not in the best interests of faction warfare as a whole and should not be supported as the ""fw"" canidate."
10/19/2009,"bumpedit: i miraculously managed to spell ""bump"" wrong (but i got ""miraculously"" on the first try )"
10/19/2009,"this will be revealed in no. 9.also, isn't it bamp?"
10/19/2009,+1 vote from me.
10/19/2009,hey can you fix neutral remote rep station dockers please =d
10/19/2009,"all these people supposedly running for lowsec, they're just going to end up splitting the vote which benefits no one. really need a primary or two-round voting for this. maybe a stv."
10/19/2009,the only legitimate lowsec candidates are lark and that python guy.most people who live in lowsec have more than one account or are members of tight knit groups that will all vote together.the lowsec vote isn't that badly split.the fact so few player give a **** about lowsec compared to the innumerable hordes of generic highsec bear candidates is the real issue.
10/19/2009,"""that python guy"" is me.just saying."
10/19/2009,no you aren't
10/19/2009,tbh everyone should just vote for alek ;)problem solved.
10/19/2009,this. my platform benefits lots of folks :)
10/19/2009,added some improvements to bookmark management and probing to my wishlist.
10/19/2009,i'm not sure if i can vote for a canadian in good conscience. they do odd things to bacon.
10/19/2009,it is a pain to try and sift thru that mess they call the minutes. be so kind as to link the ones where ccp says which upcoming changes are because of the goonie csm members.
10/19/2009,"so much goon hate...you'd be surprised to know that, certainly this term, the goon delegates were actually pretty decent people and a pleasure to work with. the goons run internal primaries so they usually put forward good candidates. as for who raised what. you can always dig through the minutes (why should someone else do it for you if you're obviously that concerned) or ask the people involved on previous terms."
10/19/2009,"oh mah gawd... i just want to know these 'changes' the goon csm's are responsible for. you want to paint it like the only reason i am asking is because they are goons. that is not the case at all. if the op wants to wear that statement like a badge then link where ccp says these 'said' changes are because of the goon csm's.as they say, proof... or stfuyou will also be happy to know i would gladly vote for a goon before i voted for you."
10/19/2009,@the op. how did you do in the goons internal primary elections?
10/19/2009,they haven't happened yet. i'm running on the assumption that i won't be an 'official' goon candidate as one of our incumbents is running again and so is the guy who narrowly lost last time around. that's why i'm campaigning outside the alliance as well.
10/19/2009,"okay ... so begs the question that if you don't think you are going to be a good enough candidate enough inside your own alliance to get ""officially"" supported - why should the rest of eve outside of goonswarm think you are good enough for ""us""?sorry to sound a bit cynical but thats the downside of being in a big alliance with a ready-made voting block to get their candidates in. since the goons have 1-2 walk-in candidates anyway why should we give them a 3rd?"
10/19/2009,"i do think i'm a good enough candidate however the reality is that i'm unlikely to get official goon support. that has nothing to do with my platform and everything to do with the fact that my alliance recognises that our incumbents have done a good job.you aren't voting in a 3rd goon candidate, you're voting for an independent candidate who happens to be a goon. as i said, i'll represent any playstyle and take forwards any valid issues regardless of my alliance affiliation."
10/19/2009,a goon?how about... no?
10/19/2009,"with respect its easy to say that. but the reality is you have chosen to run with a character with a good ticker and you've personally chosen an eve affilitation that is tied directly to the goons. you obviously like that culture and enjoy the way the goons do things - can you really break free of all that to be a true independent? maybe you can, but i hope you'll appreciate it takes a massive leap of faith for an actual non-goon to trust you not just to vote the goon party line on any issue that comes up.(just as it takes another leap of faith to see non-official goon candidates as anything else beyond simple electorial tactics attempting to split and dilute the non-goon vote.)i'm personally of the opinion that even 2 goon candidates on the council is too many given the relative size of that alliance and overall number of players in eve - so helping to get a 3rd in is quite a poor decision."
10/19/2009,"there isn't a 'goon party line'. if there was then the goon delegates in the previous three csms would have shot down changes to the doomsday and the sov shakeup (as two examples off the top of my head) because the current mechanics benefit us pretty well. the fact remains that they pushed those changes forwards because the csm as a body wants to see the game made better overall and so do i.to be honest i'm not seeing what your issue is here. anything that benefits the 'goon party line' by definition would also benefit other entities in the game that are 'like the goons' (i.e. that own 0.0 space or have large capital fleets or have supercapital construction facilities etc) and many of those entities are hostile to us. off the top of my head i can't think of any changes that could be made to the game as a whole that would solely benefit goons and not also help out people like atlas, tri, sys-k etc.here's the thing. in my professional life i often had to push issues that were opposite to my own interests as a player. in war and daoc i played the game and fought on a particular side and yet i was able to see the validity of issues that the other sides in those games had. i pushed them all forwards regardless of my personal affiliation because the end result was a better game. that's exactly what will happen here."
10/19/2009,"you can't be serious right?first of all, your a goonie. so naturally by default everyone is cautious to vote for you because of your ties. and don't give me that, ""what do you mean?"" crap because in all games that goonies play, the idea is to ruin everyones fun.second of all, you are running around saying that the goonie csm's are the ones responsible for many of the upcoming changes that is coming out in the next expansion. really?? where does it say that? i have asked repeatedly for you to link where these information is but you still wont do it. no one will. i have looked myself and there is no evidence at all from ccp that says anything like this.thirdly you are also saying that darious told the csm's to tell ccp to fix 0.0 and titans. tell captain obvious (darious) that these things have been told to ccp for a long time now.so please, link me where ccp says, ""here is the changes that the goonie csm's had us do."""
10/19/2009,i lolled hard over your totally unbiased post.
10/19/2009,"right because ccp will obviously tolerate the csm being used as a griefing tool ...also generalisations are fun and always correct all of the time.you're looking for the wrong thing. ccp won't say 'goons pushed for this, omber zombie made us do that etc'. the information you'll find is in the meeting minutes. a couple of minutes with the ctrl-f shortcut will show you what the goon members (or any member you happen to be interested in) pushed for and discussed. this is all public information. alternatively you can ask other csm delegates what their experiences of the goon candidates were. bunyip and larkonis have already stated their views in this thread as an example."
10/19/2009,it's fair to factor in his alliance to your decision making - after all it is a decision he has made as to who he is going to associate with in game.on the other hand though having known him for quite a while and recently interviewed him for eve tribune i'm confident he will present a fair view and work for the benefit of eve as a whole.
10/19/2009,"indeed, thanks to zarch for the interview which you can read here."
10/19/2009,"no but being dishonest about his statements just means people who feel the same way as he does will not match him, while people who feel differently will. so while he will gain matches with different-thinking players, he will lose a (supposedly equal) amount of matches with like minded players. a draw.this system isn't about testing someone's competency in ingame related matters, its just a way to chart their position on the eve-political spectrum and match them with people who feel the same way."
10/19/2009,"great work. this is really useful, and if used by all candidates, this would greatly help me make a choice. if some candidates are not bothered to use tools like this, or at least post a good resume on the forum, i am probably not going to end up voting for them. please note that initiative, such as this, is noted as well, and i am more likely to vote for an active csm candidate that puts effort into his campaign, into clearly stating his views, rather then for someone who does not take this proses seriously."
10/19/2009,update:website moved to the correct host. new address is now
10/19/2009,"it's always surprised me that ccp themselves did not come up with a similar system, great work this. you need a few exposure mechanisms though, since the big bulk of voters rarely pokes their heads outside their internal forums, and the eve forum carries limited exposure options in threads outside of the csm and c&p sections really. if all candidates stick their heads in this webapp and the exposure is slapped in the face (so to speak, regular isd articles / in game advert on login / magic sigs for people to use to show their preference / stuf like that) then perhaps it is possible to make the voting patterns a little bit less like ""this is our guy, y'all vote for him, he tells us what to plan for, screw nda""."
10/19/2009,"moved to "" jita park speakers corner ""."
10/19/2009,"this guy isn't that bad.. this sorta people make eve what it is, it's about balance between this and order. half of the attacks on the op are not reasonable.not voting for you because i have another candidate in mind.and btw: all the talk about good an evil is kinda lame."
10/19/2009,maybe because they brought up some issues and ccp laughed at them and they don't want that to be made public.
10/19/2009,you've been asked several times to mail them to me since i'm now part of the csm. when is that going to happen??issler
10/19/2009,"i am confused if your post is suppose to be ironic, and it's a joke, ro you are actually serious. i used to run missions alot. that never happened to me.anyway.. you do not get my vote."
10/19/2009,"csm is not perfect, but it does work. now, if more people would be bothered to vote for the correct candidates, that would greatly improve the situation. why do i think it works? because the issue i proposed for underpowered destroyers made it through. csm does not have to reply to the post, they might well just have a look at it, discuss it, then discuss it with ccp, and see what ccp thinks. now, if csm would make us aware of such doings, that would greatly improve players opinion of it, and there reputation, but that's a different ussue. if you look at the wiki, there is a list of all issues, votes, denied proposals, so on."
10/19/2009,you have all my votesyou won me through your fountain of charisma.
10/19/2009,"not that i don't appreciate your situation, but i won't be voting for you because you got caught."
10/19/2009,unfortunately gents i won't be allowed to run this term as ccp have deemed it 'too soon' much like making jokes about a recently deceased irish pop star.on that note i'll share this little gem i recieved today.what's pink and goes round in circles?stephen gately's suitcase.i'll get my coat.
10/19/2009,"really? too soon?more like pwned.you cheated, you got caught, you got pwned."
10/19/2009,please change your name to 'terrible troll'.
10/19/2009,you never mentioned this whole scandal to me larkonis!please change your name to liaronis trassler
10/19/2009,"you got a couple good points even despite your bad reputation, i will take you into consideration, and compare to other candidates."
10/19/2009,"what did you think was going to happen?you broke the nda and now run around talking about it like its a badge of honor. i mean look at your sig. you cheated.let me say it again to emphasize:you c h e a t e d.seriously, lol at you trying to run for csm again."
10/19/2009,they better let istvaan in this time or i won't have anyone to vote for.
10/19/2009,"funny thing is, i was told i wasn't b&4lyfe. it's quite understandable though, not being allowed to run this time around. the :outrage: from people such as yourself when elected again would probably have made the forums explode costing ccp millions in new servers and bandwidth charges. i've been told to wait a while until the heat dies down.as for the sig? well, you're the only person who's complained so far. i think it's quite clever (and considering shigsy had to carve it onto a potato before scanning it too, they don't have paper in ireland).at least i can have a laugh about my shortcomings and failures. i fouled up, i apologised, i moved on, water under the bridge broski. i did actually have some great plans for improving how the csm operates and giving more power to the people... but then again nothing will ever please pretentious dullards such as yourself. in other threads you seem to have tarred all goons with the same brush despite everyone providing evidence to the contrary. you strike me as a very bitter person or a very good troll. perhaps a lady friend would ease your troubles. there's more to life than nerdraging on eve-o because tri didn't get a representative in last term (your alt maybe?) and cavorting with madam palm and her five lovely daughters while watching some japanimation or whatever the hell they call it these days."
10/19/2009,"excellent judgement call by ccp. to be perfectly honest, you should be banned from ever running again. nda."
10/19/2009,"yes, you can find the minutes from every meeting into related thread."
10/19/2009,"im keeping this list here, i will make wikis later:"
10/19/2009,soo... when are you crackers gonna ask ccp to fix rockets?
10/19/2009,"we did this, like... 2 months ago?and ccp agreed they'd look at rockets again :)"
10/19/2009,"it occurs to me that csm is like a student union.i dont know if it is does already but perhaps if it conducted itself in more a union like manner it might be able to affect change.do csm members have roles or postings to act as channels for different issues.a carebear officer, 0.0, fw, industrial etc.but how is it organised already?"
10/19/2009,"don't think of it as a congress or council. it is an ""elected focus group.""why should you care about how it gets organized?because this focus group is going to be the go to focus group outside of ccp's devs and testers.if you want a ""carebear officer"" vote for a person that sounds like they will push that point of view.csm should be less about ""agendas"" and more about ""background."" and even then it requires a delicate balance between diversity and proportional representation.for example, let's say that eve had exactly 5 different types of players (types a through e). a's make up 50% of the population. b's 20%, c's 15%, d's 15%, and e's 10%. do a's deserve 50% of the csm seats? what if there are only 5 csm seats (i know there are more), should 2.5 of them be filled by a type players?this would probably lead to a panel of a, a, b, c, d. leaving e players entirely unrepresented in this focus group.unfortunately we each just get one vote. instead of being able to say ""i think x, y, z, and w would make for a diverse set of delegates,"" we can only say ""i want t to be in csm."""
10/19/2009,"an elected focus group. well that doesnt sound very interesting.i was spitballing those role ideas, but the idea behind the roles would be to provide channels between players and ccp."
10/19/2009,i would like to nominate king leopold ii of belgium. seems like the kinda leadership eve needs.
10/20/2009,"i updated the op and second post, with some links to updated wiki pages about the csm. read it or die!"

10/20/2009,/signedwant dust to pc! now!
10/20/2009,pc wtf
10/20/2009,"i agree. not because i'm particularly looking forward to dust, but because i think it will fail as a console exclusive and because of how it will tie in on eve, its failure will have a negative impact on all of us.lets face it, the console market is saturated with fps titles, and dust won't offer anything different from more established titles to anyone other than eve gamers. console games are expensive, usually almost twice the price you can get the same title on pc for. that means console gamers are not going to buy 2 fps games when they both seemingly offer the same thing. is dust really going to overhaul halo for the mainstream xbox market? because if it's not better than halo, no one will play it.since it will tie in closely with eve, a lack of players for dust will mean one of two things. either the entire mechanic will fail, which would be disatrous for eve, or, more likely, some large alliance (we all know the most likely candidate) will realise there is a small player base and order all their members to play dust, and they'll exploit the low player base in dust to gain a huge advantage in eve. you could argue that that's the way it's intended to be, but it seems a little unfair that somethign that is not available to all players can have such an impact.if dust was on pc, and ran on an engine that was useable by the majority of eve players (the source engine still looks good, and is very scaleable), and was available at a reasonable price point, i reckon most eve players would buy it. it still needs to be a good game in order to get people playing, which as i said is vital to the game's success and also to the success of the new mechanics in eve. perhaps ccp are just planning to release it as a console exclusive initially, then a few months down the line if player numbers aren't what they need to be, they can port it to pc and release it free to all eve subscribers. a man can dream, can't he?"
10/20/2009,"i came up with this concept, although a bit different, a long time ago. imho, we should be able to train the 'livestock' human trade goods in an academy to work in our ships. it might require a pos module to do, or it could be available at most academy stations or such.the basic idea is that the crew goes through a series of steps, and some of these steps can add to the rp value. for instance, slavers can be taken off of vitoc, or others can be given vitoc, depending on which side of the amarr/minmatar war you're on.once the recruits graduate (which you would have to pay for their education and wait for their education to be completed), you can equip them in new 'crew slots'. frigates wouldn't have any crew slots, destroyers 1, cruisers 2, bcs 4, bs 6, capital 10, for example. once put into place, they add a 1% bonus to that specific area they're trained in (guns, shields, speed, etc).over time, these crews gain education in their field, allowing their bonus to increase up to 3%. the crews can be 'unequipped' and sold, giving a new market area for trained crew. obviously, you'd have to be doing what the crew specializes in (activating a module of the type that corresponds to the crew - gunners/guns, scientists/scanning, engineers/shields (amount repaired), etc).since frigates don't have crew slots, the new players can ease themselves into the idea. a tutorial might open up as soon as you switch ships into your first crew-ready ship to walk you through how it works.this method accomplishes many goals without many hinderances outside of the coding requirements:* makes 'livestock' trade goods valuable, and you might have to feed the crew as well, with other trade goods.* brings a new development to ship customization.* eases new players into the game without overwhelming them.* introduces a time-based element and isk sink.* opens up a new market segment for players to specialize in."
10/20/2009,"i have something similar on a website for our corp over a year old myself. i agree with many of the points raised in this. crews would be a great way to do a lot with leadership/social/corporate management skills and make charisma a slightly more relevant skill. it lets the livestock section of trade goods suddenly become important.i believe that new slots other than rigs should be available, and that the maintenance of crews be implemented into already existing aspects of eve as much as possible. a simple pantry bay to put foodstuffs, spirits, and antibiotics, among others, would suffice, with the amount of material being used out of it dependent on the number of crew slots filled by the player.i think that the observation that this helps missioners more than pvp is relevant. but you have to pay these crews something, so how about this: rather than a drawback like rigs give, crews take a percentage of bounties and mission rewards equal to the percentage bonus that they give. it's not crippling, and in the event that many different bonuses are given by different crew components, an average is used. this means particularly evil micromanagers will keep the crack squads for their weapons rooms or whatever, and rotate greenhorns out as soon as they're trained in order to keep the bonuses low. there's a potential for pilots swapping to uncrewed ships for mission completions, but the bounties themselves would be skimmed for crew performance.i like this for a lot of reasons, and i think that eventually it will happen whether ccp is interested in it or not right now."

10/20/2009,i'll support this sure.but i am concerned that some players may spam the thumbs up/down option to artificially impact the threads relevance.it would be nice if each account was only allowed one support/unsupport per thread.
10/20/2009,shameless bump
10/20/2009,"i agree with the sentiment, but it's not the system at fault, it's the players who aren't using it to begin with that are.with only ~10% voter turnout to date, there's plenty of scope for you to make some friends of your own and vote for somebody else you like instead./ben"
10/20/2009,the only motivation behind calling out an alt is to tailor personal attacks against them. i deprive you of this ammunition.and i find it a little humorous that most of the attacks in this thread stem from sniggerdly and pl. you guys mad?
10/20/2009,we are v. mad because our grand plan to sieze control of the csm has been foiled by this very thread
10/20/2009,posting legion. the posts made by pl are probably as genuine as those made by the op(ridiculously genuine). also hubris's graph is the best. the mazzilliu throne room will be my next csm proposal
10/20/2009,"mazzilliu you do understand your incessant trolling makes the csms as a whole look bad, right? in all seriousness. are you deliberately trying to tarnish the csms already battered public reputation? if so, it just further reinforces the need for reform."
10/20/2009,"it's ok, i have hired an entire legion of poasting mercenaries to whitewash my legacy so history will remember me as the best csm to ever walk this space video game(and also a girl in real life(the best girl)).as for you, you should probably rum for csm and then raise this issue and disband it from the inside. a self destructing csm would be pretty funny"
10/20/2009,"thing is, she's doing it on the assembly hall. we already know the dirty truth. can the opinion people here have of the csm really get any worse?"
10/20/2009,"first, i can never run for csm as i am on active duty.second, the purpose of this thread is not to destroy the csm. to the contrary. the intended purpose of this thread is to bring reform with checks and balances so black sheep incidents like you and larkonis never happen again.doubtful imo. i can only wonder what's going through the heads of the other csms. one thing is for sure. if she really intends to run again for csm 4, she's got a whole lot of explaining to do. this thread isn't going away anytime soon."
10/20/2009,"i dont think the opinion of the csm in the assembly hall was ever positive. everywhere else(ingame, within corps, average eve players like joe the pirate, members of real eve-marica) people seem a bit more chill about it but on eve-o even innocuous posts about the csm itself attract whining about the csm like flies to poop. as such, i am trying to decide whether my fall campaign should be sarah palin themed or obama themed again and which will generate more whining.in before ""it was all fine before mazz ruined everything"" posts"
10/20/2009,"i can see where it would be easy (particularly after some of the csm 3 actions) to become cynical about the csm process. that said i think the solution lies in greater player participation.more and better candidates.holding ccp and the csm accountable for their actions (or inaction).getting the word out in game to all the players that aren't in big alliances or associated with the 0.0 end game that they need to find a candidate to support.i don't have any connections to big alliances or 0.0 politics and represented just those players i just suggested should rally to become involved. i was elected to csm 2 and got nearly 1000 votes in the last election despite rl time conflicts that prevented any real effort for election to csm 3. (and thanks to lark got to be in the csm 3 anyways! )so one thing i posted repeatedly last election was to really look at who you were voting for. i hope that the importance of that suggestions is now particularly clear! in at least two cases folks were elected that made it pretty clear that taking the job seriously wasn't really their focus. and you know what, they acted pretty much like they promised.so please consider being part of the solution to fix the problems you see in the csm. participate! run! or challenge candidates that have shown a lack of character or that have made the primary focus of their campaign the ownership of mammary glands.and get other people to do the same!the csm is only as good as you choose to make it. i'm going to give this a ""thumb"", not so much to throw out the current process but as a call to action for all the pilots of eve to join in making the csm better!issler"
10/20/2009,"you did ruin everything, eve is a much worse place to live after the short reign of mazzulliu. just yesterday i heard a little caldari boy quote, ""mazzilliu killed my mumma, puppa, brudahs and those other things. she stolez my c4ndi too."" so i asked the little boy why she did those things, ""mazzilliu is da debbil, the pur3 eveel that be sh3 makes justece dead cold.""there we have it people, the devil, the tyrant, the witch - mazzilliu. on other news, mazzilliu's reign of terror and suppression is over! *crowd roars*anyway, i'm for disbanding csm. i would like to disband csm because ccp is not correct 100% of the time, and this is one of those times (just look at certificates *lmfao*). i would also like to see csm disbanded because its a clear separation of the classes and we can't have that, it would lead to possible discrimination, for example - mazz is one of those council of sin management delegates, or was! i will never associate with that csmer!yeah i believe i'm drunk, but hey! you have to put up with it yarr"
10/20/2009,what he said.
10/20/2009,"your character dirty wizard has a long posting history in assembly hall, are you seriously saying you made a specific alt to post here while protecting your mains identity? afraid of 'political assassinations'?the problem isn't with the csm, it's with you taking ingame internet spaceship politics way too seriously. whether you like it or not, being flown out to iceland every now and then is a perk of being elected to what is a time consuming and volountary position. there's no actual need for ccp to do this, it's offered as an incentive to stand.personally, i suspect your motives and your behaviour. it seems too much of a coincidence you've singled out goons and pl for reform while trying to hide who you actually are behind an alt created specifically for this very purpose. the only motivation behind using an alt is to mask your own alliance based political affiliations."
10/20/2009,waaaaaaaa why is the csm not giving me the respect i deserve waaaaaaa(this thread owns)
10/20/2009,bring more man just cry on ventrillo. :dpl turning on so ridiculous.
10/20/2009,"i'm all for this, but i see some problems right off the bat. the first is the method of accountability (or rather the lack thereof). once a csm gets their foot in the door, that's that. there is no mechanic for dealing with unruly and misbehaving csms. other than breaking hard and fast nda rules, there is no trigger that throws out these bad apples. no vote to dismiss, no impeach process, no behavioral review panel, nothing.if anything, this thread is the closest thing we've got to such a mechanism. kinda sad if one really takes it all in but it illustrates the point. we need such a tool so these incidents are prevented or dealt with in the future.the second problem is that the csm is mostly a forum thing. issues are here, discussion is here, voting is here. however we don't see any of this ingame. we're almost talking about two separate universes (plural universi?). the eve forums and the eve game.most players ingame are only vaguely aware of the forums existence let alone what a csm is. the forums seem to be looked upon as an outlet for trolls and hatemongers to spew their vitriol. it's hard to dispute that sometimes in full honesty, i do not want to draw the attention of the ingame playerbase to the csm. not in its current state. just look at what they'll see here in assembly hall.if the csm is to garner any sort of greater player awareness, tools and mechanisms will have to be introduced into the game. spreading the csms existence by word of mouth simply isn't enough."
10/20/2009,"top that off with the fact that there pathetic excuse of ""well run for csm then if you don't like it"" is no longer valid.based on the fact that only there stupid excuse of a posse would practicually garuentee the said idiot getting reelected.as i've said... i might be able to make it past the front door... but then i'd be rendered useless every time i shot down an idiot csm... because i'd be out gunned and out numbered.i get that we don't know everything that's going on.i get that there is more to the csm than we know.but that will not excuse the fact that the flagrant behavior on these forums in total lack of respect and trolling by csm itself... with there posse gangs making these boards turn into the coad or worse yet the c&p would effectively make it a total waste of time to bother running for csm.as i would only be a drop in the perverse pond of foolishness... even with ripples... wouldn't do much to change the situation.only ccp would be able to slap them around...even with people who don' entirely like me have already indicated to me they would vote for me... i haven't figure out whether they are joking... or if there serious.and as i've indicated before... i'm not convinced it would amount to a hill of beans when you got that ####### <points at mazz> going on and embarrassing the entire goal and image of csm itself.the whole purpose of the csm is no longer valid... all i see the csm doing is ignoring the bulk of us... sitting there twiddling there thumbs and keeping quite... ex members (reputable or not) are doing more work than the current term.. and even they are apparently embarrassed.maybe i should start dragging people in here... but then they would have no bloody idea what was going on because only less than 10% even give a damn.and in the end they would conclude that participating is nothing short a waste of time short of discussing ideas.maybe its time i move to features and ideas because i'm growing tired of the foul stench that floods these boards.... and i can assure you... it's not coming from (dare i say) my party of participation...there is literally no more point to assembly hall itself or jita park if the csm is in its current form is free to do as they please.why bother discussing and pushing issues if they are likely to ignore you and do there own thing?that alone should make everyone with half a brain rather mad."
10/20/2009,"far from it. i think i'm getting used to you, thus i now understand better how you think. you've grown on me.anyho, due to recent events, i'm considering wether this might not be such a bad idea after all."
10/20/2009,o7 we'll need to chat in game some time...:)
10/20/2009,"i can't support this thread because you are growing on me too drake. i may not agree with some of the specifics you lay down in terms of fixes and tweaks, and at times i feel like you shoot down ideas that you feel frivolous but might be fun, but i know that you love this game. i have a feeling that you would do everything in your power to improve the game to the best of your ability.that being said, you don't choose the fights you can win, you fight the fights that need fighting."
10/20/2009,"it is one thing to disagree with someone with a valid reason.it's an another to do so like a child and troll/insult/mock/ignore/stupidly go forth like a moron.yes i'm agressive that way... but i tend to respect peoples position.for example... i have nothing personal agianst mazz or lark... i do take insult however with the spitting they have done on the very idea of what csm is.. and when they come walking in here with the holier than thou atitude with a track record that shows nothing but trash for what they have to prove for it... that's an entirely different issue.lark violated a real life contractual agreement called a non-disclosure agreement... usually (at least in my knowledge) that results in getting sued/fined/charged criminally for causing damage to a working business... he's damn lucky what ccp did was all they did... they where well within there right to let him have it with everything they got.take the time to read the legalese and you'd be surprised... nda's are no laughing matter... and he took it lightly obviously.mazz... ""miss i got's boobs"" and ""tons of alt's"" with the entirety of the pandemic legion (whom i referr to as the neo-goonswarm now) goes forth in the guise of working for the better of eve... and then pushes a very suspicous ""we need longer terms"" proposal and at 3 to ???-133/200 (obviously a hell of a lot more than 3) it gets passed by csm without hesitation or consideration of public opinion and then pushed on to ccp whom i hope will likely shoot it down for the obvious lack of common sense.... but even then we don't know as ccp tends to keep to itself!the point is not a matter of what the csm does or how. it's who they represent.they excuse there actions for ""then run for office"" when in fact they know that very little to no participation in the game population will result in changing the status quo.so whose the fool now? that would be us... the overall public at the mercy of a bunch of egotistical asshats.that... i wager is far worse than what ever i could come up with!am i mad? yes... i voted... i payed for this game... i plan to use what was given to me to my fullest extent... including my expressing an opinion.the csm has great potential... but there must be some changes to how they do business... or it should be terminated... immediately."
10/20/2009,"i'm curious to see which csm(s) have the moral fiber to bring this issue to the next upcoming meeting:csm 3 meeting 10 - sunday october 25th 16:00granted it's not a week old, but the very nature of this thread and the recent misbehavior of a csm member warrants an exception. to ignore or delay this issue will only cause greater resentment towards the csm process."
10/20/2009,"i agree, their operational processes and practices need revamped. that won't stop idiots from acting like idiots, though. true colors always shine through, whatever their root cause (lack of maturity, inexperience, or just not giving a ****). before you throw the baby out with the bathwater, keep in mind that the worst behavior we've seen from csm delegates has come from a tiny minority of their members. the vast majority have conducted themselves admirably--at least as far as we can tell from their behavior on the forums here and in meeting chat logs. got to give credit where it's due.disagree with you on that one, hence no thumbs up from me for your idea as a whole. one thing that would mitigate asshattery would be for ccp to give players the ability to impeach a csm candidate who acted like a total ****. related to that, the whole csm process needs more participation (i.e., voting, competing for seats, and participating in the csm forums) from the playerbase--ideas for which i've been internally brainstorming about quite a bit recently."
10/20/2009,in response to the termination statement... yes... that was a bit extreme... but you got one major question here... what is the point if there is no check sum system? why bother at all if this is all we are going to get?to implement a checksum requires an unbiased (if you wana call it that) party... unfortunately that means ccp whom moderates anyway... i'm not so sure if they would even go that far.at that rate ccp is better off having a dedicated team to sit here on the forums and just chat things up... not likely to happen... hell the csm will never go away at this rate.don't mean we all cant make a ruckus about it. but you do have valid points none-the-less.
10/20/2009,"i petitioned this and asked all the relevant people and it won't get me banned or anything. i am certified legit.for the cost of one 30 day plex, i will raise any issue in the assembly hall for you. it can even be a really stupid issue. i'll write up a wiki about it, bring it to a meeting, and everything.i'm charging plex since you can't scam with gametime, and it seems like a pretty fair price for anyone to be able to make their mark on eve forever.so hurry up and get it. the threads have to already exist, since the next meeting is so soon. the deadline for purchasing your influence is october 24th.edit: you can also have me leave your name in the csm issue(""this issue was brought to you by xxxx!"") or remain annonymous. your choice"
10/20/2009,except that you can with plex as it's an in game item and the devs have already said that scams involving plex are within the rules. it's only gtc's you're not allowed to scam with.nice try though.
10/20/2009,"clearly this is what we want from our representatives it's nice to see that the csm can act like real politicians from time to time.edit: some csm members i should say, there are and have been a few that aren't on personal powertrips. again strangely like real life politicians"
10/20/2009,"i just might end up charging an entire gtc then, depending on whatever petition answer comes back as to whether i can do this or notdon't be silly, i'm nothing like those dishonest rl scumbags. i'm an honest hardwokring american. a politician you would want to have a beer with. a politician you would trust your family with.anyways real life politicians dont put their prices upfront. i'm more honest like that.supporting myself in this thread(like any honest hardworking real american would)"
10/20/2009,and yet another c&p-sponsored csm living up to his full potential.and you expect ccp and the rest of the community to take you seriously?raising issues for which your real concern is whether or not the price for the gtc was worth it?in a way i'm glad c&p keeps electing these frivolous csms because it just means they have no real representation in the csm.
10/20/2009,"her, actually. didn't you know that mazz is a really hot girl?"
10/20/2009,ah... so the true utter depravity comes out of the csm.how nice to see them lowering themselves to an all new low.how pathetic can you get.
10/20/2009,"just one more reason why csm term limits are an excellent idea, so scumbags like mazzilliu don't return. just because you are a girl playing an internet spaceships game doesn't mean you deserve any kind of special treatment."
10/20/2009,supporting this
10/20/2009,"brilliant, if only because of the amount of hate it will garner from others.i think i need to send you a plex very soon."

10/20/2009,"lets all send gtc's to have this guy support the dead horse pos. and make him list ""this petition brought to you by: name, name, name . . . . . . ."" maybe then ccp will listen to us. ps will send tonight"
10/20/2009,"funny thing, i'm pretty sure you can scam with gtcs too. unless you trade via the secure mechanism, which only allows cash for time transactions, gtc scamming is legit too. the only actual unscammable transaction is character trades, and even then, that only applies to character-for-isk trades. saying you won't scam is fine - i might even be crazy enough to believe it. as the old saying goes, an honest politician is one that stays bought. but saying you can't scam is just wrong. and for what it's worth, i think that this is stupid as well. csms scamming unrelated things(say, tourney slots), i'm cool with, unlike a lot of people. but i'd think that you'd try to hold yourself to a bit higher a standard on actual csm business."
10/20/2009,"finally a politician willing to be totally transparent about true 'politics', and to bring it into the public domain.we should all celebrate mazzilliu for finally bringing this forward.+1 support"
10/20/2009,"damn, you're dumb. mazz is the pl+sot+pets candidate. i hope now you can see why you should biomass yourself."
10/20/2009,"oh damn, i forgot to support."
10/20/2009,"and with this ccp (and other csms) should immediately realize that any issue brought up by mazzilliu as a csm is highly suspect and not a true representation of the eve community as a whole.mazzilliu, it's nice to see that as a csm you are genuinely interested and concerned in improving eve by bringing up issues that matter. this isn't a waste of time at all. good job! keep it up."
10/20/2009,how about you actually do your job properly in the csm and make positive changes. and you're not hot. don't believe these nerds that jerk off to victoria secret magazines.
10/20/2009,"i find mazz incredibly erotic fyi!in fact, i even laminated her picture <33 baby"
10/20/2009,"oh, i think we have a new winner."
10/20/2009,just so i know for your next term...how much isk would your seat at the csm/ccp meeting cost me? flight/hotel/meals/whatever else they provide you included in that.
10/20/2009,"don't be knocking shigsy's campaign sig he made for me.ground floor in a mazz troll thread. i can't believe people are still biting. it's pretty outrageous how stupid and easily trolled you all are. in some ways i am glad i'm not allowed to run (and hence get elected) this term. you people are the biggest bunch of pretentious dullards i've ever seen. i think it's time to apply lark's law to the eve-o community now. it goes something like this:i'm larkonis trassler, signing off, good night."
10/20/2009,lark...once again your missing the point... much like you breaking an nda.it's not about the fact everyone (in your opinion) is falling for a troll.it's the fact mazz is trolling/posting #### in the first place is the problem.you'd think the csm would care about how or who they represent as opposed to inflating ones e-peen.
10/20/2009,it's not like a csm would actually attempt to do something as stupid as the op... oh wai...
10/20/2009,"i personally think that the people who mazz represents are having a good laugh right now. if you don't like it then run this term or rally more support to make sure horrible people like myself and mazz are never elected to the csm again. if you and your peers weren't such a bunch of pretentious, reactionist and easily trolled dullards you'd probably see that the whole process is otherwise going along quite smoothly."
10/20/2009,"i'm wondering two things:a) if this thread is such an obvious troll why hasn't it been locked yet?b) if mazz is such an obvious troll, why hasn't she been banned for it?self-edit: i have a theory, but i like my posting rights enough that i'll refrain from sharing it."
10/20/2009,this thread is boring. lark deepthroats mazz's anal beads.
10/20/2009,so what your saying that its perfectly acceptable to make the csm as a csm... look like a bunch of idiots waving e-peens around at the expense of others?thank you for that revealing bit of insight.
10/20/2009,oh let it rip de...if mazz can get away with that kind of ####... you got perfect grounds for contradicting moderation.
10/20/2009,i'd rather be deepthroating yours maddog but you never post anymore .so the actions of one member reflect upon the whole council do they. i would have thought everyone playing this game was compos mentis enough to realise that everyone on the csm is an individual and not part of a mive hind. i suppose then because i engaged in some insider trading it means all the members of the council are? actually lets not go there...thanks for that revealing bit of insight into your mind drake.edit: snipe. i know you're not supposed to edit them in but i forgot to first time around so it's ok.
10/20/2009,again you missed the point...the csm is a council.. a member of the council represents the csm as a whole to the body of players.if you can't handle that... you have no business being there in the first place.if one breaks an nda or one starts making a mockery.... it starts to give the impression to everyone else that your a bunch of asshats.and until such time you start to reflect otherwise... it's going to stick.politics 101 - guilty by association.shrug it off all you want... this is what started the anti-csm mob back in the days... and now its stronger than ever.furthermore... the csm's inaction in light of this either confirms... or denies said issue.
10/20/2009,"what makes it worse is that none of the (supposed) decent members bother to distance themselves from that sort of behavior, which to me indicates that they either don't care (in which case why should i be convinced they care about anything else?) or that they condone it (which makes them no better than the public asshats - just better at hiding it). either way, their silence on the subject only serves to exacerbate the perception that the entire csm is a joke, and should be deleted at the earliest oppourtunity. i'd rather have no player input than ****ty player input filtered through a bunch of ****wits.edit: i can spell - no really. i are edumacated."
10/20/2009,exactly... eve online may be a game... but when your tasked with the job of molding that game... it's not supposed to be treated like a game or a joke.the trouble with politicians is they end up being in it for themselves and don't give a #### about anyone else.which is why i've started asking the question -what the heck is the point of assembly hall and jita park if all we are going to do is see csm ignore us entirely and do as they please?if that's the case... shut the damn thing down and we can get on with our lives.
10/20/2009,and your vocalness on the subject only serves to exacerbate the perception that the eve community (or at least in this forum) are a bunch of mouth breathing reactionist cretins with a flare for the dramatic.
10/20/2009,"in full honesty if i were in the shoes of the other csms, i would remain publicly silent about this as well. the last thing we need is for the csm body to engage in a civil war on the forums.take note. this is no longer a minor incident or simple harmless trolling. this has become a real and genuine fracture of the csm process. i doubt we'll see any public action from the other csms or ccp anytime soon, but i bet they're discussing it right now behind closed doors.and i have no doubt that once this issue is dealt with by ccp, mazz will reemerge and claim the whole thing was all just an act and on purpose to help promote the need for csm reform."
10/20/2009,"as if you couldn't lower the standard any further.so is there a clause for ""bringing the csm into disrepute""?"
10/20/2009,so it is just like real politics. thanks for the confirmation.
10/20/2009,wrong (respectfully mind you)the csm being silent is the worst thing they can do.all they need to do is step up and clearly and simply say they do not agree nor condone mazz or lark or anyone else's actions for that matter and apologize or at least attempt to come to some sort of level playing field for the community at best.for them to be silent is to keep people guessing... and we all know where that goes.i always tell me members.. if you make me guess.. i always choose the worst... possible.. guess.so don't make me guess because that's the wrong conclusion.the silence or further encouraging of these stupid little games only makes them look even more guilty than before.
10/20/2009,i think the op pretty much confirms that the csm is a complete joke managed by clowns.
10/20/2009,"anyone that is willing to spend the money for a plex or a gtc to have a subject brought to light by a csm will probably make sure that the topic is worth the money. well at least i would hope so as for it being a scam. it very well may be, but as with all of eve that is the chance the customer takes.i sense a fairly dramtic post here myself slade"
10/20/2009,"i hate to break it to you, but lark isn't a csm delegate.``all they need to do'' is apologize every time a random eve player does something that somebody else doesn't like? are you even thinking before you click the poast buttan?"
10/20/2009,he was csm and resigned. it was the resignation and circumstances surrounding it to which drake was referring. (try and keep up with the scandals.)
10/20/2009,"what mazz is doing here is offer a service (or something like that) for eve players, anyone can post a thread on assembly hall you dont get the attention you wanted well build your e-fame like mazz did and you will get the attention you want"
10/20/2009,what do you call a female who sells themselves to perform a service?
10/20/2009,prostitute and wh*re are not gender specific terms.
10/20/2009,politician?
10/20/2009,"hate to break it to you... but you should learn to read before you click that ""poast"" button as you call it.lark was csm and certainly shows an air of currently on csm even if not officially... and anyone with the sense to read would know that.as for the statement about the csm... that's just a suggestion at best.the point is silence is the worst possible move they could make now... even if they where putting on a show of support it would at least be something... positive or negative.even i know no matter of words would make up for it as its way to late... but sitting there on there hands and not doing anything is still a very bad move."
10/20/2009,"first to lark. if you can call any member of the csm a ""politician"", then who exactly do you think they represent. even a president who gets elected by a margin of 1% still represents the other 49% who voted against him. this holds true to any politician.mazz is not only representing those that voted for him, but the scores of others who didn't. i have to agree with drake on this, in that when you are helping to mold a game (that we all pay for mind you) it affects other people playing that game and thus a certain amount of decorum must be maintained.this action is reprehensible because he should be bringing up concerns of the playerbase anyway. what the hell else is his job other than to bring up ways to improve the game from the playerbase?i fail to see this as anything but a slap in the face from a person who is supposed to be helping make our game world a more fun place to be.one man acting alone is one thing and can possibly be shrugged off as a stunt or a joke or god forbid an actuality, but what if a time comes where the only way to get input to the csm is to pay one of them off with a plex? why should we trust them based upon that? why should ccp listen to them? and why should ccp listen to mazz right now if he is willing to do this?"

10/20/2009,supporting this coz i'm down with the clown.
10/20/2009,funny part is that rl politics work exactly the same although the public doesn't realize this.then again ccp will filter out the really stupid issues anyway. iirc they will filter out 90% of the issues anyway.
10/20/2009,one individuals purchased issue on the table means one less relevant issue supported by the playerbase.democracy at it's finest... oh wait
10/20/2009,"as some might know ccp is lowering the skill requirements for exploration by large margin, pretty much making anyone able to quickly skill up:"
10/20/2009,"not sure about the civilian modules, but it's no longer a profession if everyone can do it.a real kick in the nuts ccp."
10/20/2009,"your solution doesn't allow ccp to do their intended thing. the tutorials aren't a reason to do the change and tutorial modules have been in the game for a long time already, so suggesting tutorial modules is obsolete and doesn't address the issue.their intention is to make them actual professions. you know, just like mining, missioning and manufacturing. that means new players must be able to start doing it very quickly and progress with it as their skills grow. they shouldn't be able to do everything, but low entry barriers haven't hurt any of the other professions.as you can see it isn't like being able to get into a hulk, it is like being able to fit miners on your frigate and start scraping an income out of it or flying with your corp on level 4 missions and helping to kill the frigates, target paint the primary, salvage and do some looting. these things are already in the game and are encouraged, so why is this such a problem with your chosen profession?"
10/20/2009,"you train lvl 1 arcaheology/hacking and you have access to most of the content, and level 2 takes what? an hour? 3, less than a day? how long for a hulk again? you can't apply the same methodology because it doesn't have the same scalability."
10/20/2009,"nope, i support ccp in attacking the exploration community. it seems a logical step in creating chaos and therefore i must not support this thread."
10/20/2009,i guess it seems like neccessary to dumb eve enough so it reach levels more accessible to poor development performance but i can't support this approach.
10/20/2009,dude they can start exploration witn noobship and on board scanner and can go from there
10/20/2009,the part about civilian modules was aimed as a wider solution to the coming skill req nerf of hacking/archeology and such. however i've changed the proposal to better reflect what i'm really seeking with the proposal.
10/20/2009,just because its easier to get too... doesn't mean the current mechanics would end up being the best zone to be in for those exploration skills.i don't think it's an issue... veteran players such as our selves would have an edge on them anyway.
10/20/2009,i do not think that making the basic requirements for scanning is a bad thing. however i would very much like to see more depth in the scanning profession.
10/20/2009,"so the proposal is to make exploration a longer skill tree, with lower entry requirements? i like this. not sure if it'll work out to be a reasonable balance when you create the actual skills, but it's the right approach."
10/20/2009,i am all for a richer astrometrics skill tree.
10/20/2009,"ccp is using the exploration ""profession"" as a way of dynamically adding content to eve and will probably be the most important tool used in the upgrading of 0.0 solar systems in dominion. it must be more accessible as more people will be using it. you can't increase the difficulty in finding sites or lower bonuses. that is the opposite of 'accessible.'for more depth, how about adding a skill that allows you to identify a site at weaker signal strengths? each site type (gravimetric, unknown, etc) would have its own skill. professional probers would find the sites they are interested in more quickly and waste less time on other sites."
10/20/2009,explain. it's very easy to add things that don't need to be probed down.

10/20/2009,"eve tv 2.0:i had posted this in general a while back, but feel this is a more appropriate venue for this proposal...the ability to view the alliance tournaments live has been, perhaps, something that we have taken for granted. i personally remember the first time i watched one of the tournaments live  it was very exciting. it has become apparent, however, that this medium of expression is too cost prohibitive for ccp to produce with any sort of frequency. when you think about the amount of bandwidth and server power needed to stream video to thousands of users simultaneously, this is not a huge surprise. what i will propose here is a solution to this problem that will not only be more cost effective, but will also produce a much higher quality result. i will begin with an overview from the users perspective, followed by a more technical analysis.overview:many of us have played rts games that have a replay feature after a match is completed. the camera can be moved by the user to any part of the map, allowing the user to analyze the match second by second. eve tv 2.0 would essentially be an in-game player that would allow you to do the same thing with eve recordings, as well as accepting live feed from eve events. it is important to note that this would be entirely different from a video stream or stored video file. this player would not play video footage, but would render the events to be viewed using the same graphics quality and freedom seen when playing the game. many of the same options available to a pilot in eve space would be available in this player (look at, camera rotation, zoom in/out, etc.), while also adding the features of a standard media player (play, pause, rewind). the feed for this player could come in the form of stored files or a live feed. the graphical quality of the display would be exactly the same as that seen when you play the game. other information could also be provided (i.e. showing when fleet members activate which modules, etc.).a pilot could record a battle they participate in, then go back later and closely analyze the fight from any of its participants view to gain a greater tactical understanding of what the hell actually happened. a fc could use this replay to viciously chastise the noobery that he might otherwise not notice"
10/20/2009,"technical analysis:the product i described previously is, without doubt, ambitious. the part that may surprise you, however, is that once implemented this application would probably take less resources to run than its current counterparts.the first and most basic function of this application is the ability to take data representing a sequence of events in eve, and play it back. luckily, eve already does this. a video stream (the method used to display the tournaments thus far) actually sends your computer data representing every pixel on your screen  essentially sending every video frame to your computer. when you actually play eve, this is not the case. the information on how to graphically render every object in eve is already stored on your computer locally. all the eve server actually sends you is information about the entities in your area. for example, the server might send you data indicating that there is a megathron at coordinate (x,y,z), the entitys name, that it has an armor repairer active, its velocity/acceleration vectors, etc. the rendering of this information to the pretty pixels on your monitor is then handled by your computer locally, as it takes all the given information and produces the image on your screen appropriately. an eve tv 2.0 player would use this same graphics engine that is already in place to produce its image. the only real difference would be the source of the data that is fed to the player. this feed of data could be produced from a stored file or from a live feed from the eve servers. the amount of data needed to represent a sequence of events visually through this method should be far less than that needed to send every pixel through a video stream. this is why the game itself is generated in this way. further, the server power is already in place to send this data for live events. it could even be implemented in a form that prevents extra burden on the servers for live events (i.e. cannot be logged in and have player open, or must be docked to open player). an implementation of this sort would guarantee that a player watching a live event puts no higher a burden on the eve servers than one playing the game (less, since it is just a sequence of data sent that doesnt allow interaction from the player you cant control the ships in the video player). and the server power is always in place for this type of broadcast, so long as eve is online. it does not require temporary allocation of server resources to do a live broadcast.the second function of this player would allow eve players to produce their own files to be played. at this time any eve video you see on youtube, etc. is produced with a third-party video capture program. these programs basically take the display on your monitor and copy it to your hard drive in the form of a video file to be played later. again, this means that every pixel on the screen will need to be stored on the hard drive. the method used to create files to be played in the eve tv 2.0 browser would be much more efficient. these files would store the entity information rather than the visual representation. again, in most cases this would run with better performance than its current counterparts. this would allow it to use less resources when recording than a program like fraps, while also producing a much higher quality result to be played back. obviously the record option would have some sort of on/off switch, so it would not impact game performance at all while off."
10/20/2009,"disclaimer:i have certainly made some assumptions about the underlying workings of eve in this post. most notably, there is a point where this form of video reproduction will begin to cost more resources than a standard video capture. i cannot say what this point is from my limited perspective, but basically at some point the amount of data needed to represent everything around you will exceed a simple, low quality video feed or file. only those familiar with the underlying data structures of eve will be able to make an accurate prediction of the resource cost of such a player compared to a standard media player. that said, even in the cases where the resource cost for eve tv 2.0 would be higher (huge fleet battles maybe?), it would still produce a final product of much higher quality and functionality."

10/20/2009,"um, you know that it was coded by ccp, right?"
10/20/2009,"i didn't mean it as a hackjob database architecture wise, that's the best way i could think of you could probably implement a system like that without messing with the core inventory table. but it's still problematic.if you have ownership for every item, it'll create a huge table. (one entry for every item in eve) if you don't, and in -most- cases still use the location system, you'll have reduncancy, which strikes me as 'unaesthetic' in a massively normalized and high-performance database. either way, each show-info lookup, or any call requiring ownership info will have to involve a join or something of the like of the ownership table, given the item entry and singleton info no longer are enough to tell you everything.i obviously do not have statistics on how many owner-lookups the current eve code generates, and how heavy the db load is in general, but this might potentially create performance issues.who knows."

10/20/2009,"keep it simple, system only, completely public and up on the overview like a cyno field."
10/20/2009,"i support this. but we also need a way to broadcast quickly to corp or alliance chat (or both) a request for help with a link to the system we are in. the link should work like an escalation where if you're not in system, you can use it to set destination (via right-click), and if you are already in system you can warp to it."
10/20/2009,"the only issue i can see with this is people spamming your overview with distress signals.imo the way it should work is that it would be a deployable item with a few minutes of lifespan. when you activate it, you will be required to enter a short text to describe the situation. ie ""help"" or ""hotspot"", thereby securing the name for the beacon in this system. this would be in place so that when someone deploys a beacon, the hostiles couldn't spam the system with beacons of the same name to confuse the enemy.these deployable beacons should cost a fair bit to produce and take a hefty amount of cargo space. ideally they'd sell for about a mil on the market and take 50-100 m3u in cargo."

10/20/2009,not on all stations. certain stations have hilariously large docking range.
10/20/2009,"bump them out of station dock range and have fun. use alts, neutrals whatever... its possible and fun."
10/20/2009,"i don't think the aggro timer needs to change.dock ranges on the other hand need to be looked at, and in some cases reduced considerably.those of you who say 'just bump it', have you ever been to a station with a 35km dock range, try bumping something off that then come back"
10/20/2009,"no.when ccp adds windows to stations, then they can look into modifying ""docking games."""
10/20/2009,supporting my own topic....the core idea here is just an improvement in organization and security for alliances.i don't know about increasing sma space. you get that by anchoring more than one if you really need it. --krum
10/20/2009,hey you're right. he comes across like a carebear with nerdrage.
10/20/2009,also... improving a strong foundation.as the only other lowsec/piracy focused candidate has been myself so i must assume that the foundation you are building on is me. i'm flattered and i didn't know that you cared so much sammich <3.
10/20/2009,"actually, i am a lowsec/piracy focused candidate. i am also a big advocate of cheese, especially the soft varieties."
10/20/2009,"because she was the closest thing fw ever had for a representative in the csm? and i brought her up because you seem to think damar can be possibly worse.val do you also think that damar is doing this for himself? do you think that whatever proposals for fw changes go to ccp will be his own? are you so set in your mind that you would prefer no fw participant in csm instead? you have exchanged noumerous blows and words with damar rocarion - brigadier general in game, maybe you should try shaking hands with the man behind the general. because he is the one to represent us, not his ingame persona. i have flown with damar on many occasions and although i can not claim to know him very well, i can attest to one thing: he is an honourable person. and you just can not put a price to that especially in politics which is what this is all about. i would vote someone just for that.damn alt posting - wallinstar"
10/20/2009,i can't seem to find the thread in c&p people are talking about where he kills mission runners. would someone be so kind to link it?
10/20/2009,"but this does applies to both caldari and gallente plexes. whoever has the aggro will be either ecm'ed (randomly) or damped (always works) and indeed be somewhat unable to do anything. both of these can be bypassed in a way with fof missiles or drones or the plex can be captured anyway with specially fitted ship.if you do solo plexing, of course the ewar in either races plex will gimp your perfomance and if you have npc aggro solo, i doubt anyone would start 1 vs 1 fight in such situation. lets not forget that caldari did conquer all systems and had to deal with npcs and someone always had to be the fall guy for npc aggro and damps. (but of course we killed the rats so eventually everyone was free of ewar).above of course speaks about caldari/gallente plexes. i cannot comment on amarr offensive plexes as i've not captured any. it is perhaps true that caldari npcs are better than some but npcs are nonetheless important factor of faction war so removing all of them would probably be disservice (as it helps new people in pvp and gives outgunned defender some help). i do agree that some tweaks are likely in order for amarr and gallente npcs to put them more on par with matar and caldari. damar rocarionbrigadier general"
10/20/2009,"i doubt you'd want to try this on the live server, but i do have a suggestion for you if you have access to sisi.get an alt into the gallente militia on sisi and try running plexes for the gallente militia on there where it won't affect whats happening on tranquility. you've got a lot of experience with how the plexes work from the caldari point of view, see whether the same tactics and fittings tailored for caldari rats allow you to run those plexes with the same degree of dificulty.for example, was it possible to run gallente medium plexes (and higher) solo by speed tanking in a rat specific hardened t1 frigate? if so, would the same frigate be able to do the same in a caldari plex when the hardeners are switched out to focus on caldari rats instead or would you need a much more specialised ship to do the same task? to what degree does the npc e-war hamper your ability to operate within those plexes when you have to deal with enemy plexers (for this, i speak of your experience in coming into plexes (both offensive and defensive) when gallente are running the plex and often taking several of them down before escaping or driving them out of the plex, could you do the same if the situation was reversed flying into a caldari plex where the rats will be hostile against the same group of player ships flown with the same level of skill?)the problem is, until you do this from an unbiased perspective and publish your findings, people are going to believe that your candidacy will be biased towards making fw better for the caldari alone even if that isn't your intention.for myself, i'm keeping an open mind on this and have not decided whether or not to support you in the election yet."
10/20/2009,"yes. he is personaly invested in his faction 'winning'. his other motivation stated by his most ardent friends , the space pervs who say in public it's "" to get revenge for people who voted for ankh""his only goal appears to be to keep the current fw plexing system as it currently is, because his faction currently dominates that system.he doesnt want to change anything except make other npc rats (gallente/amarr) more difficult. what about changes in the whole plexing system? the only thing i can see from other forums is a notion that increasing the amount of time on plexs and decreasing the amount of plexs will somehow lead to more pvp. does damar endorse this idea still? i personaly couldnt think of a worse one if i tried. i have seen proposals that offensive must kill the spawns to cap plexs......but nothing about a t1 frig 'defending' a major plex. that can't be changed becasue then how would a certain faction defend with their alts? etc, etc.so bottom line, i don't agree with the only proposals he has put forward. they seem self serving to his own interests .it would take a lot for me to be convinced that his 'in game personae' isn't his real face. so i stand by my earlier call that damar is not the person best suited to represent fw to ccp. while he does understan dcurrent mechanics, he just wants them ""fixed"" not overhauled.his ideas are out of synch with the majority of fw players who don't care for the current plex/system occupancy system and he has not demonstrated any impartiality in game or on these forums.edit: bugs in plexs should of course be fixed. but proposing that offensive ships must kill spawn for that bug only raises the question about 'defensive' plexers causing this any ideas on that?..... the whole sentence just demonstrates lack of impartiality."
10/20/2009,"eve is quite complex game and you are talking about details when you should look at big picture.npc is not a problem, it really does not matter what it does if you have reason to kill those and capture that plex, you will do it.we all want more pvp in plexes, but it seems that those who whine about npc does not want to capture those plexes. they just want easy kills. fw should be capturing systems not just easy kills. it has to have bigger goals too.caldari npc may need some balancing but not much. val itself has shown that those can be captured by solo. he can kill enymy in those too, sometimes it goes well somethimes not."
10/20/2009,"i have actually tried tanking caldari plexes with an alt of mine in tq. and usually end result has not been very succesful. interceptor certainly could not speed tank close enough without having to warp out repeatedly (neither could vigil). i've not tried tanking one in t1 punisher, perhaps only t1 frigate which might be able to pull it off. my alt did kill one to medium plex which tanked it quite well but i reckon it wont do it forever unless your fit is completely aimed at tanking the said npcs in which case it's quite useless in pvp.however, what bm says and what battlestar crusader says in other thread raise a good point. people would need more incentive to go to plexes and then discussion about solo capture would probably no longer be necessary. the question is of course how it can be done?damar rocarionbrigadier general"

10/20/2009,"anything i've seen damar doing, he puts whole heart on it. and he has my vote. oh yes he have bad days, being angry and stuff, but isn't he just a human too ;)you should just cut the bull and shut up."
10/20/2009,"so lets see what damar really thinks when it comes to fw...1) ankh said x, whine whine whine!2) fw npcs are perfectly fine!3) plexes are the best thing in fw!4) plex timers should take even longer!5) gallente are evil blobbers, i have to fly around with 9 alts for my casual pvp!summary: everything is fine, don't fix fw!fw people should vote for someone that is actually aware of the problems with fw, instead of someone that just tries to keep his own faction dominant."
10/20/2009,"thanks for linking something that narrowed things a bit. most of what i read was a lot of:csm - ""you need to fix this!""ccp - ""we are already working on that.""csm - ""oh...""it is the equivalent of seeing this:owner of a car tells csm that their car is not working right.""oh really?"" says csm, ""i'll talk to the mechanic that is under the hood.""csm walks over to the car and says to the mechanic, ""hey, you need to fix this car!""the mechanic looks up at csm and says, ""i know, that is why i'm working on it.""csm in frustration says, ""yeah well i was just letting you know.""i did read every word of the minutes you linked by the way.seriously though, so far i think you would be a good csm to be honest. currently the only two things that are keeping me from voting for you is your false statement about the goon csm's and you acting all surprised when people tell you they have a problem with you being a goon.you say early on that people should ignore the fact you are a goon and vote for you, but then later say vote for me because i am a goon and look what these other goon csm's did.i read the interview and it seems you have a very nice background that would be very beneficial to the csm as far as balance to the game goes. just fix those two things and you get my votes unless someone better announces they are running for csm which it doesn't look like it."
10/20/2009,"that's not what i said though. there was a 'lolgoons' post to which i pointed out that goon csms have contributed positively to the game - as borne out by the testimony of the two actual csm delegates who have posted in this thread so it's not a false statement at all. that isn't the same thing as saying vote for me because other people in my alliance have done a good job, it's simply to set the record straight.i'm not at all surprised that people have a problem with a goon, which is why most of my posts in this thread have been to try and put those fears to rest.anyway, thanks for your comments."
10/20/2009,some great questions there! however it will be difficult giving them all a 'rating' to distinguish between different gameplay styles and interests i'm afraid?
10/20/2009,"as i get it those questions currently listed on the site are there for the test only but some of them are perfect examples of how questions shouldn't be formulated because they can yield completely opposite answers depending on how person will interpret them:- tech 1, meta 0 loot should not be dropped by npcs.i'll say ""strongly agree"" if this is supposed to remove mineral income from loot reprocessing to leave it to the miners but i'll answer ""strongly disagree"" if all meta 0 drops are supposed to be replaced with higher meta drops as we don't need to increase mission profitability even higher.- action needs to be taken to remove 0.01 isk order bumping from the game.i'll answer ""strongly agree"" because ""0.01 isk order bumping"" looks stupid and if there will be a replacment mechanics to allow buyers to make their choices based on something other than the price but i'll answer ""strongly disagree"" if this is only aimed against people who are able to ""babysit"" their orders and supposed to nerf their advantage in front of those who logs in and check their orders once a day.- suicide gankers should not receive a full insurance payouti'll answer ""strongly agree"" as it's unbelievable what suicide gankers get insurance but only if condord responce time will get nerfed in same proportion. but i'll answer ""strongly disagree"" if this is a plain nerf to suicide ganking as i believe what suicide ganking was never as ""overpowered"" as some people claim.so final questions should be checked and formulated in the way to disallow different interpretations.and some question ideas:1. point income sources like r64 moons and static complexes were main conflict drivers and their nerfs were wrong.2. core combat model of eve lacks complexity and too simple.3. development of eve should focus on the expanding of existant activities and not on bringing new ones like plantary interaction, incarna or dust.(i know this is dictated by strategic marketing and quite an utopian dream as this isn't something what can be influenced by csm or even probably out of control of most devs but i think it will be useful to know if there are candidates who share similar thoughts)"
10/20/2009,"gripen, i get your complaints, but no simple system deals with them effectively. we're asking simple questions on complex issues, and that will always have flaws. but everyone knows what is meant by these questions, and so the answers are still relevant. if dv wants to give candidates the option of adding a link at the bottom to explain their answers, that might help. i'd prefer it that way, really. but even if that's not how it works, i think it'll be fine."
10/20/2009,"maybe, herschel, but gripen's item 1 is a very far reaching impact factor, in terms of 0.0 affinity and perspective. if properly diversified to put (for lacking of a better description) ""something that makes you want to scream 'epic'"" next to different levels of 0.0 play this is probably the most important question for a 0.0 pvp viewpoint imaginable."
10/20/2009,"gripen, some good points and some over thinking (in my opinion).i rephrased the 0.01 isk issue to ""the minimum trade order increase/decrease should be 2% of the item value."". however, i think you are overthinking the meta 0 question. all it states is to remove the loot, it does not mention replacing it with higher value items or more isk bounties. judge it purely on what it states.basically, if you can only agree to a question if you have to say ""agree, but only if..."" then you do not agree with the statement as is and should select disagree. we will need to evaluate the questions we add carefully (your 0.01 isk explanation was a good one), but ultimately you have to take them at face value.added:herschel, i will not add a specific ""explanation"" link to the candidate data - but i do include the candidate website (as entered on the official eve online candidacy list). candidates can post their explanation on their own website."
10/20/2009,"dierdra how are candidates supposed to get passwords? i was going to evemail you, but your bio said to not bother since it would get lost in the volume.is the best way to just address book you and then wait until we are both on at the same time?also, i would appreciate it if questions weren't too broad. some may want bombs to work in high sec but not the disruption spheres or vice versa (with concord reacting appropriately if used on a bystander). but when grouped, a person can only say yes to both or no to both."
10/20/2009,"more questions:* level 4 missions are not challenging enough, level 5 missions should be available in highsec.* csm candidates should be able to get re-elected indefinately, instead of being bound by a two-term restriction.* poses in wormhole space should be exposed to more danger.* there should be more varied, dynamic pve content instead of just the static missions and exploration sites we have now.* ccp is not doing enough to punish macroers.* players banned from the forums should not be able to run for csm, and get booted if this happens during their term."
10/20/2009,"interview with hallan turrekinterview with zarch aldain of eve-tribunecsm is a focus group. it is important for it to be as diverse and representative of all ""types"" of eve players as possible, so that as many unique points of view can be conveyed to ccp.i am a proud member of the school of applied knowledge, a caldari rookie corporation. i spend lots of time and attention educating the freshmen of sak.in that vein, it would be a privilege to represent rookie corpers, pveers, and anyone that takes on the responsibility of teaching new players the game.things i want to see improved in this game include (but are not limited to):new player experience: primertutorials are fine and all, but it has been my experience that the key tips players need are not communicated. those being (1) right click, (2) left bar of buttons, and (3) the overview. this is far from complete, but i think it would be a start.player vs environment: miningreading through past csm minutes, i keep seeing the topic of ""mining"" come up again and again. i think we all agree that if mining could be made more interactive, that would be better. i have a hulk (i know, who doesn't) and i often feel like i would rather punch myself in the face rather than undock and go get another hold full of ore.i don't have a perfect solution, but i have a few ideas:-reduce the population of asteroids in beacon marked belts.-create new higher yielding ores in probe sites (trade mining time with finding time), this would probably combat macro miners-lock bigger ships out of tutorial systemsrookie corporations: extension programspart of what keeps me in sak is the social atmosphere and being able to help new players to learn the game instead of rage quitting or joining some player corp just to be scammed into a worse situation than they started at (and then being dumped into one of the 2nd generation corporations). what i would like to see is a way to still participate in the corp chat of a character's first rookie corporation. i am not ignoring the obvious potential abuse (people spamming their original rookie corp for new recruits), i just don't have a good solution to that.aggro sharing across fleetsi understand why aggression timers aren't shared among rookie corporations: they are simply too big (and why should a complete stranger in black rise care about what is happening to someone in the citadel?). but i think that the aggression timer should be shared at a bare bones minimum across a fleet. fleeting is the best ways to recruit new people that are going to remain with you.who i am in real lifeoutside of new eden i am a 24 year old california resident. i am a graduate student working towards a masters in computer science (emphasizing security).thank you for reading this.-jonathan ""dawnchaser"" fearn"
10/20/2009,"hello jonathan,as a csm representative during term 2, i am eager to see another npc corp member in the csm, especially with the upcoming taxes to be levied against the npc corps. that being said, you should make a strong platform with specific objectives to achieve, and get the support of the npc corps. you should also let us know who you are, as part of the reason i believe that helped me get elected was my bio.the npe does need work, but the objectives towards mining i believe will not benefit the actual activity. part of the main problem is not mining's profitability, but rather it's boredom. ever since project unholy rage, it seems as if macro groups have abandoned or mostly neglected macro mining for other activities, such as hacking accounts to steal isk and items. in this vein, having belts diminished and moved to exploration sites will only raise the bar on the mining activity, making even less people want to do it.i do agree with the aggro sharing across fleets, but only due to the fact that the tax will soon remove one of our few benefits to remaining in npc corp. npc corps will still have their main advantage and disadvantage in place - no wardecs and no poses, respectively.the rookie extension program i disagree with somewhat. i do think players who leave npc corp might have second thoughts and regrets due to the livelyhood of the conversation there. this is a sticky issue though, and i'm not sure how to solve it. maybe by eliminating the 2nd generation npc corporations and having them return to their original npc corporation, since the effects are essentially the same?best of luck to you, but you need to give us a reason to vote for you. before this thread, i never even knew you existed."
10/20/2009,"i know, my direction is to increase interactivity (for example, i am mining right now while writing this post) to make it less boring.regardless if i am elected or not, i hope my campaign raises issues for the elected delegates to further pursue, i am glad to hear that others appreciate some of them.i would argue that not being able to war dec could be a drawback too. i look at the population of sak, and i sometimes imagine what would happen if the school corporations could alliance up and declare. probably something like a million babies taking on bruce lee, but it is still an interesting thought. this is sort of an extension of the new tax thing. ccp wants us to go to player corporations. that is great, but some of us (in sak anyway, i can't peek into other corp chats) do remain in sak to teach. and others that stay to learn the game and meet people before they start to build the ""wall of employment history.""thank you, unfortunately, i only started posting on the forum recently. i plan to run as much of my campaign actually in new eden. to that effect i have created a public channel called ""soapbox chaser"" for people to ask me questions and otherwise grill me on my opinions and personality. as i said, csm is an elected focus group, and as you said, if i expect people to vote for me, i need to convince them that i can represent their opinion and point of view to ccp."
10/20/2009,"as you deliberately used the term rookie corp, its only fair to pick up on this and ask: what do you think of npc corps being (currently) used as a tax-free safe haven by players who ceased to be 'rookies' long ago? what is your opinion on the 11% tax proposal?"
10/20/2009,"i am glad you ask. also, i don't want anyone to feel like they need a reason to ask me any sort of question.first i will address the forthcoming tax. i think an 11% tax is acceptable, but it is the wrong solution for encouraging people to go to player corporations. to me i have to choose between 11% of a portion of my income vs the value of the social commentary that occurs in sak chat. not to mention an uncertainty of how i will i feel about my new corporation (did i just give up the diversity of sak for a corp made of 2 friends and 30 strangers?).but taxing new players is harmful to retaining new users. yeah the tax only applies to mission/bounty entries over 100k. but bounties are summed if they occur in a near enough time span. for example, 10 12k bounties is 120k, therefore eligible for taxation. i think this 11% tax maybe should apply to characters until some point is reached (such as reaching 60 days of age or leaving their school corp, which ever comes first).don't forget that the 11% tax doesn't apply to sales, and many argue that a lot of the profit from mission running comes from the resulting salvage and loot.----having players move from a player corp to a rookie corp when they leave only makes sense, otherwise they might be dumped into a ""player corp of 1"" which just screams ""grief me."" but that isn't what you are talking about (this is the case of a player in transition).the big problem is that you are talking about an abuse. maybe a high sec pirate that is in a rookie corp and spends the days trying to bait other players (specifically other rookie corp players) into shooting him so he can go get a bigger ship and ruin someone. all the while knowing that after 15 minutes he will be safe from retaliation. if you are asking me how i would address that, perhaps increasing the aggression timer and allowing fleets to share aggro could help. would a rookie corp pirate be as bold if he can't control the number of targets that can shoot back? this can also reduce the profitability of suicide ganking (when the alt tries to loot he gives aggro to the reinforcements).as to players hiding in the 2nd generation corporations. it is important to recognize that not all situations are the same. perhaps the person that leaves for the rookie corp was part of the aggressor corporation, and just doesn't feel the war declaration was justified and wants no part in it. is it wrong to dissociate yourself from a group with an agenda you don't agree with?or perhaps a minority of a targeted corporation provoked the wrath and the resulting war declaration. even after those members are removed (or quit), the war dec may remain for a period.whatever the reason, at some level pvp combat is opt in. and it does need to stay that way. some people just don't want to spend hours waiting to undock until someone leaves. and no amount of baiting can force one player to take advantage of an aggression window, although some may say the act of baiting is a form of pvp.however, i would still argue that being in a rookie corp doesn't make a player safe. suicide ganks still occur and people do salvage other people's missions (including stealing loot from wrecks). just because a person can't just war dec and shoot me doesn't mean they can't engage in pvp against me, they just have to be more inventive.""passive"" pvp may also include:- competing for sci&indy lines (especially for manufacturing at mission hubs)- the market! a.k.a. ""eve price is right"" (17,000? i'll post at 16,999.99)----those that use rookie corporations as war dec shields are going to continue to do that, 11% or none. it would take game changes toe end that."

10/20/2009,"well it's a non-disclosure agreement. although he acted on sensitive information himself, larkonis didn't tell anyone else. so i guess he didn't actually disclose any private information.so is he in breach of a nda?"
10/20/2009,"with serenity's help i know have a way of creating an automated survey, which will make it much easier for y'all to fill it in and create some good ol' fashioned raw data to work with. it's currently in the works, expect it to be done soon (tm)."

10/20/2009,"there are a lot of things like this that i'm learning from doing this survey. i plan to do many more, based on various aspects of how this survey is turning out, and a lot of issues like the one you're bringing to the table will be worked on. the problem with changing the current survey is that it can taint the results of the people who allready took it. so because of that i'll wait with major improvements untill the next survey."
10/20/2009,"here are some innitial results as an appetiser. as more people do the survey the chances of anomalies decrease as the majority vote evens them out, so judge these first impression results carefully.i asked what activities players find the most important (noting that i am not referring to what they spend the most time doing, just what they feel is most important). people have voted as follows, starting at 1 being the most important, and 16 being the least:1 missioning2 ingame socializing3 wormhole exploration4 exploration outside of wormholes5 0.0 sovereignty wars6 mining7 0.0 wars that are not about sovereignty8 market trading9 low sec piracy10 null sec piracy11 factional warfare pvp12 factional warfare plexinga tie at places 13/14 with bounty hunting and factional warfare missions15 suicide ganking in high sec16 scamming other playerswith the first type of pvp gameplay coming in at number 5 with 0.0 sovereignty wars, and players electing missioning and exploration aswell as ingame socializing highest on the list, one could argue that players do seek to interact with other players but prefer to do so with words, not guns. this seems rather unexpected from a game like eve.it may well be that as more people take the survey it changes, so i don't want to set anything in stone quite yet.another part of the survey shows that an overwelming 80% prefers to do their missioning in high security space, thus also avoiding unwanted player interaction.mining also shows this result albeit in a less drastic measure, we see 40% saying they do occationally mine in 0.0. most miners avoid low security space.on the topic of blobs there appears to be another strange result: 40% of people hate blobs, but 28% says to fly in them. and just as 4% wants to keep them arround, another 4% wants to get rid of them, while 44% says to have no opinion of them. people who love blobs make up 8% of those surveyed.on what people feel ccp needs to focus on next the list goes as follows:1st: new shiptypes2nd: missioning3rd: exploration4th: ship ballancing5th: wormholes6th: mining7th: factional warfare mechanics8th: ingame socializing9th: 0.0 sovereignty system as it is in dominion10th: bounty hunting11th: piracy12th: suicide ganking13th: tradingin this list we see also that players seem to prioritise forms of pve over forms of pvp, with missioning, exploration, wormholes and mining all listing high. but new shiptypes is the most demanded of the lot. in future surveys i'll be sure to try and find out what types of ships it is that players seem to be demanding.let me state one more time though that these are not final results. more people are coming in and taking the survey, as should you, especially if you disagree with the outcome. your entry will affect the final outcome!when i am confident that enough people have taken the survey to be relatively sure that the result isn't scewed (which i can currently not be sure of, as the testgroup is yet too small to rule this out) i will then post a copy of the results here on the forum so you can all see the whole thing, and make sure that i haven't changed anything.for now, keep surveying... :)"
10/20/2009,"my highest priority isnt listed on this survey at all and that would be better pos, corporation and alliance management tools. i really feel they should offer more pos services alliance wide."
10/20/2009,"perhaps i should do a survey about the user interface to cover for the lack of mentioning it in the current priority list. the problem with adding it now is that it will give a distorted outcome to the final survey result, as some players will have taken the survey without it, and some with it.you're the first to mention this lacking to me so far, but there may be many others who haven't said anything about it.edit: speaking of user interfaces, i hate how the forum automatically selects one of my alts to post with, which i sometimes forget to rectify, such as now. so for the record, i'm aynen too"
10/20/2009,"what a stupid suggestion. no, of course not. i'm going to counter your wardec by docking up for 3 days. sweet. seriously wondering what the op was thinking."
10/20/2009,yay!!!*kazzzi hugs dierdra*

10/20/2009,"which is why they call it ""council of stellar management"" instead of ""elected focus group.""that isn't to say that those channels couldn't be formed.after the delegates are selected for csm4, i urge everyone to figure out who is for what types of game play and discuss with those players on those topics. add them to your address book. heck, talk to them before the election is held, see who responds and who ignores you."
10/20/2009,"here is how the csm is organized:person with most votes total is the chairman. he is the one who organizes the csm and gives direction. our chairman(diedra vall(sp?)) was excallent, he was the one who did the issue submission to/from ccp and kicked our asses to make sure we got our crap in on time and made sure there was something to show for even if/when we didn't. the chairman can resign if they dont want this extra work and who wins this position is voted upon by the rest of the csm.he sets deadlines for meetings and makes organizational decisions. he also acts as moderator, so to speak, during csm meetingsvice chairman acts as chair if chair is absent during meetings, which hasnt happened yet iirc. thats omber i thinksecretary takes notes and produces meeting minutes and releases the raw logs sans nda stuff. that's meissavice secretary, acts as sec. if the sec. is absent. that's erik(i think?)all positions aside from chairman are voted on by the csm. members volunteer for the positions then we vote for who does it.aside from that, all csm members have equal ability to raise issues and vote yes or no. not even the chairman can flat out decide not to include an issue on the agenda if it follows the rules otherwise(for example you need to follow a template, and the assembly hall thread needs to be at least a week old, stuff like that)"

10/21/2009,"disregarding the story and the fact this probably happens rarely, having character transfers disabled by default and a timer is a great idea regardless. the time delay would be an issue if you wanted to sell a character asap, but it would stop the haxor from logging in a disabling this function straight away, and like stated earlier sometimes the devs cannot answer too quickly so 10days + would be a good idea. as i have traded characters quite a few times i can say this wouldn't cause too many problems. also the mention a couple of posts up about sending a confirmation email to the original owner of character (using the email adress supplied on this account 28 days before the transfer was sanctioned to catch any email changed) with a link from ccp to confirm the sale; this is also a good idea. the time spent making this function would pay off in dev time and player grief later tenfold.-t'amber"
10/21/2009,"i like the idea, and would even say that characters should be locked by default. so if you want to sell em you have to enable it. i would even say that you receive an email once this option is enabled, and the email has to be confirmed before the unlocking takes place. after it has been confirmed a one week period will commence.there should also be an email adress field that you can specify that cant be immediately changed. it would take 2-3 days to change. this would give the victim some time to notify ccp and would also provide ccp with the necessary info to determine if the account was really stolen. account security is everyones responsibility, but you can only do so much to prevent **** from happening."

10/21/2009,the system is less than 18 months old. if you expect it to be perfect right off the bat then you're deluded. as awareness grows and more people become aware of the process and get involved hopefully then you will have your 'check sum'.
10/21/2009,"you will actually find, according to the data ccp recorded from csm voting, that the voting awareness and committment of the player base is dropping rather than increasing, or perhaps is simply stagnant. csm 1 = 10%, 2 = 8%, 3 = 9%"

10/21/2009,the csm is a glorified free trip to iceland club whos only purpose is to spend beer tokens at fanfest. ccp probably still pays for the csm just to troll people in the assembly hall with.

10/21/2009,"i fail to see the point with such a ship. its practically useless. cant even fight, nor mine for that sake..."
10/21/2009,"thusly, the shuttles, the industrials, the freighters, and the rorqual/orca are also practically useless as they are incapable of mining or fighting. it's not there to mine or fight. it's a shuttle, with a jump drive. that's it. that is its purpose - get from one end of the universe to another.obviously someone has never lived in 0.0 in the ass end of the universe where it is 4-5 carrier jumps (+2 in dread, rorq, jf) to empire. about 20m each way. or, its 30+ jumps through various (usually contested) regions of 0.0 into a camped entry point. occasionally one lucks out and finds a wh to empire. not a common occurrence.never mind you must scout each system (if you don't want to be the next pinata km), and then wait a minute (at least, non combat fit) or 5 minutes if combat fit to jump again. this is fine and all, but it takes time.hopefully you have a cyno gen or perhaps you pay 20$/month (or however much isk) for a cyno alt. yes, jump clones alleviate this.... if you need skillbooks, and can use them in the here and now. but what if you can't afford the 24 hour jump delay? sure, you can train something else... but you still need to do it.what if you need to move small cargos? a carrier trip is hardly economical.btw - you can't use cynos in highsec. so yes, in the context of highsec/lowsec, such a ship is indeed useless.it's a jump shuttle, for those poor fools who trained jump drive operation 5 and so on. (of which i am one). it's a pita, but it was worth it otoh. i just think it would be nice to have a smaller craft which makes use of these skills + is useful for transit."
10/21/2009,so what your saying is... anyone who trains jump drive operations v is a poor fool?that's messed up.not supporting noob proposal.
10/21/2009,"logistics are already easy mode with titans portalling, jump bridges jumping, cyno generators generating and regional gates doing the whole i cannot be bubbled thing. jump freighters, rorquals, carriers, haulers that can use cov cynos, good lord you have so many tools to make it easy to get ships and modules into 0.0 ridiculously easy.that's the problem really, you are too used to easy mode logistics in 0.0 you believe you are entitled to one button click instant 30 jumps through 5 regions of 0.0 in a second. no, a thousand times no."
10/21/2009,"no, i don't regret training for carrier or jump fritter. it was a cast iron pain in the ass but ultimately, it was worth it. the point i was trying to express is it is annoying to train jump skills - being forced to get atleast one to lvl5 and two others to 4 for ""baseline"" skills. you may want to check jump ranges before you make silly statements like that. you could span about 3 regions with that sort of range, tops. it has nearly enough fuel, with standard skills, to make it from empire to omist. (this is jumping over 2 regions, 3 jumps)for a jump bridge route to be viable (ignoring fuel use, which is an insane pain) you need to own every 3-8 systems on the route to empire, which still terminates in an entry point system (which is fine and all) but it's hardly the epic logistics tool you make it out to be. titans jump portalling? surely you jest. for an alliance freighter op, okay, sure, it may happen (not that i have seen it). anything outside of a combat situation: no. cyno gens are indeed a revolution and are very very handy for moving caps.all of what you have listed are mass transports. slow, but if something big needs to be moved well you have the tools. btw, those haulers that can use cov cynos need a black ops pilot who actually owns a pinata and moreover has no qualms about using it. plus, it's going to take a long time to get those small haulers to wherever with a 4 ly jump range. and you need cynos for each step of the way because blackops can't bridge to cyno gens (stupid) assuming someone was crazy (read: stupid) enough to put cyno gens at 4 ly intervals. it's a lot of work for a single item that >you< want. btw, 200m3 is enough to carry about 5k rounds of med ammo, or 6 cap booster 800s, or around 6 hours (12 if you use some of the fuel bay) of pos fuel (small pos). or 4 large mods. good for personal logistics (aka a quick hop to empire grab a book or a mod which is not available in 0.0) but not corp or alliance logistics. okay, you can get to 295 with a spander and two small cans. not game breaking.i'd say it would be a perfect use for the opux luxury yacht, but that wouldn't really be fair to voogru.i don't really see what there is to hate about it. it's another tool for people who have jump skills, it's another fragile ship to blow up, and those who live in empire aren't affected. what's your problem? not like big bad shuttle is going to kill you and your way of life. it's like i'm asking for a vaga that has fighters, a dd, the tank of a mothership, the cargo of a freighter, enough range to go from stain to omist in a single jump using 66 topes without a cyno and dread guns while generating isk. it does not make any ship obsolete nor is there any other ship that is remotely similar outside of having a jump drive."
10/21/2009,so you're basically describing a ship that's supposed to be like a jump clone that can haul officer gear and blueprints. i'm not liking it.
10/21/2009,did it occur to you that the fact you need a minimum of level iv jump drive op to fly most jump drive capable ships is to prevent mass pandemic jump drive pilots?your little idea makes it much worse.like it or not... it really is easy to get around... not supporting.
10/21/2009,jump freighters are 5lycarriers 6.5lyyou want longer range then that?1/10 troll for beating me to it.
10/21/2009,"it is generally considered that you are extremely dumb or extremely unlucky to lose a jump capable ship when used correctly (cyno'ing to stations/deathstar poss) the thing to hate is that you bypass 0.0 pipes, entrance points and get nearly risk free logistics into 0.0 which is supposed to be contested and an area for lots of pvp. by adding in jump generators and jump bridges, ccp nerfed pipes to make them completely useless, it used to be that people could harass an empire by attacking their logistic pipes, but now they can jump everything they need without a sweat.attacking an alliances logistics is a different, interesting way to fight big alliances and you do not require huge blob to do it. easy mode logistics nerfs an entire style of play, and what is worse it is one of the few that is great for small fleets and doesn't require blobbing.you are in atlas, you live in detorid/insmother/wicked creek area. you are one jump from an npc region that is easy to jump from a low/high sec area. you already have easy mode logistics. claimable 0.0 is for alliances that work together, not so you can solo jump in modules/ammo whenever you feel like it for very little effort/risk and bypass having to secure logistic pipes or actually going out and doing work and securing space.i don't understand why you cannot use your corporation/alliance resources to move up 200-300m3 to your alliances space, corps with far less do much more. that's how it should be, having to rely on friends and cooperation to get into 0.0."
10/21/2009,"what are you on about? it needs jump pre-reqs to fly (as noted in first post).seems to me that you have more problems with 0.0 logistics in general than this. jump ships already do all of what you are unhappy with (being easy to get into 0.0). ranting here won't fix any of that. (implying that it needs to be fixed, which it doesn't)btw - we also have and use omist (though not for much longer, probably). @some deathstar pos: cloaked hic w/ cyno -> jf jumps in -> bubble + cyno -> insured dread jumps in -> jf dies, hic dies, wreck popped, dread self destructs -> nync'ed. @station: cyno goes up -> recon pops another cyno -> you jump in to the company of 15 dreads. you die.which is what you get for not scouting. as proposed, this is even more vulnerable to this trap because the recon in question is free to tackle you and something comes to blast you. jump bridges are easily campable with stealth bombers (small guns have 250mm scan res and scramble batteries absurdly low scan res) so you have a good 10 or so seconds before you start getting shot at. there's no time to assess the situation beforehand, you just die. and frankly i'm not too bothered by this.not to say that this would be any different, but moving about 0.0 isn't nearly as safe as you make it seem. if this could go from jita to 0.0 in a single bound (it can't) then i might be inclined to agree. but you still have to get through however much highsec before you can get to a point where you can jump to 0.0. meanwhile you're just as vulnerable (more vulnerable really) to wardecs.the problem is getting said 200m3 from wherever (assuming you already own it) to a point where an atlas pilot will pick it up. (alts, okay, but courier contracts are very unreliable). empire runs are few and far between during wardecs. i could just as easily hop down my own carrier but then i'm wasting 20-40m of fuel (counting round trip) nevermind some cyno alt's time.it's a cruiser, with a jump drive. it jumps small amounts of cargo. it has a longer jump range than a carrier (3 ly at jdc 4), but in all other aspects it is inferior. it's several times more vulnerable than a carrier as it has about 5k ehp and thus if it gets caught it will die. no logoffski here. a carrier can jump faster, carry much more ly worth of fuel, nevermind cargo and ships. i don't see how this makes anything easy mode. if anything it's more dangerous to use than my carrier for jumping stuff. it's more economical on fuel use, but that is it. the greater jump range is frankly useless as cyno beacons will continue to be placed at ranges that make sense for dreads and carriers. so, again, what's your problem? it's not obsoleting a playstyle by any means. nor does it make logistics easier or safer. it's about 9 times as expensive as a carrier jump is, per m3, assuming both are fully loaded. at 200m3, the carrier costs 19500 per m3 and the shuttles 3600 per m3. it becomes cheaper to use the carrier at 400m3, because the shuttle must make 3 jumps as opposed to the carrier still only needing one. at 5 m3, the carrier is 780000 isk/m3 while the shuttle is at 144000. this is assuming jdc 4, and the max jump range for each ship.edit: quote fail"
10/21/2009,ok this is a bit different i know but what about a jump shuttle with no cargo just a fuel bay and can only be used if your corp/alliance has sov in the area you heading to why would you use this to get around your space fast if you need to probably stupid but just a thought.

10/21/2009,"although an interesting idea, on most mining ops that i've ever seen or organized it's always more advantageous to be paying the miners based on participation, not which roids are close to them.a good mining outfit would be striping everything in sight, otherwise everyone will be grinding on the same high value rocks, thus wasting cycles. every cycle should be on adding to the aggregate haul for the organization."
10/21/2009,"a mobile store (ship) would be interesting but also hard to implement. perhaps make a pos mod which can have stuff put into it which can be then put on market? problem then is delivery (delivery probes lol?)otoh, poses would need to be completely renovated before i'd want the devs to even consider putting time on this sort of thing. there was a good thread in features/ideas discussion about this."

10/21/2009,"greetings,i have been playing this game since 2003. i recall fondly the perception of 0.0 space when it appeared largely empty and void of life. today, 0.0 space is controlled by conglomerates and afk entities. dominion promises to break up these monopolies and once again restore 0.0 to a chaotic and unfettered state. i propose we take this one step further.with the addition of wormholes to the game, a unique game mechanic has been introduced where local chat does not show other pilots in system. i propose ccp add this same mechanic to all of 0.0 space. make no mistake, this would dramatically change the dynamics of every day life in 0.0. however, since dominion is going to allow for system upgrades, i would imagine an upgrade could be made available that would restore the intel provided in local to it's current state; showing the size of fleets and pilots in system for all parties. this ""intel"" upgrade would only effect systems where sov markers were in place and the upgrade was added. in addition to greater intel within home systems, the result would create pockets of uncontested 0.0 space where no info could be gleaned from local, similar to how wormholes currently work.this would have several effects...first, it may provide the needed security blanket for industrial players to leave empire space and begin making their way into deep 0.0 space. i believe this is one of the major motivations behind dominion to begin with.second, it would also place greater emphasis on probing abilities. attacking fleets would need skill in locating targets otherwise hidden because local would not indicate their presence. third, combat encounters would actually increase as ambush parties could lie in wait without fear that local would give their presence away.fourth, holding sov, using jump bridges and cap ships would be even more valuable as pilots could no longer rely on a scout or two to avoid confrontation.fifth, this change would further immerse players into the ""wild"" that is 0.0 space. unlike empire where communication devices and transmitters would theoretically be used by npc factions to show players in local, 0.0 is supposed to be void of their influence. instead, this encourages players to assume the mantle of protectorate and sovereign overload. in conclusion, this proposal is designed to accomplish the combined goals of greater security for the sovereign empire (by showing pilots in local), while increasing the likelihood of 0.0 encounters throughout unclaimed space (not showing pilots in local). please join me in supporting this initiative, and make 0.0 wild once again.thank you,janos vaasdirector, arkons of myth"
10/21/2009,this is a new and promising concept that nobody has ever thought of before.edit: it's a tough life having four heads

10/21/2009,it's a lovely idea. what a shame it will be shouted down by those who's alliances rely on macro/sweatshop isk farmer alliances paying rent.

10/21/2009,no local in 0.0 without another intel tool has been discussed and...denied
10/21/2009,good thing another intel tool was proposed then.
10/21/2009,i must have missed the part thats going to make 0.0 ratting or mining 4x as profitable as now to even warrant coming out of the high-sec mission cribs.
10/21/2009,"or maybe i didnt and this is just another thinly veiled ""i want to gank ratters and have people laud my pvp prowess"" post. i just dont know."
10/21/2009,"if not doing missions in high sec isn't enough motivation already, nothing ever will be. i wouldn't go back into empire and run missions for a living if it was 50x as much isk. if ""isk/hr"" is really your primary motivation, maybe empire is best for you?"
10/21/2009,not a bad idea.
10/21/2009,"i agree that there is a problem with the current system reguarding salvaging.im very new to eve, and have worked my way upto level 4 missions, and do still find missions time consuming and difficult, i do not earn the 20+ mills an hour mentioned.i stopped doing them, and logging into eve, due to the frustration cause by ninja salvaging.i understand salvaging is a new feature, but with it came ninjas, these ninjas, tend to enter missions well before i can clear the npcs, 9/10 they follow the npc im currently trying to kill, and salvage it as soon the npc goes pop.i did try to run missions with a friend who had fitted a t2 salvage harbinger, but even thats not quick enough.i dont have a problem with salvaging, just the ease and speed that the salvagers are free to work at.if i can be bothered to log in and do a mission, i tend to blow the wrecks up straight away, but this hurts me more that the ninjas.im not ready for low/null sec, getting a ship popped is expensive, and mining, id rather not log in at all.1 runner less for the ninjas i guess."
10/21/2009,"all those mission rat frigates, cruisers and battleships aren't warships?"
10/21/2009,"these are the best ones to get.if you have backup, you always know they won't have anyone else coming to help them."
10/21/2009,"a lot of them no.for salvage purposes 'warship' is a flagged naval vessel of a sovreign power.angels, guristas etc. etc. etc. are not warships. they're just criminals with guns flying spaceships.were we to use true salvage rules than only naval ships (amarr navy, etc.) would be 'warships'. and even they can be salvaged under certain circumstances, usually by contract with the owning government."
10/21/2009,"i see it this way, wrecks belong to the person who got killed. in the case of missioning, they belong to the npc, and since they are already flashy red to them, its fair game. the loot from these wrecks imo belong to the npc aswell, but to balance it out and prevent your tears form sustaining those noble ninja salvagers, you are rewarded with the loot that is inside of the ship.or you can employ a salvager to clean up for you. best defense against a ninja salvager is someone setup to do the same thing and doesnt have to probe. just let there reward be the bounty on missions and when there is no bounty, you pay them for there time."
10/21/2009,mission in a less crowded system...
10/21/2009,"tryed that 3 times.. either lose quality or go into null sec, it doesnt matter where you mission nor how meny people are in local, ninjas are everywhere.empire miners have a harder time than the ninjas, at least the npcs cause agro when they try to strip there belts."
10/21/2009,"fair points, which is why there should be an option to ignore distress signals for systems...personally, imvho, i am in two minds about a system wide distress call for exactly that reason. could you imagine the scene in jita, not to mention the extra bandwidth and system load that could ensue... the way to eliminate that is to have it set simply for someone's corp or alliance. but that still leaves the npc corps (obviously still some things to sort out)...at first i didnt like your idea about charging for the beacons, but now that i have had thought more about it, i can see your point and it makes sense... a deterrant to keep down spam is to charge for the priviledge... so about a mil to buy install a distress beacon sounds like a good approach... although i dont think it should take up cargo hold space. it should simply be ""installed"" when one is used up. and furthermore, i dont believe it should take a slot. it should be a standard item in every ship.mj"

10/21/2009,"why not just move all of the lvl 4 agents to low sec, so carebears could defend their salvage if they wanted to, and ninjas could keep going with their business? :p another idea is to put limits on how many missions the lazy, comfort-loving high sec agents would give each day. that might make some of the players go to low sec as well.one more apporach, would be to introduce some specific to mission running profesion leadership skills and modules which would make a carebear gang less vulnerable to pirate attack; assuming missions take place in low sec and mission runners are inside a deadspace (in a similar way as microwarpdrive doesn't work in such a location)."
10/21/2009,because they would go to level 3's instead.and limiting them would be no different then doubling the security penalty for killing players in low-sec.stop thinking lopsided and start thinking balanced.neither can live without the other... alienating the other is going to kill the game.this isn't hello kitty online... nor is it pvp online... its eve online.unique... and requires all types to keep it going.
10/21/2009,"i'll preface this by saying, ccp would have to offer a 1 time opportunity to change races.now that ccp has removed any need to choose a race to delegate attribute points, there really is little reason to dedicate to one race short of specing everything to level 5.race has seldom ment anything in this game, and removing attribute characteristics has pushed us further from that road.so what i'm thinking is a specific line of either skills or bonuses related to race. these skills would encourage you to stay within your own race rather than branch off so easily. it would add another element of tradeoff choosing to stay within race, or using skills outside. obviously, these bonuses can't be severe or else everyone would be up in arms about one race getting the biggest benefit. so what could potentially work?maybe it's a skill that gives 2% boost to racial ship effectiveness.maybe is a bonus to racial warfare styles such as ecm, target painting, webs, drones, etc.maybe it's a racial agility boost, speed boost, range boost, etc.i think the options are limitless. and with such a small boost, it shouldn't skew the balance of power.originally i was considering making this a line of skills for each ship class, but it doesn't seem practical. so i think it would better be handled with drugs, or implants, or just racial awareness.it just seems unusual for so many caldari pilots to fly gallente ships, and surely, we cannot continue these atrocities."
10/21/2009,"something like a 1% bonus to all racial ship bonuses, for your race.note: role specific bonuses should not be affected, nor should the t2 skill bonuses.take for example the rifter, with minmatar frigate v:non minmatar - 25% bonus to small projectile turret damage and 37.5% bonus to tracking per level.minmatar - 25.25% bonus to small projectile turret damage and 37.875% bonus to tracking per level.or the golem, with caldari battleship v:non caldari - caldari battleship skill bonus: 50% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo velocity and 25% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo explosion velocity per levelcaldari - caldari battleship skill bonus: 50.5% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo velocity and 25.25% bonus to cruise missile and torpedo explosion velocity per levelthis would also make pirate ships more interesting.for example, the bhaalgorn with both amarr and minmatar battleship skills at vcaldari and gallenteamarr battleship: +75% to large neut/nos amount per level, minmatar battleship: +100% to range of stasis webifiers per levelminmatar - amarr battleship: +75% to large neut/nos amount per level, minmatar battleship: +101% to range of stasis webifiers per levelamarr - amarr battleship: +75.75% to large neut/nos amount per level, minmatar battleship: +100% to range of stasis webifiers per level"
10/21/2009,"uhhh no. with that amount, no one would be using his racial ship for sure. but if you take it to 10% or maybe even 20 or 25% then yeah...maybe."
10/21/2009,"then noone will use non-racial ships.no, however neat this idea may seem to be, i like the way eve is unrestricted. race is determined by your birth, so you cannot possibly change race, if you where born (let's say) british, you may speak a different language, you may live in a different country, but that noes not change your race."
10/21/2009,no.
10/21/2009,"no.as much as i would have liked them to keep differences in stats, i can see why they removed them. as long as one of them was even one point or percent more efficient than the others others, it was adviced in every guide new players were offered. it was causing severe population imbalance between races and the obvious solution to balance things, was to make race a meaningless choice.your ""solution"" would discourage crosstraining, but it isn't a bad thing and such bonuses would just be silly. there really isn't any need to create such differences between races. roleplayers create their own persons and the ability to chooce stats should suffice for them. most players seem to be happy with the current situation, there is no reason to implement this and it could create new unforseen problems, so why would ccp even consider this?"
10/21/2009,"atm, t1 mining ship bpo's are extreme expencive,( roughly between 1 - 2.5 bil ) , npc market.retriever , 1 bilcovetor 2.5 bilthere commen used, entery level ships, cruiser / battlecruiser""class"" in size / skill level.align the price to there level."

10/21/2009,lucky to find them on market? head to outer ring - plenty for sale. and i really fail to see how a bpo that has always been expensive remaining expensive counts as lining anyone's pockets. no to the op as well. the ships are cheap and abundant. industrialists who don't have the cash for that can build cruisers and battlecruisers instead.

10/21/2009,ok hersel i'll play your game. as its 24 jumps there and back through null sec to get to 4c-b7x how much cheaper than 2.5 billion is a covetor bpo?. in the real world as ccp likes to equate eve to a covetor bpo would have to be around 600 million to be worth the risk considering gates can be bubbled. please let me know cause if you dont know then your full of it mate.
10/21/2009,i think its npc price is 2bil. your options are pretty much these: 1. get it yourself in a covop and try to sneak it out. 2. pay a someone to sneak it out or to jump it out. 3. pay the market premium for delivery to high-sec.
10/21/2009,"^^ this, the npc price is 2 bil.considering the ""user"" level of this ship, it is absurd high,i don't mind getting it out of 0.0 ,you can get a orca bpo ( capital ) for less.its a part of the game, if you want to do something, like..building a ship, you need to do some efford or spend iskto get to it.the ""problem"" is that, it has a odd price.i don't give a rats ass about politics, to be fair.. thinkits overrated :)when i first noticed it, i actually thought it was a bug, *still think it is*"
10/21/2009,yes let's make sure all the people who actually went there and bought the bpo's at the original price wasted craptons of money.the problem with this is that you can't go changing such an expensive product without currently afflicting a huge number of people.if you really want to get your hands on a bpo in a market which is mostly dominated anyway is either take the chance and fly there in a cov ops or join a corp who claims the ore stations.

10/21/2009,"my first thought is ""gtfo with a shield boost bonus on the jag"". but the rest of the post makes sense.while you hit on a lot of the points in which specific afs suffer, that is an insane boost you are giving them, more slots for more tanking/ewar/tackling as well as a +50% dps increase in a lot of these ships. i can imagine that ishkur with 5x medium drones killing any t1 cruiser in the game. i don't think with these changes afs will crush and obsolete t1 cruisers, but it is something to look at in testing.mainly i don't agree with your original statements into why afs are broken t2 ships are generally poor value for the money, sure some t2 ships can do unique things but are still very expensive. as a ""heavy tackler"" they are certainly not outdone by t1 frigs or ab ceptors with a plate. an ab ceptor with a plate, wtf who flies that? i guarantee you that the ishkur is many times better than a plated ab taranis (or god even a t1 frigate, have you flown t1 frigates lately?) in the heavy tackle role. and by heavy tackle i mean you don't need fast lock speed, just lots of ehp/tank and tackle and in that role the ishkur soundly squashes the ab plated taranis (which anyone caught dead flying would probably be laughed at on the killboards) and insanely squashes a t1 frigate.but i've read the this thread a few times and comparing it to other ships ingame and like the idea of a mini-deimos in the enyo (400 dps on light guns omfg) and the other changes seem okay like the hawk sounds cool and 4 rockets on the vengeance is definitely needed. i'm supporting this thread and unlike herschel yamamoto, i have actually been keeping up on afs and know that ccp has scrapped the af ab speed role bonus and is back at the drawing board. mini-hacs for the win *doctor evil cackle* also giving you bonus points for effort."

10/21/2009,"the current mechanism is flawed. i believe ankh was talking about need for fw rewards and this is what we got. pervs and some others said that system was broken the moment it was annnounced yet it came along anyway. i really wonder how come people required weeks to understand how to farm them.we did the missions before the changes anyway, mostly to have an objective for roaming gang. now there really is no need. we were given the key to bank vault so should we not use it?the mechanism should not allow continuous declining of missions. this makes it possible to essentially have an assembly line for lp like caldari have and i reckon gallente have as well in nennamaila area.as said in other thread, make declining not possible (except the one in 4h) but if mission fails, dont give standing hit. this would reduce the functionality of ""assembly line"". it might also bring more roaming fw missioner gangs (like we had) to low-sec instead of current soloing/alt tanker setups which rarely pvp.damar rocarionbrigadier general"

10/21/2009,"yeah, it's a computer game. i hear nothing but whining from you on most of your fw posts, before you got elected to your benevolent position. we will just have to disagree that your a spammy twit or someone who actually cares about the balancing of mechanics of fw. mob consensus points to the first...."

10/21/2009,candidates can mark a specific number of questions as 'important'. this is weighed when calculating a user's fidelity with that candidate. it is also displayed in the results.letting people sort 30 questions from most important to least important is not going to happen though.

10/22/2009,"for better than five years, players screamed incessantly for a skill queue, and ccp said we weren't going to get one because swapping skills ""makes us play more often"". csm gets elected, makes an issue out of it, we get a queue in the next expansion. even if they never did anything else ever again, they earned themselves a hundred free trips to iceland with that one."
10/22/2009,the real question is did the skill queue come about because the csms pushed it? or was it already on it's way and the csms simply took credit for it?sort of a chicken and the egg question.supported.
10/22/2009,"leave it to somebody who doesn't know about the csm to trash the csm. i went through a term, and it wasn't a picnic. i spent between 8 and 15 hours a week just on csm stuff, not including playing the game itself. in exchange for six months of this, i did get flown to ccp hq and fanfest, but it was for meetings and representation of the devs/players.i'll admit that some members, even in my own term, acted in ways that i find repulsive and warranting a ban. however, the csm as a whole is a devoted group of players who earnestly want to make the game better. arguing without knowledge is the height of arrogancy.if you can't take off your black glasses, there's nothing more that can be said about this thread other than 'troll'."
10/22/2009,"for better than five years, ccp was a broken record with the same stupid explanation, and they certainly sounded like they believed it. the csm as an actual elected body with several thousand votes behind them, got listened to in a way that a string of random forum whiners simply never would be. you can ignore eve general or f+i threads far more easily than you can ignore an issue where the carebears, alliance leaders, pirates, industrialists, and general crazy folk all agree unanimously. the latter seems to have been enough to make ccp realize that we meant it, and it wasn't just a few disaffected folks. of course, this thread is at least 80% trolling anyways, so i don't expect i'll convince you. but hopefully someone else reading this thread will take note."
10/22/2009,"the problem is that the csm isn't an entity itself. as always, it's the people who actually take action, not the group designation.there's no use in worshipping a group for what it did, when the original members who took action aren't even in it anymore."
10/22/2009,"one flaw in your argument.set up a forum, provide a ""support this topic"" button. provide protocol to recognise items with 1000 or more support, ccp has a viable solution, cost free and argument free.you can worship csm all you want but at the end of each day it is but a face. it's ccp's idea of how to get the players involved, to make a fantasy landscape where they can say the players are in control but truthfully aren't.why do this?it looks good. it brings in new players, despite that they don't know about it. it strengthens the community. take your pick, there are probably a few hundred theories supporting community based voting systems strengthening the community, that's all it is.at the end of each day, each subscription period, do you think to yourself, ""omg this game blows, if it had a skill queue i'd keep playing""? i'll answer for you, no. the games development has continued with remarkable progress and not through players ideas. the game keeps expanding and attracting further players."
10/22/2009,op is a crying little babby
10/22/2009,"this is correct, though you only took the logic halfway. by the same reasoning that it's inapropriate to ""worship"" a group for what it did because the members change, it's also inapropriate to condem the group for the same reason. the logic can't work only one way. you are correct that it's the individual csms that make a difference. each will leave their own mark on the group and the process. some leave their mark as actual civil servants - doing thier best to help the game and the players. some are more like pop stars or teenagers with spray-paint cans - the only mark they care about is their name in lights or putting thier gang-sign on the wall. some leave a mark like a stray dog on a random fence post. as long as they stink up the place on the way out they are happy. if we, the ""public"", want percieved problems with the csm solved we need to vote in candidates that think the same."

10/22/2009,"i first tried eve two or three years ago. back when you started with the 800k sps through a career path. no neural remaps yet, at the time, but it was after ccp introduced bloodlines. so, you had a bunch of achura monk characters who min-maxed into the 5-charisma builds. i tried it with a friend of mine, who was into mining, so i did have a fellow player to keep me interested in the game. we both ended up quitting though.i fired eve up over the past summer, again with the same friend from two/three years ago. the first thing i made sure i would do this time around was to join a player corporation asap. my friend joined the same corporation. but the corporation i joined was primarily a small gang and pirate corp with industrial/mining as an afterthought. my friend has sort of 'quit' right now, while i'm still going strong in the game.what is the lesson here? get into a player corporation as soon as possible and participate with the corp. it's not enough just to be in a player corp (see my friend, who has gotten bored of the game once again). if anything, instead of giving new players free sps, ccp should change the starter tutorials so that they are more clear and concise regarding the importance of player corporations.in fact, perhaps the first tutorial pages should point players to player corporations.people have raised the issue of corps requiring sp requirements that take months to fulfill. first of all, the majority of the corps i have found doing this are null sec corps. which makes sense, because you need to be somewhat self-sufficient by the time you get to null because not all the amenities are available out there. for example, basic skillbooks.most corps do not require an explicit number of sps i've found, though. at most, they just require a basic skillset that can be trained within hours. for example, pirate corps usually require at most that you have the skills to use a frigate with point for tackling. mission corps sometimes require that you can salvage, so you can tag along as a salvager on l4s instead of running a bunch of l1s solo, etc."

10/22/2009,"cheers to this idea, well presented as well as very useful, it will truly make 0.0 a blast.. hom3"
10/22/2009,sounds like it could make things very interesting.
10/22/2009,"this could work, in theory.who would have access to ftl communications technology?why would the 4 empires have ftl communications in deep 0.0 in the first place?the pirate factions could steal the tech and use them for their respective regions. sisters of eve and ore would undoubtedly have a system set up for their regions (see the news from april concerning the release of apocrypha), the drone might have a system, though only to talk to each other in 1s and 0s (i would assume drones won't have much to say in the words of man )but delve, period basis, providence? who would fund such endeavors and why? for the benefit of everyone? would they really care about that?how did such a system get put in place in the first place? the jovians?my idea would be this, affect only sov altering systems. reason being, that would be the highest concentrations of main sequence anomolies (as depicted in seylin and 3hqc-6 [ore system in apocrypha trailer and news archives]) empires and factions can (and do) have the resources to upgrade and replace ftl comm arrays. due to the msa's recurring (and in some cases multiples at the same time) appearing over an extended amount of time, the electromagnetic fields have damaged such equipment (much like how they don't work in the first place in wh space at least until someone talks) but you still have frequencies that each ship sends out, and you can be on those channels (ie. cb radios for all us old fogies out there)alternatively, who actually uses constellation/region chat anyways? :)"
10/22/2009,"yes, thats a very good idea.would allow for much better opportunity of tactical movement in a single system as well as in constellation / region.also would increase the tactical value of ""small"" systems that are easy to cover with the onboard scanner as a checkpoint sort of thing to restrict hostile movement into your space."
10/22/2009,and my axe.
10/22/2009,removing local but making it a system upgrade has long been a proposed idea.
10/22/2009,1
10/22/2009,"sovereignty-based intelligence tools which allow people players to be better informed about hostile movements through their space is something that ccp are actively looking at - it was mentioned at fanfest as something that could be tied to the new dominion infrastructure. once such a system is in place, ccp have said that they may look at the local channel.so yes, a system resembling what you suggest is already on ccp's 'possibility' list."
10/22/2009,"this is a neat idea--props for bringing it up.the other side of this would be making sure an alliance has motivation to install these rather than, say, delegate a ""system probe"" or ""gate watch"" character."
10/22/2009,i think its a great idea. you have my suport.
10/22/2009,"because of the above portion of your quote i could support a ""local nerf."""
10/22/2009,this ^ finally a remove local idea that made sense.
10/22/2009,as the two posts i quoted said - this is the first thread i've yet seen in the assembly hall that offered a reasonable replacement for local.this ia at least worth investigating.
10/22/2009,like it :)
10/22/2009,"although many details are still in development, one of the things i really wanted to point out is this.dominion = super caps being more of toe to toe ships of the line.dominion = no significantly defendable way to manufacture supercapsas both a former super cap pilot/super cap producer i think we need something to allow manufacturers a little peace of mind with dropping 20-80 billion in components into a relatively weak structure. supercaps are going to be exploding soon after the dominion release, there needs to be some way to replace these losses in a better way than relying on the defense of a pos.i know i don't have the solution so i'm not offering one, but i'm asking other forum posters for their ideas. i've had a few but found many holes in them. here were my ideas as starting points for discussion.- outpost upgrade for 1 supercap assembly line: i think this is too safe, but also this does not include docking, which is whole other issue, i would propose the super cap can be launched from the outpost to put it into space, possibly without fittings.- system upgrade creating an ability to assign invulnerability to a csaa pos with some heavy restrictions and a high cost for the upgrade.anyway your turn, discus."
10/22/2009,so supercaps came into the game. there was no sov 4. it was basically a galactic shell game. no supercaps survived. supercaps = massive waste of isk. then sov 4 came along to ensure u built your supercaps. now you get to the point everyone has supercaps. which in my opinion is fine. ccp disagrees.now we are going back to the shell game. which means building supercaps will be very very difficult. anyone who isnt the sole powerhouse alliances will be unable to build them. giving major advantage to the powerful over the new guys.anyone who is anywhere near empire wont be able to build supercaps.that's pretty much ccp's goal i think.kind of stupid. only inevitable that they need to revert that and give us invuln pos again.
10/22/2009,"i have run hundreds - maybe thousands - of hi-sec level 4s, most of them in isinokka, which is not the smallest mission hub there is. how come i never get salvage ninjas? they're scared of my awesome dangerous notorious combat powah c/d?to date: 1 dude turned up in some super ab frigate and swiped the quafe from cargo delivery, never even bothered trying to ransom it back to me. i figured that if the guy was that thirsty, then who was i to deny him a cool refreshing quafe? that was, i dunno early 2008?then a few months later in 2008 a tri suicide gank squad bump tackled me at an acceleration gate, scanned me and advised me to ""learn to fit your cnr properly"" before going on their way. my feelings somewhat hurt, but my shields intact, i docked up for 20 mins just in case of some freaky h4xploit aggro shennanigans.in fact so far from being plagued with salvage ninjas, i find that i literally cannot give the salvage away. i'm frequently too lazy to loot and salvage, since i usually mission when i'm either too unwell or hungover to play ""real"" eve, and my offers in local of ""salvage ae4 anyone who wants it x up in local"" go unheeded"
10/22/2009,"/sig'd everything else aside at the base level , this still comes down to someone profiting off someone else's work (without there permission). and that is by definition stealing. why would loot be considered property but not salvage? both where created because of a direct action by a individual. and without that direct action would cease to have been created. they at least should have the same policy on loot and salvage rather than 2 different policies. considering that they are both created the same way. come on guys its simple logic, you work for it , you get it. the asteroid analogy is null b/c asteroids are already there and don't require someone triggering them."
10/22/2009,"i see that in some systems i mission in. some guy offers up the salvage and he gets no response. i think it has to do with the type of game eve is. it's a ""trust no one for they are out to kill you"" type game."
10/22/2009,"i am a mission runner, and uber salvager. i make as much money from the rigs i produce from the salvage, than the missions themselves. i don't even run missions for the isk, just the standings, loyalty points, mods and salvage. i love ninja salvagers. they provide an excellent service. they cut down on the items in space, making the system run smoother. and during high body count missions, they can make the salvaging fun as you race for the same wreckage. to be honest, the loot in that gallente bs will often sell for a higher price than the 10 armour plates that could be salvaged.so i'm afraid i am with ccp, salvage is for everyone, life's like that."
10/22/2009,"i love the idea of being able to set up traps with distress beacons... would be pretty awesome. could have something flying a damaged hauler with no cargo, but in low structure so its got fires and whatever. just when the ""hero"" gets closer cloakers decloak and start shooting this guy to bits."
10/22/2009,"distress signals, perhaps a temporary beacon on the overview, would be great.make it something you have to carry in your cargo hold and deploy, and that industrialists can build."

10/22/2009,"it's quite populated already. sure, some stretches of it are fairly empty, but a lot of it is populated enough.sure, more things available to make isk in low-sec would be nice, but taking l4s from high-sec and putting them there isn't really a very appealing idea to me.the only reason why l4s in high-sec bother me is that they really make the whole risk/reward/etc story pretty pointless, but that's another story, and highsec is too good a cash cow."
10/22/2009,it is the highsec l4 carebears who buy lots of the faction goodies people get in lowsec/0.0. you really think they would bring them into lowsec?
10/22/2009,ok so i'm doing this 10/10 plex down in 0mist lets say. it drops me this nice gist x-type xl shield booster. it took 5 of us to run this plex. so we are hoping to sell that booster for at least 1-2bil. who buys this? is there even a darknesss who does shields? i doubt that. so pretty much it's the lvl 4 mission runners who buy it. hmmm.now lets move lvl 4 missions to lowsec. if they goto lowsec for missions. they sure as hell arent bringing gist mods. so they arent going to be using those anymore. if they stay in highsec and run lvl 3s. they sure as hell wont be flying a ship which needs an xl-booster. so they dont need to buy it once again.so suddenly this module that currently can sell for a load of isk. suddenly has absolutely no buyers.now factor in.. sov is being fixed and people are going to populate 0.0 more. iow more of these modules are going to find their way to jita to be sold.do you really want to nerf missions? when nerfing missions leads to 0.0 being extremely worthless?
10/22/2009,"don't worry guys, i just talked to jason edwards in a private chat and he admitted that this idea was ok."
10/22/2009,"please turn on brain before engaging mouth.first of all - even if a bunch of missioners were to go to low sec it wouldn't mean a free for all against salvagers because that would mean shooting someone who hadn't drawn what concord considers legal aggro. which means that if you shot a fair number of salvagers your sec status would tank and you'd not be able to get back into high sec.second - mission runners use pve ships and many fly solo. pirates (the largest low sec population) use pvp fits and fly in groups. what's more they are pirates - killing other players for cash, loot and fun is what they do. so mission runners die like flies and get disgusted after about five minutes of this and go back to high sec space and run what's there.third - ever hear of these things called l5 missions? they only exist in low sec. guess what? no one does them except for bored pirates who are there anyway and even those only rarely as it leaves them open to getting ganked by other pirates. if l5s, the best paying of all missions, aren't being taken advantage of what makes you think l4s would be?this is either the least well thought out comment ever, or a very sad attempt at trolling. i've no idea which and don't much care."
10/22/2009,"i didn't write that they were going to defend their salvage without legal aggro. they just won't get concorded in low sec while doing so, which gives them a chance to claim their salvage if they need it so badly.well, mission runners may as well team up and fight back.if you put less npc ships in missions (reduced server load?) but give them more tank, make them smarter and increase item/salvage drop rate, then mission runners might team up and get pvp fitted ships as they won't need a huge amount of tank to survive a mission anymore. that would give them the ability to defend themselves when they get attacked by a pirate gang.reducing number of npc ships on a mission and increasing possibility of losing ships because of other players' actions might result in missions that are less of a grind with more thrill, and thus they will be completed faster, and more fun. accomplishing such a mission would be more meaningful, too. however if it decreases chances of a pirate attack and imbalances the game a signal strength of a ship in a deadspace would have to be increased.what's more why not introduce a new faction warfare-like thing? something of a player-controlled low-sec-concord whose pilots would be the only group authorized to get bounties from kills; assuming a pilot who has a bounty on their head had indeed committed an action punishable by the concord. players would put rewards on heads of those who give them troubles in low-sec and anti-pirate oriented pvpers would get the opportunity to kill pirates for a profit without risk of getting killed by other anti-pirates. that might even make rewards oriented pirates become anti-pirate adding balance to this new system.additionally players would still be able to help each other by attacking a pirate flagged with aggro in a similar way it happens in cva's nrds providence (although they don't get literally flagged as it's 0.0; i'm more interested in a way players back-up themselves). that would eventually mean that mission runners would be getting some feeling of being collectively bonded to other mission runners and it might increase social interaction between them.and about lvl 5 missions. why not make them a feature of 0.0 security space? one of solar systems' improvments would be a possibilty to include inviting lvl 5 agents to holders' space. players inhabiting 0.0 usually have means to run them effectively.that would possibly mean making 0.0 the most profitable space in game, thus encouraging their holders to fit their ships as well as possible to get an edge during defense (or attack in case of conquering a well developped solar system) and becoming new customers of providers of high meta loot.to sum up, maybe a perspective of less time consuming and more enjoyable missions would convince many high-sec mission runners to go to low sec, especially if they could call and much more likely recive a back up. and maybe it would make them consider exploring even deeper, more hostile parts of new eden where the fortune and epic battles have their place."
10/22/2009,"""well, mission runners may as well team up and fight back.if you put less npc ships in missions (reduced server load?) but give them more tank, make them smarter and increase item/salvage drop rate, then mission runners might team up and get pvp fitted ships as they won't need a huge amount of tank to survive a mission anymore. that would give them the ability to defend themselves when they get attacked by a pirate gang.""you still dont seem to get it, missioning is not for the sake of finish a mission. it is for the sake of earning isk. ever tried to finish a lvl 4 mission in a pvp ship? lets begin:1. how do you aggro-manage with short-range guns? 2. how do you slow-boat your way from one group of enemy to another group that is actually 100km away in a 100m/s battleship? microwarpdrives? well those dont work in most missions i'm afraid. no macrowarpdrives? then how the hell do you pvp?3. without aggro management, how do you tank 1000dps with a buffer tank and without mission-specific hardners?4. if you plan on use an active tank, how many cargo space are you prepared to sacrifice for cap boosters? even if you do fill your cargohold with cap boosters, are they gonna last 30 minutes? 5. where do you get ammo? not a lot of traders go to low-sec? right?5. how do you plan on getting your salvage ship to do the salvaging provided that the station is going to be camped 99% of the time?""and about lvl 5 missions. why not make them a feature of 0.0 security space? one of solar systems' improvments would be a possibilty to include inviting lvl 5 agents to holders' space. players inhabiting 0.0 usually have means to run them effectively.that would possibly mean making 0.0 the most profitable space in game, thus encouraging their holders to fit their ships as well as possible to get an edge during defense (or attack in case of conquering a well developped solar system) and becoming new customers of providers of high meta loot.""why would 0.0 space holders who can get billions and billions of isks from moon mining (where they dont need to move a finger) would actually start grinding missions? what makes you assume a particular 0.0 space that is claimed by a particular corp/alliance is actually ""safe"" for that alliance to mission-run with pve ships?"
10/22/2009,tldr version - pve fit ships are not pvp fit ships... and vice versa.a missioning gang will likely end up bringing a pvp'er with them for defense purposes... but at that rate they are likely to not come at all.this isn't as cut and dry as you think it is.
10/22/2009,"if you decrease number of npc ships and accordingly increase their tank and chance of loot, the end isk reward should remain unchanged. in fact, the point is to decrease dps received from npc rats and increase the threat from other players, so those boosters you have mentioned are most likely to be used only in case of pvp.whether people decide to go for range or power in the mission it will be entirely up to them. the point of flying in low sec, though, is to have at least a wingman. that way players would get some feel of tactics in pvp. so, for example, one player is focused on a mission while other makes for an escort.don't forget about the idea of player controlled concord in low security systems (anti-pirate warfare).as to station camping. if the pirate vs. anti-pirate warfare is introduced it won't be so easy to camp a station anymore as players will feel much more confident to fight pirates assuming the presence of well trained anti-pirate pvpers in the system and response of other mission runners.but you have to assume, that as easily as pirates will be able to find you, ninjas will be able to do the same. so going to get a salvager ship might be a bit pointless, but having a wingman (let's say in an ecm ship) who could do salvaging for you and buy you more time to defend yourselves from pirates before the player based concord arrives to help you, might be a much better idea.of course, it will be very important to balance the mission reward time- and threat-wise as you might get ganked by another player at any time. i'm not saying that losing a ship shouldn't hurt. it's eve and it should. but the new system should as well be encouraging players to fly in low sec, as imho it seems as a next logical step to make more money and do new more interesting things.what's more, i can't agree with you that the only purpose of missions is to make isk. they should give fun as well because that's what computer or any other games are for. and the fact is, that right now missions are extremely dull.economy. i doubt that moving lvl 4 missions to low sec would limit the availability of items and ammo because if there is a place where money can be made, people who want to make it will very likely find a way to do so.and the last thing. in my opinion it's not the point to make space for running level 5 missions a safe place. 0.0 isn't a safe place and definitely shouldn't be such. it's a place where you go to hit the limits of wealth and power you can get in eve. but i don't think it should be an easy task. and not for every player it is an easy task. despite the bilions you're thinking of, ccp for one is reinventing the 0.0 and many players even of well established and well managed alliances have to get funding for their warfare by ratting or doing plexes. why don't give them a chance to do lvl 5 missions, too?"
10/22/2009,"""if you decrease number of npc ships and accordingly increase their tank and chance of loot, the end isk reward should remain unchanged. in fact, the point is to decrease dps received from npc rats and increase the threat from other players, so those boosters you have mentioned are most likely to be used only in case of pvp.""i've already said, you have no clue what you are talking about. a buffer-tanked battleship cannot tank anything other than current lvl 2 and maybe some easiest lvl 3 missions, without aggro management. thats not even 1/50th of what a lvl4 mission may pump out. so you are going to reduce lvl4 dps by 1/50 and buff bounties/drops/loops by 50? how realistic is that? and thats just the issue with tanking, you have not addressed a whole bunch of other issues there. if you want to balance the low-sec mission reward-risk, then it perhaps needs to be at least 30 times as lucrative as high-sec missioning. or even more. lvl5 missions are already 10 times as lucrative as high-sec level 4s and do you see anyone bothered doing them?ah, running missions is for making isk. this is a basic fact of eve and it does not really depend on whether you agree with it, or not. if you dont agree that 1+1 =2 dosent mean it isnt. being ganked in a pve ship while missioning doesnt make the mission any more ""fun"", either. maybe for the griefer, but not for the mission runner.edit: something i do agree with you is that low-sec and 0.0 needs buffing, it needs more reasons for people to go there other than to ""feel good about themselves that they are a pvper"". for instance, better rats, more interesting warfares. generally, things that can improve for players flying pvp fitted ships.but low-sec missioning was never a good idea in the first place that ccp might just as well remove the low-sec agents alltogether. the main reasons, i've already stated, missioning with pvp fitted ship is totally unfeasible."
10/22/2009,this is actually not true. there are some ships that work very well for pve with pvp fit. long range hacs for example. also many battleship pvp fits work okayish for missions with proper aggro management. but it still doesnt help you when you get attacked that you got this extra dps from the rats against you.
10/22/2009,"um, dude. the best level 4 agents in the game, available from all faction are *drumroll* you guessed it: in lowsec!nobody uses them currently. why do you think that is?depends on which rats you're fighting, and which mission. if it one of those deadspace gates that drop you in the middle of 6 close range battleships, then a range tank isn't going to help. if it's a guristas mission, they can actually hit you up 150km, so no help here either. so unless you've got some magical tanking ability that works for both pvp and pve, then it doesn't work.besides, the dps on a hac vs. marauder is pretty thin. missioning in a marauder in highsec nets you more isk/h simply because you are able to finish the misisons faster, and you never have to dock/safe. the interruptions from seriously bored people camping you in station for hours on end puts a massive dent in your isk/h.not that i really care about the isk/h, i care more about the fact that i can actually play the game when i log in, and not sit a smack a bunch of people that are too bored/lazy to actually go hunt something that might yield some action. you can have my isk, but my time is precious!"
10/22/2009,"i didnt say hacs are exactly fast in doing that job. and range tank works even with those missions where you get dropped right into the middle of them. wc 4 angel/sansha e.g. i tanked in a cerberus was just orbiting long range. and even when guristas hit you up to 150km, they dont hit hard if you keep moving.cerb can even do c1/c2 wh stuff solo.and i often pick the cerb over my golem just to have to actually fly in my ship. and not just sitting at the warp in point killing things."
10/22/2009,"ok, some of you read my original idea of a tier training system,[proposal] tier training system. and it was shot down hard, which is okay, it happens. but, rotten fruit can become great fertilizer...i very much like aren's adaptation, instead of a main character having two skills going at once (the second going much slower, as i had it.) have it so your alts can be learning skills, but at a slower pace than your primary. (maybe decided on which skill queue you set up first, or assign it to your characters which is primary, secondary, and tertiary.)well, this any better? and good thinking aren!"
10/22/2009,iwas actualy was about to make a topic of this. i made an alt after a month of playing and then it said i couldnt train skills. i just wanted to make a gallente and try a different line of skills and see how i liked that and maybe make it my primary instead and maybe become a pirate on my alt. but there is no way im delaying any training on my primary just to indulge my need for piracy. should totaly enact this and make the alt 4x train time that way its slightly harder to abuse it.
10/22/2009,again not supported. if you want another toon training at the same time. get a 2nd account. multiple toons training on the same account will just lead to people training toons to sell them.
10/22/2009,"i have to disagree strongly with the idea of training multiple characters at the same time. my reasons are simple. characters develop, their skills dictate who and what they are, which takes time, playing time. i understand the desire to try different races and skill trees, but without putting in the required effort, these skills are meaningless. worse they belittle the effort put in by players who have dedicated their time and resources into developing these skill trees. finally, the last thing needs, is old, experienced players like me, who know how to create powerful characters quickly running around with pirate/griefer, miner/trader alts. game balance would be blown out the window, to the detriment of newer, less experienced players."
10/22/2009,"make outpost build cost 10x more. outpost spam is horrible, 0.0 is not supposed to be empire."
10/22/2009,"i would say number of outposts right now is fine. however i do expect number of outposts to increase vastly with dominion, as little alliances taking a few systems build an outpost for quick response to attacks on sov."
10/22/2009,"is there a limit on the number of outposts? if not, maybe a limit of 1 per constelation. hmm, i dont really know if tehre are already any set rules, but i agree, 0.0 shouldnt be full of outposts."
10/22/2009,"on the other hand, with sov4 invulnerability going away, a lot of the incentive for the recent outpost explosion will go with it - most outposts dropped in the last year or so were built in order to sov4 a constellation with an existing outpost. plus the r64 rebalance may deny alliances the easy passive income that the outposts were funded with.the only current limit is 1 per system - our w-4 constellation in delve has 6 player-built outposts. it would be pointless to impose a restriction on other alliances following suit if they wished to do so, but as above, post-dominion there may not be either a good reason for them to bother or the income to afford it."
10/22/2009,"what is the point of limiting amount of outpost that one can build?if i want to invest billions into making my alience empire, and improving logistics, why shouldn't i be able to?"
10/22/2009,oh boy your in for a surprise. ccp wants more people in zero. so in a matter of speaking it could become empire...probably will be. and no. more outpost in zero means more market and more competion...im like that.
10/22/2009,not supporting for 2 reasons1: it's called economic growth...2: dominion will change the entire landscape with the new sov system... i'd rather wait before calling it quits on the system first (as far as outposts go)
10/22/2009,"i'd like to see the 1 per system limit raised, but player outposts should ultimately be destructible in some way."
10/22/2009,"because eventually, every single 0.0 system will have an outpost. allowing players to build them and not tear them down can only ever lead to an increase in outposts..."
10/22/2009,"because eventually, every single 0.0 system will have an outpost. allowing players to build them and not tear them down can only ever lead to an increase in outposts...why are these 'bad' things?"
10/22/2009,"currently, the default setting is to lock every item that is put into a secured container (not just station ones). i propose to make the default setting unlocked instead of locked because it's annoying having to set up the cans to not lock items in your personal hanger, and it also takes ages to unlock >200 items. i've also had these settings reset on me a couple times...please ccp?"
10/22/2009,this.
10/22/2009,"not sure, maybe some kind of addition to gang boosters restricted by race would be an idea, i.e. say minmatar characters in minmatar ships get an additional 2% from the gang boost a pilot with skirmish links / mindlink provides.shouldnt be too much either way, as that would just lead to countless whinefests on how overpowered the amarr / caldari bonuses are while the gallente / minnie ones suck still, not supporting, i'd rather see some thought put into something like that first."
10/22/2009,i would rather see the bonuses work the other way. for example for every lvl of mimitar crusier you have that grants 1% bonus to all speeds on a crusier level. this means that if you can fly all 4 races ships you would have additional knowledge and experience that would augment your combat ability
10/22/2009,"many a times i had to click the blinking wallet and journal icons and thus opening them, in order to get rid of their shiny status. i'd like it if there was an option to get rid of having to open the menu, and simply right clicking them sounds just right.situations where this could come handy are limited only to missions i'm afraid, when you want to know when an objective is completed so you could warp out. however it's still a nice feature for us people with minor cases of ocd, who prefer having all their buttons having the same background without cluttering their interface with stuff you need to close."
10/22/2009,"it was suggested i create a thread about a post i made to the other pos topic.with the advent of dominion and the change in sovereignty mechanics in game i'd like to suggest a change to the logistics required to fuel pos's.i'd like to suggest the creation of a new component called a pos battery which could be manufactured from the current components required to fuel them. bpo's could be created in order to facilitate the manufacture of the new pos batteries. the pos battery would benefit both the players and ccp by eliminating extra calculations required when determining remaining fuel for a pos. for the player, if a pos battery was 9,000m3 and had a 7 day lifecycle, the player would only have to be able to count to 3 to fuel a pos. rather than open the calculator and multiply the fuel requirements for each component, subtract the remaining components already in the tower, and load the difference in our refueling ship. the isk sink that is pos fuel components would not be lost if a blueprint requiring those same components existed.for ccp, rather than the 7 (or 8 if in empire) calculations per pos per hour, the new pos battery would be 1 calculation per pos and could be made per hour or once per day. let's say there are 10,000 pos in the eve universe that would reduce calculations by between 1.44 and 1.58 million per day.finally, a secondary battery for reinforcement of towers or the current stront timers could still be used.pos batteries could be designed so they exist for the same duration as the current pos fuels and could be stacked in a tower. or they're lifespan could be expanded to 10, 20, or 30 days.please feel free to expand on or criticize this proposal as you see fit.cheers"
10/22/2009,"not signed.i recall reading something like this in the past (i think they called them ""fuel rods"" or similar which, imo, is a better name than ""pos battery"") and many of us shot it down for the following reasons:1. every manufacturing slot in empire would be jammed full of these things (assuming these completely replaced fuel, i.e. you could no longer use regular fuel to fuel a pos).2. you would need different racial ones for each race (if you switch tower types or have the wrong ones you have to waste more money getting the right ones vs. just replacing the racial ice fuel)3. liquid ozone and heavy water are used in variable amounts (it depends how much pg/cpu is used in your tower). unless these were separate to the fuel rods you would not save anything by offlining unused modules like you currently do.4. more of a waste of time for people like me who routinely fuel pos (come on, the math is not hard at all and there are tools such as my pos that you can put your tower fit into and then just copy and paste the amounts in the tower to figure out what you need if you don't want to do math), under this system, i would have to buy bpos of the fuel rods, research them (unless they start with a 0% wastage factor like ore compression bpos), waste more time building them, haul, etc."
10/22/2009,"i sort of like the fuel rod idea, but the problems with it are real. you'd do better to just delete the current npc good requirements and replace them with one npc ""starbase fuel cell"" item, with the same cost per hour. less flavour, but also less hair-pulling."
10/22/2009,i'm with hersch on this one... too many pitfalls here.
10/22/2009,"the other posts above mine have pretty much covered the reasons, so i'll just add my own no to the list."
10/22/2009,"while doing a wormhole with a group of corp mates today a bunch of us were rudely cut-off eve regularly. unfortunately, it happened so much so that one of our members didn't come back, perhaps he also had net problems after the disconnection. anyway, my proposal is a sitter function.what is a sitter function?a sitter is a player you elect that can log on to your account using their password. it contains severely restricted roles much like a corporation designing it's titles etc, and allows a player to give access to other players without providing their login passwords.what i would like to seewhile the sitter function is a fantastic idea, it can't simply be thrown as is into eve online, it wasn't designed for the game. however, limiting it's duties can provide a viable function with minimum consequences for ccp. the sitter function should prevent players from undocking from stations, contracting, selling, buying or transfering isk from wallets. the sitter can however use the ships if the character is already undocked, and to it's maximum potential (pvp, pve etc). the sitter can also add skills to the queue however can't remove skills from the queue.using this approach should prevent any abuse of the system. furthermore should the original owner log on, priority access should be given to them preventing other players from bumping them off."
10/22/2009,you can jumpdrive to 4c-b7x from loads of lowsec systems that border highsec. pretty much safely. cyno ship is likely to die sure... but big deal a couple mil vs 2.5bil bpo. similarly u can jump right back to that same lowsec system.getting the bpos is easy. the price is high sure... but it's mining barges... it's like the main horse of the game. mega important. due to this... there's much competition in the barge markets.
10/22/2009,verys shall i list the changes ccp have made over the last 20 months that have affected the majority of eve players your point is mute.
10/22/2009,"the existence of a spell checker is moot if you don't know the word you want to type in the first place.but, uh, no. sure, if this stupid, stupid, stupid suggestion was ever implemented, it would be a lot easier to get a mining barge bpo. that means, everyone would have one. that means, you wouldn't make money building them. or copying them. so, we must ask: to what end? what's the fricken point? once you make barge bpos dirt cheap, they become worthless. so, why screw up the game for a bunch of players for a change that will net you or anyone else no benefit?"
10/22/2009,"damar you had to see this coming, you've made your self known to have a very touchy temper that is remarkably similar to my 1yr old niece when she isn't getting held. if you don't get your way, you rage. if someone kicks you out of a defensive plex, you rage. we are talking about the csm here people. do we really want a self driven, tempered person to be on the csm. yes i am gallente, i'm sure i've said enough to you in local for you to know i don't like you and your whining...anybody in the world from any side will argue ""biased!!!"", this whole thread screams it, but the fact remains is you can argue as much as you want about plexing mechanics you want, but until you direct your attention to the pvp aspect of faction warfare, the rewards of pvp, and the plexing/pvp interaction you will do nothing for faction warfare. you could go on about how what rats do what, and how they are unbalanced, and how ships can tank or not tank plexes, but tbh a lot of people i've spoken to (yes mainly gallente) don't give a rats *** (no pun intended)...tbh i think from a pvp standpoint that if the whole plex system was redone (not system control, because the caldari earned their captures fair and square...or so i think) to fit for better pvp interaction. make control more easily lose-able (don't flame me i'm not done yet)...making plexes more dire, more rewarding to the player as far as experience, you will see a lot more people from both sides (all sides) get more involved, see the map become more dynamic (like alliances...cuz i've been there...alliance space changes a lot, making it more dire and rewarding)i'm no expert about plexes and i don't claim to be, but the general consensus is that plexes can get boring to the average player, and they lose their 'zing' after awhile...this should be about making faction warfare more attractive and dynamic/rewarding (experience wise)....once you do that, the experiences are that much better (even if all i do is defensive plex at least make it more dynamic and critical to the point people want to do them more often) lastly....i have even thought about running for csm myself actually but the truth is...i'm too biased, i talk to much in local, and i'm a die hard pvp'r who cares very little about plexing, but only when the occasion rises...i'm sorry damar but i will not be supporting you, keep on plexing tho 0/pvp ftw!"

10/22/2009,"i am interestedi am runningmy platform is only a few planks wide, however. i personally would like to see minor shifts in some basic mechanics but i do believe a lot (most) of this csm's mandate will be reactionary to the dominion expansion. it is hard to build a platform when we do not see the land we will be building upon.that being said"
10/22/2009,i will vote yes when a baboon is voted in to protect a banana warehouse
10/22/2009,"nice troll lark, i applaud thee sir."
10/22/2009,"reporting this thread as nothing but trolling and spam now. i mean after all, larkonis is not allowed to run because of breaking the nda, so this thread is now pointless.don't worry lark, maybe in future terms when if ccp allows you to run, i am sure no one will bring up what you did and dash your hopes for another chance at a spot in csm. right?..."
10/22/2009,"i'm now at half the amount of surveyed people i'm aiming for, it's going pretty fast.a new tally of what people are interested in:1: ingame socializing2: missioning3: wormhole exploration4: exploration outside of wormholes5: sovereignty wars6: 0.0 wars that aren't about sovereignty7: market trading8: mining9: low sec piracy10: factional warfare pvp11: null sec piracy12: bounty hunting13: factional warfare plexing14: factional warfare missions15: suicide ganking in high sec16: scamming other playersso far not much has changed, and it seems that what some people are saying is in fact true: the carebears have taken over eve.onto the list of what people want to see ccp work on next...1: new shiptypes (with a convincing lead btw)2: exploration3 and 4: a tie for missioning and the sovereignty system is it will be in dominion5: mining6: ship ballancing7: factional warfare mechanics8: ingame socializing9: wormholes10: piracy11: bounty hunting12: trading13: suicide gankingthe new shiptypes could apply to all gamestyles, potentially, but here we see a similar trend of pve things getting priority over pvp things.by now i have discovered how misleading forum data can be. i've taken the survey ingame looking for people there who will take the test, so it doesn't just represent the people that go to the forum, and i think that's where this result starts being different from the trend of many pvp-related topics on the forum. as a csm member i would therefor be promoting better ingame tools for the csm to reach the ingame population with, to make sure that no type of player is overlooked.there are many more things that i am learning as this survey plays out, and i'll keep you posted. once i've reached the target number of participants i'm aiming for i'll post the whole thing in full here."
10/22/2009,"edit: better formatting for readability.one of the problem of the current survey is that people rating something as high priority can mean it in 2 different ways.for example:- industrialist/trader (and there is nothing about industry in the survey, btw) ccp work on mission - high priority - what he want? remove meta 0 loot from missions;- malcanis: ccp work on mission - high priority - remove them!- rpg interested mission runner: ccp work on mission - high priority - make them more interesting, variend and let them affect eve in some way;- 0.0 player alt: ccp work on mission - high priority - make them faster and more profitable, i need the isk for my 0.0 character pvpand so on."
10/22/2009,"you are correct, there is a plethora of reasons why people vote the way they do, and this survey by itself cannot clarify those reasons. but it gives me a good indication of what to enquire about next, in surveys to come which will be more and more specific.also, it's not entirely true that i have no indication of what people vote high priority for. for instance:looking at the first list, i asked what players find most important in the game, missinging comes in second, this means that missions, in some way, shape or form, are indeed coveted by players. then looking at a part of the survey where i ask where it is that people do their missions,the overwhelming majority do them in high security space. this is what they appear to want, otherwise they would choose to do them in low security space. so looking at the last list of what ccp needs to change, missions scoring as they do (i just checked missioning to be on 6th place now) you could argue that even though a still considerable amount people want them to change, it doesn't weigh up to the overwhelming amount that plays them in high security space. so if you where to asume that all players who voted for missioning to be looked at next mean to say that they should be moved to low sec, they would still be overruling an even larger group that wants to play them in high sec."
10/23/2009,"i am not going to mess about with numbers in this thread though but i would personally like to see about 5 minutes per fighters when carrier is not in triage 2.5 minutes for fighters in a mothership and about 1 minute for fighters when a standard carrier goes into triage and starts consuming nanite paste.since not all fighters have the same hp i think time should be the factor of the repair.locking the bay would complement the idea of having repairs time based which i support myself.seeing as the carrier would be equipped with a maintenance bay i would also like to see it possible to repair standard drones, however these should take up slots so that you will have to choose what to repair.since this mechanic would largely be when the carrier is in a safe position (unless you are in triage) i believe the repairs should only be limited to the amount of time the player has and for what amount the carrier can stay in this position.speeding up repairs in a carrier by personnel would lead to situations where people only put the repair personnel in the cargobay unless they have a hefty cost."
10/23/2009,sounds like a intresting idear.
10/23/2009,"i like this, you have my support."
10/23/2009,"let me make somethings clear: i support this idea, however, from a game design standpoint, i doubt a 'repair bay' will be allowed. there's too much room in there to allow someone to pack a whole new flight of fighters in there. i think a carrier or mothership should have the ability to designate 'repair this drone' at which point an eta to repair time pops up after the name of the drone. drone repairs cannot be aborted, and drones under repair cannot be launched.in general this idea is quite good though. /signed"
10/23/2009,"of course it's not perfect. after all we've seen so far as of late, it's nowhere near perfect. improvements are still badly needed and they won't happen unless ccp steps in and intervenes. the csms have already demonstrated they cannot conduct themselves accordingly. they cannot be expected to police themselves."
10/23/2009,wow i thought this and threads like it are all about how easy it is to troll people in this forum section. thank you for clarifying this.its serious business!!!!!!!!!! lol.

10/23/2009,"not sure about the approach. but the idea of continually making everything quickly accessible to everyone, seems to lead to a generic experience for all. personally, i think eve could use an added element of specialization within all of the ""careers"".making exploration more accessible and also adding depth to it seems to be the best of both worlds."

10/23/2009,"requesting a devblog on the layout of the servers for dust514.as an australian fps player i know that only local servers are playable.there is no possible way to play an fps game on a foreign server from australia as you end up half a second behind the other players.as such i'm very dubious of what the final result of dust514 will be when it comes to non-us markets.will it be setup to have geolocated servers which then feed data back to the ccp server farm?will dedicated servers be able to be run and authorised by 3rd parties?if no dedicated servers are planned, how does ccp plan to mitigate latency?"
10/23/2009,"something i've been wondering about too, not because i own a console, but just because i'm curious."
10/23/2009,ccp is always on the bleeding edge of technology. so to make sure aussies can connect to the servers in london they will be getting a dedidcated t-256 line to kangarooland. this tacheyon-256 line will wirelessly broadcast tacheyons through the earth to ensure a quality connection that bypasses the great aussie firewall.
10/23/2009,"sorry aussies, bad news is no amount of software/server work is going to alleviate the fact that australia has been in dire need of additional long haul fiber for years. if i didn't get laid off a year ago i'd be building the conversion station here in san diego, but the company went under and lost the contract. who knows where the project is now.... but hopefully you gamers down under will be getting some telco love soon. but again i'd like to point out that there really isn't very much ccp can do in terms of the latency you guys are plagued by. it's a telco problem."
10/23/2009,another now concerned aussie battler wondering what the future holds.
10/23/2009,this might help with our horrible speeds...but as for multiple servers all over the place - i guess we'll be waiting for the next media release from ccp before we find out. asking for a devblog about another game isn't likely to yield much of a result.

10/23/2009,"isn't this thread in the wrong forum?if we are going to have functional sounds, they need to be pleasing to the ear. randomize the sounds a bit, no looping plz. if you do something that gives same warning 3 times in a row in 20 seconds, that warning sound should be disabled for 2 minutes. allow players to disable allmost any sound they don't like. and yea, i have quite little trust on how ccp is going to make the voices work.countdown to session change. 1 minute aggression cooldown 30sec, 10sec and 2sec aggression cd warnings. also smaller 5sec warning to docking countdown, when gate cloak is ending and maybe session change in station when changing ship. or/and maybe perhaps visible timer somewhere on the ui. you know, all those annoying arbitrary cooldowns... fleet session change alsoeve female voice announcement when global criminal cooldown endssound when fitting a ship and you're out of cpu or pg.announcement when concord incomingwhen pushing the warp button, eve female voice could announce ""warping in 6seconds"" estimation.announcements when science and industry jobs are finished. same kind of like when skill training finishes.sound when bumping someone, getting bumped or crashing into anything that slows you down. sound when you're bugged and stuck into an asteroid that is actually 20km away from you. when you try to dock and you're too far away, game should tell you how close you need to be to be able to dock.when cap booster runs out of chargeswarning when module is about to be busted of overheating. but i'd rather see an improvement on the graphics on the ui.message or sound when first neutral or hostile pilot is added to your overview. sound when you are targeted first time(no sound if you are allready being targeted). sound when you are being aggressed first time. possibly, if you can code it, have eve female voice say the name of the aggressor. would be neat.various messages from the eve voice female when you lose a ship or a pod. it was great when i lost my first ship(or was it a pod) and she ridiculed me. i was like hit with a bat and like wtf. half a joke here"
10/23/2009,"as much as i would love to think that poking ccp repeatedly gets the job done, they don't exactly have a pristine track record in regards to fw.- the bug that they marvelled at in iceland was reported and presumably reproduced/fixed internally back in july which is obviously not the case.- they have stated that they have no idea what causes timers to behave as they do, which gave rise to the defunct cloaking exploit and the timers refusing capture.- they removed mwd from vanilla missions back in the day specifically to prevent people from speed-tanking/kiting npcs due to limited ai, yet they turn a blind eye to the exact same thing in fw.- to top it off they have not had a single employee utter the words factional warfare (if you disregard the round table on it that is).by instantly freezing vp/standings gain from plexes but leaving them for pvp purposes, ccp can have the time they need to make it fair to all parties and squash the bugs either by changing the mechanics or finding the offending code.i just do not have a lot of faith left in ccp's ability to fix the mish-mash of code that fw mechanics is comprised of."
10/23/2009,hey way to line up like sheep. but shouldnt you be off somewhere servicing your masters?
10/23/2009,"why would we when were getting serviced right here?i mean this is grade a whine without purpose here.your argument is flawed on so many levels, i have to wonder what the few thumbs up you got smoked this morning (and where i can lay my hands on some).flaw 1:fanfest had some video footage of the things that the csm has brought before them, and in said graph, were marked out the things that were implemented, denied, and the things in development. to say they do nothing is a bit of a stretch, to say they do much is also laughable. they are attempting to strike a balance, a give players a voice (the things they raise come from us).flaw 2:if you find it utterly corrupt, feel free to toss your name in the voting booth and create change from the inside.i know, baffling concept that you should actually do something yourself to change something you don't like, but the shock will pass, and your life will continue.in the end, one guy cheated, and one girl is adopting a real life politics by attempting to form a lobbying group (something i find both fascinating and a bit funny). the first got impeached so to speak, the second is well within the rights of just about every elected official in the history of elected officials.if you don't like it, its on your shoulders to do something about it, not ***** and moan in some barely passable thread where you insult/pick apart the spelling () of those who don't share your views.perhaps you don't hail from a country with a democratically elected government, so your not used to seeing the system at work, a flaw that i can understand, but without even trying to do something yourself, your efforts are laughable at best.tl;dr- you can change the system if you get off your whiney lazy ass and do something for once in your life.edit: upon reflection, your sig on this very forum makes the hypocritical nature of your post so much more evident."

10/23/2009,"i dont really see why we need jump shuttle and what will be purpose of that ship, but idea seem to be interesting, so you will get my support for this."
10/23/2009,"jump shuttle with carrier jump range that requires 1/10th fuel of black ops, requires only racial cruiser 4, **** that ****. also, it would actually require about 4 capital jump drives for an average price of only 35m. but seriously, get a ****ing life and train for & buy a bobs and/or carrier like the rest of us did."
10/23/2009,"the op failed to outline the main thing needed in assembly hall threads: the why.as in, why in the world do we need a jump ""shuttle""/cruiser? the only answer i saw in the op was because he wanted to travel easier. (more importantly, he wants to trade bps/expensive but small gear, easier.)the ""i want things easier"" is not a reason that will gain much support."
10/23/2009,"i'm against that idea, use a capital ship if you want to jump, i dont see the use of that ship."
10/23/2009,this is not true. a blackops can jump you to a covert cyno in a recon. same with stealth bombers.
10/23/2009,jumping cargo and player isn't inbalanced but jumping player only is?
10/23/2009,"yeah they can do that, but if you look at the question/answer again, i'm pretty sure hes asking if recons can cyno around. they cannot. bo cyno them around, they cannot cyno themselves around."
10/23/2009,"i own a carrier, a jf, and a black ops. also, it requires exactly the same fuel as a blackops (feel free to check). mins: whatever. i don't do indy ****.i don't trade. fail. the purpose is to get from a... to b. preferably intact. with a tiny little bit of cargo. it's more economical, but incredibly fragile (less ehp than a cruiser), never mind this would be candy to any sort of blackops squad (one volley from a redeemer/etc = dead before you even load system). or lowsec gate/station campers. or highsec gankers. if anything, it's more dangerous to trade in. it's a shuttle. use it like a shuttle. pick stuff up. go places. die. etc. it's not a complicated concept, lol. an easier way for cap pilots to get around (it requires 2/3 of the skill training of a cap to use).this requires 2 more people, more fuel, and you have a range of 4 ly. they can't jump around by themselves."
10/23/2009,"for people who use jump bridges on a regular basis you will understand that everytime you switch system you need to reenter (99% of the time) the same password on your ship in order to use the next bridge. this can grate after multiple bridges need to be used and seems a bit uneccessary. i propose that the password be saved on your ship until you change it or logout. people who don't have access should support this on the grounds of making 0.0 more accessible to the general player in the future, it's akin to being asked to enter a password everytime you want to dock in a hisec station."
10/23/2009,"it *is* saved per session. just that every jump, dock/undock, bridging *is* a session change in ccp's terms. ;)"
10/23/2009,"notice i removed the term ""session"" from my post before this response, knowing that some pedant would make this response."
10/23/2009,no. people who mess up the password then discover themselves outside the bubble and dying. dying is a good thing.
10/23/2009,well due to those st*p*d 5minute timers for postings my answer was typed like 30minutes ago. it just took ages until i could actually submit it. :p
10/23/2009,"don't worry about it man but to be honest i would think my idea of a ccp session is a lot different to your's, i'm thinking more along the lines of viking suits and kegs of beer vov.anyway i'm attempting to improve the usability accessibity of the game what's not to support?"
10/23/2009,you know you almost had me with the usability thingie ... but then he said something about killing. now i am undecided again.
10/23/2009,"internet tough guy has a somewhat valid point but he's not looking at the big picture, if you make 0.0 more user friendly you basically get more people into 0.0 which means a lot more targets.also jump bridge netowrks and poses nearly always have different passwords so you will still have people bouncing off pos shields, so it's not really a very strong counterpoint."
10/23/2009,"i had originally posted this in the ideas forum. i don't know why there's an ideas forum and this one, seems redundant but...anyhow here's that post:"

10/23/2009,"no they don't need 5-10mil sp :d you got to be kidding...however learning ""curve"" is pretty horrible in eve. you fly kestrel for like what, a week or maybe few days then you got a cruiser, then battleship in a month?... then uhm... yeah you don't really need anything else. what i mean is that t1 frigs are pretty useless very fast... it's not about giving more sp at start it's kinda relative nuclear physics or something.."
10/23/2009,"and for those of you who think this will make moving through 0.0 more difficult, consider this...if you look at the star map as it stands now, there are very few systems without sov. this proposal would really only impact those few systems where no one claims control. the rest of 0.0 would function much like it does now. this proposal just creates pockets of ""black"" space where no intel can be gathered on fleet sizes just by simply looking in local."
10/23/2009,"aha so you are proposing to use the sov markers as a kinds of frequency tower, activate the tower, activate local?wouldnt that counter why ccp has stated the sov changes in the first place?"
10/23/2009,"woo, page 2 of support!"
10/23/2009,would be perhaps the best change ever. all of us old guys know it.
10/23/2009,supported.
10/23/2009,"why does everyone only want local removed in 0.0, if you gonna do it do it good and remove it from lowsec and empire as well, that will make empire wars a heck of a lot more fun as well"
10/23/2009,"takes with one hand, gives with the other.+1"
10/23/2009,i fully support this idea.
10/23/2009,"think of it this way...your alliance controls 4 systems in a 6 system constellation. by placing the sov markers in those four systems, you gain all the benefits intended with the release of dominion. in my proposal, those four systems would be ""dark"" until the marker was dropped and the upgrade acquired for local ""intel"". then it would function just like it does now; it alerts anyone in system that a hostile is in local, and from what corp/alliance they belong to, nothing more. so the two systems that are ""dark"" would be potential sources of invasion or where a hostile fleet could operate unnoticed. think about the ramifications for a moment...cloaked ships would essentially disappear from existence. this would also make a black ops fleet more relevant without having to buff the ships directly. they could hide in a ""dark"" system and wait for a covert cyno to be dropped. who knows, the possibilities are dynamic and much more intriguing.but remember, this would also benefit those who wish to operate in 0.0 without being noticed just as much. covert mining ops with cloaked rorqs, transport ships and a super cap loitering at the only gate could make for a very interesting encounter.and if everyone started fitting cloaks, then all the penalties associated with cloaks come into play. there would be a targeting delay for most ships that would usually make a cloak prohibitive for a roaming gang. so pilots with probing skills would be invaluable as they scanned down such fleets. i would also say that while this idea would technically apply to all of known space, in reality, the empire factions (and npc 0.0 factions) would have fully functional local channels all the time. so empire space wouldn't change at all. unless you wanted to say certain constellations could ""go down"" for a short period of time, turning empire local into 0.0 local for sporadic time intervals. who knows, that's not the purpose of this proposal.very few systems would be without local intel. this proposal only creates opportunities for engagements in systems without sov where both fleets may be unaware of the other until the carnage ensues. i think that would be fun."
10/23/2009,"i don't think we've heard enough information yet about exactly what ccp's plans are. i would agree that there ought to be some degree of compromise - there are so many supercaps already out there that their current owners are set to have a distinct advantage for a very long time after a transition of this kind.we'll be seeing quite a lot of abortions if there's no mechanism to protect any of the outstanding jobs. what i suspect is going to happen is that supercap production is going to be linked to the new infrastructure hubs, which are going to be a lot harder to take down than your average pos, rather than outposts."
10/23/2009,imo there are at least an order of magnitude too many supercapitals active at the moment.
10/23/2009,supercapital abortions wont be as near as common as you think if alliance finances take a major hit post-dominion.
10/23/2009,my opinion ... htfu !!!my advice as a pro ninja... be tidy.. you won't have any problems if you don't leave a trail of wrecks for everyone to salvage... i don't care how you do it but if by the time you finish the mission you also finished salvaging ninja salvagers won't stay around you for very long.
10/23/2009,"consider the law of the sea regarding salvage... the owner of the property must negotiate with the salvor who retrieved the salvage. when you are running missions you are not the owners of those wrecks. that would be guristas or sancha's nation, or whoever's ships you blew up. legally, you would have no rights to the salvage any more than anyone else. salvage is a free for all. tbfh you should be glad that looting wrecks is counted as thief.not supported."
10/23/2009,"i don't ask for much in this game, i don't ask for boosts or nerfs, all i ask is that ccp give me/us what they said they were going to give us years ago.... an interbus lp store!so come on! lets get this into dominion, it can't be hard to implement surely? even if it means just having one system in the whole of eve where we can trade in our lp.thumbs up for this please. -------------------------------------------------"
10/23/2009,i can't see what interbus would offer.factional cargo expanders? o.o
10/23/2009,"ccp said this was coming out soonfrom here specifically. interbus: we are aware of the ""missing"" interbus station, it should be in-game q1-q2 next year.this obviously hasnt happened."
10/23/2009,"tl;dr, sry.like the idea. perhaps link it to the fleet broadcasts window, eve-mail,the cyno mechanics or even have an auto-convo window open to boot!ohhhhhh the possibilities....i have to go lie down now"
10/23/2009,"on the weekend of september 4 ... our illustrious csm were flown to ccp hq to represent the player base on numerous issues for a face -to- face meeting with ccp.7 weeks later ... we're still awaiting the results of that meeting ...sanitizing the minutes for public view should not take 7 weeks (49 days) or (1176 hours) or (70560 minutes) or (4,233,660 seconds)fyi ... everyday ccp makes us wait is taking away from the credibility of the whole csm program"
10/23/2009,.
10/23/2009,does it really matter tbh? csm = useless to the players. the minutes mean nothing.
10/23/2009,sure. we would finally hear how many free beer they got and what mushrooms mazzilliu tried.
10/23/2009,case example of player sentiment you think ccp would try to avoid ... no follow up doesn't help ...
10/23/2009,"gotta say, i didn't even know the meeting had happened yet. i don't pay the most attention to ccp/csm, but i troll the forums enough that i would have noticed if minutes had been posted, i'd like to see those, even if past csm's have proven themselves next to useless. guess we'll have to wait and see if these did anything good.of course, to see that, minutes will have to be provided."
10/23/2009,"after fanfest, someone posted saying that the minutes had to wait for information from ccp that couldn't be given until after fanfest. i read this, and thought it made sense. however, a lot of drama could have been avoided if they had clearly stated weeks before that it wouldn't be until after fanfest.its been 2 weeks since that post, and the minutes still aren't available. now, its gone from mismanaging information into negligence. if someone doesn't want to do the work, don't run for csm, and especially don't accept the secretary job."
10/23/2009,"yup. current csm sucks. need to set some standards imo.edit: and if it's so bloody secret (), then at least tell us that your are busy plotting how to best take advantage of teh situation up ahead. i it took you this long, so you're probably way past the the point of ""saying nothing and remain inconspious while hiding behind the banner of stupidity""."
10/23/2009,"look, no one important cares. you cant have your minutes.now quiet down and go look at our pretty dev blogs.look youtube!we are a 21st century company allright what, you still aren't happy? stop telling everyone or marketing is going to yell at us again.no, we really mean it."
10/23/2009,"your primary assumption (that the csm still has any credibility left after mazz got done with it) is flawed, and thus your argument doesn't matter.i am now adopting an attitude of ""until it's in the patch notes, it's not happening""."
10/23/2009,oops .. my bad
10/23/2009,"i think several members of the csm do still have some credibility, and are working hard. its just a minority of members actually not doing their job, not acting ethically, or just who like trolling people a bit too much.the euni guy seems to be doing well, with a lot of issues brought to the table. erik and avalloc brought a few themselves. some of the others might not have raised as many issues, but they've contributed in meeting minutes."
10/23/2009,yes please.
10/23/2009,no reason i can see not to incorporate this...good idea op
10/23/2009,"for the wallet only. i don't believe there's similar options for the journal or eve mail (or at least i haven't found them).and the journal i want to see blink when i've completed a mission, but why should i have to open it up to stop the blink? i know i've completed the mission now and there is nothing in the journal i need to look at.so, still doesn't solve the problem of you want it to blink, but don't need to open when it does."

10/23/2009,"this is just not a good idea. nobody goes to low-sec mission not because they are not lucrative (since there are bunch of q20 l4 and high-qual lvl5 agents there already)but because anyone with a sane mind will not drive a pve fitted ship into a pvp area, neither will someone use a pvp ship to do missions. want to buff low-sec? at least do it not at the high-sec's expense."
10/23/2009,"beside the ""small"" advantage that missiles don't care about tracking and so can work at short and long range without problems while guns can't, what pvp capabilities has your cerberus? seriously, a cerberus tanked to do a level 4 mission, as you claim to do, has no tackling gear and probably an active tank (or your completion time for missions is so low that you get maybe 10 millions/hour if the wrecks don't despawn before the end of the mission), so it is a awful ship for solo or small gang pvp. the only pvp option i see for the ship to claim to use , if fitted to do a mission, is to be to stay away from the mission entry point and warp out in a hurry if someone warp in."
10/23/2009,"you know how they put the tech level on the corner of the item in thumbnail. i was wondering if there was someway for them to label mods with thier meta level. instead of memorizing or looking in the show info. tech information is just as important as meta level. this would also make sorting through loot found a lot eaiser when you got a massive haul from corpmate, rat kill, or pvp kill.i could get up off my lazy butt and memorize everything but i only bother with the stuff i use, and given how many items are actually in eve i wonder if this wouldn't be too much of a hassle or if anyone else has any reasons why this hasn't been implemented?"

10/23/2009,"i'd argue that not knowing how to deal with an issue doesn't mean you don't care about it. far from it. as a candidate i strive to be a democrat, acting whatever way my surveys tell me to, so i can't know in advance what issues i'll be championing or how i would vote on things. how does such an approach factor into your program as it is now?edit: sorry about the character mixup, i'm aynen, i just sometimes forget to switch to that character as it has this one automatically selected."
10/23/2009,"it is less about the candidate voting no opinion and more about the user voting 'no opinion/dont care'. if an issue doesnt matter to the user, one could argue that the answer of a candidate has no effect on the fidelity score one way or another:if i dont care about bombs in low sec, it doesn't matter if a candidate supports the idea, doesn't support it or also doesnt care because... well whatever it turns out to be - i dont care! however, i choose to award a lower, but positive fidelity score if both you and the candidate dont care.i admit that i do feel a candidate should be knowledgable in all parts of the game, even if it is only the basics. if an issue comes up that you dont know about, you should research it to form a proper opinion. the csm process needs people who can make informed descisions to support or not support an issue, not people who dont care or dont know and just roll the dice (remember, as a councillor you can only agree or disagree with an issue, there is no 'dont care' option in our meetings). as such, i want to encourage candidates to take an actual position on issues. afterall, the only thing you show as a candidate who votes a lot of 'dont know/dont care' is that you know or care very little about the game."

10/24/2009,"trying to create more dept to the current system seems much more reasonable. without such progression it is more of an miniprofession, than a career you can dedicate yourself to. my support is for that basic concept, not for this specific proposal.one basic way to do this would be to add new sites or phenomena, that require their own skill or skill set to make available. these sites should provide their own set of rewards on top of the normal ones, so they would retain their value for explorers regardless of what happens with other professions in eve."
10/24/2009,"it's reasonable for ccp to lower the threshold for getting into the exploration profession (new players should feel like they can do that without waiting weeks), but the op has a solid gold proposal in simultaneously expanding the skill set at the top. that way everyone who long ago invested the time in electronic upgrades v and survey v and poured their hard-waiting-on sp into astrometrics, hacking, and archeology will still be validated for having done so. i'd also recommend making the good sites harder to pin down (and wormholes even more so) and boosting the strength of npcs found in them. that way the brand new player who can scan things down and exploit what he/she finds still needs some help from a corpmate or more time spent on combat skills in order to get at the bounty."

10/24/2009,"the proposalthe blueprint lockdown ui is an infuriating experience when you use it to locking down multiple bpos. if my memory serves me, it has been this way since the beginning of eve and it is in dire need of some love. ccp is aware that the ui is a problem; the lockdown ui has been a source of many complains over the years. my reason for raising this issue is to get its priority raised on their todo list. my hope is that team fibonacci (who deblogged about the apply to join button several months ago) is still active and can fix this for dominion or the first patch after dominion.the problemthe lockdown process is used by corporate directors and ceos to make bpos held in a corporate office impossible to remove without a shareholder vote. if you were to go and buy a brand-new bpo off the market and lock it down, you need to perform the following steps:1. break the bpo out of its wrapper. (any bpo that is still stackable - indicated by a number in the bottom right corner - cannot be locked down.)1a. right-click bpo1b. select material research (manufacturing works too)1c. click pick installation1d. select an assembly line from the list1e. click use assemblyline1f. click ok to go to the quote screen (this is the part where the wrapper is broken)1g. click close (canceling the research)1h. click cancel (this time for the initial me options screen)2. right click bpo3. select propose lockdown vote4. click okthen, in the vote screen (we won't count those clicks because you only need to bring it up once to vote for all the lockdowns):1. click the lockdown vote's header2. click voteand notice how this screen doesn't even update when you've clicked vote - there's no indication that you've clicked the button, so you have to close the header and re-open it to ensure that your vote was cast. +2 clicks.in total, locking down a brand-new bpo is an astonishing 15 clicks! i usually buy bpos in batches of 10-20, so that's between 150 and 300 clicks.the solutionthere are several things i would like to see done to make this process less annoying.* the propose lockdown vote option should be enabled for blueprints still in their wrappers. proposing a vote should break the blueprint out of its wrapper automatically. * the propose lockdown vote should be able to spawn votes for a mass of bpos if you shift-select them all and propose the vote.* the voting screen should look like the (very badly drawn) mockup below (link for those with images disabled). those little circles are radio buttons. clicking on the yes/no headers should select yes/no for all the votes shown. please visit your user settings to re-enable images.i am aware that for general votes, you can have more than two options. keeping the existing ui for general votes and breaking all other vote types off in to their own tab is a viable solution; after all, how many people are having problems with general vote spam?we also may need another tab to show votes that are still pending but you've already cast your vote in.edit: added a link to the mockup image for those with images disabled..."

10/24/2009,"i think this would be difficult to do for huge battles. however, battlefield2 already includes a feature where you can get at this exact type of recording within 48 hours of it happening. other precedents are fighter pilot training. this would be an excellent addition, with regards to all eve movies, being able to essentially edit the battles together from multiple angles. for another independent developer that already has this implemented, aces high 2 (wwii mmo flight sim) allows recording of this data, for later editing in dev provided client to play back such files. i really think the awesome videos that will end up on utube from this feature would seriously benefit ccp, and all the rest of us, by virtue of awesome pr depiction of the eve combat space. note, i also think this kind of data service should be included in incarna, to allow for advanced machinima and lols. i'm going to go out there for a second, and say that if ccp could deliver a browser plugin (or make the transfer an open format so one could be written), wouldn't it be epic to be able to watch any kill on a killboard from any pilots perspective?totally a good idea and supported."

10/24/2009,"while i think the idea may have merit, don't forget that armour tankers don't have an equivalent to the shield boost amplifier.still, if a way can be found to implement this without it being overpowered when combined with sbas, i think it's a reasonable proposal.tentative(due to balance concerns) thumbs up."

10/24/2009,i thought about something like this once.
10/24/2009,"i do think this is a pretty cool idea and perhaps useful in many cases. i would add that if one is not already operating in a fleet or on audio with friendlies nearby, by the time a distress call is issued and responded to, the carebear is dead and his wreck looted. things happen very quickly in low and null sec systems and a good pirate won't stick around long unless he knows he has the backup support to take on would be rescuers.also, a distress call may not be noticed unless an alert noise was associated with it as many people minimize the many hordes of windows on their screen during gameplay.i typically monitor local and our special private channel (or fleet) and minimize everything else."
10/24/2009,"while a nice idea, i think that all the pirate who may (ab)use the distress call system (going to people in distress, or posing as one) will cause the regular players not to use it."
10/24/2009,"i absolutely support this proposal. the lag induced by the info screen when looking at a player's (or player corp's!) standings is terrible. after all, who cares about any agent's random staring-straight-forward mug? a plain list of agents with their npc corp logos would be a 100% improvement."
10/24/2009,"in a attempt to fix the broken bounty system it seem that eve-radio has taken on themselves to code their own bounty system in to a web site. the problem is that they need to be able to confirm that the bounty hunter has in fact killed the mark. to do this they require the full api key of the bounty hunter so that they can pull the kill-mail directly from the server, that way they don't have to rely on potentially faked kill mails.no one in their right mind (or at least very few) will give them their full api key as it allows access to to all the information of that persons account, everything. it seem that when ccp codes mechanics and systems that deal with trusting others and access to information ccp tend to make that access/capability monolithic, meaning all or nothing (see corp roles and access to pos/hangers). the solution to this problem is once again granularity and user definability. in addition to the default api access templates full & limited allow a third type of template, custom.with this custom template the user can specify what sections of the profile about them stored on the database they want the access template to expose. a key is then generated and associated with this template. that way if a bounty hunter wants to use this service he can make a custom template that only allows the kill-mail information to be accessed and not any thing else about them. or say someone wants to join a corp they can make a custom template of only the information required by the corp that they are comfortable giving access to."
10/24/2009,this could be a good thing... or a really bad thing depending on whats involved in the coding.but i think its a good idea.supported.
10/24/2009,"why arte you blaming the csm for this delay? it's only their fault half the time. have you asked meissa where the holdup is? is it a problem with the secretary not getting the stuff to ccp for approval, is it a problem with ccp not giving approval, or is it trapped in limbo somewhere? i'm not going to blindly condemn the csm for something that quite possibly isn't their fault."
10/24/2009,"the delay isn't really the problem - it's the total lack of communication. if one of the csms were to post saying 'yeah, the minutes are written up, we're just waiting for ccp to ok their release', that would be fine."

10/24/2009,"from the survey i am running, i'm allready seeing some things i feel i'd need to adress as a csm member, if i am to be voted in. first and foremost, a bit of solid foundation needs to be layed. currently, the csm can champion suggestions made in the assembly hall, but if you compare the suggestions made there with the survey results you'll notice that the many amounts of suggestions and comments on things like missioning and exploration, which do well in the survey, aren't that common in the assembly hall. and the new shiptypes that are the most popular demand of what ccp should work on next in the survey aren't even mentioned as suggestions in the assembly hall. important to note here is that i didn't just advertise my survey on the forums, i also did ingame. this, i believe is how the difference emerged. i feel that the forum, or atleast the assembly hall, attracts a certain type of eve player moreso than others, so people who stay ingame and don't bother with the forum won't see their issues be worked at by the csm. the logical conclusion isn't to convince 300,000 players to change their behaviour, it's to get the csm to come to them. i'd strive for better ingame tools for the csm to use, and also for the players to use to get to the csm. ingame survey tools, ingame sheets that show what the csm is upto, ingame logs of their meetings. ingame is where most players are, and appearantly where they want to stay. but this also means that the assembly hall is not a good basis for the csm to work with as a source for their suggestions to ccp, as it shows a distorted picture of what the playerbase as a whole wants. so the whole assembly hall needs to be transfered to in the game aswell.ofcourse, these steps aren't actual gameplay changes or additions, but they are the groundwork that needs to be layed so future csms will suggest gameplay changes and additions to ccp that are really representative of the whole playerbase, and not of a small segment there-of.edit: the survey is still ongoing, if you haven't had your say yet, you have your chance here:"

10/25/2009,"so, for the over 9000th time, i'm going to complain about how blasters need to be boosted.for their current damage output, they do not have enough range to be effective. they're supposed to be a ""cross"" between pulse lasers and autocannons, therefore, their optimal and falloff should be a bit higher than 0kms (ok, i'm exagerating, but you get my point).this makes blaster boats highly inneffective in combat, such as the deimos, for example. i've stopped flying them for pvp completely, because they just get slaughtered (mainly because of the fact that it is indeed a crappy ship overall). and, on that note, i'd choose a vagabond over a deimos anyday to pvp in, or even a zealot.but anyways, the deimos isn't the subject of this post. the fact that you can hit up to 45km with pulse lasers and scorch ammo (and still do a lot of damage) is pretty overpowered compared to the not-so-powerful-anymore, range-defficient blasters.currently, gallente ships are a very hard choice for large fleet engagements, since blasters don't hit far enough, thus forcing us to use failguns instead (see what i did there?). let me put some ratio numbers in here:gun type - dps (dmg mod x hi dmg ammo / rof) - optimal + falloff - ratio [dps x (optimal + falloff)]neutron blaster cannon ii - 4.2 x 48 / 7.88 - 3,600 + 10,000 - 347,939800mm repeating artillery - 3.234 x 48 / 7.88 - 2,400 + 19,000 - 421,569mega pulse laser ii - 3.6 x 48 / 7.88 - 12,000 + 8,000 - 0.03375 - 438,578425mm railgun ii - 3.3 x 48 / 9.56 - 28,500 + 24,000 - 869,8741400mm howitzer artillery ii - 12.807 x 48 / 40.16 - 24,000 + 35,000 - 903,123tachyon beam laser ii - 5.4 x 48 / 12.50 - 26,000 + 20,000 - 953,856solution: either increase blasters' damage to match their ridiculous range or increase their ridiculous range to match their damage.i feel like i've covered most of the aspects in this post, so, support (or flame) away!edit: moar numberz."
10/25/2009,"if you increase range you crowd out autocannons completely (in bs level this is actually already true). damage increase at point blank, maybe but it<U+FFFD>s more like lasers doing too much real dps. you could increase speed but not agility of blaster boats, allowing them to close on targets bit faster. maybe."
10/25/2009,"i agree with your post, but autocannons are getting boosted in dominion :) now, i don't know how that's gonna turn out, but yes, i think that to lasers (and even acs, regarding the falloff) they are underpowered. and yes, increasing speed would be an awesome solution to this problem. thank you for your feedback!"
10/25/2009,"but what about caldari ships? i know their intended for use with railguns, but their bonuses also apply to blasters. i think a boost to optimal is the easiest solution, allthough that would be against the filosophy of blasters. increased tracking and damage would be more in line with the intended function of blasters."
10/25/2009,"absolutly true.the recent changes to the vigilant (+60% hybrid damage) and how great it works shows us what the blasters should really be. they need to do more damage (20-25% more), keep the current range.about the deimos, it needs to have a definite purpose. right now, it is absolutly worthless with blasters, a brutix is a dozen times cheaper to lose and does exactly the same thing. i suggest giving the deimos even more damage or more speed or more range, but something to make it worth flying over a brutix."
10/25/2009,"medium blasters have embarrassing range. large blasters aren't as bad. ps: i don't like when i sit at point blank range next to a webbed amarr ship, and it does nearly as much damage with lasers. an armageddon with 7 mega pulse laser 2's, 5 t2 ogres and 3 damage mods deals ~1150 dps with all skills at lvl 5, and higher damage ammo type. megathron with 7 neutron blaster cannons 2 and 5 t2 ogres deals 1200 damage with 3 damge mods and void ammo.. range of mega (optimal+falloff) is 27km, range of geddon is 55 km.. that is with long-range ammunition.with armogeddon having 2 times grater range, this is not right."

10/25/2009,"i'm gona take issue with this bit first.you keep bringing up the ""one mid slot coercer"". stop it, destroyers in general suck, ccp knows it, players know it, if you don't know it, your literally the only one. there's exactly one good destroyer, the thrasher, the rest are in dire need of revamping, and its been a complaint of players for quite some time.your almost purposely misconstruing what i'm asking for on the ship by comparing moving an non weapon fitting high slot to a mid slot to allow it to a mod that helps it keep dps on almost every other ship in game, to giving a damage bonus to an ewar ship.the retribution does in fact specialize in a role right now, it sucks. all by itself.if you were going to have af's in a gang (because honestly right now, in 0.0 they are the bottom rung of the food chain) you would want any other af besides the retribution, simply because it does not have any ability to tackle. your blinding yourself to the fact that most pilots in dps ships are expected to, and want to be able to stop an opponent from warping away on their own, and your also being blind to the fact that every other dps ship in the gameevery otheronecan do that (except for your crappy example in the coercer, a ship in a class so hopelessly broken that only a complete revamp could save them).by your own argument (that the ship is a weapons platform only), the ability to fit the now changed scrams becomes a near must for ships like af's so that they do have the option of keeping damage on a larger target by disabling the mwd capabilities and using the ab to keep safely in range."

10/25/2009,"the 'peace of mind' you seek comes from having comrades who will defend your csaa pos and blow up anyone who comes along trying to harm it. this is 0.0, security should come through diplomacy and firepower.why?we've seen a plague of titans over the last 2 years and a large factor in that was sov4 allowing any small-midsized alliance to plonk down 3 outposts and start churning them out under a blanket of invulnerability. you are complaining that supercaps will die more and be harder to safely mass produce, but you seem not to understand that that's exactly what ccp want."
10/25/2009,"these goals are incompatible; if supercaps become harder to build, their prices will increase to match. that's not going to make people more likely to want to field them in front-line combat. yes, we're looking at a 10% drop in material requirements for motherships due to the removal of clone vat bays, but that will easily be cancelled out. there needs to be something a bit more substantial than a standard deathstar pos if ccp's objective is for prices to remain the same."

10/25/2009,"this is a great plan, i holeheartedly agree.i doubt ccp would do it though, because they intend to remove local as an intel source. seriously, why would a ship that is trying to be stealthy broadcast that its in system to everyone? local needs to be removed and a very effective directionnal scanner needs to replace it."

10/26/2009,"following my thread in the features&ideas section + the positive reaction i want to post this here.on my way searching through the lp stores i found some items that imo need some buff.example 1: cap rechargers. t2 gives a 20%bonus to cap recharge, faction give the same bonus with a little less cpu need, and then we have the uber-expensive officer mods. my proposal would be to buff the primary effect on the mods; e.g cap recharge rate; while leaving the fitting req. the same. maybe give the faction cr a 24% bonusexample 2: eanm's. this is more fed navy specific but it also needs a boost of at least 10% to be comparable to the amarr version.feel free to add other mods"

10/26/2009,"hi ccp et al,character scamming has become more and more prevalent these days which produced three major issues;1) highly frustrating for players2) causes a huge workload for gms to back trace the isk3) gms are tied up with resolving this work load than focusing on other areasfrom a players point if view, there is nothing more aggrovating than waiting for your isk to be returned because of a ""loophole"" in the system.from ccps point of view, you're having to pay people to resolve the issue, i.e. financial lossso - if there isn't an alternative method found then the financial cost incurred to ccp via paying a member of staff to resolve the issue will be, in effect, astronomical.proposal1) change the process by which one can edit the e-mail address associated with your eve online account. this step is vital for the process2) when wanting to sell a character, you must log this via a ""portal"" on the eve-o website.3) this ""portal"" sends an e-mail to the e-mail addy which contain a confirmation link which must be clicked, i.e. similar approach to when you sign up to a forum to confirm who you are etc.4) when posting a new topic in the character bazzarre, a new option is added where by you must select if you are selling or putting a wtb thread up. you will only get the option available if you have gone through the process described above. also, the thread will have some sort of recognisable confirmation on it to show the sales thread is valid.5) character sale process continues as it is now.the way in which i propose and e-mail address is edited is via the following method;1) log into account management section.2) load the edit account details page3) change the ability to ""free text"" change the e-mail addy to where you have to click on a link called ""change you're e-mail address""4) that then generates an e-mail which is sent to your existing e-mail addy, the e-mail contains a link which must be clicked & then you can change your e-mail addy there.this system should make scamming on the character bizarre much harder but could have two painful bi-products.1) scammers try and attain e-mail address passwords which could be more harmful than good.2) problems stemming from the system not working or scammers petitioning that they can't log a sales thread and bully a low-down gm into allowing a sales thread to be posted without prior authorisation from the steps highlighted above.still, its an idea and i'm sure its full of typo's & loop holes and will cost millions & millions of pounds to implement but figured i'd share.<3 to all.grootedits 1) removed typos & tried to make the post read better2) have thought more about the systems described and elaborated on potential downfalls."

10/26/2009,do it.
10/26/2009,this is the most beautiful thing i've ever read. true story.
10/26/2009,"this is a good idea, but there should be an alternate way as well (for instance, if you lose access to your e-mail account via switching isps or losing the password, etc). i think a simple call to your nearest ccp gm (hopefully via telephone) to verify ownership of the account.another method is the common 'security question'. this could be required whenever making any changes to the personal data on your account.in either case, i support this measure."
10/26/2009,"hi chap, thanks for your support. thought i'd answer the points you've raised & hopefully we could, together, figure out a way of improving the original proposal as i alone can't get it to 100% resistances across the board. oh my words eve-jokes are laim.i had considered having the option to contact a gm (in which ever form that may take) but thought the work load incurred by this could be much highers & introduce a human element into the equation which could open up a loophole, i.e. scammer pretending that they'd recently changes isp & no longer have access to e-mail account. so is there an alternative method?also - security question is an entirely valid option and is an argument which holds a lot of water. my only concern at this point was how willing people are to ""release"" that information to ccp. and am not intending to put a negative slant on either side here, was just a thought.still - i like your thinking dude, a lot. do reply here if you can think of a way of adjusting/revamping the proposal so as it'll be safer, easier to use and incur less ongoing costs (time or cash wise) on both the players & ccps time.groot"

10/26/2009,"it's been brought up time and time again - why can't you move drones from the cargohold to the dronebay?answer - because then you'll have 600m2-dronebay-domis-of-death constantly spewing out legions of drones at you, and it would be painful.fair enough, refilling your dronebay while in combat is a bad idea. but what about when you're stuck in a wormhole and the sleepers just killed off a wave of your hammerheads?or you've made it through a fight, gone to a safe and want to re-drone?to stop a massive imbalance in pvp, yet still enable drone users to do what you can with every other type of ammo, perhaps we can leverage an existing ingame mechanism and tie it to our dronebay restocking problem.it's fair enough to say that if you're engaged in a pvp battle you're going to have an aggression timer, so how about aslong as you don't have an aggression timer you can move drones from your cargohold to your dronebay.this would then allow drone users to do what all other ammo types can already, yet still prevent them from gaining an unfair advantage in a fight.tldr; allow drone movement from cargohold to dronebay aslong as you don't have an aggression timer."

10/26/2009,if you dont have an aggression timer you can also dock and refill your drone bay or warp to a pos and refill it on the ship maintenance array.
10/26/2009,as long as you have an easily accessable station or pos lying around./me supports proposal
10/26/2009,"i do think the pvp balance comes first, but also think you should be able restock your dronebay in some way from the drones in your cargobay. add scotty the drone bay manager with his timers, if it is needed, but this would be a nice thing to have anyway."
10/26/2009,"while ratting i got lag and disconnected from my drones. had to fly up and pull into dronebay, but not before accidentally pulling one into cargo. annoying had to go 5 jumps back to put it right."
10/26/2009,1
10/26/2009,"ok since nobody else pointed out that ccp already answered this question and why, here's the issue with this proposal.by allowing drones to be moved from cargo to drone bay, you are forgoing the preset balance of the size of the drone bay. granted, i would love to be able to scoop drones from the field and reuse them after i lost some other drones. but it threatens the game balance and is therefore a bad idea.so no support."
10/26/2009,"i dunno, is it that easy to create free websites? i realize tinyurl can do that sort of thing, but then you can just put ""tinyurl"" in the block list and it would take care of that. i would think it's certainly more difficult to create a brand new web site than to create a new email address to use for a fake trial account as they do now. this won't help at all. we'd be no better off than we are today. if folks are inclined to buy the isk, they'll ignore the motd when they see the isk seller. but if they never see the isk selling spam in the first place, they'll never know about it."

10/26/2009,"you may note that i used the word 'if'.like everyone else, i'm in the dark regarding ccp's exact intentions in this matter. my concern is simply that even after all the positive changes, the price hikes that will inevitably result from the loss of sov 4 are going to deter the vast majority of pilots from using supercaps in combat. in situations where any doubt exists as to the outcome, people are already reluctant enough to bring them to bear.a price hike will also give people who already possess supercaps a significant, self-perpetuating advantage over those who don't. not that i particularly care."
10/26/2009,"so current domination timeframe looks like this if i'm not mistaken:start of december expansion and new sov system is introduced but sov is locked for 3 more weeks in the state it was right before dominion got deployed.this puts the end of the sov lock period right at the begin of the holiday season.i think it would be a nice to prolong this period for another 2 weeks since there are a lot of people who will be spending the holidays with family and friends and not playing an mmo, yes, i know it sounds weird bit it is true or even better, spend an extra 2 weeks working the kinks out of the expansion, deploy it mid december and then have the 3 week lock period."

10/26/2009,"""chat was never intended to be an intel tool"" (c) ccp.do you think this attitude has changed since it was said?"
10/26/2009,"tl;dr: no matter what happens or doesn't happen with local, the ability to manage that information in a better way is needed.while i agree that it should get a nerf, that change in no way would make this feature reduntant. even if i only see a limited part of the people in the system, i still could use the ability to filter or sort them by what is actually important. you know just like the overview, so you can set it up to show only the relevant info, instead of spamming it with all kinds of space rubbish. it doesn't have to show anything extra, just sort by importance.then there is the cold and hard reality, that local isn't going to be removed from empire space. it will propably stay in 0.0 too in the form of infrastructure upgrades. when i buy stuff in jita, i don't need to see the thousand trade alts. i need to know how many wartargets are out doing the same thing, without having to scroll up and down the infinite list of people every 5 seconds for updates. same thing in a station system with people who are not blue.again this won't give any extra information, but only allows you to filter/sort by your needs. it wouldn't make local any more overpowered then it already is and even after any possible changes, this feature would remain useful.they failed horribly and haven't done anything about the fact for years, so it seems reasonable to think it doesn't bother them that much. i also deal with the reality of how things are now and i'm not too conserned with how a wide eyed naive dev saw the situation when he first thought about it. obviously it is an intel tool, a useful one and as i said could use a nerf, but that in no way means it should be left in the condition it currently is. ccp should either fix it, if it isn't working as intended, or shut up and start adjusting to the fact it isn't going to go away. i don't care what they choose to do with it, but i want the ability to manage the information ccp decides i'm allowed to know."
10/26/2009,i cannot support the removal of local and this which turns local into an idiots intel tool.
10/26/2009,"allow me to be a bit clearer.local, being used for intel, in any space, is wrong.its a chat window, thats it. empire, low sec, 0.0, it should all be the same, a blank window unless someone is talking, and in that case it should simply have what was said. the list of people in local is so ridiculous in concept i can't believe it ever made it into the game.again, a chat window should never, ever, be used for combat purposes.if you want to change things, think of ways to modify the scanner to provide limited friend of foe information, as no player should ever benefit from an ""all seeing eye"" chat window in any form."
10/26/2009,"completely agree, change local to be like wh space, give us a better d-scan or an actual intel mechanic that is not so op."
10/26/2009,"what most of these topics touch on, yet fail to mention in any direct sense is simply this...... the rule of law in empire space.there is alot lacking in this aspect. i don't think i've ever been fined for carrying contraband materials past more customs agents than i can count... more than a few times... why is this?are the ai's not functioning as they should be? did someone at the office switch them off years ago, and forget to turn them back on again??should'nt some offenses be a regional/constalation related matter, and not require concord's involment? ... what exactly do all the various ""security forces/police"" do... aside from float around as window dressing?did'nt mean to hi-jack your topic, but i just thought it needed saying... aloud for once."

10/27/2009,this has been pointed out before in the thread as the bay should only be able to be used in space and there should be a maximum amount of drones which takes the fighters in the repair bay and the fighters in the drone bay both into account.however as i'm not sure how the code would work i'm going to stick with the repair bay so far as in my opinion it creates a better overview instead of having to scroll through a list of drones to see the repairing drones.

10/27/2009,"it seems dominion will fix a lot of things, but well... there are tons more to be fixed.for a long time every race have a close range has, which is more lego-focused, allowing for the use of creative setups. point is minmatar have vagas, caldari, even though they don't like close range have ham cerbs, gallente have ishtars, amarr zealots are actually performing quite well with pulses and sacri is good too. only deimos, despite the great dps is useless in his role, it can't be shield tanked, it can't be active armor tanked, it has terrible optimal(2km lol).so obviously we have one role for it - the long range segment. long range hacs started as mere anti-support and became fearsome fleets of vultures, with exelent range, dps and agility, today they are prefered by many alliances, no matter large or small. and sadly, at the moment there are only 2 heavy assalut ships, which perform well enough in this role - zealot, the supreme lr hac and muninn with it's natural shield tanking and most of all - devastating alpha. deimos in it's current state is more ""along for the ride"" in such fleets, and eagle, which is made for this is the worst of all. so i'll try to put some numbers in:zealot:114km optimal290 dps719 alpha1654 m/s309mm base scan resmuninn:114km optimal224 dps1448 alpha1616 m/s294mm base scan resdeimos:91km optimal235 dps824 alpha270mm base scan res1657 m/seagle(using cn lead):105km optimal216 dps758 alpha252mm base scan res1354 m/sthis is what i can think of, similar setups, 3 damage mods, 3 optimal mods(2 for eagle), mwd. the difference is more than obvious. and more, eagle with it's terrible scan res, dps and alpha and been 300 m/s slower than the others is pracly useless. next one is deimos, which has terrible optimal range and the 2nd worst dps/alpha combination, also the worst tracking, 2nd worst scan res. comparison to zealot is pointless. and last, comparing signature radius for the 4 ships - zealot 125m2, muninn 130m2, deimos 160m2(30% more than zealot), eagle 175m2(50% more than zealot).it's been like this since the zealot buff a while ago, but things gotta change a bit, i'm tired of flying zealot in the all-zealot fleets.this can be fixed in many ways. easiest one is switching deimos falloff bonus for 5% optimal one, boosting dps of med rails by maybe 20%? with such stats it's gonna be kinda comparable to muninn and still subpar to omnizealot in every possible way. also it will make the eagle kinda... worth to fly at least? it ofc needs speed a scan res boost and possibly some reduction in base sig radius.saying this, i've been flying a zealot for some time now and it kinda makes me sad when i join fleet and see 20-30 zealots, 5 muninns, 2 deimoses and if there is, by some miracle, an eagle in fleet people laught at him to the point he switches to a ceptor/falcon/dictor/noobship/shuttle(yeah, we're very mean).deimos and eagle desperately need some boost."

10/27/2009,"started amarr, cross trained minnie and caldari, can't see a reason to use a caldari hac at all atm, and my galent alt would rather fly a phobos than a deimos."
10/27/2009,"the diemos need some work. the eagle is a hard topic to, it is not a bad hac, it is just a over specialized one in my opinion.problems with the eagle are powergrid(at least enough to fit 5x250mm + mwd would be nice) and the utility high slot that might be better used as med or low slot(similar to muninn that also needs a med or low more and a high less).then again i<U+FFFD>m not a eagle pilot, and might overlook some important things on it. if you give the diemos a optimal bonus you nerf the blaster diemos with this and the eagle to. also this kind of general med rail boost might look ok compared to a beam zealot but in general it<U+FFFD>s a lot to much(since it would be the gun with the most dps and range at the same time). on a diemos with optimal range bonus it would also outdo eagle and muninn by a fair amount with this and might break even with the zealot. in general it is not a good idea to work with optimal bonuses on the diemos, since you will wrack the long range balance pretty quickly, at least for eagle and muninn.there is a large diemos thread on shc about what to do with it atm, it mostly boils down to more speed/agility or more flexible blaster and medium range(20-70km) rail hac while both ideas also increase the durability a bit."
10/27/2009,"ishtar is for sniping, deimos is for blasting/dying.i would agree though that the eagle needs more damage/more pg, and the deimos needs to be able to survive better."
10/27/2009,"well, if you put it that way..."
10/27/2009,didn't the eagle get the same turret boost as the zealot?besides i still consider the cerberus the better ship for long range hac gangs.
10/27/2009,"the deimos needs alot more powergrid.i need to fit 2 anciliariy current routers on mine to be able to make a decent fit.and it needs more damage, plain and simple.either give the deimos more range or speed, but basically make it something else than an overpriced brutix. i personally think it needs more damage and speed (to close on enemies faster). vigilant gets a +60% damage bonus in the next patch, give the deimos +20 to +35%.eagle is a bit meh.. give it more damage or even more optimal (not sure about this one, though)."
10/27/2009,"i disagree here. eagle is useless in current state, there's no balance, so comparing it here is pointless. 5% optimal per level will mean somewhere around 114km, which is the same as zealot and muninn. also, don't forget muninn has twice the alpha of a deimos with better tracking. it's a fair trade-off. i'm not sure what you mean with ""medium range"" hac and really don't wanna know, cuz nobody actually flies such things. as simple as that. and about the ""gun with most dps and range"", god save us, nothing should be even comparable to a zealot and nothing should get even with it. even if deimos has the same dps as a zealot, the zealot has more favourable dmg type, more scan res, 30% les sig radius and more optimal.so i completely fail to see the point of your objections."
10/27/2009,"ugh, i want to support the idea behind the topic (boost eagle and deimos) while strongly disagreeing with most of the content in the op. the deimos doesn't need to be yet another sniper hac, and i like the idea of its role as a scram-range face melter. what it needs is more survivability in that role - some of the vaga's ability to disengage and gtfo when things turn sour. i'd really like to see it and the enyo redesigned as shield tankers, but... yeah, that isn't happening. anyway, agree the deimos needs a fix, don't like your ideas at all.speed aside, the eagle's actually kind of sort of ok - with cn thorium rather than lead it can do 243 dps/100km optimal, and tracks significantly better than any other sniper hac. the problem is grid - making it work requires an acr and an rcu ii. with deimos-like grid, you could drop the rcu for an od, and it would have speed and agility similar to the muninn/zealot."
10/27/2009,"eagle holds a tracking advantage at 100km and gets better with any km you go over 100km since it will still work in optimal where other hacs drop into falloff. the main problem with it you would need a full fleet of eagles to use this advantage, since you will have a hard time in a mixed fleet with it(you only can use the tracking bonus of faction ammo at ranges where other need t2 long range ammo). it got one more low slot so it will out range and out damage a muninn. it also got more base lock range so it will need one less sb(what you can use for tracking or optimal). the diemos with a optimal bonus got the better base stats(lock range, turret optimal, dps) and one more low slot. by this it outdoes the muninn. it also out damages the eagle at 100-120km. something that can play in the same role as a heavy puls zealot reasonable well with rails. it is also a lot worse at 100km sniping than it is atm.at the same time it also fixes the close range diemos, instead to nerf it even more. you can use rails on a lot more ships than just the diemos and eagle and you try to buff the weapon directly to compete with the best long range hac that has the strongest damage bonuses an the optimal slot layout for it."
10/27/2009,"currently, dedicated remote repair ships only come in one flavor; the cruiser sized logistics.i would like to see that role expanded to frigate hulls as well. the logical choice would be tech ii variations of the bantam/navistas/tormentor/burst frigates.this would, in my opinion, be a nice addition to frigate gangs, as well as an ""introduction"" to logistics for newer players.i am thinking assault ship resistance/tank (maybe slightly less), no drone bay, enough powergrid, cpu and capacitor to accomodate a speed module plus some self tank/capacitor upgrades. they should be limited to fitting the small shield transporters/remote armor repairers.not so sure about carrying over energy transfer or tracking links from the cruiser sized ships. perhaps a secondary bonus could be remote sensor boosters or remote eccm?let the trolling, flaming and (hopefully constructive) criticism commence."
10/27/2009,carriers were here.hi.
10/27/2009,"even with the rep power of a logistic cruiser it is hard to keep frigates alive under any kind of reasonable dps. so even a bonused frigate (which would only fit cruiser sized modules at max, assuming similar fitting bonuses as the logistic cruiser) would still have problem to keep you alive.imho frigate gangs together with scimitars are the way to go. maybe oneiros/guardian if you want to try your luck with armor tanking.(edit: honor to the amarr brothers.)"
10/27/2009,"key word: ""dedicated""."
10/27/2009,"wouldnt mind flying these things. logistics can certainly benefit frigate gangs too, though cruiser sized logistics will not fullfil this role too well"
10/27/2009,you mean more dedicated than having bonus for logistic modules and triage?
10/27/2009,"i have no doubt a scimitar would outperform a logistics frigate in ""repping power"". but that is also the point; it would serve as a cheaper, more mobile and more accessible option, especially for newer players. there is no ""introduction"" to the logistics role at the moment.""reasonable"" dps depends on what league you play in. also, remote repair will do more for an assault frigate than it will for a stealth bomber or interceptor. any tank will crack at some point. i will argue that some remote repair will keep you alive longer than none."
10/27/2009,"key word: ""dedicated"".you mean more dedicated than having bonus for logistic modules and triage?as carriers also have bonuses for fighter drones and warfare links i would not call them ""dedicated remote repair ships"". being capital ships they are not exactly easily accessible to new players, neither would one do particularily well trying to play dedicated remote repair in a roaming frigate gang (especially in hisec).but, let's end this one once and for all: carriers do have bonuses to remote repair! they can be set up to do it, quite well in fact! congratulations, you win!your prize, 1 pcs. chocolate chip cookie, should be arriving by mail within the next 7-14 business days. enjoy."
10/27/2009,i fully endorse this product/service.

10/27/2009,"with the upcoming change in the ingame mail system (sorting by date, yay!), please add the possibility to send mails to corporations.the current system requires you to have contact persons - if the particular one leaves the game, you have to ask your way through the corporation to get a new contact. especially while having business relations to several corps, this can be quite difficult.maybe add the possibility to give people in your corp specific roles in order to view the corp mails. answering from the corp mail address isn't that necessary, but sending mails to your partner corporations would be nice.if this feature is already in the game, i stand corrected and would like to know how to do it"
10/27/2009,"i like the basis of the idea - i'd like to try an offer a refinement.1. on the right click menu for a corp (or on the show info screen) add the option: contact corporation.2. add the role: corp diplomat (this would automatically be assigned to the ceo and all directors).any time someone chooses to send an email to the corporation, it gets routed to the individual email boxes of the people with the diplomat role. now, there's no more need for eoutside websites to track who your diplomats are, and non-diplomats are not privy to the contents of email sent from outside the corporation.for alliances, you could have the same options at the alliance level, with the diplomats being assigned as an alliance role, and defaulting to the ceo\directors of the executor corporation.at any rate, i'd really like to see something like this - it would make contacting corporations you have no previous experience with much easier, and as the op said, when the one person you do know leaves, now you're back to emailing the ceo and hoping he responds.supported"
10/27/2009,make it possible only if you have no drones deployed?that should keep the game balance intact.
10/27/2009,having to wait out the 15' aggression timer seems to respect balance enough. supported.
10/27/2009,"a lot of ships are balanced in the way they can carry many spare drones, don't forget that.and 15 minutes aren't enough, only docking is."
10/27/2009,"this is a fine idea, and doesn't even require the aggro management. just allow one drone per 2 minutes to be jettisoned from your cargo into space.... and have it appear as a drone in space (uncontrolled). then you can take control of said single drone instantly. it lets you restock a flight of drones every ten minutes - which hardly negates a drone ship's large drone bay.-liang"
10/27/2009,"how about the following:create bribery contracts. when applied to a targeted player, security forces will look the other way and not provide any security if the targeted player is attacked. the applied contract will last for 1 hour of play time. the number of bribery contracts created each day is limited to some percentage of total hours played by all players (say 1% or .1%). contracts could be auctioned off in all major trading hubs. targeted players will appear red or some other special color to indicate their status. contracts can stack, making it near impossible to travel without the risk of being shot down... effectively sending them to ""jail"" of their currently docked station.edit: changed ""sold"" to ""auctioned off""."
10/27/2009,"well, that is the real life solution, though it would be way too abusable in eve since the goods (or some percent of them) are still in play, unlike the current insurance system where the destroyed ship has been removed thus you get a net isk sink. if cargo was going to be insured it would have to be done in a way that on average more isk leaves the economy from the process then enters it."
10/27/2009,"the easier fix is stop paying insurance for acts defiend by the game mechanics as criminal. iow, if concord shows up and knocks your **** in the dirt, you lose your insurance on the spot. this has nothing to do with making pvp more viable. if you want to pvp you can fly your happy ass out to lowsec or null sec, or war dec someone and shoot them to hell and back without concord even pausing in their consumption of space doughnuts.besides, think of all the whine tears from mission runners duped into concording themselves - now they've lost their ship - and their isk."
10/27/2009,"hello,in the sell forums there are often times lottery format sales. these lotteries allow for some interesting functions.1. it allows very high priced items to go for market value much easier. 2. it allows for most players to spend a little and possibly become instantly rich.3. it is fun.i would simply like to see this as a contract type along with auctions/item exchanges. same basic format as current lotteries but ran ingame. seller sets up a contract as type lottery and sets minimum/maximum available tickets and or draw time. seller sets up ticket price and maximum per player if needed. buyers can buy a few tickets and come back later to buy more. should be simple and fun but not sure about the hit on sql servers tracking this sort of data.thanks"
10/27/2009,"not supportedcurrently, in order to successfully hold a big lottery, you need to have cultivated trust in the eve community. that makes trust a very valuable commodity, and one i believe is rightly compensated. a formalized lottery contract would be a stealth nerf to trust in order to boost what is, in all honesty, a peripheral issue to the game."
10/27/2009,"after an initial reaction of ""that would be cool"", i read the first response and i have to agree with the reasons why it would be bad, sorry.no support"
10/27/2009,"given how sketchy the contract system is, i can't see this being anywhere near as flexible as the forum-based lotteries. and while the lotteries i ran were all legit, i do like the fact that scams are possible. cool idea, but no dice."
10/27/2009,"so you're looking to make having a low security status easier? one of the things that appeals people to a life of piracy is the attraction to living life on the edge.the warning is there so new players don't make the mistake, but there's no way a new player (not an alt or such) will use this message. i do not support this idea."
10/27/2009,"as a -10 individual, i occasionally take shortcuts through high sec (assuming i'm in a fast enough ship to avoid the faction police) to escape pursuers who might not be so keen to follow me there. i don't want or need any message like that popping up and stopping my progress in the heat of the moment. in general, i don't support any kind of hand-holding in new eden for folks with negative sec status. you break the law, you live with the consequences. if you're too dumb to figure out what systems you can or can't go it, you deserve whatever ill fate awaits you.if such an idea were implemented, it better be a setting in the options window that was by default set to not give me those warnings. easiest solution: just embrace the -10 and avoid confusion altogether."
10/27/2009,"pretty much this. it's not like you can become kos without some indication that you're headed down that path (you blew up the opposing empire's ships, you got concorded, whatever) so this shouldn't be a surprise to the player."
10/27/2009,omg i agree with a pirate.
10/27/2009,"don't let it surprise you - mynxee is a real pirate, not a griefer in pirate's clothes. i find i agree quite frequently with the former."

10/27/2009,"i haven't thought through the whole real life economics of this plan and the negatives, but i would like eve to have a new subscription type. that would be one where you could, at a reduced cost of the normal subscription, be able to continually trains skills already injected into your toon. the cost i thought of would be like $5 a month.i know at times, with this game, i've gotten bored with playing the game but still wanted to train skills, but i didn't feel like paying the whole price just to train skills. this would enable those that want to take a break from the game, but still are willing to come back eventually.every once in a while, you would still have to subscribe completely for a month in order to inject new skills you had unlocked, but it would still be profitable. it would be a negligible bandwidth usage on the eve servers so that wouldn't cost eve too much."

10/27/2009,character farmer detected!!
10/27/2009,"ok, i never even thought of it as a character farming system...i just saw it as a system, for when you get bored, or lack of time, with the game as a way to keep training skills while not having to pay the whole price. my main only has a little over 6mill but i've been away for 2 years prior to starting back about a month ago"
10/27/2009,"unfortunately, this. the character farmers would latch onto this like a fat kid with a chocolate bar. the could now train 3 characters for resale for what it costs them to train one now."
10/27/2009,"as i said and i will personally admit, since i haven't ever even considered buying a toon, it never even came to my mind. in retrospect, i see where this is not a good idea for the whole of eve, though i still wish i could do it myself.................."
10/27/2009,wow.... you read my mind! lol
10/27/2009,personally i think turning down the alpha on the shield to make the effect more solid would actualy make the newer effect look better right now they dont look any were near substantial enough to be working properly

10/27/2009,you have my vote just because it will get us some additional information on ccp's modus operandi on this one.they lack some serious operational experience while handling situations like this and i'd just love to see one of those ridiculously illicit nda's that are used by the gaming-industry get busted.

10/28/2009,man walks into a bar - bump.
10/28/2009,i've always wondered why you can either support or have no opinion to an issue.
10/28/2009,i wish i had an 'unsupported button' so i could show my support against this idea.
10/28/2009,"needs refining but idea that needs implementing.cap rechargers great example. many t1 and t2 mods got rebanlanced, but not their equivalant faction items. this certainly does not make sense.i offer my support (actualy first time bothered answering one of these)"
10/28/2009,there is whole bunch of worthless faction mods.they ned a buff.
10/28/2009,add another to the list who want this.
10/28/2009,"introduciton:it has previously been identified by csm that enhancements to the ship fitting interface is needed, and by all accounts ccp has listened, in the form of our current interface and the ability to share fits amongst fellow pilots, and corporations.what might be missing from this current interface iteration is an aggregator. one that can pull all the modules from a fit, that you may have never built before, and will locate the corresponding market item types for the user.such an enhancement has great potential for speeding up the fitting process and getting pilots out doing what they do best by simply linking the current ship fitting interface with an aggreggator that can locate the modules into a singular view on the market interface. thereby allowing quick purchasing ability by the user for the modules in a particular fit.proposal:expand the ship fitting interfaces current role to an 'aggreggator' that can pull (or push) to the market interface the module types of a particular fit, thereby providing a single sheet purchase list (as is currently when viewing sub-categories via the market interface) of the corresponding modules.considerations:while there may be negatives associated with this proposal - based on the current igb enhancements and the current iteration of the ship fitting interface; it seems that it is both appropriate and benificial to offer suggestions that will streamline the ""buy to fly"" time associated with buying and building ships, and then flying them.some positives that i feel are worth pointing to are:- enhanced new player experience by limiting the amount of time required in fitting ships, and thereby decreasing the learning curve associated with memorizing market location of all module and item types associated with a particular fit.- enhanced veteran player experience by streamlining the ""buy to fly"" experience getting pvpers, etc. back into their prefered ships doing what they want to do.- increased market activity by potentially boosting market volumes of various modules as a direct result of the streamlining of user purchases.closing summary:thinking about this proposal, i hope it is not taken as a 'make my life easier' type of idea, but rather simply pointing out a area where two interfaces all pilots use can be 'dove-tailed' together to create a streamlined ""buy to fly' experience that can only benefit everyone in my humble opinion."
10/28/2009,i've always wanted something like this. be particularly nice if you could specify jump range within which items must be acquired.
10/28/2009,you sound like a bitter dullard. why don't you break some ndas about it?edit: supporting mazz because she's a nice nerd and a girl~~~
10/28/2009,"1) give drones hitpoints that take into consideration that drones are going to be shot. in short, increase here hp, so they do not get insta popped by sentries in low-sec, frigates in pvp, and sleepers in wormholes. decreasing there signature radius could be a valid option, because a light drone has sig radius of a frigate, and that is not right. drones shouldn't be inta poped by sleepers, as that leaves drone boats extremely ineffective. 2) give t2 drones increased resistances, like those of a hac. this is advanced technology that uses advanced materials to improve strength of armor, just as it does with all t2 ships.3) rig that improves drone-bay size. would come in 3 flavors: small, medium and large, each rig would give 10 m^3 for small, 20 m^3 for medium, and 50 m^3 for large.4) rig that improves bandwidth allowed. 5 mb/s for small rig, 10 mb/s for medium rig, and 25 m/s for large. both of these rigs must have drawbacks. 5) t2 versions of all drone upgrades please, including tracking link and navigation computer. 6) a t1 and t2 version of drone damage mod. same stacking penalties as those for standard damage mods apply. drones are the only weapon type that has no damage mod. 7) change the sentry drone damage augmenter to give damage bonus to all drones. 8) make sentry drones require and apply racial skills that provide them with a damage bonus of 10% at lvl 5. 9) make drone control range dictate at witch range you loose control on sentry drones, rather then how far can the target be from you in order for you to be able to make your drones fire. 10) add more options for tweaking drone aggression. that would include prioritizing targets for drones, like i could make all my heavy drones first attack cruisers, then attack battleships, and only then attack frigates. this helps both in pvp when jammed, and in all sorts of pve situations. allowing us to prioritize target drone is attacking according to what it is doing to drone owner (scramming, etc.) would be awesome. 11) hull repair drones. 12) t2 version of every e-war and combat utility drone, that reqires there respective skill at lvl 5. 13) make drone interfacing and ship's bonus to drone damage apply to all effects of utility drones, including ecm and webbing drones. yes, this means that domi with webbing drones would be a threat. 14)light target painting drones suck. they are useless. maybe there should be only light variation of tp drone, with proper stats of a heavy drone. maybe something else should be done. i am not sure how this should be resolved. 15) let us see hp of drones in bay.my proposal is an attempt to improve versatility of drone boats, and comfort of using them.please, point out specifically which part of this proposal you disagree with, if you do. all numbers suggested are approximals, and are to be determined by ccp."
10/28/2009,"numbers 5, 11 and 15 would be ok. and ewar drones need a buff.as for the rest: no way. too much buff. and i think all current rigs have the same bonuses regardless of size, and i like that.ishtar 100k away from you shooting with drones 50k away from you, with mediums full of traking links, lows full of damage mods, rigs for more damage, all v, set of sentry drones which are freaking hard to kill and automatically go for best targets regardless of players control... no."
10/28/2009,"damage mods and rigs for damage do not work together.noone stated that damage mod for drones has to go into low slot. in order for them to go for the best target you would probably have to spend hours tweaking there behavior, and you can still trick em. maybe the drones shouldn't go for the best target, but being able to control if drones it untill you tell them to fire, fire at what you fire, or fire back at whatever fires at you would be nice. now there behavour does not make sence: you launch them at one target, and then they go for random targets. well, giving a frigate sised ship a rig that increases it's drone bay by 25 m^3 wouldn't be right, would it?"
10/28/2009,"mixed bag here...i don't support these idea's. the benefit to drones is you don't need ammo. the drawback is they can get shot. if you make them more tanky then you damper the ""kill his drones first..."" aspect of pvp, especially solo pvp.sentry drones already get +5% / level of the sentry drone interfacing as well as +2% / level of racial drone specialization for t2 sentries. on top of that they get a whopping +20% dmg bonus/level for drone interfacing. these all seem pretty good. more diversity in builds is good. don't care for these either. this would be ridiculously overpowered. they'd have to dramatically drop the jam strength on all ecm drones to compensate. crunch the numbers if you haven't. last time i ran the numbers i think the odds of 5 vespa-600's jamming something like a deimos were in the neighborhood of 43% every 20 seconds. impliment the drone interfacing bonus alone that you suggest that number goes to 86% every 20 seconds and with the t2 ecm drones you propose i'd guess that number would hedge over 90%. i guess i'd commend you for making the deimose a viable ship but the game would become one big ecm drone fest of everyone filling their mids with eccm and filling their drone boats with ecm. something probably needs to be done to make these worthwhile.approved."
10/28/2009,"read along and you will find that i support many parts of the proposal... but i don't support them all together. there would still have to be much balancing between them because drone boats are very powerful as it is for people that know how to fly them simply because they're like 6 ships all in one.1) i support slightly lower sig radius, but i will scream if their hp is touched.2) supported... but only by 10% over t1 drones, and only if t1 drone resists are lowered slightly.3) supported if implemented as a percentage, and if the drawback is two of these three: sig radius, speed, and align time.4) not supported. a lot of work is put into making sure ship types are balanced, and i don't want to encounter somebody flying a raven fitted with 6 t2 siege launchers and also be able to throw 5 heavy drones at me.5) supported, but lower the efficiency of t1s.6) not supported.7) just no.8) i've never encountered a pc sentry drone, to be honest, so i don't know how powerful they are right now. no comment.9) it is my understanding that sentry drones have a pretty long range of their own. this is supported as long as there is a 75% (or something else that makes sense) penalty to drone control range with sentries.10) no no no no no no. your drones are not sleepers. they are dumb. and we don't need to make things better for people who don't know how to use a drone boat. if you do not directly control what targets your drones shoot at, and just let them attack whatever, you are a bad drone pilot. end of discussion. no.11) either that, or have a ship repair array for poses. as things are, it is a very bad thing to get into structure when you live in whs. there's really no need for hull repair drones other than at poses, though... who's going to be using them in combat?12) just make them balanced.13) no, but make separate ship bonuses for different types of drones. perhaps we can make ewar-specialized frigs have bonuses to ecm drones, or something along those lines.14) i say let's get rid of tp drones altogether.15) yes. and maybe.... just maybe.... have a high-slot module that repairs your drones, but only while they're in your drone bay and make it take several minutes to do its job."
10/28/2009,"ok, according to responses, i am going to modify the proposal. let's see if the second version is any better. 1)i think that currently in many instances drones are too easy to kill. especially it hurts when you try to fight sleepers solo, and when it's t2 drones that die. so i propose one of the three solutions: lower sig radius, increase hp, or increase resists. imao the t1 drones could be left as they are, but t2's need to become tougher. how much tougher? so that following scenarios become true:large drones are harder to track then a cruisermedium drones are about as hard to track as a frigate with an absmall drones can be hit with reasonable efficiency only with small guns.2) rig that improves drone-bay size. would come in 3 flavors: small, medium and large, each rig would give 10 m^3 for small, 20 m^3 for medium, and 50 m^3 for large.3) rig that improves bandwidth allowed. 5 mb/s for small rig, 10 mb/s for medium rig, and 25 m/s for large. both of these rigs must have drawbacks. 4) t2 versions of all drone upgrades please, including tracking link and navigation computer. 5) a t1 and t2 version of drone damage mod. same stacking penalties as those for standard damage mods apply. drones are the only weapon type that has no damage mod. it could be midslot, or high-slot, but i think there should be one. if not, then at least change the sentry drone damage augmenter to give damage bonus to all drones, or give us rigs that gives damage bonus for every drone type.6) make sentry drones require and apply racial skills that provide them with a damage bonus of 10% at lvl 5.the problem is they do not receive a +2% / level of racial drone specialization for t2 sentries. and i am proposing that they should.7)allow me to choose, wether drones should agress only after direct order, if they should agress whoever i fire at, agress whoever fires at me, or automatically attack all hostiles withing range. 8) hull repair drones. . 9) make hip's bonus to drone damage apply to all effects of utility drones, including ecm and webbing drones. yes, this means that domi with webbing drones would be a threat, after all drones should work better on a drone boat.10)light target painting drones suck. they are useless. maybe there should be only light variation of tp drone, with proper stats of a heavy drone. maybe something else should be done. i am not sure how this should be resolved. 11) let us see hp of drones in bay.repping drones, especially for a group of people, isn't all that hard, with a couple small hullreping drone and 1 remote repper it could be done, although it takes timethe problem with implementing it as w percentage is that you get myrm with say a rig that gives 15% bonus to drone bay capacity, that is going to be 172.5 m^3, and that is kind of stupid, because the last 2.5m^3 cannot be used for anything. a fixed value, that is different for frigates, cruisers and battleships should work better."
10/28/2009,"g'day alljust wondering if you can put forward a minor thing im frustrated about heh.being an agressive pirate and all, using my specialist guns with the various mods i also use to get the best from them. im constantly annoyed by the fact that the preset orbital ranges supplied by eve in-game cannot be preset by the player or on the fly.is it not possible to set a box up where we can manually preset the orbital ranges we wish to keep from our targets?this would greatly affect the optimal ranges our guns require without affecting the gampeplay mechanics in an unfair way to all players involved.just a thought!!"
10/28/2009,"you should know about...right click on the orbit button on your overview.click ""set default orbit distance"".type in desired orbit distance in meters.hit enter.left click the orbit button.edit: that'll only give you one custom preset distance, but it's something you can use right now without a csm proposal and a bunch of waiting."
10/28/2009,"maybe set distances when you set up your overview settings. so you would load ""vaga"", and you would have 'x' number of orbiting distances that you have previously set that would fit your opt/fall off ranges. you could right click orbit on your overview and you could select the pre-saved orbits and or enter the distance."
10/28/2009,"hi, everybody!id like to ask a question. do you agree with current ccp policy supporting corp thieves?lets consider what we have. we have corporate hangars that have only 7 divisions and if someone has access to division x he has access to all divisions x on all poses and offices. sure, you can place pos for each corp member but it will cost a lot of time and isks. ship maintenance bays much worth because they have only 1 division. why pilots cant have personal assets divisions on poses? lets compare corp thieves and pirates. if you are attentive and understand game mechanics you can always avoid pirates in high sec systems. also it is not hard to avoid them in low security systems. it is a game! you can play with them or not  it is your choice. but if you wish to avoid corp thieves attack you have to place outpost in every system where you live. do you think it is normal that ccp made incredibly hard to keep private assets in space untouched?so, i can suggest 3 ways of solving the problem:1) corporate hangar arrays ship maintenance bays should have some personal divisions accessible only by a certain character2) make corp hangar division access system more flexible to have an opportunity to give access to a pilot (group of pilots) to a certain division on certain pos (office).3) make personal hangar arrays with ship maintenance in it.the first is best, because the second will be hard to use and third will need to online/anchor to many structures. also, first and third solutions need to support the mechanics of unanchoring structure when personal assets placed in. ps: i thought about posting this about a year. but as usual it happens, an incident pushed me to write it right now.pss: haven't checked character which starts the topic. sparkling lord is main."
10/28/2009,"first off your op's reasoning is just flat off the wall.corp theivery is a poor excuse for a premise to change the system.that said... i have to concur the system is just flat wacked.in all honesty the corp hanger arrays should use the same permission system of the main corp hangers in the stations/outposts.pos's apparently do not... as i've found out recently... frustrating as hell.as for ""personal arrays"" i don't know about that... but it is a problem and it does need fixing.ps: i'm a bit of a pos noob yes... but it should be obvious how to set it up... its not."
10/28/2009,"poses already have personal hangars... they're called ""giant secure containers"". it is your duty to ensure that you trust somebody before you give them access to anything that you don't want to lose. until that point, if they need to store things of theirs in the pos, you tell them to anchor a container."
10/28/2009,"as i remember it is impossible to anchor containers under force field. anchoring out of force field is rediculous in 0.0. also i don't think that you can place everything in giant secure container. for example, ships. to have only one ship on pos is not good idea, because you need at list 1 pvp and 1 hunting ship."
10/28/2009,"well that's not a big deal. you can give people access to a ship maintenance array with reasonable safety. even somebody does steal a ship, it can only be one, and it can only be one they have the skills to fly.also, i know that my corp's pos has a container in it... whether it's anchored or not, i don't know. i thought putting it out made it anchored. but it's been there for 2 weeks and hasn't gone anywhere."
10/28/2009,"the trust , the only thing you cant buy in eve."
10/28/2009,"if ccp would let us use giant secure containers in poses, it would solve alot of simular problems and i would be happy."
10/28/2009,"yes, yes and yes.yes."
10/28/2009,"tracking advantage with rediculous dps and a whole lot of other problems. and 100km is still far shorter than 114. eagle got 10% bonus, better tracking and better alpha. and no,it won't outdo the muninn, same range better dps, worse alpha worse tracking. and what you mean by one less sb? muninn needs one, deimos will need 0? kinda wrong here too. the same role that noone needs and noone wants? you propose the rail deimos to become a close range hac, great idea. i see what you did there.not really. you got brutix and... well that's it. you forget that most ships doesn't even have the grid to fit 250mms, this including the brutix, so no. read above and you'll discover it's not all about the dps of the zealot. and currently lasers do more dps with better tracking, instant ammo switch, no reloading."
10/28/2009,looks like a very convincing argument for nerfing the zealot.
10/28/2009,deimos needs power grid extremely bad. it starts off starving for power grid. also boost the damage output.
10/28/2009,"the eagle would really benefit from a boost to pg more than anything else. i'd also like to see the scan resolution normalized between the ships; there doesn't seem to be any balance need for one ship to lock slower than another. it is not an insignificant benefit to be able to switch to normal ammo and get the same range without the tracking penalty other ships have to take with long range ammo.i wouldn't mind seeing medium rails get a slight boost, and rails in general have slightly reduced cap usage, but 20% damage would be way over the top"
10/28/2009,"eagle can do 189 dps at 126+15 with fn iridium with 0.0315 tracking what is balanced compared to the muninn. add the 20% rail boost and you look at 226 dps here so you out track, out damage and out range the muninn at the same time. if you fit 3 gyros on the muninn you will also have 30km more lock range that you can use without any falloff penalties.

10/28/2009,agree with topic starter2 the djegocompare deimos with ishtar in close and long range and you will understand the idea of deimos reviewing.
10/28/2009,"this. i don't really want to convert the deimos into a sniping hac, but it does need a buff as few people fly them (because they are a bad investment).in order for the deimos to be worth the price it needs to do what it does better than the brutix. it needs to be much faster and much harder to hit while heaping out damage.right now you have to plate tank them which makes them slow. they also have a large sig compared to other hac's, so you've got this blaster boat that is slow to align, slow to move, and easy to hit. it's dps is fairly gimped if you put a 1600mm plate on it as well because then you can only fit electrons unless you burn your rig slots on acr's, which you shouldn't have to do.thats what needs to be fixed.buff the grid. lower it's align time. lower it's signiture. buff it's speed slightly.do that and you have a ship that can get into range, won't instantly melt, and can apply a healthy share of dps before it's primaried off the field.it seems like this is what the deimos is supposed to be. it's still going to be primaried, but at least this way you'll get your monies worth out of the hull before it explodes."
10/28/2009,"although i'm in favour of even more frigate sized ships (which is why i'm supporting it), isn't an introductory logistics-style ship covered by the t1 cruisers that the logistics hulls use (augoror, osprey, exequror, scythe)?"
10/28/2009,"the t1 logistic hulls is like getting first aid from a person with 1 arm... first its funny, then you bleed to death cuz he cant apply that bandage.edit : not realy but most of them are of no use"
10/28/2009,"yes, would be nice. carriers have nothing to do with this, there is enormous number of instances when carriers are not available or are useless. you cannot get carrier in high-sec, and getting it into wormhole is a pain."
10/28/2009,"wow, hadn't realized it was time for another logistics frigate thread yet.said yes last time and the time before that but if you want to see it in game then be prepared to bump this thread for the next year, bribe csm candidates and possibly top it off with a naked demo outside ccp's offices.would seriously love to see this in game on the hulls you mentioned with the following bonuses:frigate bonus - xx% reduction in small transfer fittingfrigate bonus - xx% reduction in small transfer cap needlogistics frig bonus - 160% range to small transfers per lvl (just under 40km range at lvl 5)logistics frig bonus - 15% reduction in mwd signature radius penaltythe bonuses would affect whichever type of transfer unit applied to each race.the reason for stealing the mwd bonus from interceptors is because logistics frigates would have to work outside of neut range and if you've ever flown a frigate at 20 km distance from a cruiser you'll know that an af type tank won't make the slightest bit of difference.a bonus to ab speed could have the same affect but it would need to be sufficient to keep range on a mwd cruiser."
10/28/2009,"i would really like to see this as the step towards logistics cruisers can be quite a pain with the logistics skills to 5 for a logistics cruiser. a midway stop which doesn't make the logistic cruisers obsolete would be nice.it could be a nice addition to small roaming gangs with af's, interceptors etc. if it were to receive bonuses to speed and signal reduction as it would make for specialized ship which could quite easily be taken out by one of the same size but would be a torn in the eye of bigger ships. so i definitely see a place for it in eve.and please to you who keep on dragging the carrier argument in here it is neither meant for frigate gangs nor roaming gangs."
10/28/2009,"no.look, we don't need every role replicated in a frigate hull. i swear people are going to be asking for frigate sized dreadnaughts next because pos sieging in frigates is cool.the essential problem with a logistics frigate is that logistics are, well, in short, too powerful to fit on a frig hull. which means those frig hulls become expensive caskets because of being primary every time with frigate ehp, or become op due to being basically unkillable.you know, like frigate sized ecm ships. ecm is powerful enough it guarantees that everyone who is capable of firing on you will fire on you, and you have frigate ehp... frigates don't have a lot of it. (this is why frig recons were a bad idea, too)."

10/28/2009,supported - though just rename personnel manager or something (make that the required role).
10/28/2009,this issue was raised to ccp during our september iceland meeting
10/28/2009,"good news, what was the response or is it nda atm?"
10/28/2009,"problem with this is theres always a way around. for example, if some says:""selling isk; 14.99 = 500m, 24.99 = 1.1b""what do you ban? all words included in there are vital to this game except 14.99 and 24.99. say you ban 14.99 and 24.99 the isk sellers will just do 14.98 and 24.98 and then 97, 96, 95 and so on. they can make it very brief if you attempt this and make it almost impossible to catch. i recommend using the block function eve has put in place to block them, quickest approach.secondly, the idea about the p/w every so many minutes/hours. the problem here is say your in the middle of combat, the message pops up and you need to turn on your reppers....you die, petition process increases because people won't settle with this problem. furthermore, the people your targeting with the p/w simply change their macro to type it in every interval. thus it would be redundant before even implemented.if there was some miracle process to stop these spammers (excluding the removal of noob trial) then ccp would do it as it is in their best interests to keep the game alive (furthermore there could be tax/legal consequences with having people use ccp's game as a income producing activity). i have seen alot of games which have implemented these sensor word programs and they just end up horribly wrong."
10/28/2009,i like lotteries and all... but this one gets the rock thrown at it.
10/28/2009,"some decent points here. though i believe high price item movement in eve is more than peripheral. i really like to stay in game and not come to the forums to look for contracts/items and would simply like to see as one point made, the complete contract system get an overhaul and become more robust.maybe in the cosmos site something like this will be implemented."
10/28/2009,"bolded is the reason i would agree with this. while i'm not really a full fledged pirate (ie, i'm not all -10 and flashy everywhere) i do my fair share of naughty stuff, and i did recently lose a ship because of this, jumping into a 0.6 system, not because i was running from anyone, but because i was simply roaming in random directions looking for something, and i jumped into a 0.6 and died a horrible death to the faction navies.supported, but only if it is default set to not pop-up."
10/28/2009,"not supported.i am in support of a way to more easily see the sec-rating of the system on the other side of the gate, though. the way things are now takes too long to obtain that information. how about just putting the sec status in parentheses behind the gate name? stargate (jita) (0.9) or stargate (jita: 0.9), or maybe put the sec-status like you put the bounty amount in the info window in the top-right:stargate (jita)security: 0.9if your sec-status is low enough that you can't go into some high-sec systems, then you (should) have enough experience to know which sec-ratings you cannot go into, and ccp should not be holding your hand via popup boxes."
10/28/2009,did you already notice those shiny little dots on the left side on your screen next to the system name in the route listing? they give you a nice idea about the sec status. doesnt helps with fscked faction standing. oh well you cant have everything i guess.though i am not sure what all the crying is about. i even run cruisers through highsec with the navy chasing me.
10/28/2009,sometimes people just roam around without setting a destination.
10/28/2009,"the first time faction police started shooting my i had no idea that they would attack you if standing with faction drops below 5. please make some sort of warning. as we all know, all pop-ups can be turned off."
10/28/2009,maybe use the tools god err ccp gave you. especially if you know that jumping in certain systems can get you killed.

10/28/2009,"failpost is faili've been playing this game for 3 years and have only fairly recently topped 50m skillpoints, to give a new player 5-10m skill points would be a kick in the teeth for older players who have invested time and money in the game.i started nearly all my chars on the old 9,000 (i think) sp's and built up from there.they've messed around with more skill points for noobies before, and stopped it, now they've got double training speed for a bit.life is rewarding for those with patience, for those who can't be 4r$ed to wait then wow is waiting.eve has got a steep learning curve which is good since it sorts the wheat from the chaff, those with the patience to stick with the game are better than the omygodzinturnetspaceships to fly type player who wants everything now!!

10/28/2009,"well the topic is here for quite a while and many things have been said - both supportive as well as those which are in contrary.let me do a quick summary and speak up my suggestions which i would like to address to ccp devs.current situation (apocrypha):talking about damage in eve ranging from frig to bs we have basically 3 primary weapon types:1. missiles2. turrets3. dronesit is quite important to make it clear here, that by primary weapon we understand an essential part of the ship which is bringing through the nature of its purpose as well as through bonuses given by specific ship the major percentage of total dps.now, there are ways in eve to counter (this is very important word in my understanding ""counter"" not to remove entirely) any of primary dps weapon by multiple means; as an example you can use ecm to counter basically any primary weapon - for drones assuming you manage to keep a perma jam from the start), on top of that for missiles you can use fofs which we know suck quite a lot (i know that ccp is looking into it atm); for turrets you can use tracking disruptors, sens. damps are here as well as a general tool (ofc ofc not much use at a close range); on top of that you can pop any drone which is harrasing you any time.the message i want to deliver to all of you - players of eve as well as ccp devs is: sentries in lowsec should not interfere with whatever pvp aggression by means of removing entirely the primary weapon of any shipthis is not about favouring any race or ships, this is about the way dps is being delivered in eve. existing types of weapons should be respected and allowed to have a fair chance to live to its purpose in this game.i have read carefully this entire thread and other similar as well. i know thoughts many of you thinking now, that with drones being ""safe"" in lowsec ""we have a problem"".i do not agree.andy why?1. a drone boat itself will be aggressed by sentries the same way as any other boat (missile or turret based); in fact there will be more dps landing on the aggressing side, because sentries will not cycle through bunch of t1 drones used just to divert sents dps.2. you all use eft the same way as i do and i believe most of you have done the homework to figure out that there is a balance in general and as such drone boat of its class has roughly the same dps as turret boat of the same class, ofc with some variations etc etc, but in general yes, it does.3. pirates are today not ganking you in lowsec with myrmidon but with brutix, hurricane or harbinger, but they do (i am using those t1 bcs ofc just as an example ). if the balance is restored, some of them will use myrmidon instead of any of those 3, but the damage output will be similar, so what is the deal?what will it bring?more balance to lowsec in my eyes and i am sure many of eve players can support it. people will be able to field also drone boats with their primary weapon in tact.should there be still a concern about too much ganking in lowsec, i do not mind this being topic to be discussed as well, there are ways to do it e.g.:- give sentries more dps- implement tracking issue on sentries to allow smaller / faster ships to operate- etc etcbut the issue itself is not about drones, it is more general and defines the lowsec as a whole.so or so, drones as being for many ships primary weapon by its nature, should not be disadvantaged to other primary weapons in lowsec (they are not in 0.0 and not at war time), as in such a way substantial amount of offensive warfare is removed, but on a selective base, which is not fair.looking forward to read your responses, hopefully one of such being from ccp.many thanks for reading this."

10/29/2009,"more sites spawn than before and they are easier to find with a newer probing system than before. now the skill reqs are coming down meaning more people than ever can probe meaning the loot gained loses value as it's way more common.all this adds up to a reduced reward for people who really want to do this as a profession especially with the chance of very little or nothing dropping at all.personally i've gone from someone who used to probe and plex regulary and getting a good income from it to a person who now ship-trades afk as a much more guaranteed and less frustrating way to earn.these changes may encourage new or noob players to explore but for advanced players they are a kick in the teeth as it leaves no room for serious specialisation, nerfs the skills we spent ages training, and surely reduces the chance of good drops and the value of whatever does drop due to larger numbers plexing."

10/29/2009,"this is the very least that needs to be done. better yet, ccp needs to adjust a variety of mechanics to allow corps and alliances to secure their assets and organizations."
10/29/2009,"1. ceo of executor corp pushes ""prepare to disband"".2. begin 48-hour timer during which time no corps may join or leave the alliance, no alliance dues will be paid, and no wars may be declared by any participants. alliances declaring war against this alliance during this time are notified that the war may not last long because the alliance is preparing to disband.3. all directors of all corps in the alliance receive a mail (and perhaps an e-mail as well?) announcing the button push.4. all ceos are given the option to vote against the disbanning. if one-third of the ceos vote against, the alliance must be disbanded via petition so it will be investigated by ccp and made sure that the person who pushed ""the button"" is the person that rightfully owns the character.5. after the timer expires with little/no opposition, the ""disband alliance"" button activates for 24 hours. if the button isn't pushed within 24 hours, it goes away and the alliance returns to a normal state.corp ceos are only to oppose the disbanding if they believe the ceo of the alliance has been compromised.seriously... of all the timers and protections that different things have for the matter of security in case of account compromise... the disbanding of an alliance should be the hardest."
10/29/2009,"i concur with the op...copied from my earlier post in caod:the ability to nullify a power structure as important as a large scale player alliance from a single account is not right within the context of the universe ccp is trying to foster in my opinion.weather you like cva and it's policies or not is irrelevant. this discussion should not be about politics.likewise this is also not a condemnation of the value that espionage and covert operations play within eve. i strongly believe that black ops politics and spy games help make eve such a great game, and help contribute to the sense that players are the ones who control and alter the history of the universe.but if ccp wants to foster the growth of all kinds of player alliances, security in the controls and mechanisms affecting large power structures need to be more thought out and formalized. it's not as if the ceo of a real life corporation can liquidate the company without the consent of the board. democratic government figureheads like presidents cannot dismantle their governments with a single action without incurring retribution. similarly there should be no such way to do a similar thing in eve without at least a vote or formalized consent from the leaders of all the pre-determined affected parties."

10/29/2009,going to war takes longer and is apparently more complex than disbanding an alliance.how is this a good mechanic?
10/29/2009,"the topic is about fixing the broken mechanic that is being used to do this. it isn't about reversing the disband. i'm sure that during the bob disband threads that the broken mechanic was discussed, but with all the lol posts it might have been missed.i seem to recall that this is at least the 3rd time this has happened, but i can't for the life of me recall who was hit before bob...again we are not suggesting a rollback here. we are suggesting that the mechanic is broken where (as i understand the process) you can kick corps and then disband the alliance in minutes when you can't even resign from a corp without dropping roles, which has a 24 hour cool off period...i agree totally there.however there is a mechanism to stop people being kicked from a corp when they have roles and a 24 hour timer to strip their roles. there is nothing at all in place for kicking corps etc..."

10/29/2009,"the problem which most posters aren't realizing is:there's not button ""disband alliance"", you can only kick corporations one by one until no one is left.my proposal:1) fast change for dominion:- you can only expell 1 corporation per hour. this way a complete disband would take longer and would make it complicated do and getting uninteresting. when do you really have to kick more then 1 corp? corps can still leave on their own without the delay (by pressing leave alliance). - mail send to all corporation ceos/directos of the alliance that corp xyz has been expelled from the alliance.2) longterm change for alliance exucitve.- alliance executive corp ceo can directly expell corporations (1 per hour)- directors have to make a vote for kicking a corporation (similar to war decs, atleast 2 directors)- expell more corporations per hour: vote created by ceo.- overhaul corporation and alliance management interfacei think that my first point should be easy to implement without the needed overhaul of the complete alliance/corporation management interface. it reduce the risk of a sudden death of an alliance."

10/29/2009,"one additional thought in support of this.at fanfest this year, one of the big themes was social networking and building communities in eve.if ccp think there is value in those things then they have to adequately protect them. the action with cva is absolutely correct. now they need to provide mechanisms to make sure people can protect their communities without having to be ultra-paranoid with absolutely everyone. sure eve is dark and sure trust has to mean something (which is to say, it only means something if it can be betrayed) but some things are just a nonsense on stilts.if it is wrong to let one character kill 300 ships with one weapon blast, then it's simply stupid to let one character destroy an alliance and all the history and shared investment people have in it.cosmo"

10/29/2009,"while the drama is always entertaining, the mechanic doesn't seem like a good one. this becomes even more obvious when you compare the effort needed to disband an alliance to the effort needed do much simpler things. they often have timers/require voting, so it seems intuitive, that actions with greater affects would require similar safeguards at minimum.a high level traitor could still cause critical damage and would remain very useful to the enemy, so you would still need to maintain high security, but the shenanigans would stay at a more reasonable level."

10/29/2009,"given the latest wave of account compromises, i propose the following feature, which allows a user to detect if his account was accessed by someone other than himself:on the character choosing screen, display the time of the last log in together with the name of the network host accessing (obtained by a reverse dns lookup). this reveals the provider used, so if the user is a roadrunner customer but the last log in shows something like ip.hsd1.mi.comcast.net it's obvious that somebody else accessed it.to be effective, the accesses to the account and character management pages on eve-o must also be logged and displayed. the feature can be further enhanced by using a whitelist, where the user specifies his provider or ip range. as soon as an access from outside of that whitelist happens, a warning mail is sent to the user. this could also trigger other measures, but that is to be discussed.share your thoughts!"
10/29/2009,"ccp has those logs anyway, so i don't see technical problems, but currently they can only look at the data after disaster has struck. this feature gives the players a warning system."
10/29/2009,"bweh heh heh, this would be awesome! and, the mechanics of implimenting this idea could also be used for giving ships ""dressing flags"", for showing off on special occasions, such as parades and stuff.all of these ideas sound great, actually. add a less functional, more fun side to eve that isn't seen often enough i think. the fireworks display i saw in gallente space a month or two ago is evidence enough that people are interested in exploring that side of eve, even if at the moment, they need to improvise with torpedoes and utility drones."
10/29/2009,"i dunno, personally i like the sound of all of this, or at least what applies to the drones i use. but then, i'm a droneboater, so perhaps i'm jaded.i also had an idea for two sub-capital carrier classes that would be usable in high-sec, that would use drones instead of fighters, but get similar drone number bonuses as well as damage bonuses, in exchange for not having any weapon slots.one would be about the size of battlecruisers, the other of battleships, though they would use their own skills. for instance, instead of battlecruisers (or perhaps ontop of battlecruisers) the person would train ""escort carriers"", and instead of race specific battleship, the person would train race specific ""light carrier"".each of the two would have about the same abilities as it's conventional counterpart (battlecruisers and battleships), however instead of guns or missiles, or those and drones, all of it's damage output would be in it's drones alone.unfortunately, i had some trouble explaining my idea, and it got it's share of flames, mainly from caldari missileboaters fearing their pve superiority would be threatened.either way, drones do need more love, and at the very least, a reworked drone ui, with some nice shiny buttons like regular weapons get would be lovely."

10/29/2009,"yesgod no, why???"
10/29/2009,"it is your luck that you know nothing about corp thieves :) . pilot that has access to ship maintenece can launch all ahips into space and scoop them into carrier. no need to fly them all! and you have to understand that some ship may cost billions. there is no need to steal all these ships. just some expensive ones.you can launch containers under force field and they will not gone after 2 hours like jettison comtainers do. but you can't anchor them and set password either.i agree. it is not the best solution, because of ships, but it will sort things a bit."
10/29/2009,"most discussion about ecm revolves around the strength (chance) of jamming, eccm, other influencing modules and ship bonuses / sensor strength. this proposes a change to the mechanic itself.let's take a quick look at sensor range dampening. when applied, the targets locking range is reduced, making it lose any lock beyond the new reduced range or locks being acquired. it doesn't necessarily lose all locks, it just reduces the choice of what can be locked and attacked, range being the deciding factor.what makes ecm in its current form so powerful, is that it acts on a higher level, jamming a whole ship yes or no. the change i propose is to bring ecm to the same per-lock level as dampening, meaning, roll the dice separately for every existing lock or lock being acquired. this way, some locks can be lost, but not necessarily all, it just reduces the choice of what can be shot, just like with dampening, but with chance being the deciding factor.if this is implemented, ofc some rebalancing of the strengths/bonuses would also be needed."
10/29/2009,interesting idea. only negative is it would cause alot of calculations on the server for doing a per target chance but otherwise sounds interesting.
10/29/2009,"lock acquired / lost is calculated by the server anyway. those few additional random float number that have to be generated are peanuts, you could probably generate hundreds if not thousands in the time it takes to do a single database call."
10/29/2009,"interesting idea, but personally i think ecm is fine as it is. currently, you need to be in a specialized ecm ship (which have all the armor of a wet paper bag), and have good skills to jam anything other than a frigate with relitive safety. i find that ecm is good against bc and smaller targets, but that damps are better against bs sized ships. reason bieng, a maxed falcon has a str of 15, against a bs's base str of about 25. 3/5 chance means that if you dont have 2 jammers on a single bs, you will likely miss a jam and the bs will be able to insta-pop you. on the other hand, damps work in a smaller way by only killing their range, but are 100% damp chance. so as long as you are out of max lock range, a bs wouldnt scratch a freighter."
10/29/2009,ecm just got redone not long ago. they arent goin back to it.remote damps need to be buffed.
10/29/2009,"i don't think most people even know there's a 2nd caldari hac, and the deimos is generally lolfodder waiting to happen. they could both use a boost."
10/29/2009,deimos and eagle need some loving.
10/29/2009,"its not a ships problem, its a railguns problem."
10/29/2009,"frigate sized dreadnoughts? really? no motherships?you seem to be taking only the two worst case scenarios into account; overpowered ships or useless ships. again, the idea was not to make a smaller, cheaper version of the logistics cruiser, with the same performance. the idea was a class of ships intended mainly for skirmishing in frigate gangs, not 200 vs 200 nullsec slugfests. less ehp, less repping power, more speed and more mobility.if introduced they would have to be balanced, anything else would of course be a failure.as for frigate recons, i take it you were referring to the electronic attack frigates? far as i know they have had some success, though they cannot be used in every situation. according to some they are a bit lacking, that may or may not be true. they are a fairly new class of ships though, and ccp seems to be fond of introducing new gear ""pre-nerfed"" and changing it as they go along. an example of that; bombs."
10/29/2009,"well, if you put it that way..."
10/29/2009,"wouldn't logistic frigates fit medium reps to keep them in line with their logistic cruiser counterparts using large reps? tbh, i dont think they would ever be used without medium reps or a bonus to rep amount."

10/29/2009,the scanner wouldnt know they are your fleet member until you have a 100% hit. *think*
10/29/2009,"on numerous occasions i've found myself in a place where i have to re-arrange the windows on my user interface in a specific manner to cater to a specific task. i tend to arrange windows differently when i engage in pve, different in pve, different when i chat in various in-game channels, or even different layouts depending on the screen resolution i play on, or whether i play full screen or windowed.i would dare make an assumption here that other people as well end up into window rearranging chaos. with that in mind i would like to propose a mechanism that would be able to save/load the window layouts of the user interface.values saved/load should befor each window:- window type (i.e. local chat, cargo hold, overview, drone bay, etc)- window x/y position- window width/height- parent window (if it's included as a tab inside a parent window)- pinned (yes or no)- minimized or restored statefor the saved template:- global ui color scheme- resolution of the game client the layout was set up for- name given by the player to the layoutall layouts would be saved locally on the user's computer. additionally one layout could be set as ""default"" for each specific game client dimensions so when the player switches resolution in the game, the corresponding layout loads up automatically.saved layouts should also be exportable/importable so they can be shared between alts, or different computers or even other people.of course windows that are temporary (trade windows, container windows etc) should either not be eligible for inclusion in a saved layout or saved conditionally for whenever they are open (like default x/y/width/height/parent window)."
10/29/2009,"supported, with specific emphasis on this"
10/29/2009,i propose that ccp creates a mission editor for players.players then send in the missions they create to ccp who runs their quality assurance process on them and make sure they stand up to ccp standards. there could even be some public screening to take away the crappiest missions so ccp don't get bogged down.once the mission is checked and cleared it can easily be added into the normal agent mission rotation.i'm sure we would get a lot of new fun and innovative eve missions if this was to happen
10/29/2009,"um, no. city of heroes tried this, and everybody started making missions with high payout but minimal risk. it turned into a powergamer's wet dream.i admire qa, but there's no way they can detect how a player is able to run a mission well. there's a specific team for making missions, and they work their tails off making them.not supported."
10/29/2009,"this.no.edit:i don't think a process to submit ideas for missions would necessarily be a bad thing, although i am not sure how such a thing would work. but as for having players actually assdemble mission elements and rewards directly, lol no."
10/29/2009,"however in eve that's easy to avoid. to wit:1) level in missions is determined by number and type of rats (and a few other things but that's the big one) hence, the mission generator sets level, not the player. lp and mission pay can be generated by formula.2) bounty and drop is determined by type of ship, so that's not player set either.so, really, in the specific mission set of eve, powergaming is pretty easy to avoid.however, many of the really good missions need specialty stations etc. these cannot be player generated - so the tool would have limited utility to do really customizable things - but it could still be easily used to generate a lot of stuff that makes up regular missions such as blockade, portal to war, etc. etc.it's a good idea, the csm should at least present it. with the nature of eve missions the powergamery bs you are concerned about should be very easy to avoid."
10/29/2009,"i don't know how city of heroes did it, but if it is as you say they obviously weren't restrictive enough.here i'm talking about maybe 5-10 missions each month going through the qa process, only the best of the best. i'm quite confident the qa people can fly a marauder through the missions and see how long time it takes in relation to how much the mission returns.if this was to be realized, the people ""working their tails off"" making missions could be freed up doing something else, qa for the player made missions perhaps? honestly they seem to have lost their imagination a long time ago anyway. the only thing that differs one mission from the other is how many waves of rats you get against you some fresh thinking from the players could give some more interesting missions;* protect a shipyard/station/freighter* do something with a time limit (deliver a bomb?)* try to hold different strategic locations (king of the hill)* freight large items (too large for battleships) through a mission where rats constantly attack you* get support from npcs* destroy gates that spawn enemies before you are overwhelmed* play small minigames with shuffling around stuff in different containers perhaps* missions where more than 1 person is required to complete it (maybe have to hold different locations at once?)i could go on and on about cool ideas that we probably will never see in eve"
10/29/2009,"this is what i mean. let's make an eom mission with lots of eom death knights (1m isk bounty, light damage). we'll have four or five of them come per wave, in about 5 waves. payout is about 25m for the bounties alone, and one lar ii can handle all the incoming damage. this mission can be completed in about 30 minutes max with a good setup.and this is just one example. think of the other high-value bses with light damage. i don't think i need to say any more."
10/29/2009,"let me quote myself for you, as you don't seem to read what i write anyway:you're not implying that the qa people are so stupid that they can't see such an obvious flaw? even if they don't react on the npc rat type at first, they sure as hell would notice it when they breeze through the mission when they test it.it's not like i'm suggesting here that anyone can just slap together a mission and have it running in eve the next day. that would just be stupid. for a mission to be accepted into eve it would have been looked at from every possible angle, poked at, drenched, shaken, dropped from a high building and then dry tumbled until it starts smoking."
10/29/2009,"so we want to make their jobs harder?! not to be rude but doesn't ccp's qa department have enough to do without this added load? these are the folks that brought us (or at least qa'd) the boot.ini problem and shield hardeners that completely drown out all other sound effects (among other things) after all. i'd say they're busy enough without having to check to make sure someone isn't submitting a mission that's only available in 1.0 systems, pays out 80 million in bouties, gives 45k lp's, and can be flown in a discophoon on autopilot.if you want to design your own missions, go play a fps (dust anyone?) - most of them seem to have level and mission designers, as do most of the rts games i've played (starcraft's rocked because you could do exactly what we're arguing against here). leave the designing of eve missions to the people who's job it is to design them."
10/29/2009,"i think you are overreacting here and focusing on the wrong stuff.but ok, say that the normal mission creators produce 5 missions each month that have to go through qa. now say that instead the players make these 5 missions each month which means we still have the exactly same load on the qa people + we freed up all the guys that were making missions! if we put them in qa maybe we can churn out 7-8 missions each month instead with the same load on qa. i can't see why you insist that this is a problem!?"
10/29/2009,"because the players won't submit 5 missions a month. if you're lucky, they'll submit 500, but i expect the number would be higher, given the number of players eve has. who decides which 5 make it to qa? players? that's not really correcting the flaw in the process."
10/29/2009,"there is just no end to the complaining it's not like we have to solve all the problems right now, this is just a general suggestion for gods sake. you want me to give you the source code for the editor and three scrum iterations too while we're at it?i'd imagine that there would be a new forum for the mission makers. it would work like this forum where players grade the missions. if each mission suggestion would be put under as much scrutiny as this thread they would be practically perfect even before they reach qa! ccp then just pick the 10 with highest score each month and qa as many of them as they have time for. not really rocket science.so, now i have almost drawn up the entire process, happy yet?"
10/29/2009,"no.what you don't get is that players could and will design missions with a hidden flaws made to help/hinder some kind of playstile.for example a mission with lots or neut towers and timed spawning reinforcements. done right it will be a passive drake/nightmare heaven and almost impossible for any other set up. it is only an example, but it would be easy to design missions to play the strong point of a model of ship while being hard for all the others. and no forum scrutiny will notice that, you need to do the missions and see how it work, theoreticraft can easily be fooled."
10/29/2009,guess your just lazy maybe you should have checked just a little bit harder linkage
10/29/2009,"i am simply tired to shoot a bs, bc or any other high-power, ass-kicking, energy-packed space vehicle that goes pooofff... leaving wreck behind.there was a beautiful (in it's own days) game called independence war 2.ship explosions in that game are still unsurpassed in beauty and cpu efficiency, just look on youtube."

10/29/2009,"as the title says, it should not be possible to disband an alliance in less than a minute.what i suggest is that there should be a twenty-four hour cooldown period when a director of the executor corp attempts to evict a member corporation or disband the alliance.during this period, any director of the executor corp can reverse the decision.simples."
10/29/2009,"and two seconds after posting this, i noticed the other thread"
10/29/2009,"i like this idea... perhaps have pilots jetcan near the store-activated orca, right click their can, and set up a sell order, or if all the stuff in the can falls within a buy order from the orca, the person can right click the can and sell to that order, and then the orca can tractor it in.if all else fails, perhaps they could just fly up to the orca, and open it's market like they would a ship maintanence bay. it would definately improve the newbie mining experience, and give people something to do with orcas solo, not to mention build a community of small time miners, and small time buyers of their ore.or, even an ""all of the above"" approach... either way, this would be an awesome feature."
10/29/2009,no kidding! all the more tragic that there was that conspiracy against him to get him removed from office!reinstate larkonis!!!
10/29/2009,"i think some of you are missing the point. this isn't low-sec or 0.0, it's high-sec, and not just any high-sec, it's jita. it'd be the equivalent of somali pirates raiding a ship in the middle of new york harbor, blowing it up and making off with half the cargo. it shouldn't happen.unfortunately, it's becoming increasinly common, as evidenced by the general freight containers that can now be seen floating next to 15-25% of high-sec stargates in eve, 50% in some areas.i believe this problem could be dented by revoking insurance on concorded ships, however this wouldn't be much of a dent, as the potential payout still far outweighs the losses pirates could suffer. a delay in smartbombs could be considered that would give concord a chance to kill the offending parties with less damage being incurred, but this could negatively effect other aspects of gameplay, since, as difficult as it may be to conceive, smartbombs can have a legitimate use. alternatively, concord could be made to react more quickly and harshly to smartbombs than other weapons, and/or, freighters can be given some low and medium slots, with which they could have the option of strenthening their defenses against attack.either way, this is a problem that needs to be addressed. it severely hinders commerce, exploits a loophole in game mechanics, makes little sense to canon, and litters the spacelanes with unsightly general freight containers."
10/29/2009,"they just need a r-click the person and click 'spam'. immediately blocks that person to you so long as you remain in that channel.if enough people 'spam' block someone in a period of time they get gagged. if this continues they get a temp ban (we're talking hours to get that ban just by player 'spam' blocking). after enough temp gags have stacked up they get looked at by a gm whether or not they've been temp-banned.also a r-click petition (type, limited range of types) that automatically inputs the name and their last message(s) and fires it off."
10/29/2009,"damar is perfect for the csm to represent faction warfare. he led the caldari way for months because he had a goal and set out to see it happen. there were 4 major fw corps plexing continually while damar liased between them all to get us all working together, it worked brilliantly. he represents many of us in fac war for the sheer reason that he leads from the front.he openly talks about the difficulties in the plex mechanic, the exploits possible, the ways in which fac war is flawed while suggesting possible fixes for all of them. he is selfless about all of this with good intentions to fix the flaws and now has the guts to put himself out there as a candidate for csm because he is the most qualified for the job, he knows it, we all know it.experience talks buckets more than some of the above personal opinions and i hope that you all see that and vote for him in the election."

10/29/2009,i agree with you there about the merc corp maxsim. plus a simple solution is to just surrender if they pull this tactic. dont even bring pride into this situation! if you are annoyed to the point you bring this topic up people then you dont even have much pride. so what if they hide on end. its their money they're spending on it. if you think they will strike your miners send protection. if they try to run from a fight then warp scramble them.

10/30/2009,"blasters can barely outdps pulses, and they have massively shorter range. that is not right."
10/30/2009,"move blasters to the highest tracking position. leave pulses as they are, maybe lower tracking a little due to their range bonus. this will give gallente blaster boats a ""uniqueness"" to them which will also make them deadly. they still have to climb up to within 5km range, but from there on in, blasters should be king."
10/30/2009,"agreed, pulse are awsome, they got tracking, range and damage.blasters are simply not powerfull enough for their extremely short range: either boost the damage output or increase the range."
10/30/2009,they look cool. want to use em. bump.

10/30/2009,haven't read the rest of the thread but supported.won't be buying dust if it isn't on pc.
10/30/2009,agreed
10/30/2009,"i'm going to hazard a guess and say that their reason for keeping it ""strictly console"" might have more to do with certain contracts which have been signed. for instance, if ccp has received any kind of pre-funding for this game development, then they are most likely required to keep the official statement as ""console only"". however, i doubt this will be the case forever. my best guess is that dust514 will become available for the pc maybe 6 months after console release, giving the game enough time to travel around the world in xbox or ps3 form before its developed in a pc version. after all, you can play halo 1 through 3 on the pc, which was something i thought i'd never see happen, given that halo carried the xbox through their dumptruck of suck since 2001."
10/30/2009,"after a ship or cargo scan is complete, allow the user to right-click --> view market details on any of the non-faction items listed.a further improvement on this would be to add a 'view available contracts' feature for contract-only items."

10/30/2009,/signedespecially useful if we are able to set incoming and outgoing options.. (for example income from the market goes into this account etc..)
10/30/2009,"i support this. it'd be great to look at a fit and see the ""current regional market price"" for it and a easy way to buy the modules quickly or move to another region and check again. the ability to set a jump range would also be good (kudos to who suggested that too)"
10/30/2009,"if the prerequisite skills for hacking and archeology should be lowered there needs to be added new and more time demanding skills to bring the ""deepness"" back into those mini-professions.above the base skills that allows you a chance to open the respective canisters (the ones we have now) there could be a skill that improves your chances of actually finding some in the canister. above that could be a skill that increases the amount of any particular item you find."
10/30/2009,this really has to be done. i am supporting this.
10/30/2009,"i'm all for a change to the mechanics, but there should still be a case where this can happen. if an alliance could have a board of directors, each with an allocation of votes per director, then you can still have a dictatorship, there is no rule saying you must have more than one director. if in the case of many directors an infiltrator can get themselves in a position where they control the majority of votes (based on a share, not the number of directors) then well done, and much more impressive. any alliance that wont give other directors some voting share has to be aware that there is one person who can take it down. leave it open to choice. if you want to run a dictatorship then you can, if you want to ensure there is oversight and checks in place to stop this, also fine."
10/30/2009,agreed.
10/30/2009,"the alliance mechanic should be more symbolic and ease the gui rather than provide weakness to the system. it would be better if the alliance cannot be disbanded and members could only be kicked through majority votes, unless the alliance is specifically totalitarian.also the fact that internet spaceships is serious ****ing business means that there will eventually be situations where people start paying rl money in order to get an alliance disbanded.removing this meta-gaming strategy will allow for alliances to properly be destroyed and will make for many more epic battles. the whole bob disband thing is not really respectable as it was not a gruelling battle of the forces but rather a sly deception and lack of trust. the cva disband was the result of an outright hack, anything and everything they lost was due to something that was not just at all."
10/30/2009,"it was kind of amusing the first time, but still stupid. if it's going to continue though, the mechanic needs changing asap. supported."

10/30/2009,"the numbers need to be adjusted to that gein in dps would be about the same as if you would use damge mod rigs, + the rigs would have drawbacks ofcorce."
10/30/2009,"needs looking into, idea's are nice, numbers can changeagreed"
10/30/2009,"supported, with criticisms.1. full support. drones are totally expendable at this time. either give them more hitpoints or open the drone bays up to support multiple launches. the ""no ammo use"" arguement is null because it still takes a drone to do damage, just like a crystal or a charge, and if i remember correctly, they don't have a tech2 hammer that i can throw to knock out your crystals or jam the loading bays of your guns.2. oh ya, total support! in fact, just buff tech2 drones, leave tech 1 alone. it takes forever to get your drone damage up to competition with guns or missiles, and you should see a pay off for all that skill training.3. sounds cool, but i've alwyas felt drone bays should be larger anyway. so why not?4-15 need tweaking, but are also good ideas, the more diversity in drones the better i say."
10/30/2009,now that's an idea
10/30/2009,"if you understand the web nerf, the main principle was the idea that once you got into web range, you where dead, there was no way to mitigate damage, and no way for faster more agile ships to get under the guns of larger ships.gallente pilots have really been asking for this change to be reversed. i'm about 51% convinced that this is a bad idea, and instead, blasters should just become better at killing ships at the same size quickly.on void, i've got other ideas on how it might be completely changed, along with all high damage ammo, stay tuned."
10/30/2009,"putting divisions on smas would be a very nice change, yes. but when it comes to poses having personal space, the problem, to my understanding, comes from the sheer awfulness of pos code. from all i've heard, it's one of the prime candidates for being the part of the code base in most desperate need of razing and rebuilding. you can't have personal assets in a pos structure - it's all corporate. from there stems at most of the problems, but it's not an easy thing to fix."
10/30/2009,"freakishly enough, i agree with jason edwards. no support, though i must say it's a more interesting ecm nerf than most."
10/30/2009,first time i ever agree with jason.damps are so weak that it takes 3 of them to annoy a single target while ecm can jam multiple ships.boost damps.
10/30/2009,"damps are horrible against bs because of their huge lock range. at least against frigates you reduce their lock range to 10km.imo they just need to remove sdas and everything will become better, less range and less jam strength especially from those cheap blackbirds."
10/30/2009,ecm should not be based on chance.it should either work or not work based on a targets sensor strength. ships with a high enough sensor strength would be unjammable. frigates with their low strengths would always face being jammed by even multispectrals. thats my opinion anyway.
10/30/2009,"deimos has more locking, muninn has better scan. and it can still lock 121, well beyond it's optimal, there's something called gang bonuses. you don't really get why people do not fly eagles? i can't do more for you, sorry. read my previous posts.and how is a 560 dps deimos useless? they're useless only to people that do not have a clue. we've killed carriers with fleets of 20 lr hacs, get out.so when was the last time you saw any of these fitted with rails? you must be joking."
10/30/2009,i would agree with that. railgun dps is subpar.
10/30/2009,"i disagree with the op's deimos change. do not balance the deimos based on sniper hacs ffs. deimos *can* be shield tanked btw, tho it could use a boost for that.but a definite *no* to changing the deimos falloff bonus (useful with blasters) to an optimal bonus! now, current falloff+ additional optimal i could live with..."
10/30/2009,"perhaps this is a bit radical but let's look at this a bit closer.why is the deimos so problematic? a lot of folks seem to be saying 'it can't be shield tanked.' which translates to 'armor tanking isn't viable'.the reason, of course, is that armor tanking cannot be passive (as armor, unlike shields, cannot fix itself over time) and anything active gets neuted. there is also the additional problem that within short range you lose your mwd to the dual point scrams.so you have a ship which needs speed to close but loses it and needs cap to tank and loses that. yep, that's a problem all right.probably best to fix cap warfare to not be so mindless - that would make active tanking a bit more viable - and make the ship's base speed a bit higher so that if it webs/scrams you back it can actually close with something of the same class in a reasonable time.fix the disease folks, not the symptoms. the deimos is supposed to be a close ranged blaster boat which armor tanks. balance that and you've fixed the problem."
10/30/2009,i think they are talking more along the lines of long range hacs and not so much close range.
10/30/2009,"you mean more dedicated than having bonus for logistic modules and triage?as carriers also have bonuses for fighter drones and warfare links i would not call them ""dedicated remote repair ships"". being capital ships they are not exactly easily accessible to new players, neither would one do particularily well trying to play dedicated remote repair in a roaming frigate gang (especially in hisec).but, let's end this one once and for all: carriers do have bonuses to remote repair! they can be set up to do it, quite well in fact! congratulations, you win!your prize, 1 pcs. chocolate chip cookie, should be arriving by mail within the next 7-14 business days. enjoy.logistics have bonus to tracking links or cap transfers. they can do other stuff. carriers are suppose to be logistics, just bigger and more flexible."

10/30/2009,"the specific powergamery thing is yet another reason why we need variable, less predictable missions.that would make the kind of specific mission abuse design you describe impossible.instead of ""you have 3 bs of x type which spawn at y time"" you simply assign 'mission level 4, angel cartel, threat level 2 room with these 2 characters' it gets much harder to powergame.mind you - the whole pve macro/mission napfest thing desperately needs fixing which is why this is on the csm agenda.the most important thing that players can bring forward is a skeleton of a mission and appropriate background anyway."
10/30/2009,good ideathe missions allready in game are made for power gamers so thats a quite bad argument against this idea.offtopic rant: all the missions need a change. whole mission mechanics/strategies need overhaul. eve missioning is most boring grind i've ever seen in any mmo. salvaging and looting the mission is even more **tarded... nothing good to say about it.

10/31/2009,"i'd say that blasters need to be changed entirely and give something new to the gun field. currently, lasers have their niche, projectiles are getting reworked to allow for some nice damage switching, but blasters work just like lasers, just worse.changes to blasters:rewrite description to say they are a high damage weapon that has difficulty hitting at anything but close range.increase damage by 50%increase tracking by 300%reduce optimal to 1tweak falloff to slightly lesschange +optimal modifiers on ammo to +falloffnow, blasters do incredible damage at close range, but have difficutly hitting anything and damage decreases with every km of range. it turns blaster ships into close range death dealers that suck for anything past 5km or so. i'm ok with that."
10/31/2009,"supported, small blasters are somewhat ok (mostly due to some great hulls to slap them on) but med and large blasters do need loving, or their bonused ships *or* the metagame. i never went with the amarr bandwagon yet but incidentally i started to go for med projectile spec just as the boost was announced and can quite fast crosstrain lasers after that..."
10/31/2009,"yes, fix explosion velocity (i think the first digit must have been forgotten on it). further either increase rof (and clip size) to boost the dps a little (but not the alpha) -or- increase velocity and damage to give more range and alpha.either is fine, but the former option is more spammy. and i like spammy."

10/31/2009,"supported. had a similar idea while ago but couldnt be arsed to hash it out completely. would improve new user experience significantly imo (the first time you go 15 jumps to assemble components of your new ship is magical - next times, not so much)it'd also be nice if such a shopping assistant (why limit it to fittings?) could also add waypoints to your autopilot. a buy all button which works according to a specified range which as you change it, it gives you an estimate of cost (and say x items not available under current limit). possibly avoid lowsec ticker. when you buy all, it goes and adds all the relevant wps if you so choose. i wouldn't mind seeing a simple fetch mode for autopilot like get x from station y in z; autopilots there, warps to station at 15km, docks, tries to move items into cargo, undocks and continues to next waypoints. doubt it would happen though (omg trader buff - this isn't afk online etc etc) nor do i personally have much use for it.really all that is needed for the op is some sort of list input which then has a window with a market widget - highlights the best choice according to the range selection. you either buy from it (quantity inserted automatically) and it moves to the next one, skip it, or cancel. be nice to see an estimate of isk cost under the current selected market filters."

10/31/2009,"elvenlord is the man who reported over 150 bugs in the past weeks just by testing sov mechanics and caps on test server. he cares, rare treat in this game, most arses are there to get isk or fame. not him, he's the man.he has my vote."
10/31/2009,personal friend and a very knowledgeable guy when it comes to eve mechanics. got my vote 4 sure.
10/31/2009,"i'm in mm, and the way i've seen this guy threaten and rant and profane and insult people for dumb @)#$%!(# in alliance chat, i'd never vote for him. ever. steer clear. some of his endorsers here are genuinely good people, but their recommendations are flawed in that they'd back up someone like this just because they know him personally and he's in our corp. heh. right. politics ftl. get wise, people. it's better to have an honest enemy than a 'friend' like this in office.edit: edited out a couple of typos"
10/31/2009,"full support, one of the outstanding members of rawr and eve community as well. he is well acquainted with both technical and political aspects of our universe. voting him will for sure expand and improve our gaming experience as end users.big thumb up"
10/31/2009,"i've flown with, argued with, yelled at and been yelled at by this guy - but have nothing but respect on a technical and personal level. he is as knowledgeable as they come and doesn't take **** from no one.@shazbot: go **** yourself mate. if you dont have the balls to criticize with your main, your word aint worth ****. elven, you got my votes - now get cracking"
10/31/2009,thumbs up!
10/31/2009,a vote for a chromium loving pilot!you got mine
10/31/2009,ofc avec joie supported
10/31/2009,elvenlord is the best lord. you know it makes sense. edit - and @shazbot. post with your main or stfu.
10/31/2009,"what, and get kicked out for telling the truth? don't think so.btw, i haven't seen anyone yet say it isn't true. that right there says more than enough, imo."
10/31/2009,vote for elvenlord and bitter alt will get more bitter.
10/31/2009,"i'm not bitter. this is a sandbox, remember? for every action there is a reaction? what you do in eve has consequences. today, i get to be part of the consequences. god knows, i can never be 1/1000th of the consequences that are deserved, but i do try.now, i just need to figure out who i'm going to vote for. :) any suggestions?"
10/31/2009,me ofc
10/31/2009,"are you saying you did some dumb @)#$%!(# and got yelled at? cos that's what it seems like you're saying i've been yelled at by elven too, and tbh can't wait for the hard time he's going to give the gms over that lingering incompetence issue (while they intimidate the rest of the csm). elven's a taskmaster, you screw up and he'll tell you. isn't that what we need the csm to do?"
10/31/2009,"that's totally true, but i am only an fc that shoots stuff and makes pew pew. elvenlord is more experienced, looks almost as sexy and knows what he is talking about. that's why he is our candidate."
10/31/2009,"elven's a fantastic choice for csm. unlike many that came before him, he's got such a dedication to the finer details of the game; tirelessly testing out new changes on sisi while running logistics on tranq. he can be short at times, but only because he's brutally efficient.a big thumbs up and votes incoming for elven."
10/31/2009,"sorry helen, with so many goons running and at least two guarenteed seats. it will not be a good representation of the eve comunnity to have so many goons in the csm, voting for you will just add more.i will be voting for someone else."
10/31/2009,"they say that 1 person can't make a difference. in eve we can. i represent the independent pod pilots, small corporations, small and renter alliances. yes we are small but together we are larger than the mega-corporations and can be heard. make me your voice on the council. i will listen, i will take your ideas and concerns to ccp. we can and we will be heard. join me. vote alpais in the csm election.thank you for your support and vote."
10/31/2009,when is this tool ready? and when have the canditates posted their responses?
10/31/2009,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.hi, i<U+FFFD>m korvin, csm candidate. i<U+FFFD>m playing eve since 2004, survived and adapted to a great numbers of changes and addons, had learned almost every aspect of a game, played different styles and different ways. as a possible csm member, i would focus now more on polishing the game, before some new radical changes can take place. there were many cool expansions last years, and i want just to stop for a while, look at the all of effects they brought to a game, and remove the negative one. that means more balancing, bugfixing and small improvements, that was promised by our lovely soon<U+FFFD> crew. i mean: pos fixes, like slot rental and remote invention; corporation and alliance management improvements; new look at the guns balancing problem, based not only on the dps graph, but more deeply on advantages and disadvantages list (well, i call it top gun project, i have some calculations already, and the results were more than interesting, for example try to compare the tracking of the range top med guns on all lvl 5, and the dps on close and the range ammo, count all advantages, like instant ammo change, damage type of choice ets); the ui changes like direct scan and drone managements; ew review, counting all speednerfs, scripts introduction and new ships added recently; and the numerous small balance problems, that have their order on the list, waiting for some love. that<U+FFFD>s what i<U+FFFD>m up to: fix all that small problems one by one, before we have some new challenge on the next cool expansions. so, the elections has started, you can vote for me here. let's do the eve the better place to live."

10/31/2009,"i would like to formally announce my candidacy for the csmmy campaign page is located here:darth sith for csmplease take the time to read my history and consider me as your voice for the csmfor those who do not like following web links, here is a brief outline of my platform:many know me as darth sith, many as nacona as i founded 2 alliances and impacted the lives of literally thousands of people in game. my campaign platform is simple: i bring experience. since entering the game in feb of 2005 i have gone on to found 2 major alliances, act as ceo for corporations, personally oversee construction of 2 outposts, and build every ship class from frigate to t2 and titan. i have explored wormholes, grinded missions, fcd every type of fleet imaginable and spent countless hours on ts with my peers. in real life, i manage technical teams, work face to face with large enterprises, perform technical project management and am a sitting member of a certification board. this gives me r/l experience with dealing with teams and differing opinions to accomplish common goals. so both in game and in r/l i have a proven track record for working with others in a constructive manner. unlike other candidates, i do not view eve through a single lens, i am an active pvp pilot / fc, i build anything from t1 frigates to t2 command ships and supercapitals, i am a t2 bpo holder and an inventor/explorer. i see eve from many angles and can have intelligent discussions about recommendations with first hand knowledge of the impact to other disciplines in eve. i am interested in pushing for long overdue changes like differing graphics for bpcs while also being able to provide meaningfull feedback to ccp on the planned changes to sov, 0.0 life and fleet mechanics. i promise to bring to the csm a politically neutral viewpoint on eve issues and represent all disciplines within the player base. i promise to bring unbiased experience ..my key objectives:- use my experience in 0.0 to help with the development of the new sov system as it evolves post dominion- push for more granularity in corp roles (why does a diplomat have to be a director?)- t2 insurance update- balancing of exploration / mining around timezones (so everything isn't exhausted by the time north american players can log on- color coding bpc's. ccp has been avoiding it but now that they have the resources it should be revisited.- continue to remove imbalanced passive income sources for the small minority of players- expand wormhole opportunitiesmy promise:- i promise to a bring politically neutral and unbiased approach to all player recommendations- i promise to read all threads posted in the csm forums in a timely manner and provide feedback- i promise to attend all csm council meetings with an open mind and come prepared with player input- i promise to bring forward subjects and issues that are on the minds of the player base and not just my own"
10/31/2009,"my name is ashina sito and i am running for csm, why should you vote for me? first a little about who i am. my main involvement in game covers an area that has been left out by previous and current csm. entry level pvp within eve. for the past year and a half i have used my in game time to expose new (and old) players to pew pew pew pvp within eve. both with fleet/gang support and experience as well as basic pvp class instruction. you can check my blog for more detailed information about the planks i have for my csm candidacy platform. a brief rundown follows.- more ""incubator"" systems/constellations/regions. places in 0.0 for new players/corps/alliances can start out. - the ability to activate plex from web site. - more development of anomalys in 0.0 - basic ui fixes- a strong desire to beat to a pulp the designer of the font used by the eve ui. (also a strong voice to have that font changed so you can actually read what it says.) a link to my eve-tribune interview.web siteif anyone has any questions about my candidacy just make a post here and i will answer.will add more later... off to teach a pvp class atm. edit: teaching a class on halloween is not a good idea if you want people to attend."
10/31/2009,a few people have asked be about the pvp training i do. here is a video taken during one of those events. we had a nightmare scanned down and attacked it with t1 bc/cruiser/desys and frigs. (note: i can only record after my ship has gone down do to voice issues so the fc is out of the picture by the time the video starts.)nightmare in venalthis is a link to a training video. i am still looking for some editing software that will work for me. i plan to make a bunch of short (hopefully smaller sized) pvp training videos in the future.pvp gate scouting videofinally i am posting a poor resolution video of a battle hulk in a can flipping fight vs a rifter. you can fight back and make the pirates cry.when hulks attack
10/31/2009,"although, due to work obligations, i was not able to participate in the pvp training she outlined, i can vouch for ashina. she has been a strong presence to help out the new cas members with the ccd (cas combat day) program she runs. she knows a lot about eve, and would be a great asset to the csm team."
10/31/2009,"i am going to make this short.my life in eve started in spring 2003 and i have stayed with the game for the past 6 years. over that time i have explored everything the games have to offer.if you want to have someone in the csm that has a broad knowledge about and deep passion for the game i am your candidate.my only focus is keeping balance in the game. balance to be understood in the broadest sense. balance professions, balance of combat, balance of economy, balance of skills, etc.. having a good understanding of the games aspects is essential for that, and that is what i can bring to the csm.thank you for your time."
10/31/2009,"i really put my foot in it, didn't i??!!!as candidate for the 4th council of stellar management it is my goal to ascertain the needs of miners, researchers, traders and builders, and make these needs known to ccp and the devs. too many times the ""producers"" are overlooked, or even nerfed, in favour of the pvpers in the game. i am here to make certain that we are given a strong, fair, reliable voice in the council.we work hard, perhaps too hard, for our isk. yet we are constantly beset by pirates, gankers, griefers, not to mention the inevitable npc pirates. one thing i have heard from fellow production characters is the need for better yields, whether mining, or researching a blueprint. other topic of note: access to some high-end asteroids in low-sec; ability to mine a moon dry.. (similar to asteroids ??)as a member of the csm, i intend to press forward these issues as well as the many others of interest to those of us who provide the materiel and products that pvpers blow up."
10/31/2009,would i be correct in assuming that you are a girl in real life?
10/31/2009,"hallan, i would be more than happy to answer any questions you may have for your readers."
10/31/2009,there you go :)
10/31/2009,"this is in interesting and very cool concept. i will try and get on the site and input my information sometime on saturday.thanks for the effort.ashina sitoafter filling out the questionnaire i waned to add some responses.some questions are interconnected. removing meta o-1 loot from the mission loot table would make l4 missions less profitable. this would remove any need for l4 missions to be moved to low sec. at the same time it would decrease the available minerals in eve which would result in more profitability for people who mime with mining lasers instead of guns. which element is important depends on which one you adjust first.i did not like the mandatory 3 ""important"" question requirement. mainly because only one of the questions warranted that designation from my perspective. even then it had less to do with what i am intrested in promoting and more to do with being ""good for the game"" as a whole. then again i do understand it is needed to have a functional weighting system.you will have candidates, like myself, that will not be well represented with this effort. a suggestion for the future would be to have some of the burning topics on the forums on the questionnaire and then have each csm candidates submit a question. some of them will overlap but, you should be able to get a broader sample of the issues all of the csm candidates wish to promote.lastly, it would not be bad to have a comments option. ether attach it to your ""important"" question or give the csm the option to add it to 3 questions. a brief ""twitter"" type comment would be best.anyway, thanks you for the effort. it looks like it will be a valuable tool for a number of the voters out there who have not as yet made up their minds."
10/31/2009,"thank you dierdra vaal for setting this resource up. greymouse,speaker for all things industrialist, has completed the profile survey. i will be interested to see people's views; especially with dominion unfolding in just over a month. greymouse"
10/31/2009,good initiative!i have filled out the candidate questionare.and i guess this is my first post as an official csm candidate. let the fun begin.
10/31/2009,"profile completed, and doing my bit to spread the love :d||| v"
10/31/2009,profile completed.
10/31/2009,"thank you all. if you feel you are not properly represented in these questions, please let me know. i cannot change questions for this term (they are locked now), but i will keep it in mind for next term."
10/31/2009,"i thought it was a decent balance between different game aspects, just a tad few, next time expand it a bit in each direction to get a more detailed coverage and thus more detailed matches."
10/31/2009,"this question should be devided by 2. r64 moons are not just a point income sources, but also a passive income - and therefore should be nerfed. static complexes were main conflict drivers indeed - i learned my first pvp lessons there, you have to fight every time you want to take resp. that was good and i have lots of friends i first met there."
10/31/2009,"i had originally planned to have 50 questions, but after talking it over with my host (serenity steele) i decided on 30 so it wouldnt scare away users who felt 50 questions was too much work. i'll re-evaluate it after the csm4 election tho - maybe i underestimate the users."
10/31/2009,"see it this way, if someone is interested enough to click your link and read the site then he should also have the courage to fill out a few more questions.alternatively you could make a short and a long version (10 and 50 questions? :p)"
10/31/2009,"great initiative, but my interests in seeking representations with the csm is rather conflicting with this. comparing - the ""stemwijzer"" you put forth argues over several topics in day-to-day governance of the game itself. i am interested in making the game a lot bigger and diverse. i find myself completely disinterested in quite a few these issues you put forth. that isn't to say they aren't valid, rather i am not interested in putting forth an opinion on them. i'll be really clear about this - i am just not interested in representing anyone who expects me to argue on these points, either for or against. however if players would like me to cautiously argue with ccp games for a drastic expansion of the game itself, either through adding ambulation, either through adding an extra layer of real estate transactions, or more permanent structures in space, squatting of structures in space, in-world political manipulation, founding more diverse organisational structures, player-generated content, player generated missions, having an organisational network of npc's work for you, extensive ship crews, maybe even really lateral concepts such as a new (fifth) faction - then vote for me. if you absolutely don't want any of these, please do not consider voting for me because i won't represent your interests. my representation concerns eve five, ten years from now. i simply do not see where the questionnaire allows for me representing these. maybe i could have inserted these ideas on the forums - but i don't like reading acres of forum posts. they bore me to death so far - that might change, or it might not."
10/31/2009,filled out my survey. good batch of questions you wound up with.
10/31/2009,"as you'll have seen by now, i've done my best to figure out if what the majority wants is the same as what the csm seems to feel they want. and from the survey i've done there is plenty of indication that the two aren't exactly on the same wavelength.true, my survey was limited, the tools i had at my disposal where limited, the people i could reach where only a small number... but then, shouldn't any csm candidate be provided the right tools to see clearly what the ingame majority wants? isn't it absolutely essential that every csm has the tools needed to reach the entire playerbase, and not just the people on the forum and those in their own alliances?i've seen some people call the pve-gamers the 'silent majority'. this is quite spot-on.but as my survey showed me, when i go ingame and get people to fill it in there, the results do start to sway towards pve, where-as when i promoted the survey on the forum, it goes towards pvp. no wonder that the last csms where so pvp oriented...to truely represent the whole playerbase, there must be easy to use ingame tools accessible from the graphical user interface that lead directly to survey tools, the voting system, the assembly hall, etc. etc. this will greatly alter the types of suggestions made, and how they are voted upon. it will alter who gets voted into the csm, and thus what changes the csm will bring about. it is the core of most of the issues that people currently have with the whole system.i feel that pvp knowlage and voting power is allready greatly represented on the csm, i need not add to it, it's in good hands. but as a democratic system, the csm doesn't have the tools it needs to complete it's most basic functions. this is the groundwork needed to truely represent everyone, and i want to lay that groundwork for you.see you on the campaign trail...-aynen"
10/31/2009,"i had a look recently on what the topics are for the eve regulars, and i found myself not really all that interested in the current talking points of csm meetings. sure, in a year i'll probably care about some of these issues, but for now, i could care less. rather, having registered myself as candidate, invite another kind of vote.in short- expanding the game far beyond the current content- adding ship crews- adding 'power play mechanics'- adding a range of new gameplay tools- adding ambulation and fps-ambulation based skills for actively exploring planets, derelicts, wrecks, stations, vessels and planets- adding habitats, skyhooks, solar arrays to the game- allowing vastly more player control over structures, real estate, investmentsin short, doing whatever it takes to have ccp add a whole range of new aspects to the game, while sacrificing none of the current content or quality."
10/31/2009,so...are you essentially saying that you do care about these issues now? or that you couldn't care less at the moment?i believe that this is a crucial point of understanding!
10/31/2009,in case i am elected (very slim chance i'd say) i see solid ground for a coalition.
10/31/2009,"i'd say slim to none, tbh."
10/31/2009,feel free to email me any questions
10/31/2009,"well, i've finally seen them, can't say anything specifically except if you are an industrialist you will just break down into uncontrollable weeping.issler"
10/31/2009,thank you very much for this feedback. really all that was needed from the csm was the occasional status report such as this.skunk
10/31/2009,"well... as written in my description, i positioned myself as candidate from russian speaking players. but its not the main theme for my election campaign. first of all - little about myself.i play eve from spring 2004. i expirienced most of all areas of game. i do not like pvp for myself... actualy i dont like pvp without reason, just for fun. so i dont look at eve as some players, which want very few things in one area - give me more dps! - they say. i say - no. eve is very, very, very complex game, and you know it. eve needs careful steps to be enchanced without disbalancing it. and i have this expirience from my real life. more than 10 years i making lifeaction roleplay games. its wonderful, how similar laws governing people in game envirointment. and more interesting thing - its almost have no dependanse on scale! when you pick 200 people, or 2000 - they mostly do same things in same proportions.so... combining my real and eve expiriense i think, that i will do good job for you all!thank you!-----------------------------------------------------my bio and other stuff located on my site and avaliable on russian atm. if you interested - ask, i will tranlate it for you.dont hesitate to ask questions here.-----------------------------------------------------sorry for errors, that can be present in texts, english is not my native."
10/31/2009,thread and process updated.-t'amber
10/31/2009,"it is extremely easy to have a year of csm members elected, largely by chance, that has no effect whatsoever. the people, argue back and forth, ccp listens, nods politely and does what it wants. and that is the way it ought to be. however, if you have one iota of common sense, you have an afternoons talk with some developers and artists and coders at ccp, without being a hassle, and get a feel for what compells these people and what is a consideration in the game. and then you present your points in that light. and you woo them. you seduce them. and you bring them into your way of thinking.i can't say for certain i would be able to pull that off. but i'll give it a decent try."
10/31/2009,i might vote for lark
