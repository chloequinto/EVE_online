10/1/2014,if there was a substantial cost in isk (not plex) involvedif it was allowed not more than once every six monthsa search for your character also showed a list of names the character used to have.this way people are not lumbered with the stupid name they picked/inherited when they were drunk/bought the char.a name change would not hide the characters previous sins.
10/1/2014,"would you like to go ahead and show me where in the policy that an unlockable ship is considered to be ""in"" the shields, or how in any way that was clarified? want to field this one for me? because right now you sound like an uneducated imbecile. there a many situations where a ship may be ""unlockable"", perhaps a jammer on the tower has you jammed, how would you know? don't go pontificating on a topic you obviously know nothing about just to make your pedantic little self sound smarter than you actually are.#freeaglon"
10/1/2014,it's nice to see there's cohesion and serenity between ccp members and a very developed communication bridge between players and the gms. i'm glad that the money i'm paying monthly is going for a good cause./sarcasm_offthis.
10/1/2014,"okay, now i have to ask a few questions at this point.where is the gigantic list of exploits that are not acceptable, in one location? i'll take the time to read them as soon as i can find this list. link please. also the ""polite agreements outside official rules"" list and location.what does count as inside/outside bubble due to bad parking job and therefore bumpable in situations like these? some clarification please.i don't know any of the pilots involved on either side, but i find it vaguely disturbing the lack of across the board gm communication and enforcement on specific decisions, how what's acceptable in one region is a complete no-go in another, etc.is there a ""house rules"" book from one place to another i need to get ahold of so i don't get in trouble while learning eve and not wanting to bail as a rookie? what are the variations of rules and their enforcement from highsec, lowsec, and nullsec? are there differences? if so, please clearly explain as i don't understand that. part of that whole sauce for the goose upbringing i had beat into my skull growing up.if i don't know the sandbox arbitrary rules here and there, i'm going to run into something that'll get me banned and i won't know it until it's too late.the perma-ban, in my opinion, at this point either needs to be lifted or some reasons for it remaining passed to the player base. the ""it's an internal affair"" simply isn't going to fly on this one, considering no clarification on the bumping in this titan's situation has been released as why this is exploit when it does appear it's occurred elsewhere and there was not a perma-ban handed out for those instances.even the bestest peeps have kender moments. this is sounding like one, and the continuing silence reeks of, if we ignore it long enough, it'll go away.thank you for your time this morning.>jeven"
10/1/2014,"aglon has received a reply and was reduced to a 30 day ban. (still horse ****)""pos bumping does fall under pos bowling umbrella""i would be detailed here but he asked not to be for fear of futher banning.they further state stuff about not being clear on circumstances, so giving him the benefit of the doubt, yada yada.so, is this the latest rule? no ship bumping unless lockable first? still no clear post or word from ccp to the community.i will write off the lack of banning of the 0.0 guys as typical ccp favoritism.gfy(goofy)p.s. thanks for all of the support and effort put into this by so many people."
10/1/2014,i would still love to see what gm mails got the nc. titan pilots.. :p
10/1/2014,"good news that the ban is no longer permanent. still heavy handed i feel but we'll take it i guess. the bumping/pos bowling exploit notification still requires clarification, or other groups will attempt to this down the road and this drama will repeat itself. a central location listing all bannable exploits was a suggestion someone made earlier in the thread, and is an excellent idea."
10/1/2014,glad to hear aglon will have the option to come back if he still wants to. i'm not sure if anyone has gained any knowledge on the issue though. i actually have a few more questions now that aglon's sentence has been reduced and what that may mean.
10/1/2014,"snip, double posted."
10/1/2014,"unfortunately no. the question was never answered. the point of the thread was to clarify upon the vague documentation about bumping a ship that is inside of a pos. i am glad to see that algon had his ban reduced. then again though i feel like the point of the thread was overlooked. for any ccp members or gm members lurking in the thread or maybe monitoring the thread the question was, ""the player was notified that if the ship is not lockable then it is in the pos. can someone please show me the rule, post, etc. that states this?"""
10/1/2014,"i agree. i can say the latest official response (not seen by anyone or even read by the player in question because he is scared of getting banned even uttering the contents in his own head) ""to one player"" is that unless it is lockable, it is banable.now if they would just post that someplace for everyone the rule would be clear. completely stupid but clear. nice to know i can now bridge people with 40% of a titan sticking out of the pos and be safe. make sense right? ffs"
10/1/2014,"just wait until someone gets bumped out and killed and is not reimbursed and the bumper doesn't get banned. i give this about 3 or 4 weeks before it happens, anyways glad he is not perma banned. now we can finally shift our efforts over to the real issue of getting ccp to change this completely unrealistic and idiotic rule. ""lockable"" may seem like a good way to define in or out for a newbie, but we all know just how many situations can prevent you from locking a ship. this is especially true when dealing around pos' s. so ccp... you gonna use some logic today or just continue making ship skins for the lol's?only time will tell i suppose..."
10/1/2014,"i know ccp doesn't want to draw clear line for fear of people exploiting that, but it would be nice if they at least told us things that are bannable.and preferably issue temp bans and warnings when someone enters the grey area. i don't understand why ccp permabans players when the rules aren't clear."
10/1/2014,"well, that's better than expected....ccp, please surprise me and clarify the ruling in a way that makes legitimate sense."
10/1/2014,"personally i don't like or use isboxer.would be hard to implement a fair, accurate and consistent mechanism to ban people using it.an attempt might cause more angst than its worth."
10/1/2014,"it's actually simple. the ""problem"" is that it might generate a couple of false positives, which imo is a fair price to pay."
10/1/2014,"tl;dr: if isboxer does not give an advantage to players that use it, why do they use it?it isn't about the single pilot/character. of course any single pilot/character is no better than another. its about the single player at a computer that is controlling the accounts. the single player multiboxing 20 accounts with isboxer is gaining resources at 20x the rate of a single player with 1 account.let us suppose that that second player also has 20 accounts; all equally skilled. but he is not using isboxer. can he/she manage all 20 accounts as efficiently as the person using isboxer? theoretically, yes. realistically? hell, no. when an actual player has to manually input every action 20x, he or she will make more mistakes than the isboxer. it will also take 20x the time to make all those inputs. if the activity is of a short enough duration, it becomes mechanically impossible to do so.this kind of scenario comes into play when you get into pvp. there is no way in hell one player can manually pilot a squad of bombers effectively without isboxer. it requires simultaneous coordination across the entire fleet that cannot be attained with only one player across several accounts.isboxer multiplies a single player's inputs. it reduces fatigue and the opportunity for mistakes by doing for the player what he otherwise could not do. it is the difference between 1 guy running back and forth between 20 machine gun positions, or 1 guy remotely controlling 20 machine guns. when used for resource gathering, it allows one player to gain an in-game advantage over other players that are not using it. if it didn't, there would be no reason to use it.as for whether or not ccp could write code to detect isboxer, of course they can. they already have and use it to detect bots.when you have 20 guys in local and 18 of them are named borgcube[xxx], where xxx is a 3-digit numeric sequence starting at 000 and ending at 020, all of them are in mackinaws, all the ships are named the same, and all of them are mining ice at the same anom from the same location in space, or sitting at pos inactive because waiting for the ice anom to respawn, its not hard to figure out what is going on.ccp already has detection algorithms for easily predictable botting methods (ie: specific actions being taken at specific intervals, inhumanly long gaming sessions, etc). i see no reason they cannot do something similar for isboxer. all it does is multiply one player's inputs by however many accounts they have set up. so the inputs should all arrive at the same time. if they aren't then either its not isboxer, or they have another layer of automated input modificaton running to disguise or alter their inputs.i've seen the picture of some dude that tied 8 mice together with rubber bands and pencils as an illustration of how one could multibox in order to circumvent any multiboxing restrictions ccp might put in place. of course, i dare anyone to actually try something that obviously shoddy and facetious. even if it mechanically and electrically worked, good luck getting it to work consistently. at that point, you'd be better off just buying plex and selling them on the market for all the rl effort being put into it.this is the unfortunate nature of sandbox gaming. there will always be players that are so desperate to be ""better"" than the next player that they will take any advantage they can get.imo, isboxer provides an in-game advantage to a single player over other single players that do not use it. as such, it is my opinion that it should be banned."
10/1/2014,"see, soldarius gets what i was trying to portray.where however par'gellen you are like the player he was talking about....like the type i heard one of my brothers talking about with cod games....the twitch lag cheaters and such....the ones that think they are so great and doing nothing wrong.....but level the playing field.....and you are no better than the next guy in the belt."
10/1/2014,"something else that at least adds to being suspicious is the striking similarities of the pilots of such fleets.to put it short: i'm in full agreement to what you explained here, thanks for that."
10/1/2014,interesting. tell me more please.
10/1/2014,i'm not a ship balancer but in principle i like this idea
10/1/2014,glad to see another person in favor.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
10/1/2014,"a secret star chamber is still a star chamber, regardless of tinkering around who sits on it or how many. the core of any ban reform must be the disclosure of who, when and why bans are laid down for the community at large to digest and comment on.failure to do the above, makes any proposed reform irrelevant imho.if ccp isn't willing to defend bans and their details in public on a case by case basis, then perhaps said ban is ultimately indefensible?f"
10/1/2014,if they differ then by default the player should not be banned. if the first guy feels strongly about it he should contact his supervisor who would make the final decision.
10/1/2014,"this is really the problem. if we were playing wow, things would be much simpler. in wow any sort of scamming or trolling is against the rules and doing those things will get you suspended(not permabanned on the first attempt), so there is much less unclarity.eve is much more grey and ccp ban process is influenced by community pressure. they have dealt with undesirable behavior through immediate permabans. this requires a much higher level of scrutiny to work."
10/1/2014,i can second this. i have received death threats and racial hate speech multiple times. i watchlist the offender and i have never seen one suspended. the process is very inconsistent.
10/1/2014,"this is what bothers me about the ""we can't give a line because players will toe it"" bit. the point of the line is to correct player behavior. most players, even scammers and ""griefers"", will obey the rules if they know what those are. if you screw up the line, well you can always change it. but you can't expect players to behave better if they don't know what they are doing wrong.falcon's ""common sense"" reply makes no sense when you consider that most of the people being banned didn't believe what they were doing was banworthy and many gms don't even seem to believe its banworthy. i think part of the issue comes down to slow inconsistent enforcement. titan pos bumping has gotten a wide variety of responses depending the gm. erotica1 was doing pretty much the same thing for several months, with many petitions. then we see sudden permabans over it.when a group of people do x for months with no warnings, they will continue to do x, or may even do x+1. still no warning, so x+2. then we see a permaban which is seemingly out of nowhere and people saying ""i have pretty much been doing this for several months, why am i suddenly permabanned?"""
10/1/2014,"that's the other part that is irritating about this whole charade. most of this is being actioned by one gm, and appeals denied by the same guy. and they expect me to trust this?"
10/1/2014,"deciding whether or not to enable a new use for plex on the basis that it might change plex prices is not imo how one makes good balance decisions.the only thing op's proposal will do is reduce the amount of tears one sheds every time one looks at all those level 5s they really want and have to spend a butt-tonne of time to get, or accelerate one into some of those extremely high multiplier speciality skills. the actual benefits are typically very small.plex for remaps sounds fine to me. supported."

10/1/2014,
10/2/2014,"thank ****. i was loosing faith in ccp for a moment due to the utter madness in perma-banning a player who has been playing and contributing to the game for so long out of the blue like that. we still desperately need clarification on the ""exploit"" at hand though.thanks to all who expressed their concern at aglon's ban and spoke up about it!"
10/2/2014,"hello. i apologize for the long wait. i've read every post in this thread and i'm going to comment on some of the major concerns raised.i can not make any comment on the outcome of individual reimbursement tickets or specific account suspensions, this is a matter of policy and i'm sorry that some of your questions might go unanswered.pos bowlingfirst off, here is the clarification you've all requested:if a ship can be locked and fired upon, it can be legitimately bumped. if a ship cannot be locked due to it's position within a forcefield, it should be protected by said forcefield. such a ship can only be legitimately bumped out of the forcefield with proper access rights to enter the forcefield.cyno bumping was also considered an exploit until it was fixed with the oceanus release.public exploit notificationsi acknowledge that there's been a lack of clarity concerning the exploit status of this particular nuance of pos bowling. this was our failure, we haven't done a good job communicating about this exploit and i humbly apologize for this mistake on our part. we will make an effort to react more quickly to requests for clarification of this sort in the future. we will also take steps to improve visibility of public exploit announcements that are still in effect, it is a very reasonable complaint that exploit announcements are currently only found buried under months or even years of news items. moving forward, we will per suggestions in this thread and from the csm maintain an archive of some sort of publicly announced exploits still in effect. do keep in mind however that this will not be a comprehensive list of prohibited activity within the game. such a list is not realistic as exploits are often not known to us until they're abused. the drone damage exploit from this summer is a good example of this. the bug enabling this exploit had potentially existed for a long time before it became known to us. it should however have been very clear to anyone abusing that exploit that they were utilizing a game bug to increase the damage output of their drones beyond what was intended by the game.some exploits are also discovered and fixed before they see widespread abuse. in such cases we deem it best not to publicly announce the existence of the exploit since it could very well backfire and result in widespread abuse before the bug is addressed.in short: lack of an official ccp announcement regarding is not a free license to abuse game bugs without repercussions. abuse of an bug/exploit is not okay just because we haven't yet publicly stated that abuse of this particular exploit won't be tolerated. if in doubt, file a support ticket and ask if what you're doing/intending to do is prohibited or not, we do not punish players who stumble on an exploit and report it to us in good faith.i want to clearly state that the variant of pos bowling this thread covers is a special case. clarification was absolutely necessary and we fully admit our mistake in this regard. it wasn't clear to you, our players, that this was an exploit and it is therefore a different case than, to make a hypothetical example, an item duping exploit which hasn't been publicly announced.exploits and account suspensionswe take exploit abuse extremely seriously, especially when the exploit in question has been publicly designated as such. action is taken when a player is verified to have exploited a game bug to his/her advantage. the severity of the exploit and the player's warning/ban history are both factors in determining which action is taken.account suspensions are not a luck of the draw as some have suggested. all gms operate under the same processes and procedures and we do not make any distinction based on a player's corporation/alliance affiliation. the same ruleset applies to all eve players.we will not suspend a player's account based on player testimony, youtube videos or player-submitted screenshots alone. a decision to suspend a player's account must always be backed up by information in our server-side logs, we do not arbitrarily ban players. that is not to say that we never make mistakes, we are after all human. there are however strict internal guidelines regarding account suspension and we don't ban players for exploit abuse without evidence.best regards, lead gm lelouch ccp customer support | eve online | dust 514"
10/2/2014,"all the players require quite often, is clarity. it's nice to see you put your hands up to failings in this instance and it seems a wrong from those failings has been rectified.nice post gm lelouch. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/2/2014,if so whay warent the nc. titan pilots baned? im not talking about a perma ban.
10/2/2014,"then please make it so that said ship is lockable if it's partly sticking out of the forcefield. having looked at the image of the original titan and bubble i'd have gone for the bump as well (and would happily have whored on the resultant km if i'd been online).i get cyno bumping is an exploit as clearly you can bump something out which is inside the forcefield completely. i get awoxing the pos password and/or corp is legit. but if your titan is sticking out of the pos and isn't lockable then that is a game play / visual issue, not an exploit issue. eve is hard enough to play without having to worry about exploits, especially when you feel you *are* playing within the rules. should we take a screen shot and ask which titans we are allowed to bump out of the pos? how much needs to be sticking out before it becomes lockable? i know, for instance, that if you are repping a pos with a carrier and you are aligned along the shield line horizontally you are lockable (and therefore a legitimate bump target), however the second you turn into the pos your carrier is not lockable (as the targetable zone is a cuboid, and turns into the pos shield). your ship *does not need to move* for this effect to happen, it just needs to turn! is this not abusing the same game exploit but from the opposite way?then what happens if someone is powering towards you in their machariel as you turn into the pos shield? they lose target lock in the last 2 seconds before they hit you, hey presto instant banhammer! especially if that bump *does* put the carrier out of the shield. technically the mach pilot has done nothing wrong here,but they have used an 'exploit' just as much as you have by turning into the pos shield.yes, i know this is edge case scenario, but ffs make pos shields and bumping work sensibly.imho it should be quite simple - ship model inside shields, ship safe. ship model partly outside shields, ship targetable, bumpable and shootable. it should not be that hard to make that code work(!) if it is that hard give me a call and i'll write it for you...this case specificallyas to the outcome - i get you can't comment as a gm but it seems every player that has looked at this has the same opinion - and when your entire player base (including plenty of shadow cartel's reds i hasten to add) is on one side and one gm is on the other then perhaps that gm is wrong? reduction to a timed ban is progress, but really the ban should be revoked totally.fundamentally the underlying question is was this person trying to abuse an exploit?"
10/2/2014,thankyou for the clarification and follow up gm lelouch.
10/2/2014,indeed thank you for the clarification. it is not exactly the answer i assume all of us were wanting however an answer never less.
10/2/2014,"thanks for the clarification ccp lelouch, and thanks for looking into the situation about the ban and remedying it!cheers,"
10/2/2014,"thank you for the clarification, see that wasn't hard was it. *puts pliers away*now that it's confirmed unacceptable (exploiting) to interact with a titan from outside of the pos field, when the titan is unlockable (thus effectively making all pos/bridge titans unkillable). i think you also look into the other potential exploit / unfair game mechanic which allows titans to interact with ships outside of the pos field whilst themselves being protected by the same. ie: bridging through the shield.thanks community manager www.battleclinic.com @battleclinic loadouts + killboards + forums twitter @anabaric_eve www.the-bastards.net recruitment: open"
10/2/2014,"i believe the word you're looking for is suspended, as banning implies something permanent."
10/2/2014,"so how is one supposed to kill a pos titan? there's no actual way to do it, is there.seems like a bug to me."
10/2/2014,you don't. i did not agree with the gm's response.
10/2/2014,kill the pos.
10/2/2014,we live in low sec. **** caging does not exist.
10/2/2014,so if the ban has been overturned as a mistake is it safe to assume the reimbursement has been taken away/reduced to the same amount?
10/2/2014,"huh, that is really interesting.... i put it to you that your colleague senior gm karidor does not share this ethic."
10/2/2014,"i assume this only applies to bans for exploiting? otherwise, how does this mesh with your policy on out-of-game harassment, which by its nature has to rely on player-submitted evidence?"
10/2/2014,"soldarius wrote:tl;dr: if isboxer does not give an advantage to players that use it, why do they use it?ahh, but there is a flaw in youf logic. the flaw is that ccp doesn't care about advantage to the player. if they were concerned about one player gaining advantage over another player, then anyone who had more alts than another player, or any player who could afford to sell more plex, or any of a hundred different things, would be in violation. ccp cares about giving advantagd to the account.besides, as has already been stated, but you've chosen to ignore for your own convienence, is that the main perks of isboxer can be duplicated through a pure hardware solution. this pure hardware solution, found on page 1 of this very thread incidentally, is the reason isboxer was removed from the list of software that could get you banned. for the price of a highend gaming desktop computer, i can use this pure hardware solution to run 10-20 accounts st once, all performing the exact same actions, all without isboxer."
10/2/2014,mmhmm more likes. pleasewhat do you think of making the those 4 ships have really low mass 250-300k tonnes... with three lows to match it with jf's
10/2/2014,relevant.
10/2/2014,"i have been wondering :all fine and dandy but this makes no difference to small entities aslong as 1000 baltecs, ishtars or w/e... its the numbers not the ships beeing fielded.if large null sec groups wont be able to bring in their mass archons they will bring in their mass subcaps still resulting in smaller groups not having a chance in any null.jump bridges/portal are affected as well but slowing down everything stops escelations to happen so this will most likely end in less pvp than actually more pvp.sov holding alliances are basically locked in their own regions. so smaller groups will have to venture into their sov ending up within 5ly and therefore beeing blobbed to f*ck again.i am afraid that this change will infact buff large null groups instead of nerfing them as they can turn their space into a bulwark gettin phat of that moon goo.its a nice idea but still needs a whole lot of work.how about working on a cyno mass limit within a certain range of the cyno for example ?like 5 supers per cyno within 25au ..."
10/2/2014,introducing mechanics to slow down travel and make getting around more inconvenient (no more suicide-clones) sounds like a bad idea part of a bad plan that is trying to fix a bad idea. i don't think i've ever been playing and wished that i could travel more slowly. getting from point a to b in eve already occupies a lot of time. will increasing the time to travel increase the time required to play the game and get anything out of it? i'm already on the verge of letting my account expire due to not having enough time to dedicate. many aspects of the game already border on or cross into the realm of being a full-time hobby.it could end up making the game boring for a lot of players if it doesn't actually work as desired.
10/2/2014,"apart from death threats, i had the police visit me a couple of years ago over an alleged **** i committed on a 10 year old girl, in a country i've never been to, when i'd never even held a passport. what made this worse was i had reported the people who threatened me with this (all over an awoxed orca) to ccp & they did nothing about it, while likely giving the police the information they needed to track me down over a false allegation."
10/2/2014,it's not inconsistent.it's biased. and that is absolutely not okay.
10/2/2014,"ccp is not a judicial body, it's a small video game company. they can only devote very few resources to policing the online interactions of their hundreds of thousands of customers, so it would be unrealistic to expected them to do it very well. however, with that in mind, i think that we have a right to expect that in all but the most egregious of offenses, they would use warnings and temporary bans to keep player behavior from straying too close to the line. permabannings should be only used after multiple temporary bans, and in cases in which a player poses an actual danger to the safety and quality of life of another player, such as in the case of the fellow who accused mallak azaria of **** and reported him to the police, or the fellow who made threatening phone calls to psychotic monk's girlfriend and employer.the practice of having appeals processed by the same individual who decided on the ban in the first place is so unprofessional that i don't even know what ccp could be thinking on that one."
10/2/2014,"i feel there are only two ways to go with this, and its the middle ground that ccp has gotten into trouble with...1) publish every ban, preceding warnings and narrative on cause for the community to review and comment on. this way the community can at least be assured arbitrary star chamber executions are not being done by individual employees grinding personal axes. they can decide on a personal level if they agree with said bans or not, and make informed choices to continue subscriptions. additionally, they would get a clearer lens into where the 'line' actually falls, helping them avoid crossing it. this is not a bad thing.or2) ban in complete secrecy, and cut the crap with nebulous 'real life harassment' posts in the forums that use timely insinuations to smear players, without sacking up to actually accuse individuals of anything, letting the pansies in the mob do your dirty work for you. ban in complete secrecy, and only say 'no comment' when asked, and live with any player backlash accompanying that.any tweaks to process, etc beyond that will be ultimately fail imho. they need to go either full disclosure, or full secrecy, and live with all each choice entails.f"
10/3/2014,"now before anyone cries foul and wants me tried for heresy, hear me out. i am a player who enjoys eve, especially the carnage in space. however, walking in stations could be implemented without taking too many resources from other development assets.if a small team (1-3 devs) were allocated to do piecemeal work on wis per patch cycle, it could be expanded. the primary focus of course would be the spaceships aspect of eve. but here are a few suggestions just off the cuff.- decorum for cq (interactable items, i.e. drinks, smokes, medal displays, etc)- being able to display certain loot items on the wall- expansion of cq to include hangar, not just the gantry leading to your ship- gambling and vending machines in a promenade or concourse area- shops, agent hubs, actual corporate offices (and meeting rooms)- bars, clubs, et ceteraanything the imagination can really manifest in a reasonable fashion could be implemented bit by bit. this way, in a year or two there would be expansive environments for those who wanted them, and you could still opt out of using it if you so choose. hell, allow pilots to even interact with dust bunnies on station. i believe this reasonable, but as initially stated, space would still be the primary priority along with mechanics.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."

10/3/2014,"i<U+FFFD>ll give you an outsider<U+FFFD>s view of what has just happened. you knew that ccp would release a dev blog during october about the first nullsec changes. sion indicated that the jump distance nerf and cooldown proposals were discussed at the summit when he omitted these from his list of what was not discussed. you decided that a pre-emptive strike was required rather than working with ccp on the rest of the changes which were evidently going to be figured out before the second week in october. the letter was an attempt to take the initiative from ccp on the changes and to drive the agenda in a desirable direction. rather than allowing this to occur, ccp published the dev blog early and you were therefore not adequately consulted. in summary, you gave the finger to ccp by trying to take control of the agenda along with the null bloc leaders. they, in turn, gave you the finger by not consulting with you on some of the changes. your position has been publicly stated and your usefulness to ccp is diminished.(as an aside, does this mean that you did not agree with the jump distance nerf and cooldown proposals at the summit? my interpretation was that csm sentiment was generally positive following the summit. i am puzzled - perhaps you were just afraid of being seen as irrelevant through lack of involvement. also, are you still broadly opposed to the additional changes as per the article or was this just knee-jerk on sion's part?)""what else could we have done?"", i hear you ask. you clearly knew about the letter in advance and could have counselled that it should not be released. it would obviously have been released anyway so you could have immediately published a csm statement in reply. this would have been along the lines of, <U+FFFD>csm understands why the letter was necessary. csm understands the issues and these are the subject of extensive discussion with ccp. csm understands that ccp has the right to drive the agenda in their game. a roadmap of the already-drafted changes will be published in a couple of weeks and we suggest you wait for them.<U+FFFD>as it is, the letter looks impotent and so does the csm. now, you have to choose how best to represent your communities. i suggest that this is not done by always taking a popular position or a position that is defined by your leaders.i think you have harmed the csm as an institution. i think you have nerfed your own ability to guide ccp through the most important changes that have hit this game in a long time (possibly ever). i think that trying to wrestle the agenda from ccp when you knew that change was imminent was a mistake. you have a privileged position which you have diminished by confusing null politics with your actual intermediary role."
10/3/2014,this serves no real purpose as it does not truly fill any role gaps. i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
10/3/2014,... i'm really speechless after reading that the mittani article about ccp greyscale and co. throwing csm9 under the bus!*editbtw - is part of the csm boycotting the jump changes threadnaught? cause i only see one csm posting recently in page mid 200's?
10/3/2014,"fatigue numbers crunchedwith numbers in hand, many short jumps are enemently managable, as are a few long jumps. it is only the ""redeploy from north to south"" where it becomes entirely unreasonable. killing this sort of projection across half of eve, so you can effectively deploy any capital you can log on into something like b-r or asakai limits their scale, but also encourages more capital production to pre-stage at least a moderate response force within a single jump of most of the border of alliances, and have clones ready to go. it pushes strategy from 2-3 hours ahead and pick a timezone to days and weeks ahead, and pushes building schedules out further. its a good and bad thing at the same time. it kills the pl ""what will we drop next"" and de-escalates the insanely large cap and supercap fights because of the inherent inability of many of your pilots to disengage back out of the kill pocket as putting high dps, low ehp fleets on the gates of the main fight should also start spreading load, and still be relevant to the capitals slugging it out."
10/3/2014,"honestly, any empire sprawling as much as n3/pl or goons, should have been forced to divide membership into regional fleets, the ""lul lets throw everyone into a single fight and be back to defend our timers all over our territory in an hour"" was ridiculous to start."

10/4/2014,:tinfoil:
10/4/2014,huh? what bit? it is all thoroughly defensible. i am not suggesting any grand conspiracy but rather criticising actions.
10/4/2014,"i can't speak for the members who did sign it. i can speak for myself.i didn't sign it, because it struck me as pointless grandstanding. at least from the perspective of non-null csm members.for those members who live out in null, i can see a couple of pressures on them to get their name on such things. 1, from the alliance leadership, for the alliance they're part of. 2, so when it comes round to election time again, they can point at it and say 'look! i did stuff' at something which isn't as dense as the minutes.the csm works best when it's not pressuring ccp (assuming that ccp isn't doing something batshit insane, when you have to be willing to burn all your bridges.) as there's no way for the csm to force anything to happen, or for particular developers to interact with them."
10/4/2014,"yeah i'm gonna agree with mallak here, this is pretty tinfoily, and more significantly, pretty wrong. the short version is i signed it because i agreed with it, and the letter had been something in the works long before any of this had been discussed."
10/4/2014,i have idea how to fix sovereignty system. this idea makes it completely impossible to maintain sovereignty in inactive solar systems. i made earlier this proposal in long thread in features&ideas discussion but i think no one noticed it in middle of endless supply of messages.all kind of activities like mining and ratting have change to produce sovereignty objects in each capturable solar system. i call these objects now sovereignty crystals. each capturable solar system has its own sovereignty crystal. territorial claim unit needs these sovereignty crystals to be active.only way to maintain sovereignty is to do something in that solar system. these sovereignty crystals can be sold in market. solar system truesec would determine drop rate for sovereignty crystals. 0.0 would be the easiest to keep sovereignty (the highest drop rate for crystals) and -1.0 would be the hardest to keep sovereignty since there is the lowest drop rate for system sovereignty crystals.comments are welcome for my idea.

10/5/2014,"keep it going guys.with the jump drive needs, could be useful.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
10/5/2014,"in general i like the direction ccp is going with the rebalance of ships and items and expansion of content over the past 2 years or so. but, along the way, a lot of little things, some bigger than others need fixing and affect game play in a frustrating way. ccp has put up forums for <U+FFFD>10,000 little things<U+FFFD> but i<U+FFFD>d like to add to that<U+FFFD> most of these fixes should be simple.1) war history: the system really needs a better filter system. as it sits, the war history goes by the start date of a war<U+FFFD> which is understandable for when a war is pending, but if say that war lasts for months, and you have a lot of wars, when it ends, it<U+FFFD>s listed in the history at the beginning date. this is a pain if you are wanting to see what wars have most recently ended. thus, a filter should be implemented to go by either start dates or by end dates. i would further suggest being able to see a history page of just wars between two sides. as it is now<U+FFFD> you have to go through an entire history list to scroll through in order to surmise say a total wars k/l history.2) overview filter: i like the improvement of the ov filter, but a glaring mistake was made. the filter currently (and stay with me here), filters out any condition that a pilot may have. so i<U+FFFD>m talking about an exclusion list, with an option to have an inclusion list. simply put, all pilots are neutral to you unless you change his standing<U+FFFD> ok, but a pilot may also have a bounty on him, or have a -5 sec status. say you don<U+FFFD>t care to see pilots with bounties on them or those with -5 sec status<U+FFFD> but you do want to see a pilot you set to terrible standing. if you turn off <U+FFFD>bounty has pilot on him<U+FFFD> in your filter and the pilots you want to see have a bounty on him<U+FFFD> guess what, the filter blocks it out. so basically the filter doesn<U+FFFD>t do the job you want it to do. the solution, as i stated before, is to have an <U+FFFD>inclusion option/filter<U+FFFD> so that if a pilot fulfills only what you want to see<U+FFFD> no matter what other condition he has<U+FFFD> he shows up on your overview. this to me, seems like a reasonable request on ccp and probably isn<U+FFFD>t that difficult to do.3) local updating: ok, so this may be more of a technical glitch, but we<U+FFFD>ve been seeing a lot of issues with pilots not updating on overview properly. be it war targets, suspects, kill rights, or even blue status tags on overview or in local chat. this has created a lot of issues, up to not being able to shoot at a known war target because it didn<U+FFFD>t update properly.4) sisi: seriously<U+FFFD> is there a reason why there<U+FFFD>s no faction mods available to purchase for builds? would love to test some fits, but every now and then, a faction mod is part of the build and if i don<U+FFFD>t already have it, i can<U+FFFD>t buy it on sisi. :-(5) corporation office fees! i<U+FFFD>m sure just about everyone in real life pays rent or a mortgage to someone<U+FFFD> right? we sign contracts with set terms of a course of a specified time frame. you know what you are going to pay to your lender every month. and when that contract period is up, if you are renting, you re-sign a contract<U+FFFD> maybe at a new rate, or you say, <U+FFFD>no thank you.<U+FFFD> and you move out. typically any increase is a nominal percentage. everyone with me? so why in eve, do rental office prices change every fraking month! and it<U+FFFD>s not even a notice<U+FFFD> it<U+FFFD>s just changed on your bill<U+FFFD> so like most, i have autopay on for rent<U+FFFD> cause rent isn<U+FFFD>t typically all that much<U+FFFD> under a mil<U+FFFD> maybe a little more. if it was higher than that, i<U+FFFD>d just say forget you, i<U+FFFD>ll go somewhere else. but no<U+FFFD> price change is just adjusted any to amount<U+FFFD> no nominal percentage. and suddenly that 1 mil rental, due to some sudden spike in tenancy, just went to 50 mil! ladies and gents<U+FFFD> call me dumb for not caring to check my pending bills in eve for rent that shouldn<U+FFFD>t be my main concern, but i didn<U+FFFD>t notice till my corp paid a 123 mil bill in rent, and i was looking at the corp account scratching my head saying, <U+FFFD>where the hell is this isk going?<U+FFFD> then i spotted it<U+FFFD> dramatic escalation of rent on 3 locations<U+FFFD> so i had rent of 126k isk, then a freaking 123 mil isk. seriously? where<U+FFFD>s the common sense to that? a gm kindly told me, prices are adjusted monthly and you get your bill in advance so you know the cost changes. while that in itself isn<U+FFFD>t cool, i rather didn<U+FFFD>t expect a 1000%+ increase for an office rental. does this really make any sense to you ccp? that<U+FFFD>s just straight out mess up. solution:a. contract lengths and terms of cost. the whole world does this, why don<U+FFFD>t you!b. send an eve mail notification of 30 day, 15 days, and 5 days, before contract end with new terms to continue the rental.c. have different rental length terms: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months & 1 year. d. maybe have a payment option of per month or per term.e. why the hell did i really have to give this example on something so common sense?more to be added in second post"
10/5/2014,"the more troublesome issues:1) interceptors: i don<U+FFFD>t know how many people warned you boys at ccp that the bubble immunity on interceptors would turn ridicules and it has. they<U+FFFD>re already the most nimble ship in the game and with the immunity<U+FFFD> you<U+FFFD>ve made it the travel safe ship without any reasonable counter. you<U+FFFD>d have to have a huge camp of smart bombing ships that can be close enough to the interceptor<U+FFFD>s drop off from a gate to have any hope of destroying one. where<U+FFFD>s the risk in this ship? the nil tank? hardly an argument when the interceptor can very easily pick its fights. <U+FFFD>but it<U+FFFD>s a cool bonus!<U+FFFD> yes, but it<U+FFFD>s on the wrong ship! an interdictor would have been a far more logical choice. that helps that class fill its roll and not instantly become fodder from an opposing fleet because it<U+FFFD>s trapped by its very own role. <U+FFFD>but an interceptor is supposed to be able to intercept!<U+FFFD> yes, but it<U+FFFD>s speed and agility are its assets. if an enemy fleet on gate has a bubble up, they<U+FFFD>re locked in too unless they<U+FFFD>re in a bubble null t3. if an interceptor is chasing a target, it<U+FFFD>s still going to be far superior in speed to get out of that bubble. and if an enemy fleet is sitting on that bubbled gate<U+FFFD> it<U+FFFD>s not exactly <U+FFFD>intercepting<U+FFFD> anymore if your buddies are on just the other side of the gate. the logic is lacking for this bonus to be on the interceptor, pure and simple.2) along with that issue, is the crazy align times of frigates. any frigate can just about evade a none bubbled gate camp that even has an interceptor with them and high scan res. obviously not all, but any interceptor properly fit should be able to lock another interceptor much less a frigate without much issue. we<U+FFFD>ve had an interceptor with a 4000+ scan res that can<U+FFFD>t even start locking another interceptor. this mainly due to a target being still invulnerable while the cloaking effect comes off. but for that traveling interceptor or frigate, he<U+FFFD>s already aligning and in warp before that cloaking effect barely even begins to come off! does that make any sense? now to add to that, server lag<U+FFFD> so many times in general, we<U+FFFD>ve locked a target, our mods are preheated, but nope, point doesn<U+FFFD>t land because <U+FFFD>target already in warp!<U+FFFD> so<U+FFFD> what<U+FFFD>s the use of an interceptor that can<U+FFFD>t even properly intercept, even when it<U+FFFD>s boosted through the roof!?? does that make any sense? no<U+FFFD> solution: and i know everyone will groan and hate, but honestly, any ship with combat or tactical ability should not be nigh unlockable by another high scan res ship. now i hear people say, <U+FFFD>we catch them all the time! l2pvp!<U+FFFD> i<U+FFFD>m not talking popping them as they undock on station. other than that i call bs if you claim to catch a guy that<U+FFFD>s alert and blows through your camp<U+FFFD> not auto piloting or just being stupid. the solution is:a. to increase align times across the board through the ship classes. take into account server lag. leave the fastest align times to pods and then shuttles. that gives shuttles a worthy advantage, but it<U+FFFD>s not armed nor can be fit with anything tactical.b. make a target lockable the moment it appears on overview. obviously if he begins to move, he<U+FFFD>s at his/her keyboard actively piloting. 3) cloaks: i<U+FFFD>m gonna get hate here as well, but you all know this is right<U+FFFD> this game is based on pvp, not always avoiding it. real simple here, cloaks have a delay to re-cloak right? it<U+FFFD>s already in there<U+FFFD> so why the hell can people immediately re-cloak after coming out of a gate cloak? now before you blow your top and say it<U+FFFD>s not the ship mod used going through the gate<U+FFFD> i understand that<U+FFFD> but it<U+FFFD>s the cloak effect that should cause the delay<U+FFFD> period. <U+FFFD>but now you<U+FFFD>ve penalized ships that have cloaking bonuses! *rage*<U+FFFD> easy work around, give those ships with cloaking bonuses another bonus to negate that. people in regular combat ships, again having a near free pass to align, cloak, de-cloak, warp is pure bs. <U+FFFD>but they take a locking penalty!<U+FFFD> yeah, they<U+FFFD>re also in a ship not designed with cloak in mind. having that cloak delay at least properly inhibits a ship that doesn<U+FFFD>t have that cloaking bonus in all areas. think about the good of the game as a whole<U+FFFD> not just how it affects you. point is, ships get subverted in use, because other ships exploit the loopholes. i tend to think that<U+FFFD>s a bad thing. so here are just a few issues<U+FFFD> i know there<U+FFFD>s plenty more. some should be a no brainer to fix or incorporate, while others will take time to figure out. this isn<U+FFFD>t a whine thread, for goodness sake, i<U+FFFD>ve been playing this game for over 6 years<U+FFFD> i roll with the punches and adjust as needed. for the most part i know i<U+FFFD>m not the only one that feels this way on most of these topics. we<U+FFFD>re all in the same ccp boat<U+FFFD> it would just be nice if ccp rowed in the same direction as us more often than they do. i love the game, will always play it, but that doesn<U+FFFD>t mean i like all the things they do. while i don<U+FFFD>t expect all things to change<U+FFFD> it sure would be nice if even just the simple ones were handled in a timely manner.thanks for reading! try to be constructive with comments. i know where the flames will come in, but at least try to acknowledge all the items on the list<U+FFFD> i<U+FFFD>m sure there<U+FFFD>s a few on there that just about everyone would like to see."
10/5/2014,"opinion?good start but it needs tweaking, which it has been doing as we wade through the threadnaught ie deathcloning and max fatiguei think i won't win all the arguments but i keep trying anyways.this is one step in the null changes on the roadmap. please do not consider it the solution but a start.m"

10/6/2014,"i don't think name changes should be brought into eve. however i can understand why some people would like the chance to change a name they picked in their earlier years.for me the only way to introduce name changes into eve is to let every character have one name change. you don't need to purchase it or have a certain security status. every single character gets one chance to rename themselves.the new name gets placed on the main character sheet so its easy to see.eg. archibald thistlewaite iiiformaly known as- mad dog mcgrue.it is also highlighted in the employment history when and which corp you were a member off when the name was changed.by limiting it to only once it reduces names changes being the way to avoid the consequences of your more dubious activities. although your old name will appear right next to your new name when people show info on you.for the character bazaar, it allows you to ask a premium for your character if it has a name change available. if you are buying you can either pick a character with a name you like or pick one with a rename available, then its up to you if you want to rename and reduce the value on any sell on."
10/6/2014,not a fan of this idea. mainly got issues with people buying a char then renaming them. you want to pick your toons name then you have to start from scratch like the rest of us. also some eve lore and history might be effected. not to mention renaming bait alts

10/6/2014,"agreed, my history of pvp have been horrible fc choices of leaving single targets alone for attacking a target on a gate in a system of 300 reds as if the other reds in system wouldnt respond, or you meet blobs.my clone i think cost 52m? which is the minimum i need for 154m sp. so without implants even then a death if a good amount when you dont make isk or takes most of a day to make up for a frigate death. so now i avoid pvp and have to try and get an alt up to go do that and keep it limited."

10/8/2014,"o/just updating this thread after the announced jump changes, and this en24 article (thanks for the nod, matterall).medical clone costs are obviously an older mechanic than jump fatigue. despite this explanation, it's still part of the game and they're about to coexist as game mechanics. if this is allowed to happen, the message sent by ccp would seem to be something along the lines of stop playing the game so much, you're exceeding your share of load on our servers.that's a relatively serious accusation to make, but it is a simple fix, and mostly a mistake of treating medical clone replacement as if eve was default free-to-play.with just one character at 100 million sp i could exceed the value of a plex in medical clone costs, within a week. that's assuming i only lose my pod every other outing. a plex per week just to play with one character. i don't see how a player is supposed to have that type of income per character.most, if not all other aspects of the game (as well as common sense) promote sp as a good idea. but medical clone costs make me wonder if subscriptions are designed to taper off after a few years.meanwhile, dear everyone in eve: don't die?"

10/9/2014,"thank you for replying.nevermind my org, it's true, i'm covered, and i've made up my mind to make myself a strategic asset-only. i've had my fill of risk-free pve before arriving here, but now it's time to see what i can bring down to bear for the sake of my fc.as for your org. assuming the highest reimbursement category available to you, how many losses can you incur before your medical clone costs are out of pocket?if you do a drill-down of all the orgs that have a reimbursement policy in place, and assume their best reimbursement category, how many of them provide reimbursement that will cover clone costs, until eventually the character requires an injection of isk for medical clones?how much gameplay are you being kept from, by medical clone costs. i see you spend a lot of time shooting deployables in high sec, and participating in irrelevant lowsec pvp where pods are left alone by all but the more killmail-hungry groups. i assume the safety of your pod was a consideration in these gameplay choices. are you free of this issue now that you've made a sarcastic remark on the stellar reimbursement policy i have so graciously been covered by?so aren't you the one who stands to get hit consistently by med clone costs out of pocket, or is your plan to stay in highsec shooting mtus forever?what i'm saying is it's cute that you feel safe, but that's due to your risk averse choices. medical clone costs affect everyone, and especially those who are not gsf.are you about to tell me the solution to medical clone costs is... don't die? i hope i'm not the one to break this to you, but some groups, like my groups, promote ship loss on ops, lest we become station camped like blwe're not just skilled, we're suicidal. so please try to kill me before we kill you. in fact, make me primary, and get my pod so some other corp in a hictor doesn't get a lone pod kill to justify his existence. i need my reimbursements so i can reship and throw myself at you again."
10/9/2014,"cfc for 3 years. i know how space rich everybody down there is.i have flown an ishtar in havens and hubs as stated for 3 years. if you cant afford a high grade clone with all that srf and ratting you are doing something wrong despite your clone costs. so if you check up on me do it properly at least.high clone costs are a good way to balance the game and give vets with a high isk income something to spend that stuff on. especially in the extremely safe and profitable null sec regions but despite that it counts for all areas of eve. from null to high to wh sec.so if you are afraid to loose your fancy pod leave the blue donut back to high sec or do it like i do. shoot mtus in high sec and engage in irrelevant low sec engagements. like that would ever be more fun that 1000 ishtar f1 ;)also stop talking like a *** or i have to assume that you are trolling.my point stands.edit : or is it the issue of isboxing rain 6635, 6636, 6637, 6638 and 6639 and having to pay for their pods ?"
10/9/2014,"no i don't think we're trolling, we're just being mean. and when i replied to you, i may have been on ambien (i was).anyway, ishtar ratting for three years, then mtus, then lowsec.. i think we are on directly opposite paths here, except i don't plan to rat. i recall doing that in a drake in curse, back in 2009. it was not fun. the activities you list are either pve or non-sov pvp, so i'm still not sure you can relate.this isn't about being afraid to lose muhpod, it's about enjoying welpy live people-content but being unable to afford it indefinitely. you've decided not to deal with it, is that correct?"
10/9/2014,"today, i must announce from the csm. thanks to ccp and anyone who voted for me for giving me this unique opportunity. i also wish the best of luck to my replacement.axios!silva"

10/9/2014,"i did sign it and stand behind the ideas posted there as direction. the piece has been overtaken fast by the current null changes that ccp laid down. i can asure you that the csm is very much involved with ccp, and that there is no breach of trust or so.for example out of my personal experience is eve online facebook and twitter both naming my eve 24 interview and pushing it therefore. internally forums and channels are filled with interaction with ccp, today and yesterday we have life meetings about this and eve s future. if anything the letter showed unity amongst most null sec focused csm members, and a believe in eve s future and its direction. was it in hindsight necesarry, nope.i feel i function just as **** or good as i did before"
10/9/2014,the idea that the sov crystals could be sold is terrible.... just means renting alliances would mandate you give them your crystals... ... really simple fix ... track the amount of time logged in the system by a given corp.... congratulations you live there and affect the sov.

10/10/2014,"i've been waiting for this since they originally announced it. the ability to have an avatar that could interact with other toons would be a boon for the rping community.i could see special player events that could start out in stations, and lead into space.we could have player sponsored poker tournaments. (in game, not some side website)it could be an additional resource for recruitment of new players. i know of a handful of mmorpg players that avoid eve simply because they can't walk in stations. these same folks love to pvp, craft, and rp. however they won't commit to a game that only has the pvp and crafting. the fact that i can't them to try eve due to the lack of a walking avatar is frustrating as hell.besides i'd love to be able to sit cloak spinning instead of ship spinning any day."

10/10/2014,"ccp, you know i love you. i also want you to know i sat on this possibility for a day and i don't see alternatives.the short of it is, i think i'll have to consolidate my accounts down to 1 / 3 of their current number. a couple inactive, the rest transferred. i'm very saddened to reach this conclusion. med clones will cause me to hemorrhage isk in lockstep with my pace of gameplay. i can't afford it, and i don't expect anyone else to underwrite it either. even though i pay real money for subs, my gameplay will repeatedly drive me isk-broke.i still have a few months give or take, but now that i'm diving into boldfaced pod-me gameplay (null), i have to downsize.yes, medical clone costs would turn all of this around. right now i can't go out in t1 frigates or cruisers, and what i can't do with one account i certainly can't do it with more. i still want to play and i want to support you with my subs, but doing so in my current assortment of accounts means most of them will just idle. even worse, they'll keep training, which makes the medical clone cost issue even worse."
10/10/2014,"i would like to let the general public here know that the op keeps coming into missions chat and begging for mission fits, advice, how to run missions, best, etc. all stuff that can be found with 30 seconds of googling.in short, he is one who wants eve served on a silver platter for him."
10/10/2014,"i don't get why people are so thick on this.all that isboxer allows you to do, is duplicate your keyboard input to other pcs. i could even do this running vm's with other software that exactly copies what i do into those vms. it doesn't adjust your account, it does not circumvent game programming to gain an unfair advantage.sometimes i wish ccp would ban those who keep asking the same question they answer 200599235 times (give or take). but oh well."
10/10/2014,"you forgot to calculate into your ""astounding difference in terms of wealth"" that the 1 guy pays 1plex per month and the 40 man isboxer fleet pays 40plex per month.you're basically offering us your calculations as if the isboxer fleets is fueled by one single plex that the one solo player would have to pay anyhow.i've re-done your calculations and this is what comes out:421,200x275,000= 115,830,000,000 isk or 147.55 plex (figured at 785 million isk per plex) - 3.68875 plex per account10,800 x 275,000 = 2,970,000,000 or 3.783 plex - 3.783 plex147.55 x 3 = 442.65 - (40x3) = 322.65 - 8,06625 per account3.783x3 = 11.349 - 3 = 8.349 - 8.349 per accountaccording to your own calculations, the 40 man isboxer fleet actually makes less than the average solo player - in truth, it makes more due to that 40man fleet having boosts that you solo don't have, so they actually mine about 40% more than you do per cycle on each account - but i'm just pointing out your flawed logic. please, if you're going to represent the deranged people who have no clue, at least do it right and make it look like the 40man isboxer fleet has astounding difference in terms of wealth as an advantage."
10/10/2014,"iain cariaba wrote:soldarius wrote:tl;dr: if isboxer does not give an advantage to players that use it, why do they use it?ahh, but there is a flaw in youf logic. the flaw is that ccp doesn't care about advantage to the player. if they were concerned about one player gaining advantage over another player, then anyone who had more alts than another player, or any player who could afford to sell more plex, or any of a hundred different things, would be in violation. ccp cares about giving advantagd to the account.besides, as has already been stated, but you've chosen to ignore for your own convienence, is that the main perks of isboxer can be duplicated through a pure hardware solution. this pure hardware solution, found on page 1 of this very thread incidentally, is the reason isboxer was removed from the list of software that could get you banned. for the price of a highend gaming desktop computer, i can use this pure hardware solution to run 10-20 accounts at once, all performing the exact same actions, all without isboxer.there was no flaw in my logic. you posted all those words, and the end result is that none of it actually disputes my conclusion that isboxer provides a clear advantage to a single player over another single player. instead you tried to pick at a point that has no clearly identifiable borders (the reliability and reproducibility of a hardware solution) and is based entirely on the skill and will of the player to try a purely physical solution to gain an advantage over others.the advantages of isboxer cannot be reliably duplicated by a purely hardware solution and maintain the advantages for which it is used; rapid input of commands to multiple accounts without error over a long period of time and many iterations. i seriously dare you to tie 20 mice together with rubber-bands and pencils, configure a home computer for 20 screens, and make it work perfectly for an extended period of time. extended meaning hours on end, not 10 minutes or for one mining cycle. do it a thousand times and see how many times you have to stop and adjust one mouse out of 20 because oops, one of them slipped, or realign your mouse-cage because it got twisted around by 2 degrees and isn't aligned properly on all 20 screens anymore.you make only 1 valid point; ccp either doesn't care or is unwilling to venture into this realm. i've played games that prohibit multi-accounting and religiously enforce it. it can be done. but ccp has chosen not to for what i assume to be financial reasons. all dem cyno alts, dog."
10/10/2014,"except you're wrong.ccp only cares on a per toon basis, not a ""per person-behind-keyboard"" basis. that's why they dont care about the 40 miners. his total income is much higher, yes, but his per-toon income is still the same.and isboxer is only as reliable as the person behind the keyboard. it takes a lot of skill to use perfectly, and there are numerous ways for something to go wrong. there are a ton of micro-settings that can break your game if you mess with them the wrong way, and another bunch that will cause poor performance. in short, it cannot be operated by dimwits to it's full potential."

10/10/2014,why do these people always complain about cloaks?ccp has already told you repeatedly on these forums that afk cloaky campers (as example) aren't going to be changed.
10/10/2014,"that is a ridiculous idea and doesn't do anything but have people buy up these crystals.in my personal opinion, the effects of any form of occupancy should carry throughout the complete space an organisation owns. this could mean that any systems used at a bare minimum, should get reduced effectiveness on income from different sources, most importantly moongoo. a raw example:imagine the alliance owns five systems and uses a total of three effectively, while two others aren't used that much.when the participation rate for that system is less than a pre-set value derived from the total members versus activity count, it becomes vulnerable to both players and npc sov-warfare. it should lower effectiveness on towers, so that your moongoo tower in that one random unvisited system no longer is giving you free money.with participation rate i do not mean sitting in the system afk with a cloak, but rather the amount of industry, pve,pvp a corporation does in that system."

10/11/2014,"there's a statement by senior gm karidor in the german language forums, which states:translation: if a click is sent to multiple clients, this also counts as ""automation"", or to use the phrasing of the eula:it effectively counts as ""patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary game play."""
10/11/2014,"and in case this statement gets dismissed as a) only in the german language forums or b) made only by a single gm, there's this note by ccp phantom a little further down in that same thread:translation: senior gm karidor's explanation reflect the official stance the ccp customer support has on that matter."
10/11/2014,"the arguments are going in circles because there is no legitimate reason to ban it, other than ""boohoo my feelings got hurt""."

10/11/2014,i don't even.you didn't do the pos code originally by any chance?
10/11/2014,"that was kind of the point of it.if a cake is being carved anew, then those null-sec leaders represented there are those who wish to hold the tool that carves the cake the most or participate in holding the carving tool.there's some null-sec leaders signatures missing however. i guess not everyone has succumbed to all the changes being inherently bad in the long run.any veteran of eve is going to have his/her own story of how they endured the hard times when things were fubar and how they persevered. why can't we do the same? clench your teeth and take it like a man. then, when it's over, go to your favourite proctologist and get a soothing ointment to spread around the hole that hurts the most.afraid much?"
10/11/2014,well - besides this particular topic i wonder how we as players are supposed to measure the csm's involvement besides the official minutes published - and the last one is from 2012 ;)
10/12/2014,"isboxer is only the visible part of what i call the ""metacode"" iceberg... other tools are even more efficient, and customizable, like autohotkeys, and there are other tools that do achieve quite a bit to gain some forms of advantages in game... isboxer is just the most obvious....there is no way to totally prevent the use of metacode, much like there is no way to prevent players from metagaming. both are similar in that they provide advantages in-game to the players that dabble with it.this problem is more of a perception issue, simply put, isboxing can easily be perceived as a pay-to-win, even if its use has drawbacks.this perception has the potential to turn away players that would otherwise remain engaged with the game, and limit the reach of a game that otherwise has much to offer...for that reason alone, i believe ccp should actively make isboxing or macro-ing the game difficult by ui and design features that makes multi boxing more difficult than doing the same thing with the same amount of characters controlled by different players, as well as openly take a stance against multi boxing rather than staying mute about it.they will not prevent it totally, as they can't, but at least they can project the idea that multi boxing is not ok in their game, which in turn may keep other players engaged longer, as they feel their contribution to the game/alliance/corp is not dwarfed by multiboxers..isboxing is a hindrance to regular players, a fleet of imultiboxed miners can go through a site way faster than regular players, would, and those are left empty handed., it is lke the proverbial cloud of crickets passing over a system...last but not least, isboxing is also a control tool for powerful alliances to limit their exposure to leaks, betrayals,or active mobilization of their minions, reinforcing their power and control over the whole game, with a limited number of power players.i truly don't believe ccp has anything to gain to continue remaining neutral/mute on this subject. with the breath of fresh air that the coming changes are going to make, this may be for them the right time to re-evaluate their position on this.oh, and the likelihood a frustrated multi boxer would really leave the game (they would of course threaten to) is pretty low, they have a bunch of assets to play with and to loose in the process. i'd be curious to know the statistics, but i would bet they mostly pay their multiple accounts via isk only, so they do not contribute much to the game today"
10/12/2014,"thanks for that. i'll quote the relevant part that directly adresses input mirroring:my bad that i took a gm statement, that later got confirmed as official stance of ccp customer support as fact."
10/12/2014,"your post is so full of ignorance and tin foil, i'm thinking that you may actually be posting it with tongue in cheek.why would ccp ""project the idea that multiboxing is not ok"" and why would they make it more difficult?if it's a perception issue, it's due in part to posts like yours and your ill informed perception.the ""macro"" type you talk of in this regard, is already a part of the game. should ccp remove that too?multibox miners cannot go any faster than the game allows, which means regular players also have that ability in a fleet. there is also plenty of ice fields out there, so your ""left empty handed"" statement is ridiculous.also, please pray tell how you think they pay for their accounts with isk and how that doesn't contribute. i would sure like to know.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/12/2014,"yes i looked at the gm you quoted and saw your error.plus i do not know what has been written, only what you suggest. seeing as many cannot even read the eula correctly and misquote that often in this regard, i'll stick to the english versions posted by respected members.also i think you'll find gm lelouch is the lead gm. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/12/2014,"i do.and for myself, i'll take this as an example of how much i should believe statements made by the gm team in general, gm karidor especially (i was't that previously aware of mallak's examples)."
10/12/2014,"oh i agree, the majority of gms should be taken with a pinch of salt. as long as you enjoy the game and don't break the rules, you never have to interact with them.you say you do, that's fine. but even english speaking people misquote the eula to try and prove a point in this regard. either that or they read only what they want to read, skipping the relevant parts.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/12/2014,"unlike subs, plexes do not contribute to ccp bottom line today, like monthly subs do."
10/12/2014,"you're joking right? just how do you think a plex is created?destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/12/2014,the loudest part of the crowd against isboxer are the ones ...... who can not deal with the fact that others are better than them.ccp ... ban these instead.thanks!
10/12/2014,"i don't understand this post. what would i be afraid of? i don't have a problem with the letter itself although i think it ended up lacking much impact. what i would have a problem with is csm members making decisions designed to benefit themselves or their corp/alliance/coalition at the cost of the game or the csm as an institution. it appears that the csm has built up a lot of ""ccp capital"" over the past few years resulting in them being taken seriously by a larger number of teams. it would be unfortunate if this was spent on something pointless, that's all. the csm posts above indicate that this isn't the case (thanks for posting btw) so that's good. if the letter didn't prompt an early release of the dev blog then greyscale should be ashamed of shunning the csm on such an important matter."
10/12/2014,"the entirety of the post wasn't directed at you zappity, but at the signatories of the accord/letter :) i just used one of your viewpoints to quote a reply. sorry if i wasn't actually clear which target audience i'm addressing in my reply."
10/13/2014,"yes. open the door already. there is fun to be had on the other side.it was announced at pax australia that the first multiplayer avatar areas to be opened in star citizen will be the social ones, and they are slated to be delivered next year.it's annoying that ccp once dreamed of becoming an ultimate sci simulator, failed to deliver, and now a competitor is coming in to deliver what ccp cannot.fortunately the avatar stuff in eve (what little there is) still looks far superior to what is currently in star citizen (especially the player characters), ccp still has a competitive advantage that they can capitalize on, should they choose to.given that ccp is more than willing to devote an entire development studio to a game that they would eventually abandon (world of darkness). i think it is stupid that they won't assign a few devs to enriching their current game with station interiors."
10/13/2014,couldn't agree with you more.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
10/13/2014,"no way - sorry for being that frank here. the one and most outstanding difference between eve and any other mmo has been that particular part. the brutal consequences of bad management of ones character - which mainly refers to the usage of medical clones, implants and jumpclones.as of today its completely free to get a jump clone due to several corporations offering that kind of service - so that part doesnt even require any big personal management anymore. implants - well i am not starting to talk about inflation and availability here - this is a self-runner.so what is left to manage seriously? keeping your clone updated and freeking pay for it. if your character becomes that smart you force the clone producers to invest a hell of time and technology to stuff all that smartness into a new body. the risk= reward principles of eve would be completely disabled by lowering those prices. no one forces anyone to become smarter in eve - its your personal decision. you can leave your skill queue empty and save money that way."
10/13/2014,"so don't use the new unlimited skillqueue? hell, i agree"
10/13/2014,"of course it has been bought, at some point, possibly even this month (but this not a certainty) with real money, and even at a higher rate when used for 30 days of time than a subscription. but as any in-game commodities, there are plexes in game that have been bought long ago and stocked. these plex do not provide income right now to ccp, albeit they certainly have provided income before. still ccp has to pay their monthly expenses every single month, going forward, no matter what for the game to continue to exist.so it all depends on how ccp manages over the long term the income from their plexes, but this is why plexes are fundamentally different from subscription income.using isboxing to make enough isk to buy enough plexes to get characters' game time is bad for everybody else."
10/13/2014,"plex sit on ccps books as deferred income, until they're consumed or destroyed.it's money they can't do anything with, until the plex no longer exists. the moment a plex is consumed, the money is freed up for use.(as for the original point in the topic, it's something i can't talk about.)"
10/13/2014,"well steve has just told you how and when ccp get the income from a plex. but even so, you really are stretching reality if you think they do not contribute, even if it was as you suggested and paid some time ago.your argument was that they do not contribute. that's blatantly false and not even founded in reality. plex users pay more than i do and it seems ccp get the money as and when they use them.the joke is, i pay yearly. so ccp do actually get my money a full year before the end of my sub. so using your logic, i also do not contribute. i had at some point in my sub, changed my credit card. doing so took another payment and my days left were almost 600. i guess i really wasn't contributing at all then. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/13/2014,"just as a small note:multi month subscriptions also count as deferred income. (though it's more certain, as you can't pause it, or stockpile time)accountants far prefer it when you know when income will become available, rather than being carried on the books. you're right about the plex though. ccp like it when people use plex. reduces their liability. (though they prefer it when they explode)"
10/13/2014,"makes sense regarding the multi month sub.also i can see why ccp like it when we use or lose a plex. i'm just amazed at some peoples lack of understanding, in regards to their contribution to ccp and the game.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/13/2014,"i wrote a email to ccp in regards to the exploit of -10 criminals ganking players mainly new ones in high sec see belowfirst of all let me say im not saying that ganking in high sec should be stopped ganking is available anywhere anytime, my issue is the exploit of there security status in high sec and killing ships.""eve in most parts is a good game, however you never address this issue or criminals and the acts that they do to exploit killings in high sec.currently we have -10 sec status people in and around my system ganking miners, they are freely aloud to roam the systems as long as they are in a pod or shuttle. then the concord police will not do anything, so how do they beat this, they get a neutral in a orca etc to fly to a safe spot and then allow them to get in to ships then fly to someone to kill before concord then decides to get them.sounds like a exploit to me, i have no issues with being killed by them but now with the exploit that allows them to do it over and over and over, simple rule states if you are a criminal then you pay the consequences for those actions. the easy fix for this is to have security id on gates and if you are below the required sec status you are then not allowed to use that gate.ccp needs to start looking at the big picture with the game and to cater for all players and not what just suits ccp, have you ever wondered why eve is not in the league of other games with the number of players, im not tallking 000's of players im talking 000,000's its cause this game has the risk for you to lose all and i enjoy that that but you need to look after the player group that cant or want a safe enjoyable game to play or just want to stay in high sec. im happy with no where being safe and there is the element of being killed but you have made it so easy, just now two -10 chars killed a mining barge even though he is -10 was then flagged for 10 mins and is now free to do it all over again.after 11 years of this game i would have expected 000,000's of players and that would mean more income for you and more development of the game. look at why some other games keep the player base. i myself left 7 years ago for over a year because of the exploits that allow negative players to exploit postive players.i know of alot of people who just cant be arsed to pay a subscription and then lose there ships and have to start all over again, that's why they have gone back to wow or diablo 3 as some people just want to enjoy, if something is not done with the game to help out the new players and with the upcoming new games eve is going to lose even more players by them not subbing. i love eve but you need to address the issues and not just keep adding new content, make the game enjoyable, risky, rewardingyou ban or take action on certain exploits when it seems to suit you, so why do you allow some exploits to happen and some to not, i pay to sub this game but ccp is not!!! fulfilling its promise to stop exploits, when you get chars who repeatedly use the exploit to there advantage in high sec. there were two negative payers including -10.00 and -9.9 who are allowed to constantly gank mining ships, then they wait there 10 minute period and then can repeat it, how is this not different to other exploits. definition of harassmenthi sec systems where concord (the police force is in force) high sec is currently classed as systems where by the police (concord) will intervene when a illegal activity is happeningharassment . the act of systematic and/or continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group, including threats and demands. <U+FFFD> bullying mining ships which cant fight back<U+FFFD> having to pay (blackmail) to be able to mine in high sec<U+FFFD> the loss of income gained in game which is paid for through subscriptions of real cash<U+FFFD> continued and repeated acts to force person(s) to either leave, quit or pay the ransomthe purposes may vary, including racial prejudice, personal malice, or attempt to force someone to quit a job, apply illegal pressure to collect a bill (ransom to mine)or merely gain sadistic pleasure from making someone fearful or anxious. people will not play due to fear of losing more in game and not being able to play the game which they have paid real cash for."
10/13/2014,it's not up to you to decide what is and what isn't an exploit in eve. only ccp can make that judgement and apparently they don't agree with your point of view.htfu or gtfo
10/13/2014,thank you and i value your opinion but was htfu or gtforeally needed ?
10/13/2014,"agreed i see a lot of people that leave eve very soon after starting, even some people that have been playing for a while have left since ganking and blob warfare is now elite pvp. there are also so many loop holes that a ganker can use to be in space and not be shot at if they bother."
10/13/2014,"hoo boy... where to start?first off:the ""definition of harassment"" is determined by ccp (as j'poll pointed out). yes, there is a written definition in the eula, but it is still vague enough to allow for player freedom and ccp to make judgement calls in specific situations.so far, the current working definition of ""harassment"" in eve is this; sustained targeting of a player (or group of players) over a period of time despite the targeted players' best efforts to avoid it... and the targeters do not gain anything.what does this mean?- it means that ganking is, by itself, not ""harassment."" it is just another aspect of the game.- it means that player activities that run counter (or are detrimental) to yours is not ""harassment."" it is merely a part of the game (i.e. the game is centered around player on player ""conflict"").- it means that a player cannot simply move to a different station/asteroid belt or one system over and claim that tried to ""avoid"" unwanted contact. you have to put effort into it (see: moving several systems over at least). and yes, this is an intentional part of the game.- it means that if the target consistently make themself profitable they cannot claim that they are being targeted for no reason.now...and they do. allow me to list them off...if you suicide gank...direct penalties:- you lose your ship- you lose any insurance you have the ship- you lose security status- you gain a suspect flag for 10-15 minutes and can be shot at by anyone and everyone in the game without penalty- you gain a criminal flag for 15 minutes (see: can't undock in high-sec in anything other than a pod without being concorded again)indirect penalties:- if your security status goes low enough (see: below -5.0) then you can be shot by anyone, anywhere, at any time.- if your security status goes below certain levels then you will find yourself less and less able to enter higher security systems without the faction police attacking you (see: you can't use any ship bigger than a cruiser in high-sec unless you are willing to tank the npcs).- with lower security status you will be less and less able to get new supplies from high-sec trade hubs and/or must buy from low-sec stations at a premium and/or must rely on friends/alts to resupply you.- if you want to raise your security status you must either kill pirate npcs for a godawful amount of time or spend a fair bit of cash to buy the security tags needed.other risks:- you botch the gank attempt and eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit (and 15 minutes of idle time) for no reason.- the target may be tanked more than you think... resulting in a failed gank attempt where you eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit (and 15 minutes of idle time) for no reason.- the target never shows and you have wasted time.- the loot that you are ganking for never drops... resulting in a failed gank where you eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit (and 15 minutes of idle time) for no reason.- the gank is successful, the loot you want drops, but someone else picked it up before your friend/alt did... resulting in a failed gank where you eat the cost of the ship and gain a security hit (and 15 minutes of idle time) for no reason.- you don't have enough people to properly suicide gank.outside of these things... it is up to other players to make people with low security status pay for their actions. the game only stacks the odds so much in your favor (and the odds are very much in the targets' favor). you have to do the rest.concord are a reactionary force. there were never designed to be pro-active. that is a player's job.the neutral alts... well... you can ban them for being used to avoid consequences, sure... but then you have to ban all other neutral alts that are being used to avoid other consequences of the game.for example: neutral haulers, industrialists, miners, etc. that stay in npc corps to avoid dealing with war declarations, awoxers, thieves, etc.fair is fair after all. they do. but they still stay true to the overraching theme in eve; player versus player conflict.plus, you also have to consider this; -in a single player game, a ""sandbox"" means you can do anything you want to do. in a multiplayer game, a ""sandbox"" means that not only can you do anything you want to do, but other players can do the same. even if it runs counter to yours.- to ""ban"" or limit a style of play because you do not like how to affects you (or others) means that the people whose gameplay has been banned/limited can ask the same thing on your style of play for the same reasons.and when that happens... the game is no longer a ""sandbox.""because eve online is a ""niche product"" that caters to people who like ""difficult"" games?niche products may never gain the popularity of some other titles that try to be as inclusive as possible... but they do tend to last longer."

10/13/2014,"why play eve if you don't like it?first of all, citation is requested for your assertion that it's mainly new players being ganked. if you're going to suggest something, back it up.it's been a niche game for over 11 years and will continue to be one. it's also been dying for 11 years and you're not the first to claim new upcoming games will take it's players.-10 players already paid the price for their low sec status. if you wish for them to pay another, then make them pay yourself. it's not ccps job, or that of concord, to protect you and your assets. it's your job.the easy fix is for you to take matters into your own hands and deal with it. seeing as -10 players are open season for all, you have no worries regarding concord. yet another price we pay. but being -10 and ganking in high sec, is not an exploit. who are you to say what is and isn't negative play or players? just because someone has a negative sec status, doesn't make them any less valid a player, then someone with a high one. to be quite frank, in all the time i've played this game, the likes of people who think themselves better because of that, tend to be the ones not worth knowing at all.there is no exploit in this regard. it's just your self righteous attitude and belief you should be able to play and not be ganked. you don't even seem to know the game mechanics behind it, so how can you sit in judgement of them?as far as your claim of harassment is concerned, it's disingenuous at best. people playing the game by it's own rules, does not harassment make. your attempt to include racial prejudice and personal malice, is quite frankly ridiculous. they are already against the eula and if you have issues in that regard, then create a ticket.oh and we all pay in some form or another, some in rl cash, others in time that buys others use of rl cash. but you still agree to play and agree to the terms and conditions. of those, are playing by the rules. so either play the game, or leave. either way, it's not about to change for your benefit.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

10/14/2014,oh dear!
10/14/2014,it is not an exploit.
10/14/2014,
10/15/2014,"i would like an official statement from a senior gm or dev regarding isboxer ganks and their subsequent replacement. i am specifically referring to ganking a person in highsec with nados, and them having that person's ship reimbursed.i do not understand ccp's policy with this as there is no statistically significant difference from using isboxer to coordinate a gank, using a mechanical setup like this guy, a fleet of dedicated gankers using ts to coordinate their alpha / dps, or just opening multiple windows, offset them by a little to allow space to click, and rapidly clicking on the next window and hitting f1.the reason i say ""statistically significant"" is because of the server cycle time. if the eve server was set up in such a way that milliseconds actually counter, then it would be understandable. however, since the servers are set up to send commands in a ""stack"" for a measurable period of time, there is no reason why ganks should be reimbursed. i await a response from ccp, and welcome any contributions from the playerbase."
10/15/2014,"basically the same thoughts in my head. also would like to add that you even getting singular pilots together to do said ganks still wont save you, so should you start replacing all ganks? official response requested as well."
10/15/2014,"i watch some incursion runners get ganked by isboxer to have their ship replaced because "" 1 pilot is the player and the rest are considered bots"" which comes to the person getting this ship back, but yet isboxer is legal. if the isboxer is legal then why are these people getting their ships back, and a 10 man gank fleet considered 1 pilot and 9 bots, and no other use of isboxer is?they tried to have an isboxer in one of the tournament to prove isboxer isnt all that, but he also wasnt controling something like a team of 10 nightmares either due to tournament rules, which i might add would put isobox at a disadvantage using the rules as isboxer is made to control account clones and not a fleet of individual ships of different kinds."
10/15/2014,"i am not entirely sure where you going with this op. after a quick glance a the upcoming patch (dev blog), and the proposed changes from the linked blog there for research......what are you losing?is there a skill being taken away?from what i saw it seems the required skills for certain items to be researched, copied, invention etc are just being juggled around....if you have not basically researched some skills to cover these changes....then i guess you should start instead of whining about it. a true researcher or industiral person for that matter would make sure they got all the skills....not just the ones they need for what they wish to build."
10/15/2014,"i am referring to the time spent on research ""several years put into a single bpo for material and time effiency and the time taken to research those bpo's and now they have been backdated to only a couple months worth of research done on them. myself as well as many others who have done the same are having our real time taken away."
10/15/2014,"hmmm, the use of an orca as a fleet carrier or other similiar ship (orca/freighter tandem) is not an exploit....its a viable tactic.really op, you should of picked a better lke idk......maybe inability to dock up dependent on sec status to make easier to kill....though active pilots in pods are fairly dificult anyway.many ways to smarten up or tactics already exsist.....so yeah i guess all i have left ishtfu"

10/16/2014,"then ccp should tell us so we don't waste time with battlecruiser skills. would love to see a definitive answer from ccp as my end-game goal was a fleet of alpha nags for nullsec giggles, but what would the point be if my targets will just get reimbursed?"
10/16/2014,"still, this same setup can be achieved mechanically, just alot more thought behind it."
10/16/2014,those ganks are reimbursed because the gm staff exhibits a pretty enormous pro-carebear bias. simple as that.
10/16/2014,"after the reports of caldari predators rapier supposedly being reimbursed because it was killed by an isboxer, i also petitioned ccp requesting clarification on the rules relating to the use of isboxer in pvp, and was told by ccp ""we cannot discuss the terms of our policies"". how can ccp expect a player base to follow the rules, if when requested for clarification on said rules, they refuse to discuss it.i use isboxer yes, but i do also see the objection alot of players have with it, and my stance is this, if you are going to allow isboxer, then you cannot reimburse players who lose their ships to one. if not, then just get it over with and ban the use of isboxer. you cannot have it both ways, either allow it entirely or ban it."
10/16/2014,1
10/16/2014,so you want free orca kills because you're too lazy / chicken to just gank them?
10/16/2014,"i definitely can't immediately think of a way i could make this blow back on you for a highsec orcapocalypse. here's a hint, you can't exactly set parameters for someone to use your orca. it would bring a whole new level of awox, you wouldn't even be able to figure out who flagged your orca for you if i did it fast enough. hell it'd be worse than a normal awox, since you couldn't even fight back or rep your orca without flagging yourselves too.and all because you two chose to cry about a tactic that a few people actually use in lieu of insta undocks. yeah, bring on the mass flagged orcas."
10/16/2014,"this is so pathetically simple to bypass it's almost funny. orca pilot opens ship maintenance bay, right clicks on cata, selects option to launch ship into space, then is shocked when the ganker in a pod suddenly boards the catalyst that is sitting in space.no access to orca services by ganker required."

10/17/2014,what real time is being lost? the few seconds it took to add the bpo to a research queue before heading off to do something else in game?the only way you lost real time is if you sat and watched the timer on your bpo research count down instead of having a life.
10/17/2014,ah i think i might understand now....your upset that stations no longer have que times. is that it. if it is all i can say is deal with it because it is change for the better. if you spent years already having your stuff maxed out....then ok good. what are you complaining about....that those that havent can now do the same? sheesh. htfu and stfu will ya.
10/18/2014,and that is all that matters.

10/18/2014,"oh wow, this is really happening?i thought ccp gave the use of isboxer their blessing? is it only allowed to be used in pve farming or something?i hope to see a ccp response as well."
10/19/2014,"i'm enjoying the eve vegas stream very much. i'm looking forward to the goodies that come with the hd subscription.thankfully, and oddly, the accounts that i am uprooting don't expire until late december. so regarding foxfour's teaser that something is happening... cool, this issue has already been addressed beyond what i hoped at eve vegas, and i can wait until december.i want to keep playing. i will keep playing. if i started downsizing without explaining myself clearly, that would make me a walkout and it would be very immature. i should share my thoughts for the sake of communication. i also think the talking points listed in foxfour's presentation miss me by quite a bit, and i still have some explaining to do. things like ""lack of choice,"" ""punishes older players,"" and the 4% isk sink figure, specifically.""choice"" never would have occurred to me as a reason to inquire about something like medical clone costs. for me, this is all about the math. maths. specifically, an equitable relationship between the player and their organization, where the player contributes their time and energy in return for a reasonable amount of support in replacing losses. you know, sustainable.i am interested in what type of choices you have in mind for medical clone costs. it was completely unexpected, but ok. in the meantime, as they say, the beatings will continue until morale improves.regarding reimbursements. they're an excellent indicator of a successful organization, and confidence. great, but reimbursements are abstract and outside of the game mechanics--members have to apply for reimbursement ~somewhere~ and are subject to review, and only then is the ""give money"" function used. if reimbursements were handled in-game, then maybe it's something that could be balanced, but for now i hope you agree it's out-of-bounds. and it should be. losses need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, which requires human intuition. i don't see you replacing that one, or organizations putting their isk into such a system if it was created (please tell me we're on the same page here).suggesting reimbursements as a solution to medical clone costs is kinda bad, too. it's basically suggesting a player farms their organization. for someone like me, with several accounts that are not controlled with isboxer or used for mining, that's the big question. what does this joker plan to do, welp several characters at a time?to answer that question definitively with a ""no,"" especially without isboxer, i can't multibox at all without admitting to some degree that i was not playing at my best, while split between more than one client on grid. having accepted this downsizing, and the rp of my characters being put on ice or not being at the helm of their own account, i'm starting to see this as a good thing.especially considering jump fatigue changes, and decloaking changes to a lesser degree, it seems multiboxing in null is a completely different meta. not that copypaste isboxer gameplay was ever my thing--it isn't, never was, i won't miss it. but in order to absolve myself of the guilt and even the perception that i'm not contributing the same thing as the next player, it's time to go uniboxing.devs and players have talked about ship stashes in response to upcoming changes, and seem to be okay with it. i'm thinking along those lines, but slightly different.yes, medical clone costs punish higher sp players. but an even bigger issue worth considering is those characters, once they are trained to a satisfactory level, can stop training and then share an account with other characters. looking back, that strikes me as more important than my 20 million isk per pod.as for the isk sink, that 4% doesn't reveal anything about assets never undocked, and player behavior that never took place, due to medical clone costs. you can't balance for gameplay that never happens, which is what medical clone costs do. at least for me, it influences my decisions.4%... how does that compare to other isk sinks that go to bob, like abandoned drones, for example. which, unlike other items lost to explosions, are not tractored by an mtu..."
10/19/2014,"please read through the full post and comments before replying!point: many cool names for characters and corporations are taken by inactive accounts who haven't logged in for years. i want a way to reclaim these names because eve's growing pile of inactive accounts and dead one-man corps shouldn't become a cool-name graveyard.counterpoint: reclaiming names will anger players who reactivate to find they've lost their name, and will cause confusion among people who knew the old character.let's address the first issue, angering and surprising the 'former' owner of the name. i propose a simple tool, either on the site or in the game, where you can enter a name to request it. it will only take inactive names. it will send a ccp support email directly to the inactive account holder that if they do not reactivate their account within 30 days, their name will be adversely possessed (that's legal speak for ""use it or lose it""). to avoid spam, only one request can be open for a name. if the request is successful, ccp lets the requester know when the name will go ""live"", so that they can be ready to claim it.the second issue, confusion. if a name is reclaimed, all references to the old character should be changed in some way. if the mod team takes away your names for other reasons, typically your name is changed to the generic ""gallente citizen ######"" (which you can petition to change to something cooler). i suggest that the same thing should happen here. this means editing the full history of killmails, contacts, evemails etc. this can be done during downtime.please let me know what you guys think. i'm especially eager to hear how some might exploit this, so we can work on solutions to those exploits. i want to make a working solution to one of the problems that has bothered me forever in this game.tell me what you think about the following changesvariation 1: if no response from deactivated account, name remains in place."
10/19/2014,"and next i suppose you'll want ccp to appropriate all items owned by characters inactive for more than a set period of time and contract them to you as well, right?"

10/19/2014,"wow.well, if ships lost to a boxer gank are now reimbursable, i would expect to see that every ship lost to an isbox'ed bombing run since pretty much forever will need to be reimbursed immediately.or is there some greater form of favoritism at play here?"
10/19/2014,"hello csm!this is probably a terrible idea, and i'm sure you'll be able to tell the many, many reasons why. nevertheless, since sperging on the forums is a god-given right of all eve players .... here goes nothing!the new patch structure poses a particular challenge to the csm. the current scheme of having a trip to iceland for an information bonanza with smaller ""catchup"" sessions behind the scenes via skype / your forums worked well under the old model. it doesn't really seem fit for purpose under the new release schedule however. the fine details of exactly what is being released are far more fluid than they ever were in the past. the recent drama over jump range changes seams to attest to this. i might be wrong, but what i gathered from it was rather than the csm being actively mislead, they were simply left out of the loop at the vital stage, and we can probably except similar situations to arise in the future.burnout is also a factor to consider. you guys do fantastic work, but i think sometimes we can forget that ultimately you're volunteers, rather than this being your an all-consuming job. i'm sure the reality is different, but on paper your workload has effectively gone up by a factor of five, assuming each patch will require roughly the same amount of faffing about in terms of providing feedback, preparing statements etc. what i'd like to suggest is doing away with the trip to iceland, and instead hiring a full time csm tribune to spy on ccp. by no means am i suggesting that the trip is worthless, or that it's a holiday for you guys (i don't think anyone who's read the minutes could ever argue that!). but rather that this might be a better use of resources in our brave new reality. hopefully the effect would be to give the csm more of an active day to day presence within ccp, and simultaneously make your workload more manageable. i've assumed that having both would be a non-starter with ccp, but that the cost of the trip could be exchanged to cover their salary. the fine details would of course be up to yourselves and more importantly ccp, but for illustration purposes here's an example of how it could work; they should be ""employed"" by the csm rather than ccp, with their full 40 hour job description at the csm's disposal they wouldn't be a direct member of the csm, but rather a resource for it to use their principle job would be to serve as ""boots on the ground"", reporting to the csm (finding out what each team's doing on a weekly basis, sitting in on meetings, booking conferences, making sure questions are followed up on etc). rather than receiving snapshots of information, there would be a more continuous flow (which hopefully would be more manageable) they could also be made responsible for a lot of the tedious collating and releasing of information (taking meeting minutes, keeping a calendar of what's currently under nda or due for release etc) when the csm has a unified position on an issue, they would be able to bang the drum in person on it's behalf their permanent presence would presumably help smooth transition periods between one csm and its successor i could ramble on and on, but hopefully you get idea. i look forward to hearing the dozen reasons why i'm a drunken idiot in due course."

10/20/2014,"i recently returned to this game to find things have changed a lot in the last couple years.i would like to make 2 arguments:1) the old canflipping mechanics were fun. they produced distictly high quality player created content and lead to conflicts and learning within the game. they were great for casual pvp.the duel system is no replacement for this mechanic. can flipping seems to have been replaced by full-time suicide ganks because suicide ganking is, in some ways, safer than can flipping under the new system. i think the old system was better.2) a possibly unanticipated effect of the 50 million isk corp war dec is the large war-dec alliances who are now targeting small industrial corps.back when a war-dec cost 2 million isk, a war-dec corp would typically be between 2 and 5 people that would declare war on a 20-30 person industrial corp. now small corps can't afford wars, so everyone pitches in together and creates a 150 person war dec alliance. then they pool their resources and open up 50 or 100 wars against those same industrial corps.the difference is, now the indie corp is 20 unskilled guys against a major alliance. that doesn't really bother me, but here's my argument:1) the war dec guys are suffering in a big boring alliance when they'd rather be able to cause pandemonium on a small scale where they could make isk off ransoms and get more fights.2) the industrialists would have more fun if they weren't getting repetatively stomped by alliances they can't even hope to take the field against.this is what i see. i like can flipping on the old mechaincs better than the suicide gank game i see now. i like small war dec corps better than large alliances.what do you think, eve?"
10/20/2014,"i'd recommend picking your fight over either the dueling changes or the wardec mechanic. making a post trying to cover both is going to dilute the usefulness of any discussion here.for my part, i would argue that the 50m wardec is not bad, at least not for the reasons listed. nobody is making highsec pvpers join a blobby alliance to go to war. if they don't like something, they don't have to do it. as for people on the receiving end of the dec, i counter with a question: are losses under the current system greater than under the older system, when there were more frequent, smaller wardecs?"
10/20/2014,"okay, let's cut out the 'no response means yes' part. could an unsubbed person 'release' a name to you? in other words, we're flipping it. the deactivated account owns the name until it actively turns it over, but can do so without reactivating and deleting the character."
10/20/2014,"there was an announcement by ccp foxfour in his presentation at eve vegas.all names of trial account characters (who have never paid ccp any money, or used plex) that are older than 1 year old, will be reclaimed. i think he said rhea (december release) but my memory is a trifle untrustworthy right now if you've ever subbed your account, in any way, shape or form, it won't be affected.there are a lot of names which are going to be reclaimed."
10/20/2014,"that's a helpful bit of information. that's great news on its own, i bet that covers the vast majority of taken names. as csm do you have access to the statistics specifying what percentage of inactive accounts are unpaid trials?more comments to come."
10/20/2014,yes considering that some of the most hilarious moments in eve occur because of botched sov transfers.
10/20/2014,yes i am totally against a mechanic that makes things easier for people who shouldn't be in charge of important tasks such as sov transfers in the first place.

10/20/2014,and then any major power bloc with more than one seat could push their agenda through this role and leave out ideas that would benefit other players. no thanks.working as intended.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
10/20/2014,"i question whether a ccp employee could represent and work for the csm in a truly independent fashion. in the wide world of business, you generally don't entrust a company-chosen employee to recon for you."
10/20/2014,"hi i don't think ccp will hire us a spy. we do have a leeloo though, and she's great.the way things happen at the moment is:we have a whole bunch of skype channels which contain a bunch of ccp devs, who we can chat with about anything (in the general chat) or about specific team areas (in the serious business channels. better signal to noise, but less useful for just spitballing)we also have forums, which they post stuff to, for us to have a look at, when it reachs an appropriate state, or for when feedback is likely to be fairly lengthy.all in all, this all works pretty well. the jump change thing was an abberation, where, while we had all the details posted up for us in the meeting, some details were overlooked, and not discussed (as you've seen, it was a pretty lengthy set of changes. we talked a lot about them. just missed a bullet point or two). no malfeasance, just missing something, and a little overeagerness when it got posted. there was a lot of talking after that got posted, and as you'll have seen, revisions occured.the trip to iceland is valuable, as it's always better to be able to talk to people in person, where you get the full social bandwidth, unlike with text chat, or even video chat. 3 days of 10 hours of meetings is somewhat tiring, but it allowed us to more easily quiz people on things like the philosophy behind change, as a group, not just one to one."
10/20/2014,"hi steve.like the title said, it was a silly idea but i appreciate that you took the trouble to reply to my drunken wall of sperg.thanks, and keep up the good work!"
10/20/2014,
10/21/2014,the lack of can-flipping opportunities is related to a different thing actually. mining vessels have been changed a lot - so by now the cargo hold of most vessels are big enough to make the jetcans pretty obsolete. on beginner level the simple venture takes a 5000 m3 load and is so fast that it beats the combination jetcan/hauler as a single player any time. with improving skills in mining the cargo holds for ore are getting even bigger for the following ships making it even less necessary to jetcan.
10/21/2014,"fox: i concede your point. i probably did dilute my argument by making both at the same time. however, i think they're valid. my point is about the quality of the content. i consider the new structure a destruction of the best pvp experience i've seen in any game.dwissi: i'm not talking about a desire to flip miners, though i like doing that. most of the can flipping i've done is on stations with other people looking for a fight. the fact that new mining ships have huge hulls and more tank than a battlecruiser is another topic completely.can flipping was a great informal way for people to mess with each other and manage agro. most of the friends i have in this game i met can flipping.for both instances in which i ask for change, the new rules have created an inversion. ganking is now safer and more predictable than any other casual pvp option, which doesn't really make sense. can flipping used to be the casual pvp option of choice. it had clear mechanics and escalation opportunities.i find the duel option absolutely painful and without any reasonable option for escalation. concerning war declarations, i think we've made it too hard for a small corp to declare war, and desperate pvp'ers have formed large albatross alliances (who are bored senseless) and are war deccing the same small industrial corps. again, i see this as an inversion of the intended consequence.even if you don't want the old mechanics for the whole game, perhaps you can do them somewhere. i think the game is poorer for their loss."
10/21/2014,"i could probably get that information.however, it'd be covered by the nda, so wouldn't be of any real use to you from the presentation, i think it said 6.5 million names are going to be reclaimed."
10/21/2014,in general i am not opposing the idea of a clean-up - but i do not like that the motivation is the reclaiming of 'cool' names.i took a long break myself - eve is one of the few games that actually allow you to do that. so anything connected to accounts that have been payed for in some form shouldnt be touched at all - thats perfectly in line with what ccp announced.but many names have been 'blocked' on purpose by people to avoid a 'copycat' usage for scams and other things. i know at least a few that created accounts to achieve exactly that. another reason that some accounts might never been subbed after the trial period is that many people where using free mail accounts and might not have access to those accounts anymore or cannot recall enough details to reclaim them themselves.i would be very interested in knowing how many assets will be deleted by the purge. considering how gamy we are in eve i am almost certain that there are many accounts who where created as parking lot for assets etc.
10/21/2014,"all right, so i misjudged that there's a large number of people who go inactive and don't want the possibility of losing their name. i also appreciate that the vast majority of inactive names are being recovered in an upcoming recovery of trial account names. i'd still like to see some way to recover names from inactive paid accounts who aren't planning on ever logging back in. from the above comments, i imagine rules along the lines of:1) a player can ask an inactive player for a name, but it's ultimately up to the inactive player to approve the donation.2) if the inactive player declines to donate the name, they will never be asked again, since we interpret this as they want to keep the name.3) the inactive player can donate the name without reactivating their account.criticisms?"
10/21/2014,that would hit the nail right on spot probably - only requires ccp to play along to forward that request somehow to the inactive player via the account systems information.
10/21/2014,"as an older player attempting to return to eve, i ran into mr borg x50 on one of my characters almost immediately. the only thing that annoys the crap out of me about that person is that traffic control and lag get all sorts of messed up whenever i have to travel near the systems they are in. they are like a giant ball of lag that slowly travels throughout lonetrek."
10/21/2014,congrats jack on your idea getting support from ccp i want a eve pinball machine... confirming ccp cognac is best cognac
10/21/2014,thanks ed. and now we wait for it to be released in all its glory.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
10/21/2014,"gotta agree with steve on this.there is also the slight issue with 'who would run for a csm job' as opposed to the volunteer postion. you might not get the same people because committing to leaving your current lifestyle to actually be a full time game consultant might not be the dream of the people who would best represent you.then again, maybe some would do a fine job.by being volunteers we can maintain the illusion that we are not beholding to the company but working for the players. i say illusion because in truth we are both and neither. are we working hard or harder? hell yes.good.m"
10/22/2014,"my understanding from the presentation and subsequent convos/comments at evevegas is that no accounts are being purged, so therefore no assets will be purged. only the character names are being released and i was told the characters would be renamed generic racialcitizennumber names (i.e., caldaricitizen25341530958). the account itself and everything attached to the account remains in place, just the character name(s) will change.my understanding could, of course, be wrong"

10/23/2014,correct. :)
10/23/2014,"i know this is probably beyond the capability of ccp's development team, but i would like to see a deployable structure that allows view of a remote location in space. for instance i could drop this item in space on a gate and it would pop a window in the ui with a view of that location. in space this item would be not be visible to ships passing by. remote cameras could be discovered by a small smartbomb type item that would decloak the remote camera within a 50km radius.remote camera's would be limited by skill and require a fairly long train, with a max number of remote camera's deployed to 5.if the graphics rendering would not be possible it would be nice to extend your dscan from the remote camera. splitting your dscan results into sections from ship/remote 1/remote 2 etc. remote cameras would be limited dscan 360degree for simplicity and could be configured individually with its own range slider or use the range slider from the ship.it would be nice to be able to do this across systems but i would imagine this would cause more technical problems and would be limited to same system as the player that deployed them."

10/24/2014,nah.you already have intel channels across the board to cover your ratting.-1
10/24/2014,"actually ratting was not the reason for the idea, more surveillance of hostile movement for pvp purposes. if you look at my kb you will find that i'm not much into pve."
10/24/2014,"they already have these.edit: eh, i kinda feel like an *** just saying the above without explaining it. i think the fog of war as it exists right now is a good mechanic, and does not need alterations like the proposed change. while it might provide an interesting shaking-up of the dynamics of 'fair war'... there are plenty of practices, like gate camping, which would be buffed by this, and i don't think that is a good thing."
10/24/2014,
10/25/2014,"hello .i'm not sure where to post this, so i hope this is the good place.i would like to know if it would be possible to change my character name from "" random kheops"" to ""random kheops""i know this is not really important but it is to me :)thanks for the answer."
10/25/2014,
10/26/2014,file a petition in-game.
10/26/2014,"this.they will change the first letter of each word to upper case. but it may take some time for the petition to be answered. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/27/2014,"i'm glad to see that the trial account names are being opened up in such a fashion, there are certainly a few that i am eagre to try to snag up, should they happen to have been created on trial accounts long ago. as for the possibility of ever losing your character name on a paid account, that is a legacy, part of the history of eve. for some a bigger one than others, but to think that someone might snag up someone elses name simply because that person was gone for a year after 6 years of play, or didnt respond to a 30 day query, is a mistake that i hope ccp will never make. while i think its neat to ask someone for their name, i don't think that ccp should be in the business of allowing players to exchange names, beyond one player deleting his character or selling it, to the person who wants the name."
10/27/2014,"i'm fairly certain that valve, and a variety of other games already actively do this without legal hassle because a) you are consenting to it and b) because they are only searching for certain file types, they are not snooping through personal data or information any more than an electronic security is used to scan for weapons.as for isboxer, the amount of people that do run more than 30 accounts is so ridiculously small, that its silly to address the entire subject based around them, which is probably why ccp doesn't. however, if this really is such a big issue, players can combat it. if you are determined, bump or suicide gank palyers like memory alpha. sure, having enough battleships to gank all his skiffs before they simply warp off is probably not cost effective, and something he can probably replace quickly, but having a few characters simply bumping his freighters repeatedly, preventing them from warping out is particularly effective at shutting down his operation. sure, the miners keep mining, but without anywhere to put the ore, or ice, it'll overflow fast with 40 skiffs, something that would create a real problem for him. take it upon yourselves, to combat the actions of mega players like this. the general userbase that uses isboxer and similar applications are not a problem for eve."
10/27/2014,"eula:d. monitoringyou agree that ccp may remotely monitor your game hardware solely for the purpose of establishing whether in playing the game and accessing the system you are using software created or approved by ccp, or whether you are using unauthorized software created by you or a third party in contravention of section 6.but as input mirroring is valid, such monitoring doesn't matter anyway."
10/27/2014,"nicely said.i was slightly annoyed by people using isboxer many times around me, because i play with one single account, and work with a corporation or even out in null with others cooperatively and these people using isboxer come in, take everything i was doing, leaving me in the dust because i can't keep up and they just click one button to do 10 things at once.i do know it gives ccp more income, so they won't really ban it, nor can they detect for it and there are ways of hiding it's usage even if ccp were to poke into the privacy of their users by hiding a process checking tool into the game client.however, it's about the only way the game survives at this point, solo players are becoming extremely rare, i'm a rare breed now. :p being a mining/industry person with only one account. it sucks when i'm mining with someone and a team of 10-30 isboxer guys comes in and deletes the entire belt before i can get what i need, shoving me off to have to leave the area. but meh. a reward for the solo account users that properly work with other human players or even work solo just fine, would be pretty nice.however there is no real way for ccp to reward those types of people because again, they won't be able to detect the isboxer users from the non-isboxer guys.anyway, i don't support banning isboxer at this point, even though users using it have annoyed me quite a lot."
10/27/2014,"this is a question about the character naming policy, and the lack of enforcement. i won't copy the rules here directly, but here is a link for anyone wondering:"
10/27/2014,"all you can do is report it. i have seen ccp change the names of characters and corporations that were deemed offensive, but as with forums, i think they are inclined to let some edge cases stay. this thread has degenerated to the point it's become like two bald men fighting over a comb. -- doc fury"
10/27/2014,"honestly it has to do with how much effort they are willing to expend towards something no one is complaining about, or at least very few are, since the age of most eve players is upper 20's to low 30's, most people have learned to just ignore such names, i mean, its not as if theres a whole lot of ""impressionable youths"" runnign around the game (or if there were, theyd have been the ones picking those names to begin with anyways)"
10/27/2014,bump

10/28/2014,report the character names. ccp makes their decisions from there. they do have a process to make these decisions.
10/29/2014,"they may have a process, but the question is whether or not they care to follow it."

10/30/2014,"sadly, i've seen no indication ccp intends to do any real new development on eve, since they haven't really done any in the last three years either."
10/30/2014,"i think instead of trying to add elements of second life to eve, ccp should focus on the things that actually, i don't know, improve the game. it's a game about blowing ships up in space. focus on that, not some useless feature. incarna was a horrid expansion; alot of dev time and resources dedicated to catering to the rmt crowd, and the game suffered heavily as a result."
10/30/2014,"why not just let me pay another plex every month to be able to duct tape another bomber to my own? skip isboxer altogether, just give me a bomber that has double the grid/cpu/slots. that is functionally what isboxer does. ccp needs to handle this ****. if you are only controlling one ship and your commands are replicated (huehue replicator) to 30 others, you are functionally controlling a massive voltron of 31 ships as one with all of their weapons grouped. being able to do such with a bunch of plex makes eve p2w."
10/30/2014,okay so you think having a strong moral compass is important for a csm candidate? or...do you think its more important to be taken seriously?

10/31/2014,it would be an added bonus to one of the upgrades dedicated to upgrading the graphics. hell go full ****** sell stuff in the nex store to put in to your walk about station stuff. added revenue to ccp. -looking at ccp -anything is possible. i would like to see something new other then spinning my ship in the hanger.-olgaso yeah like my post. -olga
10/31/2014,"starting from my own experience, i have been in many corporations from high-sec corps genuinely trying to build an organization, eve-university, low-sec pirate groups, non-corporate incursion communities, and various null-sec groups within the cfc. and in another life on another main in the early days of eve, i have even been a high-sec carebear and a providence anti-pirate resident.i would say that there is a scale of ease of access for joining communities and corporations. some are open societies, and some are closed societies. we could place a group on the spectrum of how open they are to new members and strangers.eve university and brave newbies are on the extreme end of open societies. they will quite literally take anyone who wants to join them. if you are new to eve without any friends or connections, they would be among your best options for a well organized corp that is willing to take you in.most corporations that openly recruit on the eve online forums and the official recruitment channel, would fall under the ""please apply and fill in the application booklet, give us proof of your competence through your killboard, and standby for anti-spy background checks and interviews"" routine. their recruitment usually follows the tune of ""pvpers wanted"", ""industrialists wanted"", ""want cool pvp?"", fun times, explosions, isk... etc...then there are a great many that do not openly recruit. ""vouch only"" corps exist in all areas of space. you have to know someone to get in. in eve there are many high-profile corps and groups that practice ""vouch"" based recruitment. they ""do cool things"", they affect the sandbox in public ways, and you are not welcome to join unless you are already connected to them.being in the the new order, belligerent undesirables, and the cfc, i have met and befriended a fair share of awoxers and people who join corps with alts (or even mains) to ""grief"" them. i grant that to an awoxer or thief, public recruiting corporations are low-hanging fruit. the poor victims actually want you in their corporation and are rewarded with asset destruction and redistribution to the point of manly tears. it is understandable that ""some"" people tend towards not trusting another eve player further than they can throw them.according to the csm9 minutes, ccp wants to remove awoxing to ""make recruitment safer for the recruiter and the recruitee"" and to ""mitigate the risk of recruiting someone which makes people not recruit."" i grant that when a large, well organized entity gets awoxed or infiltrated, they can usually shrug it off. less organized groups and casual groups tend more towards not surviving the experience. and for a carebear corporation, i expect it can be hell, and it is usually intended to be so by the perpetrator.removing awoxing will most certainly make it easier for people to join corps that can't defend themselves or otherwise survive an infiltration. though i understand that everyone can try to play how they like, i personally resent the intervention by ccp in trying to help the weak survive. though my bias is probably due to being on the griefing faction.but from a perspective of ""the greater good of eve"", i would argue that making the game easier for the weak by changing awoxing mechanics is not good for new players or people who want to build corporations, in the sense that it would encourage more of such risk adverse players and organisations.many of us helpful griefers would tell you that new players and organizations survive eve by being informed and educated about the risks, and then adapting to them.changes to the mechanics will help new players join bad corps. closed societies and corps with high standards will not take them anyway. at a demographic level this will harm the collective intelligence and adaptability of the eve-born newbie as you give them easy access to bad corporations.from a griefing perspective however, bad corporations do not survive and never will. what the future will most likely see is that other methods of doing harm to corporations in high-sec will still be used to their fullest extent. the collective screaming of the victims will continue to beg for more safety. but they will never be safe without game-breaking changes to make them totally safe.malcanis' law will always apply, even in this situation. as you make things harder we can only get more organized, more resourceful and more brutal. - i would know, i will be instigating it."
10/31/2014,"i agree with you 100%. if you remove all risk from players, you create a goup of complacent, risk averse people that will do nothing to adapt to what eve is all about. the answer is not to make eve a safer place, but to educate and prepare players to be able to adapt and survive. the path that ccp has been following lately is, to say the least, is harmful to the survival of eve..imo. players need to learn how to adapt to risk to minimize or eliminate threats to their ""safety"". to me, it seems like people are whining to have their hands held because they can't seem to learn how to survive on their own. eve is a model of how things can, and do, function in the real world. the last thing eve needs is the same political correctness and hand holding of the weak that occurs in rl. adapt to survive..learn to grow..fight to win. giving handouts and free passes to those either too lazy or too inept to make it on their own is not the solution. i fear as kid gloves are put on more and more, ccp will alienate the majority of its player base in order to accomodate a select few. my suggestion to ccp would be to implement actions that help teach and prepare new players (or old players who just don't ""get it""), not remove them from all risk. tbh, the best teacher is experience. for example, getting ganked teaches you your mistakes and how to avoid them in the future (for most people anyways :/)..just like getting killed in pvp teaches you your mistakes and how to adapt to certain situations. take this away and what you have is a game like so many others. i play eve because it is not like other games. i'm sure many will agree. ccp...please...fix what's broken with eve..rather than try to change what isn't. there are so many things that have gone neglected that need attention. protection for those too unmotivated to take the responsibility themselves is not one of them. now i digress...."
10/31/2014,"ccp seagull: ""why is not every corporation recruiting openly if this is not a problem? i know that it is also corporation roles and access. but you are smart enough to know what you are getting into but do you not agree this is hindering recruitment?""i would like to add that it is not just awoxing that ""hinders corporation recruitment"". anyone that is not high-sec does who not openly recruit fear something else: the metagame.awoxing is the least of their problems."
10/31/2014,"i agree that taking away corpies being able to shoot each other isn't going to change whether someone will stay in the game or not. if the new player isn't into eve there will be excuses offered if they bother with the survey on the way out. annoying the daylights out of the player base that does subscribe long term - not so great an idea.that said if ccp really wants to make a positive change regarding shooting corpies how about this""corp and/or open kill rights assignable by a corp member with any official corp role beyond just being in the corp. lasts until used by anyone and stays with the character for 30 days after dropping corp. 1 active corp kill right per corp on a character at a given time.or if ccp wants to make less nerfing viable incentives for players to leave npc corps just boot them from their first npc after 30 days of the account being active into a ""no corp"" status with penalties like:not being able to set market orders or purchase from the market while in a ""no corp"" status.and orinability to use contracts while in a ""no corp"" status.and ornot being allowed to use reprocessing facilities in an npc station while in a ""no corp"" status.and ornot being being allowed to access any agents while in a ""no corp"" status.also consider after 30 days of being an active account:if the character joins an npc corp (after leaving a pc corp) treat the character as in limited faction warfare for that corp's main faction. such as if gallente corp all amarr npc corp/faction warfare can fight said character etc at any time anywhere. take away faction police from going after them unless faction standing would otherwise allow for it.etc"
10/31/2014,"interesting....gotta run now, but am curious what people think."
10/31/2014,"i posted the following in the gd thread, i think it's appropriate to post it here too."
10/31/2014,"the goal of this is to make the game more casual friendly. so now instead of having to do research into someone applying to join your corp, a lot of corps can just autoaccept players and move on.i will grant that the hour+ application process to join many of the established corps sucks. especially when you are a new player and don't really know if you like the corp anyway. it put me off joining a player corp for a while.however, i would prefer if this was handled by making the background check process easier. the api system is very convoluted. if that were streamlined, it would help out."
10/31/2014,"even the api won't save a corporation from an experienced and determined spy who would also be aware of these tools. at least at the null-sec level, the bar is set very very high, to the tune of professional internet forensics. what the api does do is make it more difficult for incompetent griefers like me to run amok with 10 hour heroes. i'd actually need some kind of untraceable income for skillbooks and equipment. metagame wise, i believe that no serious corporation will ever auto-accept people. and no game mechanic can change that."
10/31/2014,"you are thinking from a null perspective. this is a change directed at highsec. high sec pve corps rarely worry about spies and they don't give their line members access to anything of value. more members means more tax income and more people showing up to your mining ops.if you are a high sec pve corp looking to recruit after this change, there is little reason not to autoaccept members. worst that can happen is they say bad things in corp chat then you kick them(which is guaranteed to happen next downtime)."
10/31/2014,"hey, just popping back in to get in touch.all of my account downsizing has happened in the form of cancelling the recurring charges for the subs. however there will still be transfer fees being made as i consolidate mains. i just want to be clear this isn't about the irl $ (it's about welping half a plex in pure med clone costs in a single outing). i have no problem spending the $ for what amounts to a database edit, really. in fact i'm already saving money despite these charges, through reduced sub fees.i'll have to eat those fees again when it's time to unpack my mains and put them all on their own accounts again.i just hope you take a very clear headed look at how game mechanics are changing the face of multiboxing in eve. some things are far, far removed from the code, and are classic cases of the writing on the wall.i still love you, just doing what i gotta."
10/31/2014,i recently posted in the relevant forum about this and got told to stfu.but i'm concerned. this change does nothing for gameplay. i have not actively played eve for years but i keep my account. i really only log on to change skills and check my corp. my corp has over a hundred members and i think you could say that no one was a real player in eve. but they all pay their sub's. if i can stack a years worth of skills what incentive have i to login? and if in a year i remember to check my account why would i be bothered to keep it active.please rethink this change. i suspect it will lose more accounts than it will gain. unless farmers click on to the possibilities. thanks khem
10/31/2014,"just saw a dev mention the tug and a dec launch, so came here to see if it was true. i cant wait to see what actually comes out. nice work."
10/31/2014,i think being good or true is always more important than being taken seriously. i am aware that it isn't a good strategy but i refuse to yield my values.
