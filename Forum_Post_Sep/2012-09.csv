9/1/2012,"i'm not gonna repeat how for the very majority of t2 items the t2 bpos have little impact on sell prices.if you make the invented item more efficient to produce, it will benefit all inventors, prices will fall and margins will remain similar to before the change.many items produce at a loss because people invent blindly, not doing the math, oversupplying the market, driving price down, selling below cost."

9/4/2012,why not wormhole destabilizers. that way we can really just give a giant middle finger to everyone suggested stupid crap in this thread.
9/4/2012,"lol... we pretty much want the same thing... the only way i'd advocate a wh stabilizer, is if all wh's are initially""destabilized,"" and the stabilizer (which would be a vulnerable, attack-able module) somehow replaced the mass limits that currently governs wh travel.... i understand most people hear only ""module to let infinite ships through a wh"" and equate it with wh blobbing... but that's not even remotely what i'm suggesting.... and as for your wh destablizer....how would it function? a bomb you launch at the wh to randomly remove mass (<-- terrible idea, as people would just launch bombs to close wh's without risking your precious orca targets)?? would it be a module you anchored that collapsed the wh the next time a ship comes through (<-- terrible idea, as people would use them to close wh's without risking your precious orca targets)? how could it function in a manner that i can't exploit to risklessly close a wh?? the problem is, wh mass limit is too mathematically defined... people know exactly how to close each type of wh.... and worse, wh vitality is actually dependent on the ability to close a wh, because you need to spawn a new wh to find more sites to run.... what ccp really needs to do is randomize wh extinction events... and i don't know the best way to do this, but i'll listen to whatever's on the table to identify it as good or bad.... other ideas, coupled together, could also work: 1.) prevent ships from using a wh when their mass is more than the remaining mass on a wh.... and perhaps have it actually close the wh without going through!! 2.) make it so a new static wh will spawn without needing to close your old static. example: whenever a current static goes critical (time and/or mass), a new static will spawn. 3.) more ambiguous wh mass limits via wh mass regeneration (+100m-ish kg/hr).... but don't update the mass critical messages. 4.) change the critical point, so a wh claims critical randomly when the mass limit remaining is between 10-35% wh's mass limit. 5.) alter the time-remaining to vary inversely with mass regeneration.... i.e., if a wh's mass is regenerating, then perhaps it's life cycle speeds up so it decays faster... there are pro's and con's to each of the above too..."
9/4/2012,"take the noctis. remove the two rectangular cargo hold thingies flanking the ship near the engines and replace them with some kind of cylindrical/spherical ""gas tanks"". examplemove 4 of the high slots to low slots. (lore states the hull is an armour tanker)remove salvager/tractor beam bonusesgive the ship a 10% bonus to gas harvester yield (4 become effectively 6 at level 5 ore industrial skill)give the ship a suitable secondary bonus (tank or something)give the ship a 75m drone bay with 50m/bit bandwidth and introduce gas harvesting drones.give the ship a small cargo hold and large gas bay (approx 5000-10000m3)done. it's only a little better than using a bc and requires very little work."
9/4/2012,how about that you just do a t2 version of the noctis that is specialized in gas harvesting or something?and seems that i wasnt the only one thinking this xdand to make it more fun they should add nice new graphics also for the t2 ship so it would look like a gas harvester rather than a regular noctis.
9/4/2012,this may be interesting but ide wait for the mining frig to come out as i have a feeling that may actualy not be to bad for gas mining if not then could be interesting to get a specilised gas miner as ccp seem to be heading into this kinda thing more and more
9/4/2012,"indeed. so what will happen if a dedicated gas miner is introduced? gas supply goes up, prices fall and gas mining profitability remains about the same.the only actual changes would be to require people to sink sp into the dedicated gas miner, and to increase the hassle of moving gas to market, as the larger volumes of gas are now worth less. the best griefing is when people ask for it themselves."
9/4/2012,"this needs saying more. even if the number of players doubled and all the new peeps were pvebears, it would improve the game - for pvpers.otoh. lets get rid of mining, and then the last person with a ship is the winner....."
9/4/2012,yes please do this.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
9/4/2012,"on a seafaring ship, ammunition for the batteries and guns is stored in what is known as the ship's magazine. it separates possible explosive ordinance form everyday items such as food, allowing minimal interference should there be a fire. considering the amount of ammunition that is sometimes carried by pvpers and pveers alike, my proposal would allow a small portion of the ship's cargo hold to be designated as the ""magazine"", which players can manually place ammunition for their weapons into. the ship will automatically reload from the magazine instead of ammunition from the cargohold. this also serves to separate ammunition and scripts from general cargo, so as to ease the transfer between the ship's cargo and the in-station inventory management.leadership is something you learn. maybe one day, you'll learn that."
9/4/2012,i'm gonna stop you right there. we fly space ships.
9/4/2012,"which doesn't negate my point in the least, considering several sci-fi shows that have kinetic weapons also use magazine holds.leadership is something you learn. maybe one day, you'll learn that."
9/4/2012,"ammo bay .because ccp has a problem with multiple windows open, multiple location access, and generally having a useable product, i do not see this happening in the near future."
9/4/2012,"i like the idea, but how do you decided how large this ""magazine"" should be. how many rounds is considered enough? is it a standard size per ship?on another note - i am always looking for a good sci-fi show, could you name of a few you enjoyed?-dusenman"
9/4/2012,"this seems like an addition for the sake of an addition. also, you can't use real life as inspiration and then not see that eve doesn't have an issue with ammo exploding inside our ships and destroying our consumables.this thread has some great suggestions."
9/4/2012,"i wish there was an ammo hold (like ore holds, etc.). if you are carrying gear or looting/salvaging, you have to waste time looking to see how much ammo you have left. if you put the ammo in a can, you can't load it. loot and salvage go straight to the cargo hold.i agree with the spirit of the op."
9/4/2012,make an ammo filter? it take all of two seconds.
9/4/2012,"i don't particularly see the need for this...... either you bring sooo much ammo that you are limited in the loot you can hold, or you minimize the ammo you bring. there's a nice trade off here.... in actuality, your cargo hold is an ammo hold that you can also put other stuff there.... very few ships actually have need for a cargo bay..."
9/4/2012,"i had a similar idea, but no separate magazine or hold.auto re-stockthis way when you un-dock it will tell you if you are missing any ammo / charges. ( user set of course )"
9/4/2012,"let me tell you what i used to do. i used to have the cargo hold open at all time. in it, i had a can that about took up a good portion of the cargo hold, but left enough room for ammo. (this was awesome with medium can in a caracal.) all loot went in the can. rogue ammo, stuff that i would never use that time, went in the can too.the point was to keep ammo i was not using out of the context menu of the launchers and guns.it also prevents grinding ammo you built/need, which my friends did often.the loot-all-button is a blessing and a curse. it is vastly faster to loot, but there is no flow control. the new cargo viewer is also a blessing and a curse. it's huge, even in its smallest form. it has grown in size progressively over the years, so i gave up on keeping it open. ccp tends to feel that large, clunky windows and naming schemes are better.a filter can help with viewing how much ammo i have left, yes, but it will never affect the weaponry context menu. also, filters would have to change each time i changed ships, which would just be annoying since i fly so many types. i really don't want to have than many filters, either.at this point, i see two options:1) an ammo bay, which would do the separating and could be kept open to view rounds remaining. sadly, this would not be efficient use of screen real-estate.2) an ammo display that showed how many shots, volleys, and even rounds remaining. it would probably only show the ammo in use. it could even go in the hover-info of weapons and possibly other modules (e.g. cap boosters). however, this would not clean up the weapon context menu.both would be ideal. since missile ammo now has the same names for fof and normal ammo, it has become a lot easier to mistake one for the other. it's an annoyance... until you are reloading under fire."
9/4/2012,"some of you may have noticed these remarks in the last csm notes regarding the project to revamp starbases:so our huge revamp originally slated for this winter has slipped to sometime in 2013.now keep in mind this is from the same company who announced walking in stations in 2006, named the release 'incarna' in 2009 then followed up with release in 2011. i'm sure those alliance logos on ships from 2008 are coming along nicely guys!so in the same manner as the supercap rebalances earlier this year, i'm asking for a 'sticking plaster' patch to help relieve some issues with starbases until ccp can realise their final vision for them. this would be solely using statistics tweaks and an absolute minimum of coding work.problems a) the increase in general ship ehp and proliferation of logistics since 2007. even if you're manually controlling all the guns on the tower, it takes far too many medium guns to damage typical fleet ships of 100k+ ehp. large guns typically need over a minute to lock and cycle to the next target. and that's assuming any of them track the target and that the target isn't immediately locked up by 50 logistics cruisers.oh wait you wanted to ewar those cruisers to hamper repping? sorry that'll be a whole minute to lock it with that single ecm. then he'll warp out and back quicker than it took to lock him.b) no risk to supercaps. at all. even if a tower could tackle one, most modules melt in seconds. resistance, as they say, is futile. you used to be able to kill dreads with these things if you used them properly. now, everyone is sporting enough dps to level a tower in moments and the only real risk during a siege is if you forget the bring a support fleet and the enemy reacts within 2 minutes flat.towers stats were last balanced over 6 years ago and were meant to be hit by a dozen dreads at most, who would sit in siege for 10mins in order to do anything of note. now everyone rolls around with 5min siege cycles and supercaps that the tower cannot possibly hurt unless the pilot happens to suffer a stroke mid-op while thrashing his hands into the keys that turn off his hardeners and accidently saying ""go on guys i'll catch up later"" into comms.c) useless mods. hands up if you've ever used hybrid weapons (or god forbid, missiles) on a serious tower. if you raised your hand there, get out of this thread. you're dumb and i don't want your support.everyone knows that even vaguely effective towers use laser or projectile guns (or more likely just lots of hardeners). why not make starbase citadel torps an actual anti-supercap weapon like their ship-mounted counterparts? let's make hybrids capable of blowing up things larger than passing jetcans.d) stagnation. with the exception of various tweaks to jump bridges or fueling, starbases have been unchanged for over 5 years now. sure they can tip the balance in small scale fights as low sec corp a sieges low sec corp b with both of their dreadnoughts, but anywhere else they're not even an issue. sieging towers in null-sec is another dull structure shoot that no longer encourages real traps or surprises because the tower can't do ****. because everyone just puts hardeners on them.please bring back the risk, the drama, and dare i say excitement of putting your **** out in space and hoping someone won't chop it off.possible solutions:1) make starbases even a slight risk to supercaps - such as letting warp scramblers (not disruptors) tackle just like a hic focused point, or buffing energy neuts with more cap drain and hp. thanks to the huge sig on supercaps, any such module could be balanced around its scan resolution very easily.2) general increase in weapon damage, especially for medium guns. failing this, let large guns lock faster - they certainly ain't for killing capitals anymore. 3) right now the only reliable way to get enough pos gunners to a tower in time to man everything is if your opponent is nice enough to send a written invitation in advance. give people with starbase defense management trained the ability to use more modules more effectively (such as 2 per level, or starting with 3 basic then add 1 per level, or 5 basic with a scan res bonus per level). 3b) a couple of ui fixes to starbase gunning would be sweet too. why can't i grab or drop multiple mods at once :(((((((( i swear one of you devs is making money off a cure for rsi.4) tweak tower bonuses with appropriate racial ewar. caldari already get ecm bonuses, but why don't we get neut bonuses on amarr, damps for gallente or webbing boosts for minmatar?5) varied size ewar mods with stats suited to their appropriate target. we already have small medium and large guns. why not the same for ecm, damps, neuts and webs?medium webs able to lock battleships but not slow them quite as effectively as their larger counterparts. small ecm with a quick locking timer to counter small threats like bombers, but with a suitably small jamming strength.small/medium damps intended to counter logistics cruisers in a way the current ecm mods can't.oh, and are you worried about balance in wormholes? i'm sure that crazy space can be convinced to do all sorts of zany yet very simple things to starbase systems, just like ships. scan resolution tweaks anyone?"
9/4/2012,"small changes could make pos's more livable for everyone if we had even small tweaks now, instead of waiting a few years for massive changes. fix the small things, like cleaning up the way moon miners and silos interact, making it clear things are linked."
9/4/2012,"i have starbase defense management trained to v on multiple characters, but haven't controlled pos guns in at least 2 years. there' s very little point to it anymore other than being a tiny nuisance to an enemy sub-cap fleet. buffing pos gunning would be a good ""stopgap"" while we await a long promised overhaul of the pos system."
9/4/2012,"i'd dearly love siloes to have the option to send mails when they're full or empty, much like towers scream to give you warning that they're going to go offline."
9/4/2012,+1 i would be willing to have a ccp dev's man baby if they would change the rorq hold to an industrial hold that allows either ore or fuel blocks.... just sayin...
9/4/2012,"oh yeah some realtalk.based on the previous track record with other features and major changes, a '2013' date for this project means we should start seeing solid info around fanfest. then ccp will throw out some foundation work for the main summer patch to help get things lined up, but we won't see the new starbases themselves. that will follow with a lengthy handover plan coming in the winter patch intended to get things ready and swapped over in time for christmas.but wait! something went wrong. they found a bug and now the handover gets extended to new year. our new starbases are now live in early 2014, but with some indicated features (like docking in them) still on the drawing board and 'coming soon'. prove me wrong stoffer :)"
9/4/2012,"hi, the marauder is a little obsolete because the t3 and noctis are better than the marauder. the idea will be to use the same hull then now but to add one ""sub function"" (only one).the ""sub function"" is like sub for t3 you add some bonus to your ship. example for ""sub function"" for amarr. (it's only some example)sub function amarr 1 : 7.5% bonus to repair amount of armor repair systems, 100 % bonus to range and velocity (version like now).sub function amarr 2 :+5% rate of fire, 10 m3 and 10 mbits/s for drone ( with lvl 5 you have 25% more dps on the guns and you can use 5 heavy drone).sub function amarr 3 :+ 800 armor hitpoints sub function amarr 4 :+ 5% tracking speed, +10 optimalwith this system that would be possible to had some love to bs t2. that will be possible for all t2 ship.they are some advantage for ccp to make that. you don't need to adjust the ship parameter (like cpu, power grid etc). it's only some bonus."
9/4/2012,"well this is news to me! why did no one tell me? :(marauders aren't obsolete, a noctis may salvage better and a strategic cruiser may kill better but marauders can do both (sure, they're not amazing at both but they shouldn't be), which is great for someone like me who has one account and doesn't want to switch ships to go back and salvage."
9/4/2012,nerf the noctis its opnerf t3 cruisers they're opproblem solved no new ships needed.seriously
9/4/2012,or you could require npc ship kills to finish a site.

9/5/2012,let's get some more support going!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
9/5/2012,"actually, you can. you set it to ""your corp"" and then you can accept a courier you made.how many battleships would it have to carry to be better the just shuttling over and flying them back? freighters align and warp slow. if the new freighter could only carry two, it might not be an actual time saver. three may be better, but not by much. so it may have to be able to carry 4 to really be an advantage over just making more trips.+1"
9/5/2012,"i support this proposal fully. +1this is very close to how i imagined pi should be...if this will ever be realized (slim chances, but we could hope), eve will gain entirely new dimension, that will make its universe much closer to ultimate sci-fi game ever conceived.and if it will be done, it could / would lay great foundation for next-generation gameplay - flying in planets atmospheres, and maybe even walking or driving on planets surfaces first person... (dreams, dreams)edit:this gave me another idea.ccp has been able to merge (read: bought) white wolf company. so, why not do same with mindark, who produced great planet based game (entropia universe), and then use their system for planetary based gameplay?just food for thought, but worth trying..."
9/5/2012,"except i was trolling. i dont want any kind of stabilizer or destabilizer. that would just dumb down wormholes. and when you dumb down wormholes, all you do is allow some tard corps have the ability to live successfully in a c5/c6. and thats a bad thing. noob corps deserve only one thing in c5/c6s. death."
9/5/2012,"while i agree with your points the idea of a wh stabilizer could hold merit. you are making the mistake of thinking that wh's are individual systems, but they're not. just like new eden they're a galaxy of systems, only instead of stargates there are wh's.what you're seeing here might not just be the option for large alliances to stabilize an entry wh in null and just blob through, but rather a way to travel in this new galaxy, one owned entirely by players without actually owning the territory like null. basically if it was wh to wh stabilization i dont think it would be a problem.that being said wh stabilization would add an interesting mechanic. if allowed only in certain wh's or systems it could create an interesting system of linked wh systems while still allowing for random and limited transportation between other sections of the wh's galaxy and ks. furthermore by making it a player tool that means it can be lost. unlike stargates that are there forever these stabilizers could be destroyed.imagine for a minute if you will an alliance of wh corps who have slowly but surely stabilized wh's connecting to each others systems. they can now combine and coordinate forces inside their linked systems but must limit their movement outside of their stabilized systems or to ks.now to prevent corps/alliances from just sieging with a stabilizer in place there would be a system wide warning that a wh is being stabilized giving players a chance to stop it, or a counter module/building, or require that the stabilizer must be put on both sides of the wh making it vulnerable as 1. it would lower mass to bring that through and 2. it would be attackable. also due to it lowering mass of the wh it would give the defender the advantage as less forces can warp through to defend the wh stabilizer and the more defenders they bring in to protect it the weaker it gets (suicide runs by the defender to try and pass through wh's to close them making the stabilizer set up useless.)now that i've said all that, i can full well understand why at face value this seems bad, but honestly it could be a great expansion to the kinds of play you can experience, especially for other wh goers. i've been living in a wh for about 7 months now and while this could be catastrophic if done wrong, if done right it could probably add a lot to the game."
9/5/2012,"+1i find it kind of lazy that sleepers are still based around the scan anom run anom mechanic, i would find it more fitting to have to go through acceleration gates perhaps using hackers etc and other skills to navigate through complexsie longer perhaps e"
9/5/2012,1
9/5/2012,"after the fiasco with the horribad inventory, you really want the inventory to be more complicated, or butchered worse!?so to your proposal, i don't just say no, but **** no.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
9/5/2012,"that shows all the ammo you looted as well, when what you want to see is just the ammo you plan on using.but that brings up issues: will ammo be allowed in the normal hold? if yes, can i move it from the normal hold to the magazine? can i jet ammo for a fellow fleet member to load?"
9/5/2012,"this is a general call to the csm and to the community as a player who is drawn to the ""hard"" nature of eve online. i am sure that there will be some who say that ""i got what was coming"" and that is ok, but i am a bit saddened by this course of events and ask the csm to make sure that stuff like this does not continue. my story:my character, formerly called ""prize dept"" had a scam going that involved contracting ships to winners of somer blink ("
9/5/2012,quite frankly im suprised you even got one person to fall from it as i spotted it almost straight away when you sent me a hookbill wanting a bill for it.
9/5/2012,"it's a shame that the sandbox is getting so small =/feel your pain caldari citizen, the game isnt what it used to be..."
9/5/2012,"scamming is allowed, and i don't see how this is violation of the eula.... at the same point in time... your actions are pretty reprehensible... even if legit..."

9/5/2012,"if you check with the amarr sub function 1. you have exactly the same marauder than now.i have only add some new role with the same hull. with this method you have more flexibility like t3 on the marauder. the amarr, caldari etc have learn from sleeper technology and began to adapt some sub for this ship class. example : you found the sub function bpc in the fractional warfare (lp store). to build them it's a mix with rig component and t3 component."

9/6/2012,bump bump bump. jack i want to have your baby.
9/6/2012,"i also believe that there should be tiericide for the industrials, and i lean towards idea 1.as for a industrial - freighter midpoint: i would suggest a tech 2 transport with a massive base cargohold and massive cargohold bonuses.the fact that the gallente have five industrials doesn't hurt the idea of specialization at all. rather three of them would be highly specialized, and the other two would be more balanced but still leaning in certain directions. also there would be subtle differences between the races. also few industrials might tend towards flexibility with poor base stats, but a large number of slots, high cpu and pg, (thinking of the sigil with 5 low slots, maybe if it has even more).another concept is to have both tiers and special roles. the minmatar's fast industrial would also be the cheapest and lowest skil requirements (wreathe) and meanwhile the one with the largest hold is expensive and has high skill req (unchanged mammoth. this might reflect the lore that the minmatar have the fastest ships, but a poor economy. meanwhile the gallente have more middle of the road ships on the bottom two, with more specialized ships on higher tiers."
9/6/2012,you know you are a vet when you have seen this proposal resurrected and rehashed at least 3 times.just putting my friendly 'no' vote (again) its just like a character bazaar but worse. will likely spawn people who play 1 year as a certain 'class' then switch up entirely to another one a year later. that essentially 'cheats' the skill system out of another years worth of your subscription money and effort (assuming you take 2 years to skill up both classes)
9/6/2012,"terrible, terrible idea.terrible.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
9/6/2012,"maybe that means you should bug ccp to fix the tutorials, or otherwise make the new player experience better. not ask for a cheat to compensate for a bad tutorial. i think team five 0 is doing good work on this front recently. but in the big picture of things is ... the sp you end up putting into skills after running all the tutorials... is what? like less than 1-2mil? that not that much wasted time. also i didn't find that any skills learned in the security tutorial agent was wasted. i'm curious to know which ones were wasted and would have been better spent making you fit a kestrel properly.you shouldn't assume that just because you took the indy tutorial, then you should be prepared for the security tutorial. they are distinct and independent. remember that some people choose to skip some tutors entirely. (if they wanted to, say, be just a grunt) maybe you should have done that instead of wasting your time and sp with the indy tutorial."
9/6/2012,"i think you need to live with whatever ****ty decision you've made. it's called a ""consequence.""now ****ing deal with it.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
9/6/2012,"no....1.) if i can unlearn a few million skills every year, i can save them and instantly ship into anything i desire at a moments notice.... this is not a good thing.... hell, 700k sp will allow me to train a brand new race from no-ships to frig iv, cruiser iv, and bs iv..... it's another 400k for frig v, 1m for cruiser v, and its 1.6m for bs v. 2.) i can train precep will skills all day long, and then untrain them to pick up nice leadership skills without remapping to charisma, or whatever. this basically allows me to earn those pesky specialty skills 55% faster.... and 2m sp is enough to pick up four basic fleet bonuses to v, or two warfare link bonuses to v. 3.) just because you aren't utilizing a skill now, doesn't mean you didn't gain benefit from that skill in the past.... so you're essentially reaping the rewards of your skillpoints more than once.... also, just because you don't use a skill now doesn't mean you wont use it in the future.... people change careers all the time in eve..... and having a wide variety of skills keeps doors open!"
9/6/2012,"while it sounds like an attractive idea, all it really does is cater to the impatient or lazy. just keep the skills you have and train new ones t hat you want. in a few years you'll wish you had something new to train."
9/6/2012,"k so this is an idea i dont think has been proposed.. ive looked around but hadnt seen anything quite like this so here goes:idea is to create a temporary bounding sphere when the bomb goes off of varying sizes and masses in order to utilise bumping as a tactic in null sec warfare. tech 2 bomb launcher ammo:type 1 - creates a small but extemely heavy temporary bounding sphere upon detonation (1000m radius, 1.5t mass, 5.0sec duration) bomb should have a slow speed and regular flight time to make sniping with this less likely and getting in range more difficult.for example:10sec flight time @ 1,500m/sec (range 15km)type 2 - creates a large but relatively light temporary bounding sphere upon detonation(10000m radius, 200m mass, 2.5sec duration)unsure of bomb characteristics to this, possibly a faster speed and slightly shorter flight time intended to overshoot the enemy and push ships into the damage profile of conventional bombs. for example:7.5sec flight time @ 7500m/sec speed (range 56.25km)"
9/6/2012,i can totally see people using this on their own fleets to gtfo.
9/6/2012,"sure, you can't get it to show the exact ammo type you're using but you can specify, for instance, regular or advanced cruise/projectile/hybrid ammo. that will filter it down maybe three or four results? if you can't put in the effort to look through three or four results then god help you.and the truth is, people have managed without ammo bays and filters up until now. this isn't one of those ""vets have had it harder back in the day"" posts but really.. how much do you want this game to play itself for you?"
9/6/2012,"actually, you can have it show just the exact ammo you want. just type the first three or four letters into the search bar. it's really not that hard to find your ammo if you're willing to just make a modicum of effort."
9/6/2012,i honestly don't get what the op is on about. if i need to change ammo... right click my weapon and select what i want. i don't need to open my cargo... i don't need to rummage through anything i picked up.
9/6/2012,don't know how i missed that. guess i'm not used to the search bar. kudos for you.see people!?

9/6/2012,"hello all,in the five career agents that new players get access to after completing the initial new player arc, each mission has a the standard buttons at the bottom. i would ask that the deny button be removed, as there is no reason to deny the missions in the arcs. i know characters could easily hit the button by accident in haste, and that should change."

9/7/2012,"i fully support an expansion for pi, which will lure more people to the game.but i have two issues with the whole concept:* i disapprove of terraforming in any way, shape or form!* the increased supply of pi would have to be negated by using more and more pi in tech ii (or tech iv, whatever ccp has to work out) manufacturing"
9/7/2012,bump....
9/7/2012,"would love to see u try that and watch 90% of ur fleet end up misaligned, drifting due to inertia and unable to get into warp for longer than if u hadnt have used it."
9/7/2012,actually... the way i see it... if an engagement goes south for your own side you have your own stealth bombers lob a couple of these at your own fleet and capitals... sending everyone flying and giving everyone a chance to warp off to random celestials.btw... have you seen how fast capital ships move when they are ejected from a pos shield? they make interceptors look slow.
9/7/2012,"yahh but neither of my 2 ammo suggestions would work as effectively as pos shields. pos shield r like 60km in diameter roughly, the largest version of mine is like 20km and even with that it'll only launch a bs equivalent to if another bs bumped it by cynoing right ontop of it.the other more brutal one has a diameter of 2km... not exacly much in the vastness of space.. and no where near like a 60km pos shield."
9/7/2012,"i would like to be able to set multiple jobs, for example highlight multiple identical bpc's and then set the jobs. its been too long ccp it cant be that hard"

9/8/2012,topic says it all.why:1. you are not playing the game but yet you still are2. your getting an indirect benefits in many ways and your still not playing the gamei don't realy care how this is dealt with. my solution would be a heavy water fuel bay to the claoks but thats my idea.now lets hear the whines next.
9/8/2012,"there is a search function on this forum. try looking up how often this has come up before starting a new one, otherwise we end up saying the same things as before over and over.just go back and read the old threads (all 30 or so of them in which this gets shot down).""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
9/8/2012,can you come up with a way to do this (removing afk cloaking) that does not hurt active cloakers?so far no one has.
9/8/2012,currently the insurance system is about rewarding you when you are a failure and lose a ship. the insurance system should be removed and replaced with a killing system where you get rewarded for killing the ships.overall there would be less isk being generated because there wouldn't be any 'platinum' insurance. killers would get the base insurance prices.
9/8/2012,"i wholeheartedly agree. there is too much isk in circulation as it is, and baddies need to be punished more."
9/8/2012,"i beleve a system should be in place where that there is instead of there is there being a insuranze system there should be that there is a ""killing system(tm)"", if where u kill and there is a ship you kill that you should then get that ""killing system(tm)"" reward. this reward would be the basic insurance of that ship.ulimtately this will be good , i think."
9/8/2012,the problem with this is amarr and caldari only have 2 haulers. they need moar.
9/8/2012,"as others have said, this has come up before. i have a very complete answer. in fact, the thread title was changed to ""rescinded"" some time afterward. >:}"
9/8/2012,"no becausetrain skills-> want to change entire eve lifestyle-> remaps skills and suddenly instead of max industry/science skills i can fly super caps.the only way for this to work at all is for there to be a remap in which you lose something like 50% of the sp that you remap, so a x5 skill being remapped would yield about 500k sp ( lvl 5 of that skill is about 1mil sp) this means anyone remapping this skill would have lost about 12 days of training. and flipping professions would have a very very large penalty."

9/9/2012,+1would be awesome in so many situations.
9/9/2012,"this might be a small issue but i has bothered the hell out of me for a while now:why are the armor repairer and remote armor repairer pictures the same thing? i mean, this is not an issue when it comes to the tech 1 and tech 2 modules that say large armor repairer or large remote armor repairer... but when it comes to the meta modules, most of the time i cannot tell the difference unless i show info and either read the description or look at the ""variations"" tab. and i figured this shouldn't be an issue seeing as when ti comes to shield booster vs. shield transporter they have different pictures! so why can't the armor counterparts get different pictures, even if it's as simple as adding the arrows from the shield transporter picture to the armor repper picture so that it indicates it's a remote armor module?am i alone in feeling this or has this bothered any one else. i mean, it's a simple picture icon that i'm sure won't take too long to make and install. can we please discuss this and possibly work towards fixing it?-lord rectanus"

9/10/2012,"if you like this idea, please vote for it (the ""thumbs up"" icon) and don't forget to leave a comment. thank you !hello.i already posted a similar message in the features & ideas discussion but i've been told that it deserved to be here too. so i allow myself to suggest it to you, if you don't mind.since i saw the ""smart filters"" that have been added to the inventory window (devblog article), i told myself: ""it would be really cool to also be able to filter the overview window"".i know that overview tabs can be configured the way the player wants them to be but it would be nice to be able to filter the overview in real time. thus, the overview window could have two new filter features : the smart filters and the quick filter box. note that this post now contains other ideas related to the overview window (not only filters).1. smart filtershere is a mockup image that shows what it could look like:"
9/10/2012,"the overview needs love. the things here might be part of the love, but i'd like to see much more love and integration."
9/10/2012,"briliant, absolutely lovable, perfectly perfect, sweet sxy time idea \o/"
9/10/2012,this.
9/10/2012,yes! yes!
9/10/2012,"so i decided to try this ""afk cloaking thing"" that people clearly think is an exploit so i figure i'l get rich doing it.i set my alarm to wake up right after downtime and undock from jita in a stealth bomber with nothing but a cloak eagerly awaiting isk and rage mails saying why they think i am cheating or a bad person.so i warp to a safe and cloak then go back to bed, i woke up with no mails or isk =( so i guess i have to stay there longeri left my computer on till downtime again, didn't touch anything other then chat a bit in corp chat.nothing happened even the next day which i did it again. there seems to be no exploit or issuetherefore, afk cloaking isn't a problem."
9/10/2012,"no, no, and no. ever hear of psychological warfare? well, just cause u never encountered it, doesn't mean its not an effective tactic. grab the enemy by the balls, squeeze reaaal tight... and then u put a cherry on a cake, and put a few cloaked ships afk, in their remaining hq systems.... oh yeah, i can hear their tears in the cold vacuum of space.bad idea, to deny that."
9/10/2012,"yes i have and i want that part of the gameplay be active and not ""have fun with my alt, i'll go make isks elsewhere while you look at my alt there.""see now the key word: active gameplay. which seems to be something ccp also likes.going afk is not active gameplay. i don't mind the cloakers or the people who cloak up and do psychological warfare. it's a real fun part of the game but i hate people who are not playing the game but are still playing the game even though they can be at the mall buying porn films or something else."
9/10/2012,"suphere my reason why id argue its legit with regards to ""active gameplay"" . the corp that is being greefed this way, deserves it. its a valid mechanic. they allowed them self to be in such a situation. it wouldn't be fair for the attacker to ""suffer"" boredom in afk psycho-war. an attacker by that point, has the right to make an enemy suffer, while retaining the flexibility of time to go about their life, and leaving afk boats to discourage the enemy. that right was earned by superior balls&tactics, whatever else to do that.truth is, there are more reasons too. for example, ure in 0 sec, and gate is being camped on both sides. u ether a hunter, an explorer, or maybe even a daring trader in a cloaked indy. the game shouldn't force u to be online for next 50 years the gate be camped. u should be able to go afk, and return later to see if ur chases to make a ran for it, has improved. there are more there it came from. on the other hand, i do agree that cloak needs an effective counter, a way decloak an enemy, some other way then drone swarm, something more dependable. maybe a new anti-cloak probe, or even a special ship that specializes in anti-recon activities... donno.0/"
9/10/2012,"if afk is the problem because they are not playing while ""playing"" thenadd fuel needs to drones so people can't afk missionsadd fuel needs to mining lasers so people can't afk mineadd fees to sit in stations so people can't afk in stationand add an auto log timer so that if you are afk for more than 15 min you get logged out.that should suitably counter all afk activities"
9/10/2012,i think you've provided enough whines for this thread already azrael.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
9/10/2012,"any ""solution"" to afk cloaking needs to be careful not to hurt standard cloak operations.... a cloak is a valid tool for hiding from hostiles, for going afk for several minutes to answer the phone, for . . ..essentially, balancing it would be very hard and difficult to do!!!! add to this, afk cloaking is the only valid manner to counter the nearly-omniscient local chat that is used as an intel tool. addressing afk cloaking without addressing ""local chat"" is like banning legal gun ownership without addressing the high crime rate, or demanding abstinence only education without addressing teen pregnancy, or banning abortion without addressing incest, ****, or legitimate medical concerns..."
9/10/2012,"my god, is this arguement really going on again?just give it up. there is nothing wrong with afk cloakies. if they're afk then they can't hurt you, if they're not then they would suffer fromt he stupid ideas people come up with the hurt the afk ones.just give it up. there is nothing wrong with afk cloakies."
9/10/2012,"did you know that in almost a decade of eve online, not a single person has died to an afk cloaker?"
9/10/2012,no.
9/10/2012,"1.) assembly hall is for well thought out ideas that are ready to be brought to the csm's attention.... 2.) you're proposal is a bit vague on details... who gets paid for blowing up a ship?? do you get paid for blowing up your own ship (cause that's what the insurance system currently is)?? do you get paid for blowing up someone elses ship (how would this lessen the insurance faucet)??? are you only addressing semantics, or what is your idea???"
9/10/2012,bump for justice.
9/10/2012,"why do they need more? why does gallente need 5?each race would be good with 2 haulershauler 1. fast agile small tank and small cargo hold, invention to cloaky transport shiphauler 2 slow tanky and large hold, invention to stab transport ship"
9/10/2012,"ticks all the boxes for a good change.simple, uncontroversial and (probably) easy to implement.ship it."

9/11/2012,"thank you for participating in this forum, betoli.i am ready to accept suggestions to make it more integrated but i don't see how i could do it more. let's start brainstorming. by ""more integrated"", would you like it to be less visible or you would like it to have more options, maybe ?when the smart filters menu is not expanded, it doesn't take much space (and the quick filter box is still available) :"
9/11/2012,very good +++1
9/11/2012,"elegant, simple, easy to do, and a vast vast improvement in usefulness.+1"
9/11/2012,"there's been some good ideas in f&i and one or two really comprehensive ones. do a search.... and on the old forums?the overview is the most important ui element in the game - its also the crapest - and it takes up most space. there are so many things wrong with it, its hard to know where to start, but ccp's approach is generally to go at something comprehensively - the risk is that in doing the odd tweak they won't touch it again for years.much more should be graphical. we should not be limited to one (for example i could have a single column celestial view, next to my detailed pvp view) tabs are far too annoying, and unintuitive to set up (with consequences for getting it wrong). it is the epitome of spreadsheets in space. configurable buttons column for common actions appropriate for each object (linked to tab settings), you should never need to right click. take cans - what do i ever do with them - approach and open. so my cans setting should have those two buttons in the button column. other people might want warp-to and orbit for cans too. ewar doesn't live in a proper column, so you can't move it to the front, and there is a risk it gets pushed out of view if your not careful. colour icons, user definable icons - i want to be able to identify classes of ship easily - i want to use icon x for interceptors and icon y for logi. a simple pattern match against ship type to set the icon, or the default ones for no matches. a single interface should cover scan/d-scan (with a range slider as a filter), the controls should be in a collapseable panel (like your filters) and results merge with the normal ones in the main table with colouring or some other indicator of where it came from. bookmarks..... tactical overlay should link in and provide more (velocity vectors, ability to show multiple modules ranges, follow my overview tabs settings), colouring. my main look and feel wish would be to draw it on space without a window - a title bar is pointless, so are the spreadsheet lines, so is the visible window frame. when transparent it should really be transparent - i need to have it full height in case lots of stuff pops up, but when lots of stuff isn't there it takes up half my screen looking fugly. tabs are really fugly angular velocity to 8 significant figures? really? ever see the last one change by itself? why can't i have a visual speed bar from zero to 'fast' for the velocities (i need to be able to set the definition of 'max', and i'd like it to change colour according to my thresholds - be handy to have a visual cue when something is racing at me at 4000m/s and see when something comes into tracking range without breaking my eyes every time) columns are always filled in even though data for that column might be pointless - e.g. type for spaceships is handy, the type column for stargates - well, err i can see the icon thanks! this adds to the spreadsheet feel and clutters up the display. option to collapse alliance/corp into one item threshhold values for colour/blink highlighting - someone approaching rapidly, someoneone within my guns tracking (as above), at warp distance, at gun distance .... everything visual + detail for when you need the detail. columns should go away completely when there is nothing in them - say tags - why do i even have a tags column visible when there are no tags set can't it just work this out and hide the column completely? and now your filter suggestion too :-) 1000 papercuts ..... ? more like a billion. needs a complete redesign"
9/11/2012,"i like the idea, i do, but allow me to play the devil here for a bit:eve does not currently calculate weapon trajectory. when you fire your guns at a target, the game rolls a hit dice to determine if you hit it or not. having each shot physically simulated is just not possible with current generation computing, the servers would melt. what could work now, is if you have to target a friendly, and activate this new module on the friendly target. each ciws module would afford a certain level of damage mitigation to the friendly ship, and you would need to fit a full rack of the ciws to protect more ships. it would also mean that the aegis ships couldn't protect themselves, since it doesn't generate a bubble of protection."
9/11/2012,+1 we needed this from the beginning of fleets
9/11/2012,[proposal] do not allow new post with the words afk cloaker in the title or opening post.
9/11/2012,ccp should provide star trek tricorder scanning for life signs in front of the monitor. if they are none the cloak would disengage automatically.
9/11/2012,they have those now... sort off.nowhere near as compact and multipurpose.
9/11/2012,"oh boy it's another nullbear cry thread.if you want the rewards of nullsec, deal with the risks, baby.requiring fuel or cap usage would destroy legitimate, active cloaking and extended recon deployments. it's a terrible idea, simply awful. ps: here's a list of things afk cloakers have never, and can never, do:make a single iskprovide intel for their fleetkill someoneshut down a system or in any other way prevent you from doing whatever you wanttake your battered psyche and go back to hello kitty online if the mere presence of another player scares you so bad"
9/11/2012,"no.while they are cloaked and afk, they can't hurt you. why? because they are afk.show us on the doll where the bad afk cloaker touched you.htfu or gtfo.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
9/11/2012,"these afk cloaker whiner threads are a staple of eve-o. every post bashing the notion just gives birth to new fanatic illogical posters on both sides. and there are those like me, who get in just because i like the sound of my own voice... err typing. :)"
9/11/2012,"ok: if someone has something in this game that you don't have that you consider some kind of unfair advantage, the answer isn't to try to get it taken from them. the answer is to go for that thing yourself. praxis astra master of assassins and punctuality"
9/11/2012,"i started playing eve because it was a pvp game (apparently) now i'm only a month or so in the game so i haven't experienced most of what the game or even high-sec has to offer, i want to pvp but it's my understanding that by going to low-sec and pvping i will be locked out of high-sec, so now i have to wait until i've experienced everything high-sec has to offer before moving on to low-sec and risking lock out.how does this benefit this so-called pvp game?end of the day it's likely i will never get a chance to properly experience low-sec or 0.0 because i will be bored before getting to that point, with these proposed changes i could go pvp tonight, lose everything, gain experience and then come back to high-sec and continue exploring and learning the game at my own pace while building up resources for my next pvp session. it's hard to disagree with these changes in my opinion.the only reason i don't pvp is because i am punished for doing so, remove that please.in short, punishing people for pvping in a part of a pvp game that is meant to for people to pvp in is... strange, counter-productive and really spoiling my day."
9/11/2012,"crap idea. ""i want this little bit of space for my play-style at the expense of everyone else's"", when what you really want is a bit of 0.0 without bubbles and a few more npc stations?"
9/11/2012,"congrats to all who took part in this successful campaign and thank you to everyone for their efforts. ccp's art department remains the best in the world and they listen too.check out the new frills in this devblog.i wonder if they're aware of the desire for the return of the federation navy comet's flashy light and the vexor's ""face""?..."

9/11/2012,"why can't we have spawns in the belts that target a specific ship based on size, duration in the belt.for instance -a hulk in the ice field would spawn a much larger rat than a frigate in the asteroid belts. the spawns can become tougher and more frequent the longer the ship remains. if the pilot warps off, the spawn should not re-target the next ship but also warp away.ideas? suggestions?i really wish i'd listened to what my mother told me when i was young."" ""why, what did she tell you?"" ""i don't know, i didn't listen."""
9/11/2012,"while tiericide of industrials makes some sense..... i don't consider it a priority.... if we were to tiericide it, i would expect a few variations: 1.) the max hauler... paper thin, and gets bonuses to hauling capacity with each indy level... 2.) the armored transporter.... much lower hauling capacity, and gets bonuses to tanking with each indy level... 3.) the agile transporter... medium haul, medium tank, bonuses to agility per indy level... again, this is not a priority! and no matter what they do, the max hauler when setup for maximum hauling should have a pisspoor tank (<10k ehp), and the armored transporter should have significantly less hauling capacity (30%). make it a choice on which to use, and don't protect the stupid from themselves!!!"

9/12/2012,i support this.
9/12/2012,"when it comes right down to it, the loss of any member of eve generally brings some type of sadness form the community while we all might feel contempt for the goons, vile rat was a goon unlike any other he fostered diplomacy in eve (okay okay, i realize diplomacy in eve is a little silly, especially with regards to the goons), but beyond that he worked with the united states state department to foster diplomacy between the united states and other nations if that isn't enough, he worked on the csm, attempting diplomacy between the players and ccp itselfthe man is probably the most diplomatic person in the history of evei think it would be appropriate in that regard to erect a memorial for vile rat his in-game persona and real life persona were one-in-the-same in many respects it is not every day that eve loses a man who has such a weight on his shoulders, and when he is killed trying to foster friendship and diplomacy over the world, it deserves special recognitionleadership is something you learn maybe one day, you'll learn that"

9/13/2012,wow.. betoli. that's a long list of suggestions.i don't know where to start to create a mockup with all these ideas.. :)
9/13/2012,i saw a double overview suggestion somewhere but this is sooooooo much better.+1.1 ^ 9000
9/13/2012,"i'd help, but i'm made of photoshop fail :-("
9/13/2012,"seems reasonable to have a dedicated gas miner. shabby to have a mining ship with combat bonuses on it...seems kind of hack. nothing like a company coming in to do a job with a jury-rigged, improvised piece of machinery. if its that important a job, someone will have made a dedicated tool for it. maybe high sec gas amber mikocerosin for drugs isn't all that important to most, but when your in null or worse, in a wh looking over your shoulder while pulling out clouds for t3 ship production, every second counts. a couple extra minutes of d-scan checking can mean be the difference between survival and profit, or death and revenue loss.noctis didn't ruin the game, just made cleaning up easier. lowered the prices, not by much, of buying meta equipment cheaper for us maybe. there was a need and people built a ship to meet that need. reflections of real life...there are people who mine gas for a living. gas is the one frontier of mining that i feel ccp could do more in. i like the idea of creating a t2 version of the noctis model to give gas bonuses to. or a whole new ship. the criticism i have heard about it is kind of limp, the argument is basically...'i don't mine or mine gas, so it's something the game doesn't need'. so far seen some maller fits, domi fits, ferox fits, and a scad of other renovated ships that just do an 'adequate' job at bringing in nebulas to market. i am not saying to make replicas of all three barges, (one for durability, cargo, and yeild) just saying nice to have a ship built for the job. and believe it or not, if your flying a t3 like a tengu or a loki, someone risked thier lives and crew to get the gas for your level 4 mission run or gate camp.<U+FFFD>you see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig.<U+FFFD>i dig.<U+FFFD> - clint eastwood, misquote."
9/13/2012,"i've been pod killed so many times that i've lost all grasp on the human condition. my current incarnation is just a small and temporary mechanism that serves a greater immortal will. life and death are a seamless continuum to me, so why is it that even on the fanciest of machines, when i die the first thing i usually notice is my evemail flash informing me that a new clone has been activated, meanwhile my screen has already begun to load the station ship-spinner, or! if you are one of those damn hippies like me who run captains quarters because they like the whole 'seamless' thing ccp was going for despite the obvious shortcomings of incarna, then you find yourself standing upright in your quarters like ""wtf dude..."". not very seamless.so ccp, how about we stay up late one night and come up with something a little cooler than that. i know you guys could come up with an awesome way to die. i would also wager that you could improve the seamlessness of the life/death experience without demanding more from the machines/slowing your battle against lag.i'd love to see my pod split open and a frozen corpse fly out with goo crystalizing and all that, but hell, i'll take a kind of visual effect where you see it explode like most any other ship and then your screen narrows to tunnel vision like you're being pulled away like tony gonzales describes in eve empyrean age. something, anythinhighsec is owned by players now. systems 0.5-1.0 are new order territory. all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code. mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community. see www.minerbumping.com"

9/13/2012,"nothe intent for this is to create a single memorial commemorating the death of a man who fought not only for his beloved internet spaceships, but also attempted to foster friendship through diplomacy in real life sure, people die all the time but what makes this man any different and more important than other players?he died in a senseless attack, while trying to make the world a better placemaybe i'm being insensitive, but i see no reason to erect a memorial for random people who have done nothing more than play this game and then passed on sean smith is a huge exception, because of the way he lived, and the way he diedleadership is something you learn maybe one day, you'll learn that"
9/13/2012,"it isnt just to say one person is more important than another just like sean, an average player who died is just as important to to a family , friends, or a group just as sean was to histhe statue itsself can be a statue of sean's in game character followed with a short yet memorable description of him followed by a saying something like ""here lies those who have passed on "" then ensue a list of namescreating a statue for one person only incites jealousy and envy , then youll get people petitiong ccp to create a statue for everyone individually"

9/13/2012,"i will continue to support a memorial to sean ""vile rat"" smith a null system named vr-rip would be perfect i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about"
9/13/2012,"you have the right idea, but i think youre taking ideas the wrong way the purpose behind creating a statue for those who have passed on is to simply remember if this statue were to be created and names were listed it would show that to someone out there he/she was significant your basing a persons importance off what they did in life, thats not how life works for example you are not more important than me because you got an a on your test while i got a b, we carry the same significance to someone out there as we are both humans there are statues of people in real life , for instance, martin luther king sattues, abraham lincoln statues although the statue is of a single individual the description and text on the statue speaks for all if you want to get technical about why the statue shouldnt soley be for one person ,well thats becasue youd have people constantly petitioniong ccp to have a statue erected in game in the name of someone they cared about one statue of sean in game can be a memorial for all i dont need to personally list what ive done in life and how i have served my community , im not vain like that edit: other people agree or are sharing the same view as i am this copy and paste will show ""if we do it for this departed soul, it sets a precedent to be done for others i don't think it is appropriate or necessarythere are many players in eve who help shape what it is today, not just a select few""^^ that sums up basically what i said or is a better version of waht im trying to get across"
9/13/2012,+1a memorial for vile rat is both appropriate and necessary
9/13/2012,"+1wherever it ends up, as long as we have onei think the memorial to other people is a good idea, should have its own thread and separate petition though as this one is for vile"
9/13/2012,"i'm doing it all the time and still i think it's !""#<U+FFFD>%!""#<U+FFFD>% retarted that no one has a chance to get me while doing it."
9/13/2012,"then you have a terrible understanding of game balance. afk cloakers are incapable of any kind of action what-so-ever, for other players to be able to affect them while they themselves are incapable of doing anything is utterly stupid. it's the most basic level game balance imaginable.not to mention the fact that all these stupid, stupid ideas about cap/fuel needs, probes to find cloakies, etc would cause even bigger imbalances when it comes to holding/capturing territories in null. it is essential for a dynamic, healthy environment that cloaking exist and allow you such protections (at the sacrifice of absolutely all your own offensive capabilities).and last but not least, it would utterly destroy wormhole space.additionally, you didnt address the points we've raised about how your terrible ideas would ruin legitimate, active cloaking roles.so to summarise: stop crying. man up or go back to hisec, you terrible nullbear.i respect hisec bears more than you, at least they admit they are risk averse and choose a gameplay style that suits that, rather than crying to change all styles of gameplay to suit their carebear ways while masquerading as pvpers"
9/13/2012,"i don't realy care do you respect me or not and even if you don't no one cares :dand to address something... i tossed the idea of fuelbays in. it's not an terrible idea and i don't need to think about the balance nor do you. ccp needs to, if they are willing to implement something like that into the game. and lets face it. ccp is also saying afk playing is bad.so i see afk cloaking as a bad thing and thats my point of view and i presented one option to address it. if you see it as a good thing cause you want to jack off while playing. well thats fine. but stop yelling stupid stupid stupid if you don't have anything else to say."
9/13/2012,"what happens if two or three csm members go inactive at one time?i don't see this as being very useful, while being a good idea to present, it can be easily avoided by an educated player base electing persons with a solid track record. not just voting for the first nominee who spams their inbox with propaganda.too bad we do not live in a perfect world.edit: inafternecrorealization"
9/13/2012,"the thing that struck be about eve when i first began to play is that the distances between celestial is actually correct - everything measures in au's, all that stuff is really great for immersion.if there were one thing that i would really like to see changed, one easy little thing, is to have asteroids rotate. in rl all asteroids rotate - some fast, some slow, all natural or derelict objects rotate in space.perhaps the same scripts that make ship debris rotate (at things like magnetotronic sites) can be applied asteroids.i would also propose that the destroyed player ship debris clouds are sized to correspond with the ship size, and expand over time. finally, and here is the big one...you may or may not noticed that planets do not rotate, stations do not orbit moons, moons do not orbit planets, and planets do not orbit suns. i get the same view in my 'home station' a day from now, a year from now, and 2 years from now!i have heard some argue that it would be a coding nightmare...well perhaps. perhaps the celestials can change position during downtime. but for gates and stations there are these areas in solar systems called lagrange points, where the gravitational pull is neutral...certainly this rl mechanic could be used in some way in the game.i feel that if the game is to evolve eventually celestial orbits will need to be addressed.now there is one other issue, and i would appreciate the input. but are the backdrops realistic? perhaps there are areas of space where its just lit up like crazy! we've seen such pictures from the hubble telescope - perhaps this is more of an intellectual discussion rather than a proposal for ccp to change the backdrops in any way."
9/13/2012,look at how the front has these sunken parts with lights under them... like the hurricane! brilliant!

9/14/2012,i believe there will be a donation drive setup with funds going directly to vr's family. details will more than likely get posted once everything is setup and ready to go.
9/14/2012,i hope so.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
9/14/2012,"i will donate. the loss of such a player is a great sadness. it takes a special type of person to put themselves in harms way for the shallow hope that prejudice and hatred of any type can be overcome with an open hand and a good heart. i don't believe either side is free of blame in this, i simply say that those lost had good intent in their hearts for when the opportunity was available for it. i have always taken pride in my membership in eve and whether it was playing in lowsec or trying my hand at nation building i have never wished harm on another player (podding, pvp and the occasional destruction of an alliance notwithstanding) outside of the game. i count my self lucky to have eve friends on every continent and in many countries and hope that one day we can work as a planet to get out into space.salut vile rat, you will be missed and remembered. eve also should have a t-shirt for him."
9/14/2012,i will donate.rest in peace vile rat.
9/14/2012,"not so much a hope as the time for the technical people to set it up and his family to mourn (as they would have input). i would expect to see something in probably 2 weeks. until then be patient, it will happen but it takes time."
9/14/2012,player created monuments should be permitted sovereignty should be required
9/14/2012,"nope anti-sign no special treatment for specific individuals, thanks"
9/14/2012,"i see were you are coming form...i do not agree that planets and moons should rotate as it would not have any signifigant effect on the game.however, i do think that planets and moons should orbit the sun and so forth.this would make is so people would have to change bookmarks often,and if they are adding the ability to place poses anywhere in space, it would be interesting if you could put it in orbit around the sun as a planet does.i dunno, but i do believe that adteriods do actually orbit and move in mining belts...i think that to have moons and planets rotate is a bit meh, but having them acually orbit would be cool."
9/14/2012,"the static state of eve is an old mechanic from a 2003 game. things should move. large object lightly at down time. belts, except for 1.0 and maybe 0.9 space, should be discovered. that spot you saved for mining should expire. logistics for pi shouldn't be static. nor should trade routes. extra long jumps shouldn't always be there, nor should extra short ones."
9/14/2012,hmm extra long jumps vs extra short ones? you mean from solar system to system? or within system? or are you talking about some kind of 'stellar drift' that changes how a gate may work?
9/14/2012,"while i would like the realism of moving planets, i don't see the need. and even moreso, i really fear the implementation... the thing i fear most, is my bm collection getting very messed up... i spent many, many, many hours creating bookmarks in regions of space i regularly visit, and i know a lot of other people that have too. i use bookmarks to safely move between gates, to rat in asteroid belts, to hide by pos's, for jump bridges, to dock, to undock, to safely collect pi, for safespots, for obnoxious safespots, for .... i could go on, but i have thousands of bm's (mostly in null) that i have spent a lot of time making, and they are something i use regularly. i'd be very unhappy if suddenly these all became worthless because someone thought it would be cool to rotate the planetary positions within the solar system."
9/14/2012,most amusing! implementing such a mechanic may result in the loss of less bookmarks than you might think. esp if every bookmark is anchored relative to any given celestial or station.the bookmarks in empty space (between gates) could stay where they are. many gates could stay where they are if they are on stationary lagrange points. those gates that are in orbit around planets would have to be consistent with the mechanic though. the gates that do change position would have to be re-oriented to face the proper direction.perhaps when you drop a bookmark one could choose between anchoring it to a celestial or dropping it 'free floating'.you may or may not be aware that station positioning is going to be changed up by ccp sometime in the next year - no anchoring is what i heard. you may loose your bookmarks anyway.if you follow the principles of gravity then all objects in a solar system are affected by other objects in some way - they all orbit or are affected by orbits.anyway - asteroids should rotate! lol

9/15/2012,interesting idea. not sure if i would like for it to be a freighter class ship though.
9/15/2012,for it to be capable of transporting the amount of cargo that 3-4 battleships would take up it needs to be.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
9/15/2012,"eve is another universe/dimension n which space has the same properties as water.therefore, eventually, things stop spinning."
9/15/2012,"if its anchored relative to a celestial, its a null change and there is little point. bms that are created near a non-celestial orbiting object, would expire almost immediately because something orbiting a celestial is moving as many km/s relative to the celestial. that change would effectively mean you couldn't use bookmarks at gates or stations or a pos, if the orbits followed keplers laws. so you would have to have bookmarks relative to *any* object - which in turn makes it a null change to gameplay. the aesthetic value would be quite nice, its odd that undocking from a station always presents the celestials in the same place. undocking from balginia i have always had the sun directly in my eyes, day after day, year after year. it would also mean that inter-gate distances changed with time - which would be cool.the change applied to asteroid belts (no bm relative to a belt) would be good, and making all belts have to be scanned would improve gameplay, hurt bots, and add a much needed dimension to mining."
9/15/2012,"ok, if i am following you correctly i think you mean that since all bookmarks are anchored relative to a station, moon, pos, etc, then it really makes no difference to gameplay after implementation. yes i think those bookmarks can be saved. its the ones that are out in the middle of nowhere that cannot (logically) last since they are relative to, well nothing. so safes far away from anything, they might get all jacked up for this. it sure would hurt bots! however i can already hear the miners screaming bloody murder - plus all their cargo cans might get lost unless they are 'anchored to the field'."
9/15/2012,"im pretty new at this game and in the community so the topic im raising my be some old news. im curious whether any thought has been given to a custom color editor for ships, or if we will see something other than the four major empire logos on them? even something as simple as a corp logo would be a welcome change."
9/15/2012,"not to be rude... but please do a forum search before posting a topic/idea/concern here (or in f&i). and no... being ""new"" is not an excuse to not run a search.yes... corp logos and possible ship coloration is being worked on... no, we don't have a timetable... no, we don't know what it will look like... no, we don't know what limitations it will have."

9/16/2012,"i knew nothing of vile rat. i know of him in name only. while i have an absolute loathing of goonswarm, as does most of the eve community, vile rat served his country and paid the debt that all men pay. regardless of his character's actions in game, this plex drive is in the service of the moral high ground. vile rat left behind a family. not an internet family but a real, living, breathing family who have lost him. in the spirit of what jack carrigan is trying to accomplish here, i urge everyone to donate upon ccp's approval. this does not happen often within our community and i pray that it does not start to happen often. no matter what happens in the game, or how vile rat may have wronged you inside it, it's still just pixels on a screen. what happened to him was real. it doesn't get more real than this."
9/16/2012,"so there is a lack of low-sec specific activities, and i came up with one that may work:i propose that in 0.1-0.3 systems there be a new pos module, the corpse rendering unit. this unit will enable users with the nessicary skills to process corpses of capsleers with a % chance to recover implants contained within. this should not be an easy activity, it should be very difficult to recover said implants and hardwirings. there should be 2 skills, one for implants, one for hardwirings, and each should be a 5x skill, under the industry category, with a prereq of industry 5 and anchoring 5 to help ensure these are less likely to be throw-away alt charachter. each level should grant a 5% chance of recovery, i.e. 5% at 1, 25% at 5. this is per implant, if someone had 5 implants, you would have a 25% chance of recovering each implant. this would make it probable enough to recover implants so as to be profitable, not so probable as to place too much negative pressure on the implant/hardwiring market.the thing is is that this is a repugnant activity in all empires, and carries with it a significant loss of sec status. it also must be done in a pos, as no station owner would allow it within their station. it would be limited to low-sec, the home of pirates and scofflaws in eve. it would bring profit seekers to low sec, and keep them there as their sec status drops. of course, it would require a new pos mod and 2 new skills. of course this activity is not condoned by any law-abiding institution, so these would be dropped in low-sec pirate anomolies, bringing more activity to low sec. this also will open up a niche-market for corpses. of course, with no way of knowing what implants were in what corpse, this would be a risky market indeed, prone to scams and other ""buyer beware"" activities, all of which increase conflict in eve."

9/16/2012,"just responding to say, shahfluffers doesnt mean to sound rude, but alot of people ahve a tendency to beat the dead horse in proposals that have already been brought up multiple times.eve has been around for almost 10 years, you can bet everything that could ever possibly be sugested has been, the issue is time and technology, for instance, with custom colors. lets say you have 50 harbingers on field, rigth nw the server only has to keep track and send data about 50 dots labeled harbinger, your computer can generate the image itself, now if these harbies have custom colours, well, now the server not only has to keep track of location and combat information, but it has to store and distribute that information to clients in the battlefield.now this may nt seem like a big issue, i mean hey ""its only a little extra data"", but take into account 50,000 players in multiple systems, as well as ships sitting idle in pos's that would have customs, and the server starts to ahve to carry alot more data than it used to, and with a game that has to tick in 1-second intervals to function properly (and then can still have issues with alrger fights), this can quickly become a game breaking deal. and that is why many ""features"" in eve are spread apart by months or eyars of development, adn then still have bugs for a long time, ccp works on them, bt there is a lot of issues wit coding and server-load that can creep up with things like this.so in conclusion, use the forum search engine, and show your support in those threads, not many ideas are new or innovative enough to warrant a new thread, all ideas will be considered and given dev attention at some point, just some not as soon as others.(like us wh players have ben waiting for corp/pos revamp since wh's came out)"

9/17/2012,"smilingvagrant, this could be one of the smart filters, yes.as for me, i would like to see a difference between empty wrecks and full wrecks (to be able to select these words as filters for the smart filters menu). to do this, i guess ccp devs will have to add, on the ""type"" column of the overview. a new description for wrecks to differentiate them."

9/17/2012,"interesting ideas butthis is not really how aegis works. as i type this i am sitting in combat systems maintenance central on board an east cost based arleigh burke -class destroyer currently deployed to the middle east.aegis allows aegis equipped ships to share information with other ship (not necessarily aegis ships) and to fire defensively and offensively from that data. the problem is there is no real reason to do this with a few exceptions and most of the time we are not close enough to other ships for this to be practical . some of this may not make sense because i will have to leave out some classified stuff that limits aegis. if aegis detects a vampire (inbound missile) it will find a firing solution and depending on the ships weapons posture will automatically fire an evolved sea sparrow missile (essm) to intercept it, or the essm will be command launched by a watch stander. if the essm misses or for some reason does not kill the vampire then super rapid blooming off-board chaff (srboc) will fire and the close in weapons system (ciws) will get it. for offensive we have the sm-2 standard missile for surface targets and the block ""c"" and ""d"" tomahawk missiles for longer range strike packages. now for the classified omission: for reason i cannot discuss we cannot in practice shoot off of another ships data unless we are out of missiles (not likely to happen) if a technical problem prevents us from shooting off of our own data, that same problem will prevent us from using another ships data and that's all i can say about that.so in summery the biggest advantage of aegis is allowing aegis ships to share data (primarily from the an/spy-1 3 dimensional air search radar) with other ships allowing the battle group to use that combined data ""see"" the strategic picture covering thousands of square miles. and to use that data to plan; air strikes from carriers, tomahawk missile strikes from vls equipped ships, assist in deployment of marines, and overall fleet defense because knowledge is power.oh we also have vertically launched (vls) anti-submarine rockets (asroc) for offensive and defensive anti-submarine warfare (think torpedo deployed by a rocket)arleigh burke class destroyer"
9/17/2012,"and that is unfortunate. i think i got podded 3 time my first day in eve (ok so i'm a slow learner) i like this idea as long as it does not slow me down too much getting back in a ship. though you are correct getting podded is not supposed to be a positive experience and should cause some amount of a sinking feeling (other than isk loss)to the new guy though, a discussion about what to expect when he gets podded and how it happens to me more then most ... i mean how it happens to everyone and that when they do get podded that the best response it to get back in a ship but learn from the experience;what did you do right?what did you do wrong?what can you change/improve upon to get podded less often?"
9/17/2012,"yes, i agree that it should be a traumatic experience, and if anything i hope they make it even more gruesome and jarring. i'd even love to see your clone step out of it's little re-animation pod, bald headed, and redo your haircut and clothes joins the list of things you routinely do after you're reborn, including update your clone and buy new implants.highsec is owned by players now. systems 0.5-1.0 are new order territory. all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code. mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community. see www.minerbumping.com"
9/17/2012,"while i'm ok with a 20s animation showing my clone activating, i'm not ok with being forced to redo hair and clothing options... which takes considerably longer. *edit* i typically want to reship and get back into the fight after i die... and don't want any significant slowdowns tbh..."
9/17/2012,"well, yeah let me clarify, your portrait should stay the same, but in the quarters it might be fun to still be pod-bald, maybe just until you walk over to the mirror and click the 'set appearance to portrait settings' button or whatever. but yeah, agreed, the whole thing shouldn't take very long.highsec is owned by players now. systems 0.5-1.0 are new order territory. all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code. mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community. see www.minerbumping.com"
9/17/2012,"i'd support a full movie the first time any character on an account was podded (or docked in a ship with cq turned on), in order to establish the immersion. after that, make it a short cutscene that's there to hide the loading screen, so there's no slowdown.[edit: and add an option to the esc menu to disable (or re-enable) the movie, in case an existing player starts a new account and they don't want to see the full cutscene again.]"

9/17/2012,nullsec should not be risk free. one of the risks we deal with in nullsec is afk cloakers. here's an idea. fit up an interceptor and learn to catch them on the way in. if they are using nullified t3's learn to use hictors with infinipoints.
9/17/2012,"tbh, nothing is wrong with afk cloakers. as stated in this thread, they cant hurt you when they afk.

9/17/2012,there's way more than 30 threads about this topic. unless you accidentally forgot the 'k' after the number.
9/17/2012,"1.) i don't think their is datapath that correlates the 100's of corpses in my general freight container to the implants they had when i made the pod pilot a corpse. 2.) 25% chance of recovery per implant is quite a high percentage, and would definitely modify the implant market... this is actually the lp market that's getting hurt.... most of the corpses i make have at least 2 implants in them... and many, many have much more. 3.) this has been proposed before... and you should, of course, do a forum search on the topic, and at least link the relevant threads. look at the pros and cons in them."

9/17/2012,the grid system wouldn't fare well with moving celestials.
9/17/2012,why? in 2012 we can predict the orbital paths of most objects within meters. are you suggesting that our computer couldn't automatically compensate for normal celestial motion in the 17th millenium?
9/17/2012,"each grid or bubble near celestials, asteroid fields, and bases would have to move every day. to be sure it would be a pretty interesting puzzle of trigonometry. a system would go in effect for each celestial object and bookmarks would have to be set on coordinates based on this.for example, amarr v, moon 4 has a bookmark at 21.2 km from its origin at 123.29 by 184.6 degrees. so if moon 4 moves, the bookmark is still on vector(?) 123.29 by 184.6 degrees at 21.2 km.same would apply to undocks on stations etc. i would suspect that a 'safe' in the middle of nowhere would have to use the sun as a reference, unless perhaps specified differently by the player.maybe interplanetary navigation or anchoring should be a skill associated with bookmarking at some level. earth bookmarked without being anchored would be correct only once a year!"
9/17/2012,"i understand your adversity to going to lowsec. there are many other ways to experience pvp without going to lowsec, and now you even have faction warfare which doesn't affect your security status. one could even argue that the faction warfare changes have addressed the difficulties that this proposal addresses (although not all of them).there's wardecs and merc groups in highsec (red vs blue, moar tears, etc).you can also fight people who are criminals (minus 5 or more sec status) in lowsec or anywhere without taking the sec status hit.i just really think the falloff from high to low is too steep a cliff. there should be some areas where concord's protection is 'iffy', or npc empire faction's navies or rapid response teams provide limited protection."

9/18/2012,ummmm... we already have lore regarding rogue drones. the gallente created them by accident (in their efforts to create an automated drone defense fleet) and they broke all efforts the contain them. laws were then passed to prevent it from happening again.this also explains why automation on ships is limited./digressioncarry on.
9/18/2012,there is no such thing as a 'local gravitational field'.
9/18/2012,"the idea of rogue planets is an interesting one. even more-so though, that for every star you can see in the sky there are about 4 red dwarf stars that you cannot see! these red dwarf stars are also the oldest of all the stars. drake himself (you know drake equation) beleives that there is at least (if not more) as much chances of life existing in these red dwarf systems as any other.ok one other thing that gets me and just slightly bothers me...in rl from the orbit of neptune, and pluto, our sun looks like a really bright yellow star. in eve, when you fly to the outer edges of a system the sun is always the same size and brightness, unless you fly right up to it when its big. what gives?"

9/19/2012,"it's lowsec, right? why not just implement a way to 'buy up' your sec status? interstellar credits greasing the filthiest of palms in some seedy spacestation bar should be enough to get your sec status right with the law. it's a simple mechanic they could implement and even tie in with some walking in stations (to get that bull**!t looking like it's half worth it to have in the game, and not just a forgotten remnant of the failure of incarna). come on already ccp- make lowsec the coolest place ingame and it will change the whole landscape (spacescape?) of play."
9/19/2012,"as the title says, it would be interesting i think to have wormholes with statics based on specific ""geographic"" regions. i also suggest this sort of thing to be done in order to buff null/nerf high sec and cause more people to go out where the risk is greater."
9/19/2012,"how would doing anything to wormholes ever buff null? last time null tried to wormhole, they got smacked back to null with a couple less capitals and t3's.also, the complete randomness, any hole can go to anywhere, si waht makes wormholes dynamic, if we started separatingt hem into geographic regions, then it would bcome to easy for allaicnes to spread out and lock down an entire wh chain with caps and towers, and be able to ferry supplies because they know there are only x possibilities that their new hole can go to, and almost all will be friendly.no, i like being able to pop a new hole everyday, pay a visit to our temporary neighbors, andjump their site-ships, then have the wh closed ebhind us, then rinse/repeat/kill/repeat/etc.unless you actually meant separating where wormholes appear based on k-space sec staus? if so then thats a huge no, because most wormhole alliances rely on that 1/500 hs wormhole in their c5/c6/static in order to ferry supplies in, making majority wormholes only open in null for your ""buff"" would indeed buff null, by making wormholes and nearly all t3 production part of null, sicne no one else would be able to get supplies in order to live in them anymore."
9/19/2012,"i mean providing a static c1 to maybe c3 per region/constelation that can link to other ""non region"" wormholes (like the ones we have now) would make a nice link between the two. this way, you can have 0.0 corps settle into wormhole space, but it would only be a c1-c3...so at the end of the day they still have to come to guys like you if they want real profit. but there is a window for them. right now if you want to be in a wh you are either in a wh or you are not. it's not very easy to bounce between one or the other. a c1-c3 regional static wh wouldn't make it much easier. it wouldn't make wh ""just another part of 0.0"" but it would provide more encounters between whs and 0.0 entities buffing 0.0 more.i think this should also be done in conjunction with doing something to make high sec less profitable. you have entities that make billions easily all in the safe confine of high sec, where as in 0.0 you are always at risk. mining ships got buffed and if you are marginally intelligent you won't ever die in hs."

9/20/2012,"once upon a time eve was a fine place for pvp. then they introduced jump bridges, warp to 0km, sanctums and interdiction nullifiers. if you living in 0.0, you already know how easy to grind isk unharmed with absolutely zero risk.for the rest of the people:step 1: get into a large alliance.step 2: get a drake.step 3: go to a system where you have a lot of sanctums and an online pos.step 4: put the local chat in a big window in the middle of your screen.step 5: if local is clear start to rat in a nice fluffy sanctum.step 6: if you see anything other than blue in the local window press: warp to pos then goto step 5.even if you are a totally stupid idiot you can still avoid being caught. the only way to counter this level of carebearness is semi-afk cloaking. logon traps, fast jumps in, directional scans are way too slow methods to catch anyone else than true retards. and you want the only working solution left out of this game. dear azrael dinn, you are an *******."

9/21/2012,i concur. my assets is now 6 years old. i need a search and filter function.
9/21/2012,#NAME?
9/21/2012,"i've played this game for quite a few years now and have seen lots of trends in ships and fittings. ships have come in and out of fashion, but there is one class of ship that has steadily gotten worse and is now close to obsolete... in the future this situation will only get worse. hac<U+FFFD>s.so a few years ago ships like the deimos, vagabond, zealot and ishtar terrified me and a lot of other people too. they had strong damage, high base resists and lots of slots to take advantage of utility modules, even unbonused ones. these days they are still ok, but do not justify their cost *and this is a factor - t2 prices are not as inflated as they were years ago*. combine this with them being a t2 ship that has no role and no reason to be flown over slightly larger combat ships and things get a little bleak for hac<U+FFFD>s.faction/pirate cruisers are much better and similarly priced with amazing bonuses that give them definite roles. battlecruisers can do their job better than them, in every way (tier 3 bc's make all sniper variants of hac's obsolete). so why when hac's haven<U+FFFD>t changed do they suddenly find themselves adrift in a sea of mediocrity? well let's highlight some key changes in eve that have affected them: module stacking nerf - a good change, but it ended the 7 heat sink zealots reign of 1-shotting terror. warp core stab nerf - expensive, relatively small ships suddenly lose their 'get-out-of-jail-free' option when things got too hot. vagabonds with 2+ stabs where not only common, but regarded as legitimate and necessary. tier 2 bc<U+FFFD>s <U+FFFD> these new combat orientated bc<U+FFFD>s where a huge nail in the hac coffin. costing a fraction of the price with more offensive and defensive options<U+FFFD> speed was the only thing hac<U+FFFD>s had going for them at this point. nos nerf - those utility high slots suddenly became less useful. neuts hurt their own, limited capacitor a lot and medium nos don't suck frigates dry the way they used too. it's a lot of extra fitting that just isn't worth it. ecm nerf - people will remember the nos/ecm ishtar. it was devastating. but still, the ecm saved these ships from taking damage sometimes and also gave them another get-out factor. capacitor/ehp global buffs - these hurt hac's more than helped them. using high dps and quickly overwhelming ships became less of an option, and while they might still win some of these engagements... it leaves more time for backup to arrive and quickly tackle and destroy these relatively low-hp t2 ships. nano nerf - i agree, moving at 10km/s in a battleship was stupid, but most hac's found a new lease of life when they could break the 4k mark. they could avoid damage then swoop in like wolfs and tear targets apart at an opportune moment, then flee again to fight another day. web nerf - drop a frig to 100m/s then cut it in half with 500 dps doesn't really work anymore, so they aren't as strong in the anti-frig role. so... what to do?. the mwd bonus the af's got was nice but ultimately only useful when sig kiting on small ships... like frigates. in large fleets hac<U+FFFD>s are too expensive and don<U+FFFD>t add anything another ship doesn<U+FFFD>t do better or cheaper. 'hit and run' is something hac's always did well, behind enemy lines in small gangs or solo. so how can we achieve this?well i<U+FFFD>m open to suggestions, but i think something radical is called for - here are a few idea's:n.b. the purpose of these changes to keep their offensive and defensive abilities the same but to also give them the ability to escape small engagements. they will still die to medium+ gangs, or gangs with heavy tackle or ew very quickly. this is more aimed at getting hac's into belts with unsuspecting targets, or catching stragglers/scouts for larger fleets and allowing them to get out afterwards once help starts to filter through. immunity to warp scramblers mwd cancelling effect - sounds crazy? yea it is, but it also means that they can escape almost any solo engagement. i'm not sure this is the best solution, but i<U+FFFD>m putting it on the table to inspire some creative thinking. i personally don't like ""immunities"" as a solution however. bonus to warp strength - we have seen this on transport ships. this would be, for example, +2 - allowing them to escape a scrambler point blank if a frigate burns to them or to escape 2 long points if they are being kited by interceptors (who sit at 20km and move far too fast to slingshot or otherwise escape). no penalties for fitting wcs - this is similar to the above but allows these ships to fit as many bonuses to warp strength as they please, at the expensive of lo-slot tank, speed or gank. immunity to nos/neuts - again, i don't like immunities and i think this wouldn't achieve the hit and run goal... simply make them unkillable through cap warfare. 'old fashioned nos' - so they basically get nos to work the way they used to, sucking cap regardless of your own cap level. of all the above idea's i prefer the warp-strength related ones, as these are easily overcome by larger gangs or stationary bubbles but still give them and edge in 1v1's. feel free to comment."
9/21/2012,"if you seriously think hacs are obsolete, you're doing something terribly wrong."
9/21/2012,"bhac gangs are popular right now, but that's an extrememly limited use of this ship class, and not to mention the vast majority of hac's aren't included in those gangs...ahac gangs wont be as popular when tiericide reaches the cruisers, since tech 1 cruisers will be 100 times cheaper and have similar effectiveness."
9/21/2012,"yes, give goons and rvb control of eve. great idea."

9/22/2012,"dear alexej, please go and learn how to pvp."
9/22/2012,only renters and cva cry about afk cloakers
9/22/2012,"not a blanket removal like what's so often requested but yes, i have found a way to counter afk cloaks without screwing active cloakers. the currently useless system scanner array pos module could very easily be tweaked to provide an active, and limited, means to counter afk cloaking in a system. couple it with an ihub upgrade requirement and you've made it something of an advantage to holding sov over simply slumming in npc space and harassing your neighbors.details on the module change would be similar to the following:when activated this module sends out a system wide burst of harmonic radiance (or whatever you want to call it) that disrupts all cloaking in system for 5 minutes. this effect is so energy intensive that it can only be used ever (pick balancing number) hours and disrupts any other module of this kind in the system for the same duration.my personal thought is that if you can't scan down an afk ship in 5 minutes, you deserve to have afk cloaks in your systems. i'm also of the opinion that any half competent pilot can avoid scan probes for a few minutes to stay alive thru the disruption effect. if you're too stupid to get yourself a collection of safes so you don't have to bounce off celestials at grid ranges, you deserve to die because you fail as a covops pilot. now, whether you consider afk cloaking to be a problem or not is irrelevant - the simple fact is covops cloaks are too good and have no balancing factors of any kind beyond the limited number of ships they can be fitted to."
9/22/2012,"the reason ahac fleets work is because of their excellent resist profile, meaning they can tank a ridiculous amount of incoming damage with logistics, combined with their reasonably high dps and low sig.the rebalanced t1 cruisers, while being a lot better than the old t1 cruisers, will still have terrible resists, not enough lows and nothing like the projection range of the hacs. therefor no, if anything ahacs will increase in popularity after winter because of the heavy pulse laser fitting buff and the probable diminution of the drake fleet.to the op yes hacs could do with a buff. it is not that they lack a role, it is that the t3 cruisers fill that role a lot better than the hacs do. if the hacs were buffed into line with there respective t3s it would solve a lot of the issues with both classes of ship.except the vaga, its fine"
9/22/2012,"beam buffs only really effects the zealot - we're still left with ships like the cerberus and deimos which are literally pointless compared to t3's and battle cruisers.and i actually think the vaga isn't fine. i have flown the vaga for years across my accounts and have to say: it's underwhelming these days. i would rather pay extra and fly as sleipnir since the vaga's speed bonus leaves you with a hard choice: have better damage and projetion and only move 2400, or get more speed and lose damage and projection (at which point the vaga does about < 200 dps at any sort of real range).the sleipnir on the other hand has the projection, slightly faster than most bc's/bs's and enough gank+tank to make anything faster than you wish it didn't catch you in the first place."
9/22/2012,"perhaps you should learn to fit you're vagabonds better then you should be getting 350ish out to about 35 k(with damage out to 50) at 2700, with 450 out to 20 ish with excellent tracking.the sleipnir is a field command ship and as such should have more damage/tank than the hac, making it better in a small gang. this is balanced by it having a sig the size of the moon (meaning it can tank much less incoming damage) and therefor be next to useless, in a large fleet.the cerb i will give you is ****, it realy needs attention, but the demios is well liked by lowsec pilots as a gank boat. it does 800 dps while still having a 50k ehp tank (pre boosts/slaves) and a tiny sig."
9/22/2012,"im not saying hac's are completely useless. they just don't offer must to the line-up right now. t2 frigs all have a role. t2 battlecruisers have a role. t3's have multiple roles. t2 bs's... they work as intended.now when you look at the t2 cruiser line-up you have logistics, mega buffed and very useful. recons, who for better or worse have a definite role and then hac's... which kinda feel like expensive battle cruisers with slightly better agility and resists and much worse ehp.with regards to the sliepnir and vagabond: the vaga needs 5 low slots to do that sort of damage at those ranges, which means no speed mods or ehp - which severely cuts down is survivability. and the sleipnir is simply top of the dog pile right now with asb's - it's a monster, sig radius or not.sig tanking is such a finite thing, most 100mn ab cruisers are the only ones who can take advantage of it to any real effect. you need to have a signature literally half of a gun/missiles target sig for it to start significantly lowers the damage you take. slap on a few lse's and the point is void on the vagabond."
9/22/2012,"did you miss the point in my first post about hacs having a roll which is just being better filled by t3s just now, which could be fixed, as i suggested, by generally buffing hacs. my point is there is no need for a role change, they just need to be made better at the role they have. the ehp of a hac is usually better than a bc unless you fit them horribly (cerb is the exception and as mentioned it is ****).those stats for the vaga are based on the two gyro, two tracking enhancer, one nano layout.as i said field command ships should be better in small gangs than hacs, try taking an asb sleipnir to a fight against 10 or more people, see how quickly you die. you do not need a 100mn ab to sigtank effectively, try shooting at a 10mn zealot with a battleship and form a new opinion."
9/22/2012,
9/22/2012,
9/23/2012,there has been alot of solutions and topics how they would be countered.main problem seems to be that most of the solutions would kill cloaking completely. i would personaly want to see fuel bays for the specialized ships and just fuel in cargo bay for others. and it would be ccps problem how to balance it so that it would be fair to the ones using cloaks and it would also kill afk cloaking. mayby higher meta level mods would consume less fuel so you could cloack up for longer period of times or something.i don't see how this would ruin cloaking completely. it would just mean that if your stupid enough to leave your ship to be cloaked for long period of times without you being around someone would eventualy find you and kill you if they wanted to. you could still do all the psychological warfare you want by being in the system or traps and so on but you would most importantly be active and not passive ratting in empire waiting there and not even paying attention.and stop posting no no no no i can't play without afk cloaking and start saying something constructive.

9/23/2012,"i'll just counter this by saying. lets add the fuelbays and scans into the game. is there a problem then?and if you don't get the indirect benefits of psychological warfare, well thats your problem then."

9/24/2012,+1this would be so epic.
9/24/2012,"i've gone on several wh and null roams where i have done more than 24 hours worth of cloaking (most of my roams last a week or so, depending on how much i am able to play) without being anywhere near someplace where i could dock up.any sort of fuel or cap use or whatever that would have any effect on an afk cloaker would make my personal activity very very difficult. i'm sure there are many other folks who do similar things that require long cloak times away from any source of refueling.and to the person with the pulse thing: that kills bombers and gate/pos scouts. adds certain death to an already tedious job.and if it had a significant (say 6 hours) cooldown, it woudl be pretty useless against the afk cloakers."
9/24/2012,"fuelbays kill the active cloaker who spends time away from any refueling base. for example behind enemy lines work, or deep wormhole resident hunting.system wide scans. however they work (even if you dont use them to then scan down a cloaker), simply knowing a cloaker is present in this way still breaks wormholes.edit: posted the following before and i am sure i will post it again:simply remove cloakers from local. and deny that cloaker local.- now cloaks are really cloaked.- now afk cloaking cannot cause any fear.- now active cloakers have to work for more intel.- now system residents have to pay a little more attention to whats going on around them.- now (if done correctly) bots can be caught.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
9/24/2012,"immunity to scram mwd effect would really only be a boost to shield / kiting hacs, while i doubt an armor zealot or sacrilege or diemost would truly benefit from it. as for +x warp core stab strength / no penalty to warp core stabs, etc.... what are you trying to create here? blockade runners and mining barges have/had this utility built into the hull, but that's so they could run away... somehow, creating a combat vessel with a get-out-of-jail-free card doesn't make a good design philosophy. this will certainly make them more hit and run-ish... but hit and run shouldn't be about surprise and potency, with the caveat that a poorly chosen target with nearby backup can result in the loss of your ship... i'd much prefer suggestions like: all hacs get stronger webs, or increased propulsion jamming (scram/web/disrupt) range, or ... something that helps them fight better, not run away better!!! i agree with you that tier 2 bc's offer cheaper, excellent dps, excellent tank alternatives to hac's.... that tier 3 bc's offer high-speed, high-dps, excellent range/alpha, yet is cheaper alternatives to hacs, and t3 cruisers offer significant advantages over hacs if you're willing to spend a little more... i also agree that pirate cruisers overshadow hacs... but that's mostly because they are hacs, or have extremely unique utility like 90% webs. in the end, i don't think there is a fix-all solution that will suddenly make hacs viable again.... i think all bc's need to be rebalanced first, and then hac's given an appropriate role bonuses that make them superior choices over the bc counterparts...."
9/24/2012,"our alliance is in a lot of wars, and we intend to accumulate more. however the wardec interface is woefully lacking the options to manage our wars easily. it is bubbly and friendly - which is fine if you have 1-3 wars. but we're sitting north of 60 wars, and intend to get multiple hundred.- there is no sort option (by name, mutual status, start date, end date, isk damage, etc)- there is no table view (which would go with the first point)- there is no ""compact list"" like in chat channelsplease create the option for wars to be listed in a more manageable way."

9/25/2012,"so what you're saying is that - which is what i said in the thread name :) my idea where simply things to get people thinking.the warp core strength bonus was to take hac's back to the days when they used wcs (as a lot of expensive ships did) so they have options other than ""die in a fire"" when someone tackled them.increasing stats (ehp, resists, dps) simply turns them into mini battleships which is boring - we have battle cruisers for that. being difficult to pin down and trap is in itself a role for a heavy hitting, low tank ship... \but it's just one idea - i was hoping for more constructive feedback :p"

9/26/2012,bringing this up again as it continues to be a major limiting factor that seriously needs attention
9/26/2012,"why do i keep having to make threads with this title...there is something terribly wrong with wardec mechanics which horribly punishes the aggressor. whenever an aggressor declares a war they can and will be permanently trapped in that war and made to permanently fight an unlimited number of opponents.formal definition of problem:the defender in a war can set the war to mutual, and the aggressor is permanently trapped in the war.how to transfer wardecs:a wardecced corporation joins an alliance, that alliance sets the war mutual, transferreda corporation joins an alliance, then leaves, they have a perfect copy of all alliance wars, transferreda corporation leaves an alliance, joins another alliance. transferredthat's right, we can transfer wars from any entity to any other entity. what questions does this raise: why would you ever use the defender system in wardecs when you could just transfer an exact copy of your war to an infinite number of entities? why pay for defense when you can gain infinite allies for free using war-duping? why let your enemy ever escape? tired of fighting the war? store it on a 1 man alt corp that you can use to revive it years down the road completely out of the blue to continue your revenge. i promise to do all these things and make everyone regret the poor design decision. i will be at eve vegas to personally argue this case before the devs, but player support is muchly appreciated, even if just for the lulz.the goal of the wardec revamp was to make wars popular and fun, now you've accomplished the opposite by making war an unthinkable crime that can only be waged with disposable alt corps. you must fix this exploit before i ruin highsec for everyone for all time. because, i will.link to original dec shield thread"
9/26/2012,"+1 to the op.it seems that ccp's intent to ""promote"" empire warfare has, surprise surprise, resulted in the concept's total destruction. although we didn't have the tools to publicly see all wars before inferno, i'd be willing to bet good money that the v"
9/26/2012,great idea. i support this concept... not slow too much to reship but some slowdown is ok. after all that new clone that just got reanimated might need a little stretching and warm up before running into his next pod fully clothed.
9/26/2012,"the army will give his wife a fat check, and if he had any brains, he'd also have another life insurance policy due to the nature of his job."
9/26/2012,"as we all can see, currently is being exploited to artificially inflate prices in game. last night for the 4th time in just as many days i went to sell a couple plex to someone buying 5+ just to not get the sale's due to them not having the cash. needs at the very least taken from 25% to 75% escrow to reduce the # of people manipulating the market.bottom line, it's out of control and starting to effect the markets negatively, both for sellers, and buyers."
9/26/2012,"bumping it upto a required 75% escrow still would not add any risk to . id say leave the skill as is, but if the marketeer does not have the full amount of cash when someone goes to sell them the item, they not only dont get the sale, but also lose the 25% escrow they put down."
9/26/2012,"your ideas of giving them built-in wcs or bonuses to fitting wcs are unspeakably bad.your other ideas are problematic because you're imposing one-size-fits-all solutions across a diverse ship class. what use are bonuses to nos for ranged hacs that never want to be inside nos range? good for sacrilege, useless for the eagle and cerb. hacs need to be fiddled with individually before a uniform bonus can be considered, and somehow room will need to be found for them in a game with t2 and t3 bcs. tricky one."
9/26/2012,"i don't see a severe problem with hacs although considering their cost, they are not too amazing. however for me, the hacs should be all about getting in the fight dealing good damage, and good mobility... they definitely should not be immune to scram by default.

9/27/2012,"why isn't everyone jumping on this??? say you're fitting a ship and you know you have the mods somewhere in all of your assets but you can't remember where- you have the option of right clicking and viewing the mod in the market or in contracts to go and buy another one--- but you know you got one somewhere so ... you have to open your assets and then type it in and all that, but why ???? lets have a 'find in assets' option with our right clicky - thank you"

9/27/2012,"is it dumb idea day or what?there are some hacs that need looking into, but there are several standout hacs that are outstanding.the only reason i'm not in a vaga right now is the damn things have gotten as expensive as pirate faction stuff."
9/27/2012,"i think all of dotbros and cfc would tell you that zealots are pretty damn good.have you ever flown a dual rep sac?vaga is undeniably one of the best solo/small gang ships in the game.tell bl the muninn sucks and see what they tell you.cerb sucks because: drake, tengu, fitting.beagle can be pretty good.deimos... ya it sucks.ishtar... ya it sucks too.i don't see a problem with hacs, i just see a problem with gallente."
9/27/2012,"isthar is phenomenal for pve and pvp. it's not easy to fly, but it can project damage better than most other hac's without risking itself. put a 30km point on it and give it some speed... it's quite effective. worse comes to worst you dump your drones and flee.that's kinda what im talking about. hac's being able to do that is good - it's also why the cynabal is popular. but i'm trying to get some idea to make all hac's feel like they are that good. the vaga is decent, as is the zealot - but these and in the minority. the gtfo factor is what makes them popular, since other ships can tank and gank harder.projection and run-away-factor are top choices for making a hac harrass gang."
9/27/2012,"i agree the hac's are largely overshadowed by other things these days but i also think you're over thinking it. a simple fitting buff to them is all that's really required. the reason the cynabal outclasses the vagabond by such a huge margin isn't because of speed or gun range, it's because the cynabal can fit a full rack of 720 arties without any fitting sacrifices while a vaga struggles with even 220 ac's. it's like that across the rest of them too."

9/28/2012,"this wont change anything... i place a buy order for 2000 units of x at 1m each, and whether i need 10% or 25% or 95% in escrow, as long as i need less than 100% the order gets put on the market as 2000 units of x at 1m each.... and as long as my minimum buy order is 2000 units, when you come along with 2000 units and attempt to sell them to me, i won't have enough funds to cover the transaction. hence, the order fails, i don't gain any units of x, and you get to keep all 2000 units of x. no one is harmed in this process. changing it from 25% to 75% would really only hurt legitimate traders, who have billions in both buy and sell orders that they are continually moving. the mechanic is not responsible for the success of the scam, it's your greed. the only way to ""prevent"" it would be to alter the way escrow funds work: a.) you'd need to increase escrow to (at least) match the minimum buy amount. b.) you would need escrow funds to be used last (not first as they are now). c.) when a persons wallet doesn't contain enough to cover the buy order, the escrow is used to cover the purchase and the order is cancelled. however, this would require a serious rework of the escrow / market system. currently, escrow funds are put into one big account, and all buy orders use up escrow funds first, and then use money from your wallet. you have to change this mechanic or you won't ""stop"" margin scamming. and, frankly, that would be a lot of work to change something that really doesn't need fixing. i'd much rather the dev's focus on rebalancing ships, fixing pos system, fixing sov, tweaking fw, etc, etc, etc.... the market system works very well, even if the 0.01 isk war gets annoying.*edit* the scam is sooooo easy to spot: does the buy order have a minimum quantity greater than 1.... a.) no, its probably not a scam. b.) yes, its probably a scam. and the only way a margin trader makes funds is if you buy the product from them at some ridiculous price... so, as long as you don't buy overpriced items to re-sell, you'll never get burned!"

9/29/2012,why are they used by half of nullsec if they are pointless?
9/29/2012,"by ""being used in nullsec"" you mean: if you can fly a zealot you do it - if you cant, you fly something else cause it's better than nothing.i'm also sick of people taking 1 type of massed ship, making a fleet out of it and declaring that ship viable because of one limited situation. the muninn is the perfect example. an ac tornado is just plain better than it in it's strongest role - the only issue issue is it's skill point intensive and lots of null-sec is populated by experienced players giving out orders (minority) then pets who turn up in a ship they are told to buy (majority). when you see fleet reports from serious pvp alliances their ship choices are include practically none of these hac's - simply because they take other ships that do it better."
9/29/2012,"firstly do you even know what muninn fleets do? because they are firstly designed to not die, a concept foreign to the tornado, and secondly designs to kite and do decent damage at medium range with good tracking, which the nado doesn't do particularly well either.secondly are you seriously suggesting that irc are a 'serious pvp alliance'? if not (as i assume because lol) then who exactly are you talking about?edit: also how is the tornado skill intensive? its a t1 bc."

9/30/2012,probably not what your looking for but you can drag and drop bookmarks in to your cargo hold and save them in a station or pos until they find out what to do about it.
9/30/2012,"imagine if you are hunting war targets and you are using locator agents to find where they are, this is what you have to do.what you have to do now:set your agent finder to any and level 4, right click each agent and show info until you find the nearest locator agent, then you go to it and write the name down and the time you use it. fly your alt all the way over to the targets location only to need another locate because they have moved. so you again right click all the agents to find another and either look at your list to make sure you haven't used it or just pray you haven used it..... ectidea:wouldn't it be nice to have an option to find your locators? maybe highlight the agents names in yellow like on the market if they are on the way to your destination?or have a timer that tells you when you can use that locator again?just thought of this and think it could be helpful."
9/30/2012,"yes! god yes.this really really needs to be done. also, it would be such an easy thing to implement (compared to most of the suggestions made). plus, with the bounty system getting an overhaul for the winter expansion this will need even more attention. with people looking for other people more often, people will be using the locator agents almost constantly, which is going to make finding them a royal pain in the ass.i made this same suggestion in a thread on fixing the bounty system. if the new bounty system sees implementation without this, you will soon see threads like this one popping up all over the place. ship it.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

9/30/2012,"being able to transfer wars from one alliance to another by alliance hopping is obviously an exploit and needs to be fixed.however, the defenders should be able to make a war permanent. because that's what the aggressor deserves. if they want war, they can have war. otherwise starting wars as an aggressor is a no lose situation.

9/30/2012,"i'm the single largest abuser of these current game mechanics, and i absolutely believe this is not how wardecs were intend to be.as i see it, ccp intended wardecs to be a commitment from the aggressor for at least a week at a time. no more declare war, fight until it's inconvenient, then drop the war 24hrs later. ccp tried to accomplish this ""commitment"" through the various new mechanics: increasing wardec costs restricting player corp hopping (7 day rule) removing the ability for the aggressor to revoke the war allowing a defender to mutual a war to prevent the aggressor from ending it corps that leave an alliance receive identical copies of its wars let's talk about ending wars for a minute...as of right now the mechanics for ending a war are equivalent to ending your phone service by stopping payment. that's really what it is. you have to default on the war bill to end the war. if some corp in your alliance goes through the alliance bill list and pays them all like an upstanding citizen, then your alliance is unwillingly hooked into another week of war regardless of your intentions. there is no off button. why is there no off button?furthermore, the defender in a war has the ability to permanently lock the aggressor in this war by setting it mutual. obviously the intend consequence was to prevent aggressors from just ending a bad war and escaping. but the horrifying side-effects of this are people like me, trapping as many people as we can in wars. if this was somehow ccp's intention, then it would have been prudent to review how this played out with other war mechanics, but they didn't. a corporation that is in an outgoing wardec is forbidden by game mechanics from joining an alliance. this might make sense, but it no longer makes sense if the wardec has been declared mutual. aggressor corps in mutual wars should not suffer this restriction since the defender has thrown down and agreed to face them in open war.the natural mechanic here is to have an off-button for wardecs. when an aggressor declares they're no longer interested in maintaining the war, and then the war ends at the end of that week interval, regardless of whether or not it's paid. if the war is mutual there are three options as i see it: the war is retracted. if defenders want to continue, they can counter wardec (traditional) the war continues, aggressors are trapped (current) the defenders become the aggressors and assume billing responsibilities for the war okay, so let's talk about starting wars...the current system calculates the cost of a wardec based on the number of players in the target corp/alliance. this is a mistake that protects the large nullsec alliances from highsec harassment. a more equitable system would calculate the cost of a war based on the difference in member count between two entities. in other words, it should cost the same for a 1 man corp to wardec a 5000 man alliance as it does for a 5000 man alliance to wardec a 1 man corp. likewise, it should be considerably cheaper for a 5000 man alliance to wardec another 5000 man alliance.the old wardec system cost 2mil base for a corp to dec another corp, and 50mil base for any wars an alliance were involved in. the old system increased the cost of declaring war based on how many wars you were in, and how many the target was in. the current system only cares about how many wars you're in, and the base cost is 50mil across the board.while it'd be nice to maintain those 2mil wardecs for long abandonned highsec offline structure clearing - setting up a system to calculate active subscribers in a target entity is generally beyond a simple fix. but such a solution would be more optimal to prevent obvious abuses such as packing your corp/alliance with 51-day trial accounts to fluff your numbers and inflate wardec costs. 51-day trial accounts are the 21 day buddy invite trials, plex'd once to give them 51 days of play time, while giving a plex to the recruiter. these accounts don't technically count as ""trial accounts"", and thus do contribute to inflated wardec costs, and i will slap anyone who claims otherwise because we've tested it. the goal here is to remove loopholes related to wardec costs.continued below..."

9/30/2012,"i don't know if i've said it yet, but i'd like to see a change to how this skill works. i still believe it is exploited. i don't agree with the 25% escrow because anyone with billions can still run the scam easily, and anyone legitimately using it would lose a great deal of benefit from it.i think the simplest answer is to penalize the player who frauds the system. freeze their wallet, put them into a negative isk balance, or otherwise make sure they are properly chastened in a realistic fashion, for misusing the skill. it could still be run as a scam, but the player would require some work to reaquire either market liquidity, or rebuild their credit status for the skill.it really is as simple as looking at real world consequences, of which there are many, and finding one that seems appropriate to apply in game. it doesn't have to be too harsh, and it certainly doesn't have to remove that use of the skill as a viable means of scamming, but it should alter the effects of making such a choice, and give a person reason to consider whether it is worth it, and/or how often it is worth it to do and for what reasons.the skill is used on mains rather than alts, or at least specially trained character intended for trading. i also don't see any reason why the person failing to sell to such an order due to it failing shouldn't receive an appropriate market transaction with the name of the buyer who failed to complete the order, along with the order and amount.zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub"
9/30/2012,"supported.thankfully i've never been prey to scams, but they sound frankly ridiculous. this is something that needs to be fixed. all the scams in eve can be seen and avoided if you pay enough attention and are wary. this is the only exception.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
9/30/2012,"after talking it over with quite a few people in real time, there is no possible way to guarantee that the bounty system can't be exploited in one way or another. it offers new players not familiar with it's working an artificial sense of possible future retribution against the target, who eventually just gets podded by an alt to collect said bounty.even if the new implementation of a percentile based bounty payout takes place, in some of the more extreme cases, it is still worth it to pod yourself at least once for collection of the billions of isk you would receive for the first few self terminations. add to that that most people with bounties on their heads are station dwellers, and well, they have a source of emergency capital if they need it for their next station based scam.until there is a sure fire way that the bounty system can't be exploited, it may as well just be scrapped. if that is not an option, at least put in a warning that can be activated for new players stating that it can possibly be exploited. maybe even put it into the tutorial."
9/30/2012,"you missed the boat, they've already announced that they're fixing the bounty system for the winter expansion.also, this has been discussed in detail and there are many varied ways of preventing the bounty system from being exploited.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
9/30/2012,"no, i haven't missed the boat. truth be told, the fix isn't really fixing it. it just keeps someone from collecting all of the money at once apparently. they can still bring a ship along, pewpew themselves, and if the bounty is high enough, it would still be worth the cost of a clone."
9/30/2012,i'd prefer space flight and battles more if it was a little bit more cinematic.
