8/1/2011,"hey guys want to know something? if i worked at ccp i would never have allowed remaps to go active!bitter vet here! i remember the days of the game when there were no remaps so you spent the time to make your char properly, or rolled achura. quit your complaining and balance out your skill distribution."
8/1/2011,why not be able to remap more? all i'm reading is wha wha wha im a veteran and i want to be better then all the new people without having to do anyhting but stare at my screen.. honestly this game takes no dexterity and the hardest thing in this game is keeping your account active to get sp's. most of you wouldn't last a second in a real pvp game where you actually have to micro manage your moves. yes i support this 100% this. also they need to make jump clones on a 4 hour timer so you can pvp with a crap clone. you guys are killing this game there is no future with this community.edit: i think the price of a remap should be like only 50 mil so it can be done often.
8/1/2011,"the original plan for remaps had them at once every six months. ccp changed it to once every 12 months after people pointed out that the purpose of remapping was to fix mistakes made at character creation or to allow long-term changes of career - not to allow people to switch skill plan every six months so they could always train at 2700 sp/hr. this isn't desirable because it defeats the purpose of having attributes.furthermore, frequent remaps helps veterans much more than newbies, as veterans can more easily afford the isk cost of a plex and can more easily put together a sensible skill plan that involves focusing on int/mem or perc/willp. veterans don't need more help in this game, they should already have the advantages of experience, knowledge and contacts."

8/1/2011,"this has to be a false argument and people are missing something in their logic.a person who has trained all their core frigate skills and small weapons skills can match someone who is a lot older and is flying a similar craft even though they might have lots more skill points in total. it is only the skill points you have for the ship you are flying, its defense and weapons systems that count. so somebody with 5 million skill points all concentrated in frigates can take on somebody with 60 million skill points spread across every facet of the game.a gang of newbies in frigates can do awsome damage when under the guidance of a good fc.so where is the problem?maybe the issue is education of new starters. maybe player corps shouldn't be putting a minimum limit on the skill points of player applicants they are willing to accept. maybe by taking new players and training them in the facets of the game, there would be a better retention of new players in the game. the most effective players are the ones who are team players. skill points are important. total skill points is meaningless."
8/1/2011,"it's disingenuous to say ""any player with 5 million skillpoints in frigates can beat any other player with 5 million skillpoints in frigates, when they're flying frigates"". what you're basically saying is ""noobs should fly frigates, and maybe i'll come down to their level, if i have such a whim"". of course it suits players with older characters to say that newer players shouldn't have as many skillpoints or options in the game. older-character players are just protecting their advantage. i happen to think that many older-character players would rather ride the game into the ground than see newer players become anywhere near as successful or powerful in-game as them. hence, they'd rather people walk away from the game or never try the game than even up the odds a little bit.the funny thing about the argument that skillpoints don't really matter is that, if they didn't matter, people with more of them wouldn't try so hard to keep people with less of them from gaining more. if skillpoints aren't important, then let noobs just have some. who cares? right?i think the noob perspective is often ""i can wait 2 or 3 months to be able to play this game well enough to enjoy it or i can go play call of duty and compete right now . . . hmmmm . . . **** this game!"". and, really, who wants to wait a month to be able to fly a cool ship? if i wanted to wait years for success, i'd go to college. the reason veteran players are ok with waiting is because they've already done the waiting, not because they think its fair or speeding up the process would ruin the game, so come off your high-horse."
8/1/2011,"omg no!if you aks me, it's your proposal that will kill eve./not supported, no way, no how."
8/1/2011,well i was part of a roam through null sec last night with a fleet of 11 thorax cruisers with all t1 fits. even had small auto cannons on them rather than medium blasters. the majority of the fleet consisted of players who were only 2 weeks off their trial account. we took out a number of ships (one at a time) flown by older players and didn't even lose a single thorax. it was rather disconcerting actually because it was supposed to be a suicide mission. we had intent to lose our ships and possibly get podded.this exercise proves my point.

8/1/2011,"fof missiles need some love. i'm surrounded by hostile ships and turrets shooting at me and these little buggers decide to fly off behind me and attack a non combat facility.i understand the reason why they're not all that smart is so people won't use them to afk missions... but... people kinda do that anyway once they get their drone skills up high enough. sure, it's not the most efficient thing in the world, but they still do it.targeting the nearest thing that i can attack is a seriously flawed logic, even when using them for their original design purpose (using when being frequently target jammed). i wouldn't go so far as to say they're useless, but if you're sitting there watching your ship launch salvo after salvo of missiles at a completely irrelevant target, it gets frustrating. i remember reading somewhere that these missiles could be used just like regular missiles, in that if you had a target locked, it would prefer to attack that target. i can tell you that this is not the case, and i think that needs to be looked at to determine whether or not these are where ccp would like them to be.another thing i've noticed. drones will attack something something similar to their size so the damage done is efficient. but if i'm using heavy fof missiles, they just attack the closest thing to me... which is generally frigates (assuming it's not the usual useless space junk target). that leaves my drones with nothing to engage.the reasons i decided to try using fof missiles instead of standard had nothing to do with afking missions, though i can see why one might assume that. it started when i was getting frequently targeting jammed while on missions. it got highly annoying to sit there and watch my drones fight and kill things without problems while i'm left feeling more or less useless. later on, i started getting target jammed less, but instead i just started 1-2 shotting everything. when you're 1-2 shotting things at long ranges and the launchers fire the next salvo before the first one hits, the ammo is wasted, and so is the cycle time. with fof missiles at least it would grab another target if one was in range when the first one went down. the time lost here isn't critical to survival, but it makes it kinda frustrating to be sitting there waiting on the long cycle time and knowing that you're wasting expensive ammo when this happens.perhaps there's a few changes that can be made. as far as what these might be, i don't know. i'm not a game designer. i do know that everyone i've asked claims they're useless and to not even bother skilling into them. i don't think ccp would have put something into the game knowing that it would be a useless waste of time or not worth the skill points or risks of using them.i like to think that when these were put in the game, ccp intended for them to have a purpose and be used from time to time for those purposes. the problem is, due to design mechanics surrounding modules, reload times, and targeting times, no one has time to swap missiles and get a shot off before their target lock wears off. so even if they were useful for that purpose and didn't have such flawed targeting logic that they were frustrating to use, they probably wouldn't see much use anyway simply because you can't switch them into use fast enough.maybe ccp likes where they are. maybe they don't. i don't know. it can't hurt to bring it to their attention.possible suggestions to change the way these work: make the targeting logic smarter. no more targeting useless stuff. possibly make it so that if you have these in your cargo when you get target locked, your launchers will automatically grab these and use them instead, with a lesser or non existent reload delay.i think it might be worth the trouble to re-visit these and see if we can improve them so they might see more use, and less disgust :p"
8/1/2011,"welcome to ccp ai development. sentry drones attack targets only metres away (and thus do no damage), drones switch back to the previous target, or spilt targets despite being set not to, drones sometimes attack non-aggroed ships, fof missiles attack whatever is closest, regardless of what it is, etc, etc.i'm not asking for either drones or fof missiles to have sleeper level ai, but they could at least attack something within falloff range and similar size first."
8/1/2011,"i'm sorry if this has been proposed before, but as a noob miner, i have the hardest time figuring out which laser is mining what target once the cycle has started. i monitor the amount of ore left in the 'roid via scanning and never quite get the one about depleted to turn off.my proposal would identify in the target hover text which laser is mining what, perhaps using a color to indicate which mount point was used.regards,zi"

8/1/2011,"at this point wardecs are complelty controlled by the agressor. the attacked corp has absolutely no say in how long the war will last (unless they want to turn into the agressor and extend it). for those that don't want to be be a target, the only option is to join an npc corp.i'd like to see a mechanic where ""pvp co"" decs ""indy co"". during the 24 hour waiting period indy co can bid for peace. they can pay concord an amount of isk of their choice(with a minimum of maybe 10m, or possibly matching the dec ammount). from the time of that payment, pvp co then has 24 hours to match the amount in the bid for peace. if they match, war begins as normal. if they choose not to match the bid, war can't be declared again for a week.i played with the idea of having the bids go back and forth, but i think just having one bid cycle might be better.this provides corps that have no intrest in waring a possible (if costly) method of avoiding one. while at the same time forcing attacking corps to make a cost\risk analysis to determine if its worth it to attack right now, or to wait a week. in addition to those who just want to try to avoid war, it allows coporations that want to delay a week to prepare more a chance to do that.after a week of war, the re-newing cost would be the same as current unless a method can be devised for the bid to happen again."
8/1/2011,"actually it only needs awu 3. and that's just one potential fit. you don't really have to fit an afterburner and a mwd, i only put them both on to demonstrate that it has enough powergrid for that despite the weapons. also, it most certainly would not cost more than a tech 2 frigate. in fact that very fit i had on costs less than 20 mil. most of the money goes to the armor rigs because armor rigs are freaking expensive, and it wouldn't be much different on a frigate using armor rigs.here's a fit i would use:highs:dual 180mm ac x4assault launcher x2mids:y-t8 mwd or y-s8 abwarp scramblerwebifierlows:tracking enhancernanofiber hulldamage control or gyrostabilizerrigs:shield em x2shield thermalthis setup costs about 2-5 mil over the hull depending on module meta level/tech 2 and leaves me with 301 powergrid remaining with the mwd, 401 with the ab. it still has almost as much eff. hp (remember this isn't a tank fit, it's a nano fit) so it's still tougher than a destroyer despite being just as fast and shooting just as hard, and having little difficulty hitting frigates, even ones that aren't webbed. it also makes a pretty decent tackler. if it could warp at 6 au/s, i'd seriously consider taking it along on frigate roams.but lastly i say to you stop knocking the stabber. no matter how many charts and statistics you manage to pull off eft, it won't change the fact that i've kicked people's ass in a stabber. they don't need a buff. and if all cruisers get their needed buff, stabbers will need a nerf."
8/1/2011,"no, it's 5. i eft'd it and checked. then again that's with a tech 2 fit, drop it to metas and your stats are even more terrible. yeah, it does. hull + rigs on their own cost more than the t2 frig. (unless you're talking something like a wolf)yep it is, but how many do that anyway? none of my afs have armour rigs and all of them would utterly melt that stabber.awful. even with full t2 the dps is fail for a cruiser, and with 9k ehp even my frigates would thrash it.you seem to fail to understand two basic things about nanoships.1. their speed is to stay out of scram range.2. all of them carry some form of buffer, because having ehp as low as that is nothing short of suicidal. any cruiser and some of the frigates i have would have it as drifting wreckage in seconds.nope, because it really is trash. there's only so much you can say ""oh but it works better in practice"" when the cold hard evidence in front of me says you're outgunned by basically everything.by all means link the killmails. i take it you have an alt? because the only kills i see for your character are people who got absolutely blobbed and going by your losses you don't even fly the stabber on that character.edit: in fact, going by your losses, you don't appear to understand how to pvp fit anything. warp stabbed drakes and rifters? zero tank torp ravens? shield rigged armour scorpions?i could go on, but... actually i think i will: brutixes with missing guns, armour and shield tanked merlins, shield punishers with empty low slots, have you ever flown a ship that wasn't failfitted?"
8/1/2011,"p.s. make sure you read the last thing i wrote, you always seem to miss that bit.well who do you think flies a stabber anyway? of course i'd be better off with all tech 2 stuff on a tech 2 ship. my whole point was that a stabber is actually good for a newbie who doesn't have the skills to fit a lot of tech 2 stuff. i personally can't fit tech 2 weapons yet but i can fly tech 2 frigates. however, i don't much like the idea of wasting 30-40 million isk on a failfit frigate so i'm not jumping into pvp with something i have no experience with. therefore in pvp fleets i fly tech 1 ships mostly, like stabbers.also, you're the one who started this argument. i simply threw it out there that while most cruisers are terrible, stabbers aren't, and you decided to take it upon yourself to try and prove me wrong. i've heard people say they can make a thorax kick ass, which boggles my mind since it runs out of powergrid when you put tech 1 neutron blasters on it. the same is absolutely not true of the stabber, it has about the same powergrid as a thorax with its expected weapons taking much less. and its faster than a thorax. and it fits 6 weapons, not 5. and its only slightly weaker but has a much smaller sig radius. given all that, and that several players find a way to kick ass with a thorax, how can you knock a stabber? you don't have to agree that it's something you would fly, i just want you to acknowledge that someone else maybe likes it a lot.and finally the stabber can fit top end tech 2 weapons without awu, if you don't put on a mwd and ab together. what part of that do you not get?"
8/1/2011,"people who somehow missed the memo about the rupture being a vastly superior ship.and terrible for everyone who can fly a cruiser that's actually good. line the thing up vs any sensibly fit cruiser, and you see which is the odd one out. this is why it'd need a buff along with the other gimpy ones.^ see above point.while the power grid on the thorax is a bit tighter than it should be, you're doing something badly wrong if you can't get a tank and medium blasters on it.(as a hint: you can actually do it without needing awu at all)so what? you can put 425mm auto iis on a stabber and it still gets outgunned by basically everything. the fact you can fit the guns is irrelevant as the ship makes terrible use of them.and yet the thorax outdamages you twice over. as would the rupture, for that matter. seriously, do you actually know what sort of capabilities other cruisers have, and how far above the stabber they are?i'll even give you a few example statlines:thorax: up to 600 dps, 25k ehpshield rupture: 450 dps, 19.5k ehparmour rupture: 429 dps, 30.6k ehpstandard nano-stabber: 215 dps, 17.6k ehp.i could continue, but are you starting to notice the trend?stabber is the fastest but what're you going to do with that besides suicide tackle?oh and another thing - you do realise you can't fit 6 cruiser weapons and a tank if the guns are 425mms? sure, plenty of people like the stabber. it's up to them if they want to be easy kills. i on the other hand want a greater variety of ships that are actually worth using.i refer you to my earlier point on how this does not make it a remotely good ship, let alone an overpowered one.as part of my ""buff the underdogs"" section, the stabber should really get an extra low. to compensate for cruisers being faster across the board, the speed bonus is replaced with falloff. there, instant mini-vagabond.somewhat back on topic, is the problem that the hurricane obsoletes both the minnie combat cruisers.oh and i'd still like to see some evidence you've ""kicked ass"" in a stabber. i also have to ask - why are you bringing the thorax or the stabber into a debate, when you clearly don't know anything about the capabilities of either ship?"
8/1/2011,"good heavens you seem to have nothing better to do than talk without listening. every time i come back you have loads of banter about stuff that i can't even keep up with. yet a mere glance at any of it and i see you just keep on missing what i'm saying.plus, i'm offended by what you said about my kills. i don't have much pvp experience yet, but i don't failfit. rather, every fit you mentioned had a specific purpose and most times that purpose wasn't standard pvp. yes all my kills are in blobs. if you check my sp allocation you'll see that my pvp-effective skills are so minimal that i can't really do much against most pilots. sure i can kick newbs and carebears asses, but that doesn't help me against 3-year nullsec pilots.the warp-stabbed drake was an escape fit to get my drake out of some space we lost. i was new to nullsec and the alliance i was in then was ****. i got lucky and almost made it out, but i think i was being tracked several systems before i got hit. obviously warp stabs or no would not have made a difference with that many folks gunning me down.warp stabbed rifters i use to get through nullsec on my own. it's nice when i can't fly a covert ops. i can now but i only got one a few days ago. rifter-shuttles have gotten me through nullsec gatecamps more often than they failed, and they're cheap as hell.the torp raven was obviously a suicide gank ship, i'm surprised even you couldn't see that. it didn't work because concord jammed me, which i find odd because i've looked at several suicide gank videos and never seen anyone get jammed by concord. but that's beside the point.the scorpion's got armor plates because it has jammers. it has shield rigs because we use shield logi. it's a fleet fit. i lemminged, that's why i lost it. my bad.the brutix was obviously a ratting fit. just because the market is out of guns doesn't mean i can't take it out and kill stuff with it. i lost it because i got shotgunned by 9 people in a system with a lot more belts, so they got lucky. i also was fairly new and had never heard of the shotgun tactic. but that's irrelevant. what's relevant is that it was a ratting fit and furthermore that it was working. thus, not a fail fit.i don't think i have ever flown a merlin that was both shield tanked and armor tanked. i challenge you to find that on my killboard. but i can save you some time--i checked; it's not there.i'm sure i've flown failfit ships, especially back when i was new. but you instead like to pick out non-combat fits i lost, or the scorpion which was fleet fit (approximately) and most certainly not a fail fit. it is clear to me that you're butthurt i won't give in on the original point i disagreed with you on: that stabbers don't suck. it was your idea to make this whole thing on it. why can't you just accept that either you wrre wrong once or maybe people have a difference of opinion? you're being a baby about it. yes i'm being a baby about it too. and i admit i make plenty of mistakes. one of my downfalls is that i get ****ed off when people get all ****y about little things and try to take it out on other things when they can't get their way.so maybe you should give up on this crusade and stop making yourself look ******ed. maybe you are succeeding in revealing to everyone that i'm no shining hero myself. wonderful, i never said i was, and i don't even like to be that. but i never decided to pick you apart until you did it to me first."
8/1/2011,"you claimed to have ""kicked ass"". i ran a little check to find evidence of this - i found none.i never would've started on your kill record if you hadn't claimed to have experience with the ship you argued for. not only that, but you tried to bring ships into the discussion that you clearly didn't know anything about. that's simple ignorance, which is perfectly reasonable, but if you don't know what you're talking about don't bring it into a debate. you will get called out on it.by the way, please re-read the first sentence of that paragraph a few times. ^the warp stabs were nowhere near the only thing wrong with the drakes. the rifters less so.why even have an armour battleship if you run shield logi fleets? also cdfe aren't what you use for logistics synergy.lack of a gun was also not near the only thing wrong with that. i could go into more detail on all the messups, but that'd make a long post even bigger. actually, my bad on that. salvage rigs have the same icon as trimarks, and i didn't mouseover them.still wierd as hell all over for pvp though, i assume a hurried retrofit, and the fact remains those rigs are actively detrimental to ship performance.of course concord jam. you won't have seen it on successful suicide gank videos because the target is dead when they finally do so.i have presented ample evidence that they do in fact suck. please re-read and address it, i can provide more if necessary. you've actually provided no evidence on your side beyond ""it can fit 425mm guns"" and ""some people like it"" (oh and ""it's good for newbies that don't have something better""). if you have any points beyond this, please do re-state them.what i'd most like to see you try and refute is this little comparison:thorax: up to 600 dps, 25k ehpshield rupture: 450 dps, 19.5k ehparmour rupture: 429 dps, 30.6k ehpstandard nano-stabber: 215 dps, 17.6k ehp.if i'm wrong, show me it. i've provided evidence (which has gone completely ignored) - where's yours?i'll repeat, because this is important: if you enter a debate, and claim to have knowledge you actually don't - expect to be called out on it. if you hadn't said this:... i never would have had to contradict you on it. you also brought up the thorax when you didn't even know how to fit it, or even the basics of what makes a ship good/bad."
8/1/2011,"not sure if this has ever be posted (probably has however). here is my idea:reason: -make sov warfare not on-going, but rather: less static locations (good/bad space).-promote 0.0 industry tree.idea:-make system sec status increase (closer to 0) the more you rat/plex. -make system sec status decrease (closer to -1)the more you mine/mini-professions-make system sec status decrease if no ratting is done (far less then industry, long to become better space then 3-5 fairly efficient ratters can raise status)***(also tossed around)-capital construction upgrade now industry rather then strategic-capital production (active csaas) help maintain a lower sec status in the system (i.e. each active csaa reduces the sec gain for ratting (10% per?) with stacking penalty) pro: increased industry""crappy"" space will no longer be crappy (long term)con:people will need to be more mobile (is this really a con?)much rage will be had (like one jump bridge per system)***to clarify for this: to keep people from bouncing between 2 systems (a and b), a is being moderately ratted in (suppose it takes a month to reach -.2), system b, having not been ratted in and starting at -.2 will take another half a month to become -.85 meaning, a 3rd system will be needed. -however csaas can make is so its a 1 to 1 ratio (reducing sec increase for ratting) after 3-4 are active (only if cap const. is moved to industry)i use these numbers because people are unlikely to rat in a -.25 and very likely in a -.85"
8/1/2011,"i can't believe you people are complaining about the nighthawk. first of all, nobody fits the fit you showed. its a pve ship, and its the one of the best tanked ships in the game.now you want more damage? it doesn't hit as hard as an astarte you say? fly an astarte sometime and see how long you live. they are like tissue paper. hell all gallante ships are, and frankly their damage sucks too, how usefull is high dps when its only at point blank range? drones in pvp? don't make me laugh.)if ccps buff damage on any t1 caldari ship, and doesn't buff armor tanking all around too, then it will only prove they are more concerned with the lowest common denominator then making a good game."
8/1/2011,i'm not entirely sure what's going on but i support anything that offers more cheese.
8/1/2011,"hi.every few months this issue gets raised, i remember that in 2006-7 someone from ccp said ""it's coming"" but every time it falls silent.so what about an interbus lp store? i can understand the lack of storyline missions for them (obviously nobody would do missions for anyone else then), but since they do give lps it would be nice to be able to spend them, even if only on non-combat stuff (industrial ships, implants and such) or to convert them to someone else's lps. this shouldn't be a development time heavy change."

8/1/2011,how about no.
8/1/2011,..........must resist..... trollbait!
8/1/2011,the troll is strong with this one.
8/1/2011,"this would only be balanced if there was a skill that increases warp disruption strength or if the skill affects both. and not a +1 per level, maybe a .2.even then i vote this down (no)"
8/1/2011,"that you cannot hang me up on a gate or in a belt forever does not mean the game is imbalanced.edit: my bad. you could only hang me up on a gate or in a belt for 15 minutes if i chose to logoffski and only for 23.5 hours, maximum, if i didn't logoffski . . ."
8/1/2011,"before we make a skill, how about make a real module.warp core stabilizers are stupid. and they nerf the hell out of your ship.why not make an active warp core stab?as it cycles, it has a chance to break the point, just like eccm. of course, the stronger the point(s) against you, the less likely it is to work."
8/1/2011,isn that called an ecm module?
8/1/2011,"this issue is quite often misunderstood, as many people call for re-balancing when they actually mean to fix a wildly unbalanced aspect of ship/item properties. supercapitals are an example of this.a less extreme example of this is the dramiel.i have to admit those few sentences were a re-hash of what ccp soundwave recently talked about at eve vegas, but what he said there makes a lot of sense. if we balance every ship in a class to be equal then theres no variation in a game like eve to inspire or motivate people to adapt to a new and dynamic universe.various ships tend to get slight buffs or nerfs every so often to either bring them more in line with others of its class or to reduce the over use of it in comparison to others. obviously this hasnt happened in quite a while but now ccp have assigned ccp tallests entire workload to it. so expect it to happen more often!what i am proposing is for players to be able, for individual ships, to veto it out of the rebalancing cycles for a large isk lump sum (to be determined by ccp). please understand the distinction im making between rebalancing and fixing. im not a dramiel pilot wanting to keep my pre-nerf ship how it is. i believe ccp should be able to make the call to fix aspects of ships that need culling, without the option for players to veto their ships out of it. but also be able to group minor changes that introduce what ccp soundwave was talking about into ship re-balancing and allow players to opt out of that with isk payments.not only is this isk sink a good idea for removing isk from the game unlike converting plex to aurum for useless clothes, but if done correctly savvy players can also make a profit from it by keeping ships with stats that are advantageous and selling them on at a much higher markup. it may give rise to a new market devoted to pre-era/pre-patch ships. and unlike t2 bpos these ships would be limited, and as with most thing in eve, die eventually, so not contaminating eves economy.with the relatively recent change to the item database bit depth theres tons and tons of room to do this thanks to ccp creber!currently re-balancing appears on patch notes and tbh very few pilots actually hunt for the ship re-balances that affect them unless theyre vets.in terms of roleplay aspects you could bring about evemails to either all eve players or eve players who own the ships getting re-balanced from whatever faction shipyard creates the ships, concerning updates that have been recently installed on their ships.that way the opt-out would be tied to these faction npc shipyards when players want to take their ships out of the update loop."
8/1/2011,reserved for updates to the proposal
8/1/2011,"this is a common misconception of what is meant by ""balanced"". people assume it means ""make every ship the same"", what it actually means is ""make every ship viable"" - i.e everything has a nich<U+FFFD>, and people actually need to pick what's best for a given situation rather than one ship being an all-purpose pwnmobile."
8/1/2011,"well then you can tell me and everyone else in eve what those 225 niches are then, in your infinite wisdom."
8/1/2011,"... you really need this spelled out?ok, can do - some ships already have their nich<U+FFFD> defined and filled. for example: freighters, logistics, etc. etc.on the other hand, some ships are given gimpy stats for no reason other than their place in the ""tier"" system. for example, caracal and moa. they are both dps ships, but they use completely different weapons and fly completely differently. however, the caracal is given ridiculously low power grid because it has to be worse than the moa for a stupid arbitrary reason. you can see this same principle applied to numerous other ship types. take battlecruisers - why does a ferox get inferior stats to a drake? they're not competing for the same role, they require different skillsets and different fits. but once again, the lower tier ship is gimped for no reason.you seem to think balance means ""make ship x and y exactly the same"". what it actually means is ""make ship x a viable alternative to ship y, more or less useful in certain circumstances""."
8/1/2011,well done on that sir.. you've adequately filled niche roles for about 70 ships so far with that explanation.ill give you an example though - why should i train skills for an oneiros when its inferior to a guardian and will almost never be used in fleets or gangs due to its inferior nature?
8/1/2011,"actually they're looking at buffing the oneiros right now to make it both viable and distinct from the guardian.just look at scimitar vs basilisk - the two ships have differing functionality despite both being logistics, and that works fine. with the buffs, hopefully the same will apply to the armour side of things.so hopefully, if all goes well with the changes, you could be trained for both ships and and have use for either of them depending on the gang/scenario."
8/1/2011,"ugh, how did i manage to double post?"
8/1/2011,i always wondered why this was not implemented.+1 /sign
8/1/2011,"already supported. i think it would be a great addition to the game. thanks additionally for everyone's input. please keep it coming. i think the idea of limiting the gain to people who are -3 and above is also a great idea. that way, pirates who wish to stay -10 can and those who wish to gain can rat in nullsec up to -3 and go from there.any other thoughts?"
8/1/2011,"+1my 2 cents. to counter alt farming, the sec gain with pirates (alt) kill could scale with ship size and number of highsec pilots kills (done by pirate you kill) from the last time the pirate was killed (to counter malicious behaviour)."
8/1/2011,"make it -5 like mags suggested it makes a lot more sense than that of -3.you know, once the big bad pirate hits kos the cva wannabe is not hit with a sec status."
8/1/2011,"fleet bonuses should have diminishing returns for larger fleets.encourage people to operate in smaller gangs. blobbers can win just by being barely competent in large numbers. smaller fleets that take greater risk engaging larger numbers should be rewarded by a greater return on their gang boosters.of course, larger groups could then decide to split down into seperate gangs but this will hopefully have some detrimental effect on their co-ordination.aside from a gameplay mechanic consideration it only makes sense that a tight-knit gang of lesser numbers would be able to reap the benefits of good leadership 'skills' better than a large undisciplined fleet.it's a bit of a stretch to expect soloers to get any sort of bonus although it would be nice if this niche of gameplay was awarded. obviously just letting a 'gang of one' get the largest benefit from fleet bonuses would be pointless since it's essentially a reward for no effort but it would be nice if they got something. perhaps skirmish groups that get some bonus as long as all gang members are active in space, uncloaked, regardless of the system they are in (although not in high sec where you can just hide in a safespot). obviously this solo-bonus thing needs working on but the above, addressing the diminishing returns in regular gangs would be worth considering."
8/1/2011,ftfy
8/1/2011,thanks for your pathetic contribution
8/1/2011,glad i could be of assistance ;d
8/1/2011,or you could just make them on-grid only which solves just about all the issues.
8/1/2011,nerfing fleet bonuses will not stop blobs.even you are smarter than that.all they have to do is just have a larger group of smaller fleets... they would still be one massive fleet regardless.waste of time.
8/1/2011,"sooo... blobs will just use multiple fleets rather than a single fleet, thus making the wing command and fleet command skills completely pointless to train. plenty of people in those big fleets with leadership skills."
8/1/2011,"formation penalties/bonuses.it could be so easy: - blob penalty -> increases signature size, reduces sensor strength (.. just as example)on the other hand: - dedicated formations for frigs like v-formation reduce signature/improve speed/whatever - ...so if you are in a large fleet and you like getting leadership bonuses or dislike getting blob penalties you will have to enable your brain and coordinate small wings of ships to accomplish your objectives. which would make not only larger fights more interesting... it would actually even look a lot better."
8/1/2011,"i would never have sent a failed whingebag 'i win button' loving player to swg, may it soon rest in peace."
8/1/2011,"this can easily be solved by allowing more high sec pvp. people like that are brazen. may fly ships they haven't properly trained to fly, more than likely with the assistance of rmt. a couple untimely deaths and they'll move on. an alternative to this is for ccp to set the security status of all characters on accounts caught botting/rmting to -5 (first offense) -10 (second offense) then a perma ban for the third offense. even null botters would be impacted by this. people demanding an ""i win cause of daddy's wallet"" button likely are already burning cash via rmt anyway."
8/1/2011,"thx for your reply guy's, it's handy gettin someones elses spin, plus from what you have layed out it seems most, if not all has already been tabled.cheershuntsman"
8/1/2011,"paintshops will be coming through nex (for sure) soontm. ccp are optimising the shipskins to different shaders for this.crew is one of those things that keep floating outthere like rigs, it took years for rigs to get into the game even though they where discussed from before beta.i assume that we'll have crews having some impact on ships operation sooner or later. for an idea of how ships crew work click here."
8/1/2011,it should also include the id#s and correlate to scanners who are within fleet/ corp etcthis would be a tactical asset.
8/1/2011,welcome to w-space.
8/1/2011,war decs are a part of this game they should be lower than they are now a corp can only dec 3 corps at a given time at 2 million a pop then x the # of decs if i am incorrect correct me so thats only 3 corps at a time.if your in an alliance its 50m a pop to as many as you would like and then x that # of corps/alliances.it adds up fast and if you don't like being dec'd go to an npc corp or switch corps make a new corp with a new ceo if you cant maintain and withstand with your oorp due to constant harassment you are probably an ******* and deserve the harassment eve is not a friendly place nor should it be made more friendly l2p or gtfo.
8/1/2011,"another great example of the lack of understanding a player has on his/her actions and how it effects a gaming community and the lack of pirates comprehension in general. so basically you are saying you want to wardec more nub corps for more easy kills and 12 mil a month is alot to you..... at no point was i stating that its hard to avoid wardecs. l2readtrd""fail is as fail does....."" forest gamer"
8/1/2011,"ok when bringing up a systems information it shows in the top left the system and all the colored dots. it would be great if those dots when cursor hovered over shows what they are.f11 system info:i think a solution to this other than abstract or non abstract (i forget which one seperates all the dots) would be able to ""pull"" it from it's location and be able to center screen it, or wherever is best decided by the player and able to zoom it. this would also have to work while in the scanner map and be able to be used just like it is while in f11 :: ie: be able to show your rotation.these 2 things imho would be a great asset and very useful while exploring / scanning and the like.or allow for a player(s) to be able to develop this and implement in-game."
8/1/2011,"heres the fact... there are already 1k+ vs 1k+ fleets and that means ccp needs to compinsate for these play styles (ie they need to make the fleets bigger) however this doesnt mean the larger fleets need to be boosted (although having an ""admiral"" for the fleet could allow for more focused and individualized boosts if the admiral has them suplimenting them and reoginizing them) also the fact is there are multiple system or larger engagements (gate camps etc.) and can see combat on both sides of a gate and see fleets split as they chase after the targets. as ccp is supposed to help players they are obligated to handle it in some way or another."
8/1/2011,*clears throat*my biggest gripe was that it was just a long ass alphabetized list. could it at least have been separated into basic categories?
8/1/2011,"i guess it's pretty safe to say he doesn't care about the opinion of most of the eve players, because most of the eve players did not vote all which means they also didn't vote for him.i think it's also quite delusional to believe he represents the opinions of those people who voted for him.he represents his own opinion and nothing else.he just claims that people voted for him because they had/have the same opinion.which is either incredibly naive or just more spin (i'm assuming the latter, but you can never be sure...)do you really believe he cared about anyone else's interests when he was sitting with a dev in a bar at 3 am, talking about how the game should develop?"

8/1/2011,who called you in this discussion
8/1/2011,"no, that's been made perfectly plain. just the vested interests you are involved with. but i'm glad to have it from the horse's mouth. might make the job of booting you lot out at the next csm election easier."
8/1/2011,"first of all, the scenario you speak of does not happen in eve for so many reasons. (do you know what a carrier's worth of light scout drones would do to a noob in a frigate?)secondly, if it did happen, that wouldn't make the noob a hero, unless the carrier was raping someone's momma or something.thirdly, and most illustrative of my point, do you think a nub in a rifter should be able to pin down a high-level veteran of the game flying one of the biggest ships in all of eve? see the imbalance? do you like that kind of imbalance?"
8/1/2011,"you did not anwser my question: can you dig it. that is to be answered individually. eve leave little to no place to feelings, it's the hardest mmo out there"
8/1/2011,i answered your question before you asked it.
8/1/2011,"can't help but to reply a little bityour suggestions are asinine if you really just sat down and thought about it. imagine the powers you just asked for. then imagine them with everyone else. then imagine how certain ships would be so ridiculously overpowered that everyone in eve would only fly 3 different ship. boring and broken is what you would have.removing ewar almost completely:c'mon get real. i could argue this but i really don't think it would help.one of the things you reiterate in your posts is the ability to be a hero. what does this mean? i know for a fact that you can, and in multiple ways. want to be the savior of newbies? do it. nothing stopping you but yourself. want to be han solo? wtf is stopping you? 2 days ago i solo'd three rifters in a merlin, i felt pretty damn epic.instead of reapproaching the rules of the game to give a more desireable outcome you instead just ask for hte game to be tailored to your personal needs (which won't even get you what you want). that's not game, at least not with multiple people.all you are doing is getting beat, plain and simple. you think its the rules of the game, but really, its just you."
8/1/2011,i did that in 2006 over the missile nerf and i still regret it. you will be back in eve but i tell you it take dedication to fly an ibis after having flowned a battleship...
8/1/2011,"which ones and why are they asinine?what powers did i ask for?i'm still not clear on which ""powers"" i asked for, but do tell. which 3 ships would everyone in eve fly?the only thing i advocated the removal of was interdiction, and, well, disrupting a ships ability to propel itself through space isn't exactly electronic warfare.being a hero, to me, means doing something to help someone else at risk and/or expense to myself, so, yes, it is entirely possible to be a hero in eve, but the survivability of such actions is really what is in question. you know for a fact that one can be a hero in eve? ok, how?what's stopping me? there's a neutral machariel and an exquror stopping me. there's a heavy interdictor stopping me. there's 2 rat battlecruisers and my limited cargohold stopping me. there's all sorts of things stopping me to the point where, taken all together, it is insurmountable.that's your pvp-focused view. i won't ask how many skillpoints you had versus them or how incompetent they were, just understand that frigates shooting at eachother all day long gets boring and some people want to do other things, and with the ability to survive doing them. you know what felt epic to me? flying my probe to 74-vza in my first month and coming back with 40 units of arkonor, but i was lucky. such activities are mostly ruled out by the current game dynamics.i have reapproached the rules of the game repeatedly. my conclusion is that they are imbalanced to the point where i, the player, cannot survive, letalone succeed, unless i play the way another person dictates i play. (i wouldn't really call that success.) that's not an experience i will pay for, but with a few changes, the experience could be made . . . fun.i'm getting beat like a one-armed man gets beat in a boxing match. thank you for your intelligent reply, though."
8/1/2011,"oh man, i shouldn't even bother with this cause its gonna be a time vampire, but, wth. class variants - even if you made this make sense from a rp perspective it would make the game literally unplayable for new players. that's badmake interdiction chance based - didn't they used to have this? it sucked b/c fights never happen. this is even worse now because of the inflation we have. we need ppl losing more ships, not less. your system only works in a game where ppl can't run away so easilymake it impossible to use a web and interdiction at the same time - see the great nano-nerfenergy neutralizer - 3 ships do this, and you see it coming. thats like complaining that ships with large cap bays shouldn't be able to neut smaller shipsremove skill restrictions from everything - game breaking, you can't get off this horse mid streamaggression mechanics (1-4)1. see wormholes. also, these mechanics are there to force people to play2. sure, i'm down with that (and i am -10)3. although this would be hilarious, 50% of eve would quit. this might go hand in hand with you only simiilar ship types argument, but carebears would be removed from this game4. this would be a lolercaust. imagine the trade hubs. speed, ewar immunity, newbie immunity, etc.your right, people would fly a variety still. but no ewar + nanoage means very very few ships are going to have the layouts to succeed.see belowironically you don't have a problem with tracking disrupt, tp and sensor damp. my guess is you haven't noticed them in battle and/or you don't play with others much.see cva. even han solo had the help of the rebel alliance ;)this is exactly what i am talking about with not understanding the rules. and obviously never or rarely come out on top. if you had, then you would have realized that when you start wining it is because you used the game mechanics to turn the situation to your advantage. in turn they may or may not be talented enough to start beating you. you want to play the game in a very specific way, but that is not how eve works. if it did it would be more like cod, but boring as hell for a pvp centered mmo.although you have an understanding of the mechanics of the game it is apperent that you don't know how to get what you desire from the game in a manner that you would call reasonable (which i call not understanding the ""rules""). honestly, this is effectively ""loosing"" the game. thankfully, you can always grow in eve, come back, and smite your enemies with a vengeance (literally if you want, lol)."
8/1/2011,"but . . . they could just fly bigger ships if they wanted to use bigger modules.you want people losing ships. also, what is the problem with people running away? also, have you flown many haulers or mining ships? they're killable before they can get away by even just 1 or 2 cruisers. i thought eve was a ""space"" game, not a close-quarters-spaceships-slugfest game.i'm sure it had something to do with people being too likely to survive.my complaint is that smaller ships shouldn't be able to single-handedly shut down all the active modules on a larger ship. that's all.for you, this is mid-stream. for a noob, this is the beginning. and, if you relaxed restrictions, noobs would be able to bridge the gap between abilities a little better by at least having the same equipment, if not using it as efficiently.the mechanic doesn't force someone to sit down at the computer, log onto eve online, and engage his fellow players. the player chooses that. it forces people to play a certain way, a way that gets them killed. i wasn't running away in my hurricane. i was attempting to gain a more advantageous position on the other side of the gate, from which to engage the enemy. eve makes you stand your ground, and that is often not a smart (nor fun) way to play.see, i think they'd fight back, and others would be able to help them more.i asked that my ship be allowed to do what it was conceived of and fitted to do, for the most part.ecm is just a little too powerful, since for the price of 1 module, you can effectively shut down maybe 8 or more. tps, tds, and dampeners have more effective counters. the ""ewar"" i have criticisms of do not have very effective counters. imagine if a star destroyer had webbed and scrammed the millenium falcon.i could probably get to the point of being able to fund my game time with plex before my free trial ended. this game is not hard for me. you're right. i know the mechanics, and i guess success for you and me are just different. beating up a noob isn't fulfulling for me, but i can't take on that dude in the curse at dodixie ix because of the game mechanics. i can't mine the good stuff in 74-vza because of the game mechanics. i can't do missions for a pirate faction because of the game mechanics. i can't do anything but grind in high sec without either kissing someone's ass (not gonna happen) or at nearly insurmountable inconvenience relative to grinding in high sec or kissing someone's ass for access. i already pay (paid) to play. i just want to be able to choose where and how i do that to a greater extent."
8/1/2011,where did you get this info? this would be very strange as they even use carbon technology for wod. art people are much easier to share than code-people.
8/1/2011,"recently had the misfortune of losing a ship and a pod in low sec the ship loss i had no problems with as i was very much pinned down but i felt my pod loss was due to a issue which people have else where reported (i.e. not being able to warp although spamming warp before and after being in your pod). of course i got pretty much the standard ""the logs show nothing"" answer from a number of gms so i requested a copy of said logs to verify this myself. i was told this was not allowed and i would like to suggest that the csm raise this issue with ccp. why can a paying costumer not get access to game server logs that involve him/her actions directly? i think getting access to these logs would reduce discontent with many a declined reimbursed petitions and/or make people more content with gm answers in these matters when they can have the same information as they have. to me it should be as easy as asking my phone company for list of my recent phone calls if i'm not happy with my phone bill or something. what do you all think?cheers!"

8/2/2011,"a ""nerf"" to local would be interesting. if it was definitely coming up on a set date, stocking up on combat scanner probes and expanded probe launchers might be profitable, as even in high sec people will suddenly want them.d-scan will become a hot topic too.realistically i don't know that removal of local completely would work for anything but wh space. due to stargates, and the presence of concord in high sec, i am guessing that the suggested nerf to local is to add a delay. the lower the sec status, the longer the delay. plus this would leave wh-space with one of it's unique aspects.cloaking is not broken, it is not suddenly turned into an exploit if someone is not staring at their computer screen with their hands on the keys.ps: should bump this thread when needed so it stays near the top, specifically to try and cut down on the deluge of threads on this very topic."

(no pun intended)so, as long as someone buys all the skillbooks from the market before they instantly max them out, it's all good? and, skillbooks are bought from npc's, for the most part, so that contributes nothing to the economy. as for the time factor . . . why make people wait? we're all dying pieces of meat. time is our most precious resource. maybe we don't want to blow it waiting for the balls to drop on a cartoon character on our computer monitor.isk buying is not just influenced by the desire of people to get isk for plex, but by the desire of people to get plex with isk, so if there's a lot of isk lying around, people will just go ahead and fork over a little more for a plex. also, they will invest their isk in new accounts for new characters to increase the number of skillpoints they are accumulating . . . i.e., they'll buy skillpoints with that excess isk. in fact, this is probably the whole reasoning for ccp creating plex, to kill excess isk out of the game economy by having people trade them for skillpoints that they can't ever use, because, after all, they're only one person.the richest person in eve can buy a titan pilot today with isk from the character bazaar, but thanks for playing."
8/2/2011,"passed econ? really? then you must have cheated on the exam as you skipped over the part about a closed economy. why is it hard for you to understand the concept that buying a character is fine because somebody paid the sp training time to get those skills like titan piloting.** let me break it down to you all easy like:make it able to buy sp and you will have a pile of titan pilots overnight. this scenario cannot happen with just character bazaar sellers because the growth is organic. (as the game was intended) if they sell the toon, the they transferred the ability to pilot a titan to the buyer. zero sum game.noooo it's not like buying a toyota i'm afraid. a toyota car cost the company some money to produce. this money is in system. buying sp is using external money to interact with the system. like conterfeiting money in real life. get it?**for those of you who have yet to enter university, i apologize, i do not expect you to understand how economies work. i will explain it to you in a less sarcastic way, assuming that you know nothing:why is character purchase ok and doesn't hurt the economy/play balance:!: assume it costs 6 months to train for a titan2: everyone who joins the game is needs to pay 6months worth of training time to fly a titan.3: once trained, you will need to buy a titan, with isk.4: a character farmer, joins, plays and pays ccp for 6 months of game, training for a titan.5: assume the # of titan pilots in the whole eve universe is 100. (this is an example make that number whatever you want)6: at the end of 6 months, there will be 101 titan pilots.key point7: if user sells his titan pilot character, there will still be 101 titan pilots in the universe. all is good.if you allow sp buying aka counterfeiting, aka meta-gaming the economy:1: ever person who has real money to spend in playing this game, will pay to be able to pilot a titan immediately2: the number of titan pilots in new eden will shoot up from 100 to 100+++ in a very short time, depending only on the willingness of people to pay real cash to 'enjoy' eve. not on the real natural growth and development of a character playing in the game naturally.3: add to this the ability for people to buy isk with real money (though moderated via plex prices) you will have titans everywhere overnight.... no, actually more likely as titans cannot be built that easily, you will have a sharp spike in titan demand with no supply, causing prices of titans to shoot up uncontrollably.this is the reason why everyone who argues with the op has no understanding of economics. the real world have laws against this kind of system abuse. (counterfeiting laws - ie laws to prevent money creation out of nowhere) if we allowed counterfeiting, then inflation would skyrocket and you would have a zimbabwe situation.the weak toyota car analogy is a complete fallacy. that person was essentially arguing that if he wants to pay for a benefit or luxury, then he should be able to. what is is blind to realizing is that buying a car in real life means using the real life currency which was 'earned' somehow (by working a job presumably) his analogy is more correct if he changed it to be ""i should be able to buy a toyota with monopoly money."" or ""i should be able to buy a phd degree in economics without actually studying because i know the dean of the school.***for advanced scholars only---***these are not perfect analogies, as they technically still take place in the economic system of real life. in the car case, the company loses revenue for giving away a free car, and in the university degree one, you have a person who has a degree but is clueless about economics. to be technically accurate, the analogies should be ""snap my fingers and get a new toyota out of thin air via magic, and get an university education via a brain dump instantaneously. both premises would lead to a very chaotic world, either a utopia, or a 'brave new world'"
8/2/2011,"ok, so, there is really no such thing as a ""closed economy"". it is theoretically possible, but practically, no matter how hard we have thought about it, we cannot come up with a way to keep value/energy/information from entering and leaving a system, and by some derivative of the law of entropy, the value/energy/information (currency) density and distribution within a system and outside but adhesive to that system are always in the process of normalizing. anyway, here's where we're diverging in our understanding. you think that people pay their ""time"" to ccp to get skillpoints. i think that people pay their ""money"" to ccp to get skillpoints. so, you think that people should die a little more before getting their skillpoints and i think that people should just pay a little more before getting their skillpoints. but, let me ask you this: what if someone pre-paid ccp for 10,000 accounts for long enough to train them all to fly a titan? there would still be a glut of titan pilots in your system.it wouldn't happen, though, because the scarce commodity in the equation is not time, which is always flowing, but rather is money, which is not always being earned and is not always being spent. either way, the price of ""earning"" a titan pilot would be measured in money, not time, because an infinite number of titan pilots could be trained in the same span of time that one titan pilot could be trained. it would just take an infinite amount of money."

8/2/2011,"i think you are playing down the ""time"" factor a bit too much sir.while ""time"" may be in constant motion the way people wish to spend their ""time"" also accounts for why we see so many supercapital pilots (or lack of, relatively speaking). to strictly train a character to use such a ship in an effective manner requires a large chunk of ""time""... ""time"" which a person may or may not be willing to spend as he/she can train up a plethora of much more ""useful"" skills given the same frame of ""time."" now, one can get around this by creating an alt and training it up... but realistically few want to create such a thing not completely due to the money involved, but for the simple fact that it would require a large investment of ""time"" to get that character to do one thing... and given that we humans prefer more immediate gratification over long term rewards that kind of investment of ""time"" just isn't something that many can rationalize.this is what makes supercapital-capable characters so coveted within the character baazar... not that people have spent x amount of money to train that character that way (though, that certainly is a factor), but that people have spend x amount of ""time"" to get that character that way.now...i vastly prefer the current skill system because it limits me. i can't ""grind up"" my power so i am forced to ""use my head"" on how i can best utilize what skills, equipment, and people i have available. moreover, once i have ""perfect skills"" in an area i can't extract any more of an advantage out of my character that a newbie can't also get in roughly the same amount of time. in fact, because the skill system is set up to provide ""diminishing returns"" after a certain point, a newbie can be flying at about 75 to 90% of my effectiveness in less time than it took me to get ""perfect skills.""for me, this isn't about ""protecting the older player's advantages."" this is about preserving ""the journey""... the ""development process""... that one must take to ""see"" the game for what it is. this is about preventing the ""bar"" from being arbitrarily raised on many different walks of life within the game because some people can't show some patience. this is about making people use their heads to get ahead rather than buy their way to the top and expect to be great. i say no to microtransactions for skill points!!"
8/2/2011,"the converse also applies. non-meta-keys should not function as meta keys.almost every other game (and app) on the planet uses an object-action syntax: you select the object on which you want to act, and then you press the button to choose the action. not the other way around.consistent: i select a celestial, and then hit 'a' to align.inconsistent: i hit 'a' to align, and then align to the next thing i select (or to the thing i select when holding down 'a').use of the control meta (meta, not toggle) makes sense when i'm going to be doing the same thing to lots of different object in rapid succession (like locking). even in such a case, holding down the meta key and not triggering an action (clicking, keystroke) should do either nothing or nothing significant.in contrast, hotkeys make sense when you apply multiple actions to a single object. like 'align' then 'warp'. or f1, f2, f3 to fire off your scram, web and guns. but this requires hotkeys actually trigger the action, not function as modifier keys on an 'action-to-come'."
8/2/2011,or they could just use the key up event like every other program on the planet...*facepalm*
8/2/2011,supported. the gates are not my enemy!
8/2/2011,this is something that has been brought up before...by myself even but i cannot seem to find the threads. don't care to either way. this is a new thread.simply put...a ship blows up then it should deal damage to every other ship around it within proximity. proximity or radius of the blast from the exploding ship should be determined by the size of the ship itself. obviously the larger the ship the bigger the explosion radius. the math for the explosion can work exactly like missiles or smartbombs.oh...and yes...the bigger the ship the bigger the damage. i think a titan exploding should do significant damage to a battleship within close enough range. maybe enough to even destroy a battleship that is too close.
8/2/2011,"it's an interesting idea, but won't work given the aoe mechanics of eve. if you get concorded for using smartbombs in highsec, then what happens if you self destruct in front of jita with a battleship?it has too many ways to be abused. but if you can think of a way to get around these obvious abuses, go continue."
8/2/2011,the simplest answer would be to not self destruct in front of jita or at any station if you don't want to be concorded. however...if your ship self destructs then what is concord gonna do? you are in a pod. you may have a 15 minute timer but you are in a pod. i guess the real problem would be people using this mechanic to destroy other ships undocking then then subsequently looting them. so i see a valid problem there. so...simple fix...disable self destruct within a specific range of stations and gates. lets say 250km. now it can be used as a valid griefing tactic in the middle of nothing.
8/2/2011,"supported..but1. damge should not be done on self destruct.2. damage and damge radius based on hull size3. damage inflicted takes into acount signature radius of ship being affected.(frigs take less dmg)4. damage is not huge.no doing this in jita would not be more effective than fitting 8 smartbombs on your battleship...damage done needs to be less on frigates and tackle or will be to harsh on them in larger fleets. this is why dd's changed and look how much more varience sub cap fleets have now. so damage needs to take into acount the sigradius of the ship getting hit.damage should nto be large, at most a few smart bomb pulses worth.think this would be great and help seperate the blob. would make fleets act more as individual wings than one giant blob(this will not make fleets smaller..just mroe intresting.think this would add a lot of fun to the game... supported."
8/2/2011,"i think this is a brilliant idea. by manoeuvring in-corp alts next to haulers / cov-ops / pods and blowing them up, i can scoop up the wrecks of the nearby ships affected by my splash damage all with no security hits."
8/2/2011,damage needs to be large enough so as to make it worth it. the whole point is to separate fleets out a bit. change up the composition of fleets a little as well. if the damage is not high enough then players will just counter it with more logi. there is no reason why damage should not be done on self destruct. if not then people will just self destruct larger ships just to avoid the damage they might do to friendlies. my previous post already corrects the issue in jita or any gate/station for that matter. and i have already stated that damage should work like missiles and smartbombs so that takes care of number 3. and as stated...yes...damage is based on the size of the ship.
8/2/2011,however you feel like exploiting the system is entirely up to you. that is the glory of eve. however if it makes you feel any better you can simply make it so that self destructing causes you to take a security hit if you damage somebody else.
8/2/2011,"i would get all my alts together in jita, undock them together, then set them all on self destruct. it would be glorious."
8/2/2011,try reading the thread before you post. i will say it again...change self destruct so it cannot be done within 250km of a gate or station.
8/2/2011,"that's all very well but still needs refinement since it's going to lead to all sorts of opportunities to deliberately lower someone's security status simply because their ship was destroyed.i'm not smacking here, just covering the issues i see with the proposal.i remember the hilarity of splash damage and people even managing to pod themselves with their own splash damage from their last volleys as their ship exploded"
8/2/2011,"the amount of damage done is very important aspect of this proposed change and needs to be carefully balanced.we want to encourage ships to spread out and yet do not want to overly penalize smaller ships or introduce grief tactics while introducing a fun and interesting mechanic.too much damage and exploding ships would become a negative feature prone to abuse. it could also negatively affect the variety of ships in a fleet. also it could be unduly harsh on close range set ups, tacklers, drones, or other close range ships.the damage should be small and really small for small ships. we dont want an exploding battle ship to wipe the field of tackle or drones. thus the damage reduction for being small sig radius should be huge. a battle ship should take more damage.the additional damage done should not kill a battleship in a fleet fight. at most it damage them slightly and makes logi pilots work a bit harder. this additional damage may be small but it is on multiple ships. spreading out will make your logi pilots happier.we also do not want to have fleets never bunch up, we want it to be a tactical choice. i bunch up because i want all my fleet at the same range to primary and to be aligned to what i say and that is worth the penalty of aoe explody ships is a much better option than never bunching up.also a small damage amount is not detrimental to the game and can be modified later. a high damage amount can be detrimental to game balance and fun."
8/2/2011,again...make the damage work just like missiles and smartbombs do. smaller the ship and the faster ships are moving the less damage is done. the bigger the ship and the slower it is moving the more damage that is done. drones being as small as they are will take damage depending on the size of said exploding ship. i guess this would simply act as a smartbomb that goes off when the ship dies but the smartbomb damage is based on the ship size itself.
8/2/2011,yupto be clear i think this is a great idea that would add a lot to the game.people worried about griefers and such are imagining mass amounts of dmg and epic chain reactions that simply would not happen if this is balanced to any degree.this would be a fun addition that would make eve more intresting and fun to play.and really that is what it is all about.i also believe it would be easy to implement using current smart bomb coding.
8/2/2011,balancing is an issue that can be left up to ccp though. no reason we should be doing that kind of leg work. especially when we don't usually have all the facts in that regard. but yeah...the original idea was to get fleets to move around a bit more and stop being so blobbed together. also the idea itself just makes sense from a realistic perspective. ship explodes...it does damage.
8/2/2011,"hey, i *like* it, and i fly the small stuff! similar to what i was thinking!"
8/2/2011,"whoa, deja vu!this exact same topic is on the front page of f&i.link1) self destruct should most certainly make an explosion. who the hell would design a ""make my ship explode"" system that helps make sure your ship -just barely- explodes?take star trek lore for instance. when they self destruct, the ship is perfectly content until the very end. at which point, the warp core flushes all the contents at once, causing a catastrophic matter/antimatter explosion. not a piddly firecracker in space.self destruct is about denying the enemy of your ship and equipment.2) accredit anything destroyed, and anything destroyed by the resulting explosions, to the original trigger. that's not to say a single self destructing bs in jita will get 500 kms. but their standings loss will reflect 500 kills in high sec.2.5) on second thought, just don't hand out kms for anything destroyed by an exploding ship. if you didn't land an actual killing shot, you don't get credit."

8/2/2011,"miners would love this feature also, but in pvp i can see that it could bring unfair advantage to for example gate campers.some people could mine bookmarks around gate/station and be always be able to warp next to their target in seconds.i support this feature but only if bookmars are visible inside 100km range and there is cap of 10 bookmarks what can be seen at once (this because someone could still mine 100 bookmarks around gates, share them with corpmates and have scout sitting in gate yelling to which bookmark rest should warp to).so in short... great idea - easily abused."
8/2/2011,"mine bookmarks?do you mean driving to all the conceivable spots around a gate and building a library of bms so you can wt(a reasonable amount) to a wt position?any fleet scout worth his salt already does this in their corp's sphere of influence. its a godsend to have an inty pilot who can say to their fc, ""who do want primary? count to 10 and warp to me"" and deliver the fleet to that primary because they have a bm close to that positiontl;dr - the bm mechanic already exists in-game... seeing the bms on-grid would simply make it easier to use said bms"

8/2/2011,"something i noticed bc slaughter cruisers (dessies probly should do the same to frigs but dont for some reason), but bc get murdered in a slug fight with a bs, and a bs cant track a cruiser (arbi td bonus pwns btw).i say the cane and drake may need a slight nerf but t1 cruisers are in need of a buff. also why fly a t1 cruiser when you can fly a t2 cruiser these days cost is not much of an issue."
8/2/2011,"a hole that is perfectly filled today with battlecruisers. can you actually think of a hole (a role in a fleet which isn't filled with any ship today?) because if you can't, then your op basically boils down to ""i want to see more t1 cruisers in fleets because they are pretty"""
8/2/2011,"the thing is that you refuse to understand small but important points:who needs domis or ravens in large fleets?what alliance/fc calls hyperions instead of pest/maels/abbadonswho is dumb enough to fly other thing at cruiser size than ruppy?yes you can use tons or nice words and beautiful phrases to tell everyone and his cat that a t1 frig is useful in fleets...are they used in? -noes !!and so on, the balance is not easy but to start you must admit this important little thing you refuse to: every thing that isn't a nyx, aeon, thany, (insert name amarr carrier), heavy interdictors (not all), some logistics, some reccons, pirate frigs, canes and drakes, you stay docked or you're just advised to pick something else. (lol arty mega/abby)balance means more diversity and what diversity do you see? -would be nice if you'd show some because i don't. i've got tired of getting spanked with my brutix/myrmidon, just trained for the cane and since then i'm having fun, true fact.why? because those work fine for the role someone can/want/expect from them, everything else is trash for clueless/noobs until you open your eyes, try by yourself and see the huge difference between those ships and all the rest you can see in the market. if there are 100 ships in the game then 20 are just enough since every thing else than those 20 is less efficient, difficult to fit properly, very hard skilling for less efficiency and being more fragile, nobody wants them in their fleets they're noobs choice or hangar queens.you can buy them, hit stuff and kill stuff but that's all, what example do you need to understand that has simple has it is: not used in current game pvp mechanics = useless, waste of pixels coding resources whatsoever so, you're ok to let them be just like they are?-seriously, i'm starting to think we don't play the same game or if you ever un dock (with no disrespect)try to offer solutions instead of utopia's?"
8/2/2011,"i disagree they need changing.t1 ships have it where it counts...costi can fly expendable t1 cruisers all day and lose them and not worry. also new players can use them and be really effective. the reason they are nto flown more is because most players with the skill points to fly t2 can afford to fly t2 ships.in a fight i can fly a 150mil hac, or a 100mill bc, or a 20mill t1.if i can afford to lose a50mil i will fly the mroe expensive ship. it does nto mean that the t1 is not an astounding bargin for what it does...mearly that i can afford to through isk away. i still fly t1 in gangs where we expect to lose or are attempting to harass another fleet by denieng good kills.you want to beet a fleet of expensive t3 ships...get a bunch of t1 cruisers and kill em. even if you kill one and you all die....you still win.t1 cruiserss are also great for suppport and quick refits. i die and need to reship fast i buy an t1 cruiser and get back into the fight fast. if i die again who cares.also some t1's hit amazingly hard. take the e-war cruisers. for 20mil sik i can take millsions of isk worth of ships out of a given fight. i can jam them, disrupt them or boost my own fleets damage.t1 ships are great!"
8/2/2011,"significant skill gap, very large cost gap, and actually worse in a lot of situations than a battlecruiser is. chosing between hac and battlecruiser is actually a very good model for how the system should be - both are good in different circumstances.by the way, several people seem to be under the mistaken impression that the whole aim of this proposal is to crowbar cruisers into existing fleet compositions - it's not. it's meant to be a buff to cruiser sized gangs and to make bc vs cruiser something that actually has to be weighed up, rather than ""lol bc every time.""... which is exactly the problem. did you read the op at all? cruisers being relegated to newbie trash is not a good situation and certainly not good design.oh hi, i'm a battlecruiser, i do everything your ****ty little non-blackbird cruiser does and better, for similar price.btw if you're paying 100mil for your bcs, you're doing something hilariously wrong."
8/2/2011,"no large fleet call for t1 cruisers..the reason is not because t1 cruisers suck. it is because per pilot they do less than other ships types. 30hacs vs 30cruisers the hacs win(assuming no e-war and similar ship fittings)fleet types are ment to win fights so you bring your best ship that you can afford. most players that can fly t2 can afford t2.so cruisers are not seen as a main fleet ship.that said t1 cruisers are great and fill a very important role in evethey are cheap. dirt cheap, most corps provide free cruisers. if i cant afford t2..i can fly t1. say i have been grinding sov warfare for a week and have not isked up. a fleet call goes out and i cant afford a brand new zealotbut i could fly say an arbitrator and still help out.t1 can also be used in isk wars. if a gang is piloting expensive ships and we go fight them with t1swe may lose more ships or even the fight but if we kill even one we win the isk war.t1 ships are also readily available most station. so if i get blowed up, i grab a t1 cruiser and get back into the fight, if a die again i can afford it but i still help out.also t1 ships damage per isk spent is amazing, as are the effects caused by e-war cruisers.t1 cruisers are cheapthat is there purpose."
8/2/2011,"skill gap goes away over time, most 0.0 pilots can fly both. there is an equal choice between cruisers and battle cruisers. if i want a cheap gang i fly t1's.for example an allaince is harasing use with hac or t3 gangs. we know they are looking for good fights and epic kills. so we fly t1 ships and kill them. we kill a few and they kill more but we still win on the isk war. do you think they will hang around and keep getting losses? yay we win..all thanks to the t1 cruisers.would i use them to contest sov or in a fight we really need to win? no...that is not there job..that fight is worth investing isk in. diffrent ships diffrent roles.they are not newbie trash. cheap is a good thing. this has ntohign to do with skill points. a fully skilled player can still fly a t1 cruiser and a t1 cruiser can still be the best tool for that job. why is the t1 cruiser the best tool? because it's cheap yet crazy effective at that cost. how many crusers to take on a hac? 1.5-3? at most..and i can field almost 10 of them for the same cost...?or in a fleet fight they kill 5 t1 cruisers for every hac we kill...who wins....sorry your right, 70mil for an unfitted tier 3 battle cruiser. how silly of me...that makes all the diffrence...no..wait i can still field multiple t1's for that price.t1 are not ""newbie trash"" they are very good ships and dominate on a value basis. the cost compared to what you get with them is astounding."
8/2/2011,i agree that t1 cruisers need a buff but some still perform the role they were meant for i have flown mallers which have played bait for ppl to get ganked by in more expensive ships coz i have a stupid tank i have sat 60-100k off a gate in a caracal during a camp my blackbird fit has jammed things down almost as well as a falcon some are broken some are not i also agree if u only get a 10k differance in ehp between a caracal and drake ur doing something wrong t1 cruiser if fit for a role will do that role and thats it now i would like to see maybe better agility or velocity but not much as for a bc nerf only a few really need nerfing the drake for instance i often wondered if changing the required cruiser skill from 3 to 4 and maybe involving it in the bcs bonuses might help to balance it
8/2/2011,"no, not the kind of crystal that allows you to shoot at a ship. strip miner modules can't fire at ships anyways.while i was mining today in my hulk main and orca alt, i was thinking about all the possible ways in trying to combat mining bots. i was loading my mining crystals and then fired up the strip miners at the nearest asteroids. then it hit me: why not introduce a special mining crystal that deals direct damage to asteroids? on top of that, introduce the chance of a damage cloud depending on how much ore was left on the rock?i don't know. perhaps someone else already thought of this before i did and gave up on it. but hey, it seems like a good way to get around the nasty concord that anti-bot gankers always hated.<insert ore name> damage crystal i""x"" units lost per cycle (the amount of units lost is dependent on the type of ore targeted)20% chance of damage cloud forming per cycle (25% chance for t2 variants).damage cloud deals 250hp per second on any ship within 10km of where the asteroid use to be.10 ehp per crystal (crystal suffers 2 hp of damage per cycle)of course, to limit abuse of this mechanic, i would recommend limiting the number of damage clouds to 3 per belt. what do you guys think? a good concept that may need a little tweaking or a dead idea?"
8/2/2011,"so wait...- you want to deprive the mining bots of asteroids to mine?that's called ""mine the asteroids faster than them"".- you want to cause aoe damage, but not get concorded for it?i don't think so."
8/2/2011,"well, you have to admit, it would certainly get pirates interested in mining. fit some covetors with t2 versions of the crystals, and just destroy all the asteroids in newbie systems, forcing said newbies into lower sec systems.or sneak into a system an enemy corp uses and deplete their resources, forcing them to go to the next system which your corpmates are waiting on the other side of the gate.without the need to haul or hold any ore, four or five people in procurers could easily (and cheaply) cause some interesting problems."
8/2/2011,"an interesting idea, with the obvious and massive flaw that it would be used roughly 10% to combat bots and 90% to grief miners."
8/2/2011,not supported.
8/2/2011,"main problem i see from here is that sooner or later a specific ratio will be found for how to decrease the system ss best. from there onward corps will just focus on making the dead end systems highly lucrative (even if they use couple - these are still ""one gate systems"") or move all farming grounds into single constellation making logistics and defence much much simpler."
8/2/2011,"ccp wil not do that they need that wie cant ern inaf isk and truing harder, last updates showed that."
8/2/2011,as it stands in order to create a fitting u do not own u have to import it using a third party program which is great but third party programs can't get the price of the ship accurate within a region they take averages as a total cost so when producing fits for corp members i have found that i am charging them more when other modules will suffice or when they won't they are breaking there fits to replace them for a cheaper alternative also although i can import the fit sometimes it is easier to just feed it into a fitting screen i found this an issue by trying to make low skill point ships covering several ship classes to help corp members who were fitting badly resulting in there ship loss as i see it if the feature to create a fitting for a ship without importing from a third party program would stop the need to recreate fits in eft(or similar third party program) based on price without having to alt tab/buy a second monitor and make it easier to help new players understand why a different fit is better or why certain modules can be easily changed on some fits but not on others it may generally benefit newer players
8/2/2011,"i like this cheese idea, i propose that cheese be put into the game as a commodity along with a new collumn in the overwiew called ""superiority"". whoever has the most cheese is ranked as the most superior on the overview.cheese shall be consumed at a rate of 50 units/your level of ""classyness"" skill (thats right a new skill) per hour you spend in space. for example having no class whatsoever would cause you to consume 50 units of cheese per hour, and having it trained at level v, 10 units of cheese per hour.the possession of wine and or crackers (also new commodities that need to be added to the game) halve your rate of cheese consumption until they run out. wine and or crackers are consumed at a rate of 5 per hour regardless of your level of classif you run out of cheese and you attempt to perform an action aurora insults you."
8/2/2011,here is the old topic:manual flight control
8/2/2011,"eve is not a flight sim. eve is not a twitch game. this was pointed out back then, and time and time and time and again in every other thread about this. do you have some kind of learning difficulty that makes you unable to comprehend this?"
8/2/2011,"while this idea is great in theory, it doesn't make much sense in reality. aside from the fact that it would cause immense technical problems, there really isn't any feasible situation it would ever be needed except in 1 vs 1 fighting. again, this is only useful if you have a ship fitted with close-range weapons, because if your weapons can only fire long-range, or even mid-range the target would be too far away to see in the background of space and anyway, if you are firing long to mid range, there's no need for a cockpit's view. another thing to take into account is that for this kind of control scheme to work properly, then you'd have to be viewing from a cockpit perspective, which almost never happens, you always need to have a full 360 degree view especially if you are in a fight with more than two people, and since this is usually the case, nobody would ever use it. for those two reasons above it wouldn't make any sense to implement this control scheme in eve. i don't think many people would use it because it opens them up to too many vulnerabilities, from not having a complete view of the battlefield, to limiting you to close-range weapons and possibly to a very very fast ship. that being said, i really love flight sims and the whole idea of manual flight control, but between the technical problems and unfeasibly i don't think it"
8/2/2011,eve is not a flight sim.-1
8/2/2011,yes it would be awesome to be able to manually control ships. finer controls for navigation as opposed to this extremely inaccurate click on a spot in space and maybe go in that general direction crap. smaller frigates would especially benifit from this due to thier general higher speeds. obviously less useful to the larger and much slower ships.
8/2/2011,"yes, it would be awesome to break the server and have ccp commit massive amounts of dev time to a feature that has no real place in the game."
8/2/2011,"you're flying a supertanker, not an f-22."
8/2/2011,tl;dr - its too many possible inputs coming from players to be feasible within this current century with the way eve (and any 'decent' mmo) is designed.
8/2/2011,"this is a very common suggestion, which is often shot down.1) the current camera view, -is- what your character sees. they aren't sitting in a cockpit watching out the front. they are sitting inside a goo pod, plugged into the computer like the matrix. what they experience, is fed to them by remote camera drones orbiting your ship.2) the player, sitting at their desk in front of their keyboard, is more like captain kirk/picard/sisko/janeway/archer. you are telling the character (who has hours of training time in spaceship operation) what to do via the keyboard and mouse. you say ""put us in orbit of that target"", and the character executes that command to the best of his training and abilities.3) there's already a sh!tload of lag when you get 500 vs 500 battles. and that's just the occasional ""orbit"" and ""keep at"" commands going back and forth. change that to 50,000 ""wwwwaaaassssdddd"" commands every minute, and the servers will literally burst into flames."

8/2/2011,"firstly, ccp hacks. they can do anything they want.secondly, this skill would just make people bring in more and more dps, to the point where players would be bringing cnrs and nightmares and **** just to put their opponent down quickly enough, and without so much fear of being perma-scrammed by a ****ing ibis and hotdropped on. also, alpha damage would become more important, as would the ability to strike quickly, without warning, so fofs, smartbombs, and ""aggressive"" drones would gain in importance.ultimately, people would pvp far more, because the risk would be diminished. soloists could actually go in and take on a gatecamp in a full fledged battleship and it wouldn't be an insta-win for the campers because of their win modules warp scramblers."
8/2/2011,amazingly bad idea showing a remarkable lack of thought on the part of the op.
8/2/2011,"while technically yes a representative is supposed to represent their constituents, any body like the csm should have representatives from each constituency in equal amounts so that everybody gets represented equally. l2politics.edit: let me also add that theory aside, even in real life there is a representative from each constituency, the number of representatives (with their voting weight) differ depending on how many of a certain constituency there is. so for example (and these numbers are completely hypothetical) if 60% of the players are high sec, 20% from low sec, 10% from null sec and 10% from whs, that means in a team of 10 representatives, 6 should be from high-sec, 2 should be from low sec, and 1 from each null sec and whs."

8/3/2011,"i understand both point of view:- afk cloak is in the game so stfu and adapt or die- afk cloak is a cheatbut eve if the game is accept this mechanism there is a problem int the balance between risk and the capacity of the afk cloaker:a simple scenario: you see somebody in your local you take your pvp ship and go for it :) but no way to found it.so you make a pve fleet to warp in case of.at the moment one of the best way to rats it's to use t3 ship so it's around 1b ship.because of that guy in local you check your overview for ship incoming and probe if is afk or not it doesn't change anything and it's ok.now if the guy use for exemple a covert ship, with covert cyno. you warp into anomaly the guy warp cloaky in the same anomaly as you.and now he discrupt or scramble you because you have not a missile boat and you need to get close to the target so you can't be align.you are scramble he opens his cyno and 4 bombers pop. you scream to everybody to warp in but you are already dead. (so 1b ship :'()your fleet arrive kill all the bombers the guy with the covert cyno (4*30m + 30m) and you kill for 150m.so compare to investment it's nothing and it means that you can't farm alone to at least get revenge.stated to that, for me there is just a problem with the way cloaky ship works.for the afk if guy as to uncloak every 30 minutes, it will be fair, if the guy cannot use the directionnal scan when cloaky, it's fair if he cannot use the anno scanner it's fair too.but at the moment you can scan somebody taking no risk and be safe as long as you are cloaky warp on a guy scramble him kill him and go :'("

8/3/2011,"closed systems do exist. we create them as theoretical constructs. in such systems you have to abide by the ruled of the system. like chess. you are essentially arguing that you can win a chess match by punching your opponent in the face, causing them to forfeit the match ( and you happen to be mike tyson ). sure, you can but then you only won because you employed tactics outside of the established rules of the system /game. the rules is thisyou pay ccp x dollars a month to play and train 1 account. everyone trains at the same speed. aha yes, but you would have 10000 separate individual titan pilots all which took 6 months to train and can all do nothing else but fly titans. in your world you could have 1 pilot who can fly titans, fly jump freighters, and have maxxed out skills everywhere in 1 day. this is impossible in the current system no matter how much money you pay or accounts you have. no one player in eve has maxxed everything skills. none. and nor should there be. unless they have been playing over 16 years. you see the difference right? every one toon, farmed or not, trains 1 skill at a time at a set rate. no simultaneous multiple training allowed. that is the rule. why should you be allowed to catchup? you can't catchup to bill gates or steve jobs. they will always be richer than you if you both keep your money at the same bank. thankfully they buy things and have hobbies that burn significantly more $ than your humble lifestyle. many people signed on to play this system or game that ccp set out. many are still playing. your change is like proposing to change the rules of chess to boxing-chess halfway through a chess tournament. we don't want to play boxing chess. if you do go play it in wow or diablo3 or something else."
8/3/2011,"and others, like me, dislike it for the exact same reason.yes, i am having fun. yes, i can fly of lot of stuff (by now). yes, i can manufacture / mine / reprocess / shoot / etc a lot (by now). and still, eve online is the game of 'not yet'. there is sooo much you can do, and every time you feel like doing something else, you can't. you have to train it first. and by the time you're done training, your mood probably shifted and now you want to do something else. it's not about 'catching up', it's about being able to do in the sandbox what you want to do without 'artificial' boundaries.while this feeling gets diminished with every skill point you gain, it is a huge problem for people who are just starting out. we already have a system that lets you gain the first 1.6m sp at double the rate, so it is already alleviated a bit, but i can easily see why new players dislike the system. if i had discovered eve earlier on and paid ccp the amount needed for (for instance) 12 months of game time, i would have had that much more skill points. do i need to do anything to get those skill points? nah, only making sure your queue doesn't empty. would you have noticed me playing a year sooner? probably not. how much does the game loose out on if i pay ccp for a year and only log in to change my skills? i'd say, the way i'm playing, not much, if anything. in fact, most ppl take a break from eve every now and then, and as long as their subscription lasts, they keep training. you don't get to enjoy my presence, but i still get the sp.what, effectively, happens to the game when training afk? the player gets more sp, the game itself changes nothing, zero, nada. i therefor fail to see what would be so bad about buying sp (and here's the important part:) up to a certain point.it would be bad indeed if everyone could, overnight, fly a titan, marauder, hulk, t3, everything. it would, however, enable the new guys a way to either be (mechanically, they still need to learn to operate it properly) good at something in short order, or get lots of stuff to do without having to wait ages before they have a bit of freedom to do what they want. that way, they can actually explore those avenues and decide if they like what they see, instead of giving up because the game frustrates them every turn they take by tantalizingly showing them what they _could_ do, but can't...there is ofc. the crowd that indeed won't play because they can't 'catch up', you will not reach them with this scheme, but i think you will see less ppl leave because they can't do what they want, not because the game doesn't offer them the option, but because the game tells them they can't do it yet.as soon as ppl have found out in what direction they want to go they can create a plan and become very good at that, but i still remember my early days where i didn't play for days, not because i didn't like the game, but because i was waiting for skills to finish."
8/3/2011,"so, you just gave an example of a ""closed"" system and then gave an example of how said system is, in fact, not a closed system, then offered us the opportunity to make a moral judgement on someone exploiting the openness of that system. unless you have multiple accounts, which is one example of how eve is not a closed system. another? selling plex for isk. another? having more friends who play with you than the next guy. being smarter than other players. having more time to play. botting . . . there is already imbalance that can be exploited in a number of ways. i propose to you that if there was such a great demand for skillpoints, the system would already see people investing what resources they have into generating more skillpoints. me? i don't want to pay $10,000 to be a cyber-god. i just don't want to wait 3 months to fly a skiff around low sec. and, can i get a pink camouflage paintjob on that (or maybe a bullseye)?somewhat true. one cannot buy a totally max skilled player, currently. however, in the current system, you can have 1 player who can fly titans and jump freighters simultaneously. in truth, you're only gimping people who don't have the time and money to run such a setup by disallowing accelerated skillpoint accumulation. rich people will find ways to gain advantage. they're good at that, hence, they're rich. they do it in real life.i hate to put this to you, and to put it to you in such a harsh way, but if i assasinated bill gates or steve jobs, i winzordlolpwnwtfed them. i winned them! life is a ****ed up little game that way. that's why we play video games, instead. also, if i make a better personal computer than steve jobs or a better operating system than bill gates, i winned them! your analogy fails spectacularly . . . but that's the best way to fail; i think.different chess tournaments have different ""ground rules"" which appeal to different players much like high sec, low sec, null and wormhole space in eve. the difference with chess is that it is a much, much, much simpler game and there is a much harder ""level cap"" on chess that really hasn't changed since the creation of the game. i don't have a problem with keeping eve perfectly static, but if you are advocating that, then you are advocating rolling eve back to it's original build. otherwise, you accept that it should change and are just arbitrarily dictating which changes you think are acceptable.and, i hit level 6 draenei shaman, yesterday."
8/3/2011,"somewhat? totally true i think. and getting that character who can fly everything will take years of training. as it should. in your world you can get these uber characters in a day by using real money. and that's the whole problem isn't it? allow this and you have instant uber characters. it's not the increase of titan (or whatever pilots) that is a problem ( that's just equivalent to a birth rate in real life ) it's the allowing of super players that's a no no. but here is where you continue to fail your econ. money and wealth are internal to the game of life. getting rich is still playing by the rules internal to the system. does counterfeiting count as getting rich? sure but it's breaking the rules that everyone else has the play by, savvy? if you don't get this, then you never will. luckily i think that everyone else does. thanks for bringing up the bill gates analogy to prove my point. by killing them, i supposed you win, but you cheated now and broke the rules right? you are condoning that murder should be legalized. okay sure but do you seriously want us to accept ""boxing"" chess is a valid version of chess, a game which is a test of intellect? i think most sane people will tell you to stick to boxing and stop trying to change the game of chess to suit your own selfish goals. seriously, i think the points are pretty black and white."
8/3/2011,"come on ccp, when are you going to fix the problem with ctrl?"
8/3/2011,"supported, as this would be a intuitive and helpful thing to implement across the board."
8/3/2011,"yep, where is this useful feature?"
8/3/2011,"gonna enrage people with this one. however, i think it makes sense, no split ships anymore, so bonuses can be focused.basilisk: shield transferoneiros: remote armor repairerguardian: energy transferscimitar: dunno .. tracking seems kind of pointless .. eccm?also i think ccp should move the +transfer bonus to -cycle time. makes for a more even flow of repair, and frigs / drones actually have a chance of being combat repaired."
8/3/2011,lol no i wont even bother saying why ps.you can get some great prices on the underside of a bridge in c+p
8/3/2011,"no, next time you decide to be so stupid please include cheese somewhere in your post so i can giggle instead of facepalm."
8/3/2011,"i am a scientist first and foremost.i am a proud owner of a number of t2 bpo's i am also a keen user of the invention system.inventing is a frustrating venture at times.research on negative level me/pe t2 bpc's i wholeheartedly support i am not sure this is the best alternative to bpo's but certainly would be an addition to current game mechanics that would be most welcome.i would also like to see the facility to buy limited run t2 bpc's from r&d agents, revamp the r&d agent system write a few more missions for them to give out and boost the rp you get from completing the missions too."
8/3/2011,"i'm going to need to see some figures that prove tii bpo's are 'isk printing machines'. considering how people invest in them with 5+ years projected profit expectancies calling them easy money is laughably naive.edit: they used to be that way, but invention itself is what balanced the playing field. some tech ii bpo investors took a huge hit when that was announced and are still recovering from it to this day."
8/3/2011,for those that got them through the research agent lottery i can assure you their return cannot be measured in terms of the orginal isk/time investment which i believe was the ops' point
8/3/2011,"i propose re-working the assault ships moniker into 4 distinct roles:merge eas into assault ships, refunding the eas skill.add a logistics frigate.racial style pvp ship.micro marauder.this introduces the player to tech 2 play styles quickly and easily. doing so will allow new players to get a feel for what one can do in t2 and how the specific roles fit together. the ""micro marauder"" variant would be interesting for new players because they would ideally be used to support larger ships when running missions in high sec. for example, many pve corps recruit players and train them by playing with a veteran pilot. they tend to be the gopher (looter) and kill smaller rats that are hard for larger ships to keep up with and kill.logi frigates could be a welcome addition to small, agile fleets. currently af are under utilized, and this would provide an interesting solution.eas are well known, not going into this. personally, i would re-evaluate the bonus for 2 classes of modules though. split bonuses are just ... not elegant.pvp ships would probably be stereotypes for the races. drones and rails for gallente, missiles and shield resists for caldari, etc. high speed, but high mass with a focus on afterburners, except for matari probably, which get a bonus to mwd."
8/3/2011,forgive me if this has already come up. how about the ability (for fee of course) to get multiple wallet divisions and station item bays. i run a business with multiple layers of manufacturing which is made 1000 times easier by sitting alone in a corp. this is because i can make parts in one bay and have the output into the next bay and so on. this keeps my materials and bpo's sorted and easy to manage. i'd like to join a corp with that character but the idea of cramming everything into one bay is just well... dumb. as for the wallet divisions its nice to have business expenses and profits go in to one division and say mission rewards go into another. again keeps things neat and organized and just seems silly that only people who are ceo's/directors and the likes have access to the feature given how hard trust is to gain in eve.
8/3/2011,"its in the ruddy works! stop posting this, there will officially be a gallente turret rebalancing next summer.yes ive forgotten the link and yes we have to wait another year but there will be a fix."
8/3/2011,"terrible idea. the agressor should choose the amount that the agressed has to pay. they can pay it or not its up to them. a negotiable system that goes through concord is fine,what does need fixing is the ability for members and corps to up sticks and leave and alliance to avoid the war."
8/3/2011,"i just noticed one of the npc industry ships is called 'trailer'. this is incorrect. a trailer does not have it's own means of propulsion. it 'trails' behind a powered vehicle that tows it. it'sfrom websters:""a large van or wagon drawn by an automobile, truck, or tractor, used especially in hauling freight by road. compare full trailer, semitrailer."""
8/3/2011,why is this even in this section of the forums?
8/3/2011,which section would you suggest it belongs in?
8/3/2011,interesting to see what the results were of the crowdsourcing. fw falls at least a 5th of the way down in the grand total and on all sub-groups except for players that do not belong to an alliance... it's much closer to the top with 10% vote... still disappointing though.
8/3/2011,"one question. what is a ""fregate""?"
8/3/2011,"read whole post please :)do not judge it by subject - ""oh noes, not this system scan c**p again...""reintroduction of this array would require some changes in its mechanics - now it would work semi-automatic and whole process of using it should look like this :1. select signal strength - low strength = scans only 100% anomalies etc. and shows how many signatures are there in system) - 3 mid-levels that will scan some harder sigs - high strength = scans all signatures in system to 100%2. depending on witch strength you choose scan cost and delay would change : - low strength = consumes less fuel and has shortest delay like 30mins or 1hr - 3 mid-levels = increased delay and fuel consumption - high strength = consumes most fuel and scan delay is 24 hrs3. you could acces ssa menu from any point in system (or just any pos in system)4. consumed fuel - heavy water (ssa would have fuel bay for this - whole bay = 2 days of scanning)5. limit of one ssa per system6. no requirments of soverginity means that it could be used in w-space, low-secs and high-secs7. sheluded scans - you could set ssa to scan system every x hours (this could work like skill queue)why? it would be very useful in w-space - it will let you know what time some bonus wormhle oppened (and thus - when it will collapse) or some new site spawned etc.it shouldnt be overpowered - after all its just scan of your own system, plus - its not free"
8/3/2011,"redundant and useless idea. no one is going to wait 24h to resolve all a systems sigs when they can spend 15-20m in a cov-op and achieve the same result, without any fuel cost.i mean, don't get me wrong, it's a rather cool idea, i just don't see why it would need to be implemented over what is in use now.as to it's wspace use. i see it as more a tool to reward the lazy and unprepared. if you can't be arsed to keep an eye on your home system for new sigs, then you deserve to get poded tbh. don't automate what should be required intel gathering activities."
8/3/2011,"well, all times and fuel costs are just examples, fuel could be also just used from ct via pg and cpu costs.and sheluded scanning would be nice for nights when there is no one who could scan system and chceck for new sigs :)"
8/3/2011,"i agree, using a pos mod to replace a simple t1 frig with probes fitted, is a terrible idea.however...to go along with all the ""oh noes, there's an afk cloaker in system"" rants...why not let the system scanner find what grid the cloaker is on?that's not to say you'd land right on top of them, or anywhere near them in fact.but you'd be in the ballpark, and then you could wander about with drones or smarties running until you find them.and before anyone says ""oh, push one button and find cloaks!?""make it use the scanning interface. you have to activate the pos mod, then adjust the focus, basically like moving scan probes around until you get a hit.depending on skills and such, you could find a proto cloak a lot easier than a covops."
8/3/2011,perhaps replying to this thread would be the logical next step?
8/3/2011,"to repeat: by the way, several people seem to be under the mistaken impression that the whole aim of this proposal is to crowbar cruisers into existing fleet compositions - it's not. it's meant to be a buff to cruiser sized gangs and to make bc vs cruiser something that actually has to be weighed up, rather than ""lol bc every time.""if that's not the definition of ""newbie trash"", what is? it's stuff you fly when you have nothing better, ie a battlecruiser.so can bcs. i don't think you really understand how small the price gap is when you factor a little thing called insurance in. again, did you even read the op?how? if you're fully skilled and can fly a drake, why would you take the **** by showing up in a caracal? you are still way, way off. oh look, yet more bleating about cost. ok it seems i have to spell this out:on basically any t1 cruiser that isn't a blackbird or arbitrator, i could transfer those mods to a tier 1 or 2 battlecruiser and get better results for a miniscule increase in price (seriously, look up that insurance thing sometime.)factoring this magical thing called insurance, the price gap between t1 cruisers and battlecruisers drops to nil. as a few examples:thorax to brutix - two more guns and another mid, but i get what, 18mil back rather than 5?rupture to cyclone - another 2 mids, 1 less low, another gun and some utility slots. price difference once again tiny. both examples would buff your combat stats up considerably, and at very good value for money. it's only really the amarr that lack a cost effective example of this, plus neither of their bcs can be considered an equivilent to the arbitrator.if you can't afford that kind of increase, you really must be new to the game - meaning once again t1 cruisers are relegated to newbies, and are inferior to other choices.hence the term: newbie trash.edit: in fact i'd like to mention, for this ""isk warfare"" thing you're so fond of, my corp has basically switched over to tier 1 bcs for that purpose. they're just so much better on value than a t1 cruiser._______________________________________________________________won't do a thing. to anyone playing eve long enough to have proper cruiser/bc skills, a few days is nothing.the blackbird and arbitrator do. the rest are just roles the playerbase has crowbarred them into because they have nothing better to do. also mallers ironically aren't good bait because it takes an idiot to attack one, rather defeating the purpose."
8/3/2011,"you just suck at myrm/brutix.i fly the cyclone. i spank people with it. people don't primary me because ""cylones suck"". i've been wiped in a ferox by a caracal. skill comes into it, big time. t1 cruisers may need a buff, and i can see the op's point, but its not to nerf bc's in any way. they are fine (aside from the prophecy and ferox). drakes suck balls, being hopeless spacebricks, and canes are winbuttons...but the same can go for any class of ships. ruppys are winbuttons in the cruiser class, rifters in frig class. so what?"
8/3/2011,"... you do realise one of the biggest nerf campaigns has been directed at drakes, for very good reason? drakes are excellent bordering on overpowered.which is a bad state of affairs, but the point of the proposal is that hurricanes are win buttons that also win at being cruisers.oh also, just so you know - the gap between rifters and other combat frigs is seriously exaggerated, they just happen to be easier to use properly than the others."
8/3/2011,"i was going to interject my opinion then i realized the op would only disagree with it, no matter what it was."
8/3/2011,destroying roids is an interesting idea but it will become a pain for most us players as most high sec belts will be destroyed shortly after dtto change that roids should spawn not during dt but on a timer (24 hours after the roid was destroyed)
8/3/2011,"it wont make ratting easier, it will stay the same, however a system would be usable for so long or people would have to start mining. the idea is to make null mining more appealing (by force), and make less appealing space more appealing."
8/3/2011,true sec should be dynamic... but it should not be based on ratting it should be based on development and exploration...if you colonise the system and discover rare elements it should decrease the sec status as it would be more valuable and npc pirate corps will want a piece of the action...but tbh however ccp wants to implement dynamic 0.0 is ok with me... just aslong as they do it... because imo static sec status is dull...
8/3/2011,people need only look at dreads to realise all there previous arguments about scaling are meaningless.
8/3/2011,"it has recently come to my attention that there is a large amount of whining that the csm doesn't represent them, and that perhaps there is not confidence left in the delegates.this is self defeating. best way to make yourself represented and lend the csm more power, vote for them.the csm delegates received 27580 votes out of a player base of 300k+, and you are complaining they do not represent the player base. answer is they don't. the solution?simple vote for them, it takes 5 minutes of your time, and the best way to increase csm's power not to mention legitimacy is to increase the number of people who participate.i know that there is something up to around 10k votes for people who didn't get enough votes to actually be in the csm but come on guys rather than arguing about how they don't represent you vote for someone who you think will next csm election. what i am not saying however, is that the current csm is illegitimate and pointless, i am not saying either that everyone should vote and that those who aren't are somehow subverting a democratic process. but in the way that the csm are trying to represent the people who are actually voting for them, they constantly have to deal with people who may not have voted at all making attempts on their legitimacy.in short stop *****ing start voting.discuss...."
8/3/2011,"son, i would bet that i've got you by 10 years, good odds that i've got you by 20+, 50/50 that i've got you by 25+.i'm *very* aware of how ""irl"" politics works. i was just pointing out that he/you are wrong.i *do* so enjoy being right once in awhile..."
8/3/2011,"nope, pretty sure csm candidates aren't bound to any sort of agreement that makes them responsible for the entire player-base. why would they spend the effort outside of their constituents, or more honestly, their area of preferred playstyle? ideally, maybe they should, but this is eve."
8/3/2011,"then you understand how lobbyists work. so, mittens didn't have to explain why it would be dumb for him to discuss wormholes with ccp. not to mention he would be a hypocrite after railing against the previous csm for talking about null sec while living in empire."
8/3/2011,"ummmm, that is *in so many words* exactly what he did..."
8/3/2011,"according to the link i gave, and the data there, the csm rep's the interests of all players to ccp. which is one of the reasons why having people without knowledge of 0.0 mechanics suggesting changes for 0.0 was a bad idea. they should have *asked* 0.0 players what to adjust, how to adjust it and where/when to adjust it. (gotten feedback and input first, then make suggestions). instead, players (representing 0.0 to ccp w/o direct knowledge or feedback) made suggestions that were not only against the interests of 0.0 players and possibly even *ahem!* ""ill advised"".just because someone doesn't play in 0.0 (or hi-sec, or low-sec or wh's or fw) does *not* relieve them of the responsibility of doing ""due diligence"" if they're going to make suggestions on ""fixes"" to those areas.i *do* believe that is what got the current crop of 0.0 reps running and elected this term, is it not?"
8/3/2011,"it's *not* so ""obvious"" that this needs changing. there are many reasons why someone might not move out to 0.0 having nothing to do with ""being a care-bear"". some people just can't take eve so serious as to commit to 0.0. some find it hard to *care* what happens to 2500 other people they have no connection to. some get mistreated in 0.0 corps and don't bother going back. how many times has it come up (here and elsewhere) ""xyz corp doesn't do **** for the alliance - they never fly pvp!"" when, in fact, they mine/invent/build? i've read it on caod, gen. discussion and scrapheap (now failheap). part of the problem is might be the perception (right or wrong) about the nature of the communities in 0.0...i really can't believe that these mega alliances have every moon covered with a moon mining pos, and can't spare the powergrid/cpu for labs. the 0.0 power blocs *could* have all the invention slots they could use, but for some reason, they don't. ugh, i'm tired and i can't devote more thought to this (it's 2:11 a.m.) - i'll be back."
8/3/2011,"i would like to call out loudly bull**** on that statement. more organized? oh the laughs. you mean endless cta's and setting your alarm clock? i have met dozens of x-nullsec players who left due to the massive amount of nullsec-political drama between alliances and within them. contrary to popular belief, highsec pilots are very capable of organizing. the incursion runners are a physical daily proof of it. we organize blacklists, public statements and events for over 1000 incursion runners.if a future csm is to support our daily milk and honey then you can easily expect a large group of supporters from incursion runners."
8/3/2011,"are you familiar with the concept of ""opportunity cost""?if it was cheaper to run your own 0.0 invention slots, then people would do that. it isn't, as evidenced by the fact that no one has implemented it on a large scale, which should inform you that, perhaps, it is not fiscally or :effort: viable compared to just jumping to high-sec.were it effective, every alliance would do it, since if they did not they would lose their competitive edge against other alliances."
8/3/2011,"why yes, i am familiar with the concept. go back and read the persons statement that i was replying to. i.e. ""these alliances are limited to one station/system, and can't even get invention slots...""my point was that it can be done other ways and, wh corps do it all the time. no, it's not as easy as hi-sec."
8/3/2011,"research poses aren't the difficult part. there are plenty of those in every alliance. the problem is the logistics of inventing in null and having to import most of your components, especially datacores."
8/3/2011,then whoever organizes them should have gotten them to vote and maybe we'd have a more balanced csm or one with more representatives who were more engaged in the game/community. if they all did vote then the statement remains true the larger group of highsec players need to be more organized and connected to their 'game/space' etc to vote for people that best represent them.by the very nature of highsec people are more apt to be on thier own even if they form corps/alliances they all are not so tied together like in null where you need your friends and know your enemies with centralized leadership to make announcements etc. highsec is harder to get a message out to 'everyone' as their isn't a pyramid of leadership through corps and alliances that have the vast majority of players in highsec in them.

8/4/2011,"supported.this does absolutely nothing to stop suicide ganking. what it does do is re-focus it. hulkagheddon wouldn't die because people do it for the lol's and the prizes. everyday small target ganking would suffer only mildly.people would use the same ships with greater patience waiting for targets with better cargos. the miners would become less desirable and the trade ships would become more coveted. high sec miners despite the common misconception are not rich. botters and traders are rich and while most older miners are also traders, the best place to hit them isn't at the belts but at the gates where all their isk is condensed. as far as botters go they are an exploit that is unavoidable with or withought ganking but taking insurance away doesn't make them untouchable or un-profitable just less profitable. while botters and old traders can afford to replace ships faster than they can ever be ganked. it's the noob miner who suffers the loss of his first hulk that gets punished under the current system. by removing gank insurance it refocuses gank attacks from joe the plumber to donald trump hitting him where it hurts more often than now. meanwhile joe can go on to grow his small buisiness. donald will adapt, joe will emo rage quit.here's an analogy.you have 20 guys digging dirt up with their own shovels into their own wheelbarrows. they then wheel the stuff to a large pile to be scooped up by a tractor into a dump truck. the dump truck takes it to a gardening supplier who packages it as soil and loads it on semi trucks bound for a majior distributor.now if the shovels are hulks, the wheel barrows are industrials, the pile and tractor is a npc station, the dump truck is a transport or orca, the gardening supplier being a pos where they build shiney things, the semi trucks being freighters and jump freighters, with the majior distributor being jita; it just beggs the question... why would you bother beating down the looser with the shovel when you can just jump the dump truck?? why bother with the dump truck when you can just ransack the warehouse? or hit the final product before it gets to the main distributor? dirt isn't worth nearly as much as soil. and a shipment if soil takes up less space than a load of dirt. all the op is suggesting is lowering the amount of non discriminate attacks against. younger players and re-focusing them on older ones.while the miners would produce more minerals gankers would be waiting at the gates more then ever to make sure they are distributed fairly. and while lower mineral prices would drop the amount of money the miner makes per day but would also drop the cost of ships across the board driving inflation down. meaning they will still be able to buy everything they can buy today. while missioners etc would be able to buy more than they can today."
8/4/2011,"the downside of this is that mineral prices would fall off a cliff, and miners would suffer far more than they do from an occasional gank.another effect would be to remove the comparative advantage of flying a t1 hull in pvp, which is that they can be almost fully insured. this would be a huge nerf to players who can't afford t2/t3s, as even though the outlay price of the hull would fall, the net price would rise (and would therefore disproportionately affect new players). t2/t3 prices would rise due to the increased demand.pvp of all types would be reduced as the cost of engaging in it increases.removing insurance entirely would negatively affect so many other parts of the game that one starts to think that doing so just isn't worth the gain of excusing hi-sec miners and missioners from losing the occasional ship like every one else."
8/4/2011,"i don't know if i quite follow you, or maybe i just have a wildly different meaning of the word 'unbalanced'. we're all playing a sandbox game, in which we are allowed to do as we please. except, we aren't, because i cannot do what i want with the ship i've spent hundreds of hours of gametime one, because someone with a ship they spent 30 minutes on can take that away from me, and be reimbursed 15 minutes of that after they get 'punished'. if anything, most of the forum-warriors that can only troll (ad hominem, drink bleach, whatever) and keep spouting ""no"" are the ones that want to keep that imbalance (destroy hours or weeks or months of work in seconds) for their own narrow interest (grief, ""pvp"" the easy targets, whatever).any which way you turn it, eve is not only a harsh place, it is also home to a lot of carebears. of course they want to have a safer place, it suits their play style. and it's just as obvious the griefers (because i have yet to hear a reason that i deem valid (and yes, i can see what i did there...) why hindering others in their preferred play style is a good thing (tm)) will want to keep being able to extract tears.luckily for those whose play style it suits, the devs are on the everyone versus everyone-side, and the ones who think eve is not safe enough for their style try to change the game or move on to other games."
8/4/2011,"a near excellent post! i say 'near', because it's not about wanting a safer place per se, but about wanting a more balanced game mechanic. concord shouldn't pay out on a suicide gank, pure and simple.then what about the noob who accidentally shoots someone else? (because he got targeted, and mistook it for aggression, for instance). well, for some obsure reason ccp is all panicky about said noob immediately leaving the game if he doesn't equally immediately get his loss reimbursed. i say, f that! seriously, the game doesn't really shield you from making any other gross mistakes either; so, why be so overprotective in this case?or, they could simple make it so that nobody collects insurance when more than 1 party was involved in the killing of someone else. fixed.suicide ganking has always been a thorn in the eye; and slapping a monocle over it is not the solution! ccp, please fix it for real."
8/4/2011,"which is no different than wanting to fly a marauder into 0.0 to claim sovereignty. but using your logic, u'd probably blame the gankers for losing your marauder too 'cause they wouldn't let u do what u want, huh?1. no one forced u to fly a hulk--don't fly what u can't afford to lose.2. ""pvp"" the easy targets...sounds like most eve pilots in general and many of them aren't suicide gankers either.there is a safer place exactly for u--singularity.or they will continue playing because no other game will allow their pirate main to keep an epeen-raising killboard record by transferring all their risk away from their main and onto their high sec mining alt. and when they do encounter the only risk they'll ever face, they'll continue whining about safety like u do."
8/4/2011,"ah, the straw man, hadn't named that one specifically yet, i will in the future.assumptions... the point is still valid, it takes a lot of time to get, and very little time to lose anything in eve.thank you for agreeing with me: you want to shoot stuff, preferably without being blown to internet spaceship pixels yourself :) it may come as a surprise (though it should not, you probably have been on these forums long enough): not everyone wants to be shot at, and that's why we have high-sec. not to offer a place where you can't be shot, but to offer a place where you won't be shot as often.now that we have that out of the way we can come to the point: suicide ganking is a risk/reward issue, as with everything else. what we are trying to establish is: is suicide ganking in its current form and shape correctly positioned in the risk versus reward graph. is it balanced enough? (i avoid using 'fair' here, as that will only derail my argument as you will then probably leech onto that word to say eve isn't supposed to be fair).i think, as it is now, suicide ganking is cheap enough to grief, and grief often. i don't oppose to suicide ganking as a whole, but i do oppose to the mentality that extracting tears is a good thing, and suicide ganking is an excellent way to grief. we are all civilized human beings, and part of that is not causing undue grief without cause.if there is something to gain (for instance, a hauler at a gate or whatever), by all means, go gank. but what do you win by ganking a hulk? a strip miner, some ore and (if you have a salvager equipped) a molten capacitor or two, if that. especially if you then see the wreck, floating in space, cargo undisturbed... i still haven't read what your reward is.i would read my post again if i were you. i am not advocating safety, i'm (imo) objectively trying to show there are two sides to the medallion, and those two will never reach an agreement as they both want the opposite.what i am advocating however, is a stop to grieving for grieving sake, and the way i see it, most of the suicide ganks don't have net reward already (which makes it grieving in my book), so might as well try and make it a less feasible way to have ""fun"".you could construe that as ""wah wah make high sec safer"", that is of course up to you, but then we best agree to disagree as i am obviously unable to explain to you what i mean."
8/4/2011,"agreed....not a single non-support.ccp please listen to us and fix this asap. if old players don't like it, then it is also confusing to new players as well.not only that...but your icons are something that every player in the game looks at every day they play. please make this a priority and roll out the fix in a small patch. we want our old icons back please."
8/4/2011,"supporting this. recently returned to eve and pretty much my first reaction was ""what the heck have they done to icons?""they're supposed to easily recognizable icons, not a detailed picture of the module in question resized to 64*64 px.bring back old icons!"
8/4/2011,"i want station enviroment what has at least same functionality than the original ""station spinner"" and isn't demanding to cpu/gpu, because station is the most common place where people do their non flying related ""stuff"" and chatting.in the end it is more about having the same functionality in hangar and having some cpu/gpu friendly place in station than having both in same place. having said that - hangar would be the most convient place to use for these actions."
8/4/2011,friendly bump. we need more supporters!
8/4/2011,"what a wonderful idea, this would fit in to the game seamlessly"
8/4/2011,your proposal would ruin infinite number of reasons why you better to behave including the similarity to real life in reputation and lots of other things. will make the game way less interesting.ccp would you mind to raise the subscription cost instead of all the stupid ideas thrown around lately? that will much better and faster fix your urge for money with a lot less consequences.negative vote for this one.
8/4/2011,"i whole heartedly support this and would give my first born (whom i named plzbeatmeup) to see my name changed.note to prior poster: uh, dur, game, not real life, fun."
8/4/2011,"so the results were far from satisfactory on scannable wrecks, i honestly thought there would be a much higher %. so then here is what i am thinking::noctis: a 40+mil salvaging shipallow the noctis to fit scan probe launcher but only allow for a ""salvaging probe"" to be used. it would have some % bonus for scanning down wrecks that are left behind after missions have been turned in (wrecks do stay afterwards afaik, correct?) in this way mission runners would not feel infiltrated upon.the noctis should be based on say the imicus but for ""salavging probes"" and yes implants, rigs etc would come into play {implementation}.i can't count the number of times i have scanned into a mission and waited, and waited, etc, etc,.. and they dont come back for their wrecks.i mean the noctis is pure salvaging for the salvager profession (on that note why not have salvaging missions and make the salvager profession a viable one).also let it be that after a certain time limit when missions are turned in that the wrecks automatically abandon, in this way they can be looted by the salvager profession, and again mission runners won't feel encroached upon.i mean the noctis is the perfect platform for such endeavors, why not make it 100% full potential.also why not have opposing npc's fighting each other and dropping wrecks, in this way ""owned"" wrecks would not agress if that becomes implemented, and would free up a salavger to do what he does best.and on a final note upon this: an abandoned wreck should show up on d-scan as ""abandoned {insert npc type here} wreck""."
8/4/2011,"or...when the first wreck spawns in a room, have it also spawn a mag site beacon.they anyone with core probes can scan for mag sites, and potentially find abandoned battlefields."
8/4/2011,"hmm, not bad. i think your suggestions have merit wiz. not sure about salvaging missions being needed, as it is salvaging is sort of like scavenging and i think that is intended. i'm interested in seeing what sort of response this thread gets."
8/4/2011,"ye i know, it just kind of popped into my head while writing.ye i am very interested in the responses as well"
8/4/2011,+1 to trial account deletion
8/4/2011,that would cause the first to blow up and kill you.
8/4/2011,"people seem to have different ideas about how to fix hybrids. i say lets change projectile, and missiles too!what if all weapons had two different modes, normal and 'supercharged', when supercharged you will shoot for higher dmg but only be able to load very little ammo (which means you would have to reload more often and therefore you loose overall dps)pro's:- since blasters are one of higest dps ingame, they will naturally be awesome in supercharged mode.- will encourage more 'hit and runs' in eve. smaller fleets will be able to take on bigger ones more easily, and really punish your enemies when they split their forces.- good against ewar/jammers- good for blob fights where you can alpha enemies more easily- will encourage suicide ganking in other means than just smartbombs- will give people more tactical options in the middle of a fightcon's:- this would exclude lasers, but thats not necessarily a bad thing maybe. (or maybe somebody has a solution for this?)- your dps will be smaller- if supercharge gets a bit overpowered, it might lead to penalties to tracking- etc."
8/4/2011,train thermodynamics.
8/4/2011,so i take it you didnt like that idea. and that you wouldn't enjoy more tactical options while you are in battle. ok. noob
8/4/2011,"i have tactical options. if i want high alpha, low rof i use arties, if i want high dps high rof i use acs. if i want to crank it up to eleventy, i overheat."
8/4/2011,"exactly, overheat is there for a reason... no since adding something thats essentially the same except with ludicrous drawbacks (the lower ammo thing).also, possible exploitable, what would happen to ammo if you completely filled your cargo hold with something (like more ammo) and had your guns fully loaded, then used overcharge? guarantee there is at elast 3 ways for soemone to exploit weird mechanics in a game such as the halfing ammo thing your suggesting."
8/4/2011,"sorry. what i should have said is that your point was totally true, but only somewhat relevant, since a player can already ""earn"", buy, beg for, steal, or borrow a character or set of characters that can do what that one (multi-thousand dollar) uber-character could do . . . and they could all be logged into tranquility at the same time, to boot. there are already uber-players, except we tend to call them ""veterans"".here is where you fail econ. the production of ""goods"" and the rendering of ""services"" is exactly the addition of value (money, wealth, energy, order, etc.) into a system. if you don't like ""free"" skillpoints, then i'll bet you hate ""free"" pirate bounties and ""free"" ore in asteroids belts and ""free"" characters (i.e., ccp wouldn't instantiate them on tranquility, except that you are willing to pay them for doing so.) i don't condone murder. i might not even eat other organisms for food if there were a viable, practical alternative. let's be real, though. murder is the single most profitable activity in the history of human-kind, from killing cows, to cutting down trees, to war, because when you kill something, you get to keep its stuff.you play a game where pixels on a monitor, controlled by rules (which are often changed by the creators/administrators of said game) which reside in a very powerful computer thousands of miles away from you, in a far away ""ice land"", and representing space and objects in a far science fiction future, interact with one another in complex, sometimes unpredictable ways to produce outcomes that are arbitrarily interpretable as success or failure based on which of the massive number of participants is observing.but . . . boxing-chess is crazy? and, i don't think paying money directly to ccp for more in-game potential is quite as drastic as gary kasparov having his hands wrapped before a match with deep blue."
8/4/2011,"really?seriously, do try to read and comprehend what my point is before you give a knee jerk response. right and if you indeed understand economies all these things are within the game economy. you want real money to be ""part of"" this economy. you want it to be a means of utility in this economy. that is where all your argument goes down the drain. ask yourself this. should a big muscle man wrestler be at an advantage playing eve vs a girl?no right? the rules should treat them the same. they should have both equal opportunity to do well or fail in the game of eve. and so should the arguement go for people who are richer in real life than others. qedthe chess analogy is sound. the rules of chess do not include advantages for those in the physical world. that's why a game between deep blue and kasparov is still fair and within the rules. it wouldn't be fair though if kasparov could unplug deep blue just because he happens to have hands, and the means to do it. ( ps that's an analogy for people like you ) thanks for proving my point again. you can be kasparov because you were born later. maybe if you study chess as long as he has, then you can one day be as good as he was at his prime. but you have to put in the time and effort, just like he did. exactly the case with veterans and noobs in eve."
8/4/2011,to continue the list of analogies that all but a select few on this thread understand as obvious. real life:op wants counterfeit us dollars to be legal. anyone who can afford to buy the plates and a printing press should be able to print money and it will be perfectly legal. unfortunately these plates are expensive. so only the really rich can buy them. and you can only buy them with diamonds. so only diamond mine owners can print their own money. and he wants to argue that this is fair and economically sound. completely ludicrous.
8/4/2011,"want more?let's say i petition ccp to add a rule to this forum that requires people to get background checks, and people without university degrees or do not work in finance industry are no longer allowed to post any comments on any economic related topics in eve. the argument goes the lack of a clue from people speaking from out of their area of expertise just wastes everyones time. would you support this?likely not, because forums are supposed to be fair and equal opportunities should be given to those of any race religion education stupid smart without arms or wit or wheel chair bound. so long as you can log into the internet, you can post your opinion. now as much as i, and i'm sure many others here would love this rule to be implemented, it would make us hypocrites now wouldn't it?"
8/4/2011,"oh, kaelie onren (i like that name, btw.), i can't quit you!if you understand physics, you understand that there is no known system that is separate and immune from interaction with the rest of the universe. the universe is one whole economy of which the eve online universe is merely one subset and there is no real way to seal off the eve universe from the wider economy. ""stuff"" seeps in and out, sometimes in ways we cannot even imagine. the eve economy and the whole economy are in or are attempting to be in equilibrium. what you are suggesting is not that eve shouldn't interact with the universal economy, since that is impossible. what you are suggesting is that one specific external means of utility (money) be excluded from being allowed to translate directly into an in-game means of utility or from extracting that utility directly from the game with that means. there are many other external means of utility that do translate directly into the eve economy. you're only picking on money, and that's not fair.the pirate bounties, the minerals, the characters did not exist in the eve universe before they were instantiated by tranquility, i.e., something from nothing, just like your ""counterfeit"" skillpoints. the only association we can make between the utility of gaining isk from bounties, the utility of gathering minerals from ore, the utility of accumulating skillpoints with a character, and a means of utility, is by associating said utilities with means that are external to the eve economy (effort, bandwidth, electricity, education, fingers, capacity to think abstractly, etc.). so, if you want to nerf the possibility of external means generating utility in the eve universe, then you have to look at all means of utility external to that system, not just money. otherwise, you're just a sand merchant in the desert, claiming a pound of water and a pound of sand should be valued equally. unfortunately, some people just have more water.that is what you are saying, only the ""diamonds"" in your analogy equates to seniority. you're saying that only players who have x length of months playing should have the possibility of having y skillpoints, but that if they have x money or x amount of effort to put into the game or x whatever, they should be disallowed from acquiring those same skillpoints because somehow that makes the game fair. you are equating the ""diamonds"" with real money, but even there, the ""diamonds"" can be acquired by other means, whereas, seniority isn't something that can be acquired.here's a solution: let players sign up for their free trial now. they'll create a character, but then not pay or log on for a year. after that year, the person can log back on, enter their payment method, pay for the previous and next years, and they'll get a year's worth of skillpoints to apply to their character."
8/4/2011,"oww my head hurts reading all this debating about this nonsense. i can understand both sides of this debate, but have to agree on never selling sp for cash. i'm not sure who said it first but when you are buying a toon in the bazar you are buying sp not the name. so here is the meat and potatos....make a accout with a starter toon go buy yourself as many gtc's as your heart desires and go buy yourself a toon!"
8/4/2011,"well said cendric.this is similar to the feedback i've received from friends i tried to get to play the game. all of them have left, mainly because they feel the cards are stacked against them in so many ways - isk, skills, knowledge, gameplay mechanics,(right or wrong, that's their feedback). they want to ""dive in"" and instead find themselves restricted to the kiddie pool until they earn enough isk or make enough friends (and making virtual friends can be just as tough as rl friends for some people). the community could certainly play their part in making some of the ""learning wall"" appear less daunting to a new player. skills take time, so not much we can do there, but imparting knowledge, fleeting up with new players and even something as simple as letting a new player salvage an l4 blockade can be a big deal to someone currently making 60k isk running l1s."
8/4/2011,"i do understand ccp wish to make more money. they are business. so they drop some ideas and see how community respond. sometimes they wishfully think. they already saw ""the great unsub"" event with that way of thinkinh. what's next? ""the great end""? with ""the great instant gratification players influx with a lot of cash"" event in the middle and then ""the great exodus"" event?because if ccp does that enormous amount of players will leave. once their 6-12 months characters biomassed that's it. they wont return. emotional attachment lost and deep insult gained.if you proposers of sp for money/isk/whatever else so much want that you picked up wrong game. it happens that people start playing but dont like it later. so stop offering cash to modify the game and go look for the game that suits you instead of making attempts to ruin this game for countless numbers of players."
8/4/2011,"fine, but i don't want your ****ty character with his ****ty skill tree. i want my own. and, what are you? a gtc salesman?the real problem in this discussion is that you guys want to have your cake and eat it to. on the one hand, you claim that skillpoints are not the most decisive factor of one's success in eve, and that's why there is no need for us to be able to buy skillpoints and that's why the game is perfectly fair. on the other hand, you claim that buying skillpoints would create uber-characters that would dominate the game and that's why it's important to keep skillpoints limited the way they are now.well, if skillpoints aren't so important to the game, then why fight so hard against more of them? how would it unbalance the game to have high skillpoint noobs running around dying to lower skillpoint veterans? as it is now, you claim that low skillpoint noobs can already kill high skillpoint veterans, so, what's the problem with reversing who has the most skillpoints? it doesn't detract from the success of a player or the fun a player has in the game; right?as for the claim that buying skillpoints would create uber-characters that would make the game unfair for poor people who only have so much to spend on this game, well, that argument could be made to limit any number of things in the game. by that argument, ccp could impose a limit on the number of battleships, since flying a battleship gives you an advantage in certain situations. they could limit the amount of isk you can make per day. they could limit the amount of ore you can mine or the number of ships you can have or the amount of times you can jump or undock from a station per day.here's another suggestion: ccp should start a second shard to allow newer players to play in a new universe, one that they had more control in shaping the rules and culture of."
8/4/2011,1
8/4/2011,ccp veritas has addressed a five page thread concerning this issue (source)
8/4/2011,1
8/4/2011,"i'd like to propose that ccp add a 'save/load' current profile button to the incarna character creator. this, so you can save your current look (hairstyle and color and such), and reload it when you clone-jump. clean and simple.n.b. i know many folks don't care for incarna -- please, don't make this thread about that."
8/4/2011,i understand what you are getting at. but saying that the guardian and onerios are to similar is like saying a raven and an dominix are to similar because they both do damage.healing damage is what logi's do...if they don't repair damage there is no point. also the current logi are wonderfully balanced and different(except onerios)who would bring a guardian to a fleet if it did not provide reps?
8/4/2011,i see what you did there.
8/4/2011,"removing the repping ability from a logi would completely obsolete it! besides, all logi's have 2 bonuses, not one... guard = armor reps + energy xferonieros = armor reps + tracking linksbasilisk = shield reps + energy xferscimitar = shield reps + tracking linksyou could make an argument that tracking links just aren't as useful as energy transfers, and that they onieros/scimi should have a better second bonus, but you can't take away repping form a logi ships without making it useless! are the scanning frigates with a damage bonus and a scanning bonus a split ship? are ships with an armor/shield resistance bonus and a damage bonus a split ship? are ships with a cargo hold bonus and a mining bonus a split ship? are ships with a tractor beam bonus and a damage/salvaging/repping bonus a split ship? are ships with an active tank bonus and a damage bonus a split ship? are ships with bonus' to two different types of weapon systems a split ship?are ships with an ewar bonus and a damage bonus a split ship? are ships with multiple ewar bonuses split ships? almost ever ship in eve falls into one of the above categories... so what do you mean by no more split ships anymore?"
8/4/2011,"whats this, a use for all those small deadspace remote reppers that you can barely give away. this could be fun, may even encourage roaming frigate gangs which would be cool."
8/4/2011,the current csm is an abysmal failure which must be impeached and new elections held.
8/4/2011,your well thought out argument and ample evidence has swayed me. death2allcsms!
8/4/2011,why.
8/4/2011,what unlawful activity did they do? or do you mean they should be recalled?
8/4/2011,gather a petition with 5000 signatures (from active eve accounts) and people might take you seriously.you clearly don't know how impeachments or recalls work.
8/4/2011,"i'm sorry, i wasn't aware we voted ronald reagan for csm..."

8/4/2011,"you can group drones in your bay, that is awesome.i am suggesting that you be able to assign a hot key to a few groups so that you can launch a group with the stroke of a key.after grouping drones in my drone bay (lets say my ""med-thermal"" group.) i should be able to assign ""med-thermal"" to ""launch group 1"", and then in my options screen set a hotkey to launch ""launch group 1."""
8/4/2011,"you arent the same guy who suggested ""drone squadrons"" are you? because that was a terrible idea.but if you mean that they are only ""grouped"" while still in the cargo-hold and that it just allows you to launch them with a certain composition of drone types (such as 2 amarrian drones, 1 caldari, 2 gallente, etc) then that would actually be useful, though wouldnt it be pointless?i say this because if your deploying drones, are you not normally going to ahve them focus on 1 target? and is that target usually weak against a certain damage type, and deploying multiple drone types would only lessen your dps against them?"
8/4/2011,"you know how in ancient times warlords and emperors had their best fighters battle with the opponents best fighter. eve can also follow this tradition.only make one simple change, make the ceo's of corporations like warlords and emperors, give them the power to allow up to 10 members of the corp to have 'killrights' on an equal force of the opponents corp.basically the ceo's will be able to open up a 'trading window' with eachother. and into that window they will drag the names of the people they want, and also the ships that are allowed into the fight.in the end when both parties are satisfied with what is in the 'trading window' the fighting can start after 20 minutes time. killrights will last for 40 minutes.when a corp wants to wardec somebody, they can choose to give the target corp a chance of canceling the war dec if they win the '10v10 tournament'the argument why duels should exist in the world of eve: it's human nature to fight with pride and honor. the human condition means ego, and ego means personal pride, so cheating in a fight is not as easy alot of the times because the ego will prevent you from calling the cavalry to a seemingly fair battle."
8/4/2011,why is it people want to have artificial mechanics to control player actions in eve?
8/4/2011,"1. people have been making 'honorable fighting agreements' since the dawn of time, so there is nothing 'artificial' about it. (and also this sort of arrangenged fights are not very solid contracts, the opponent can still cheat to a certain extent, for example a bunch of 'out of corp logistics' could still interfear etc.)2. you're not being constructive, maybe you should take a quick look at forum rules m8. we're all here to vote, and help develop ideas, period.also these sort of fights could potentially be strictly made for 0.5 systems or below, so that it doesnt become to strict of a 'contract'"
8/4/2011,"if that where true, you wouldn't need artificial constructs for your duels now would you ?"
8/4/2011,"while that may (or may not) be true, it is only true because in the real world there are consequences for not doing so. society shuns those individuals who fail to keep their word or who cheat at competitive events.in eve the opposite is true. there are no long term consequences for a lack of honor. in fact, some people revel in it and tell boastful stories of how they tricked an enemy into a ""fair"" fight. far from being shunned, they are given accolades for their behavior.eve is not fair. it never will be, and if you think it should be, you're a hopeless romantic who will soon part company (explosively) with your ship."
8/4/2011,"ah, but you don't need artificial constructs to fight with pride and honor, you need artificial constructs to not have concord on your ass when you want to duel :)of course, you can start a war or steal a bookmark from each other, but the first is a bit over the top for a simple duel (and: it takes 24h to start) and the second is cumbersome for a 10 on 10 :)"
8/4/2011,there's already at least half a dozen mechanics in hi sec only to do this. how about just using existing mechanics.also get out of hi sec and be less *****
8/4/2011,"ya hueinm, obviously i meant that it's only part of human nature to do things like that, you don't have to take this rough draft of the idea so literally mate. and please read forum rules before you make more comments, you are unnecesarily bumping this thread for no good reason."
8/4/2011,"did you just call me a hopeless romantic and that i will blow up for some reason?anyway, my counter argument to your 'eve should never be fair' is that while the existing game mechanics are great, eve has to keep growing as a game and eventually introduce additional mechanics to adress the people in the game who are not as much into the whole 'hide and seek game' where one has to travel 100+ jumps just to get some action.and if you look at ccp's current focus which is incarna with its 'attract new people to try the game and keep people playing' then i would say this is one of the few ideas out there that is actually in sync with what ccp is trying to accomplish nowadays. for example i would much more prefer that ccp fixes hybrids just like many others would, but unfortunately ideas like this one would probably get more attention from ccp than any other idea that is not in sync with what they are focusing on right now with incarna.in any case it is just an idea for us to discuss, and i don't really agree with your 'hopeless romantic argument' that the idea of new agression mechanics introduced into the game is hopeless, it could happen sooner than you think"
8/4/2011,"be in fleet, get shot, whole fleet gets kill rights, your duel just became blob warfare, congratz, you just thought up another pointless mechanic.also, low/null you dont need to worry about concord, and i can only assume thats who you actually meant because i dont remember there ebing in warlords or competent generals/leaders in high-sec.would be much easier and less hastle to just can-flip to start the duel..."
8/4/2011,"markers:5 mil shield, 5 mil armor, 1 structure.0% resistanchors in 1 minute, onlines in 10 minutes, cannot be off-lined.cost: 5 mil build cost and 10 mil at the time of anchoringplanetary control becomes the nature of system holding. however, it's a twist to the old pos system that nobody liked. you are required to hold a majority of the marked planets in a system. they are instantly destroyable, except for the last 1 held by the claimed entity.there are 2 ways to take sov. the first option is to remove 51% of the markers and replace them. this method requires 1 day to take effect overriding the current sov holder. markers placed must be the ones that remain for 24 hrs, no replacing dead one's or the counter resets based on the newest marker that gains superiority. the % of claim is directly tied to the sov level of the system. lower % of claim across all planets in a constellation will reduce strategic assets in systems such as cyno jammer hp, pos turret tracking and range, pos shield capacity, plexes and anomalies. no more farming or mining for 5 days, now it's all about constellation control.the 2nd method of taking sov is to kill all the markers except the last. once the final marker is all that remains, it automatically goes into reinforced mode. when it exits reinforcement, it will have a resistance based on planetary control constellation wide. this means the fewer planets you hold in the constellation, the easier it will be killed. reinforcement timer can be set between 6 and 24 hrs. once the reinforced marker is killed, whoever holds the larger % of claim in the system takes sov.this method provides 2 forms of fighting. either the defending entity can risk it all and defend some time in the next 18 hrs, or they can try to remove markers ahead of time. the attacker also has 2 chances to take the sov, both by holding the system control, or by gaining control at the reinforcement exit timer. this also prevents stacking large sums of systems on a set timer, making a hard press in many systems more of a 24/7 fight rather than a risk of waiting til the reinforcement timer exit. the benefits of attacking and defending at any time of day are further enhanced because they have a direct impact on strategic defense by affecting the sov level.upon the destruction of a marker, the attackers are awarded a 10 mil bounty. this means that people will be rewarded for structure shooting by either pvp or isk value. it also benefits smaller groups tasking out duties or disrupting larger alliances."
8/4/2011,"why is your proposed system better than our current system? less rf timers? if you want to really focus on improving sov, find a mechanic that strongly favors sustained system activity over [alarm clock] structure shooting. something to note, per the new dev blog, ""shooting at stationary structures is boring ""! hence, i don't think structure shooting will be the primary mechanic for a new sov system. while i think some structure shooting is inevitable, and i believe alarm clock structure shooting is the best mechanic for large fleet battles. note: these are a good thing, as long as its not the primary thing!"
8/4/2011,"it would be nice if the turret icons denoted what they were on. like a little '1', '2' etc to coincide with the turrets (mining, guns, missiles, nos...whatever)this is mostly a ui thing so i wouldn't count on it happening. nice idea though.advice until then (you'll be dead when 'then' rolls around, literally)...eve turret updates have made it such that the graphic turret on the ship (what you see) is directly linked to a module icon. if you click the first module, the first turret will fire. if you click the eighth module, the eighth turret would fire. in the old days it was random and those of us who got bored enough would figure out the order of our modules and rearrange them...no more are those days.so when you click that first mining laser, one of the beam on your ship will be that laser always - i.e. for a hulk, the front most laser is #1 on the modules. follow said laser to roid, select roid, and you now know which laser is on the roid. hopefully that helps!"
8/4/2011,nice idea!my vote goes for it. supported.
8/4/2011,really not even a single reply... what am i missing here? i can't be the only one who would be game for this. would have thought spending a little extra isk for more then one item bay would gotten a better reception. station containers are all well and good but not exactly useful when it comes to manufacturing.
8/4/2011,i think the ideas are fine (you can use station containers to solve the hangar problem). but i also think these are incredibly low priority issues and there are about eleventy billion other things i'd rather see fixed/changed in eve first.
8/4/2011,in what other game would something like this be allowable? really if y'all want that much needed buff anything short of mass gallente unsub wont make it happen. so stop making posts about the subject.

8/4/2011,i support the idea of people not being able to leave a war as long as they have the option of not being able to be wardeced in a non npc corp.some people do like to play eve as a game and not have to worry about some 30 yr old wardecing them all the time because his parents molested him when he was younger and now he is taking his aggression out on them.
8/4/2011,remove magical police force from hi sec

8/4/2011,"defining hauling ships based on the propulsion methods they use might be inappropriate for space, so maybe they used common names of hauling vehicles and re-defined them with rigorous definitions that represent not the propulsion methods they use, but the quantity of minerals they carry. since we primarily care about the loot it drops, can the english police forgive eve for redefining the terms hauler, trailer, convoy, and carrier to signify the exact quantity of minerals in it? perhaps they could use a definition like: hauler: a ship that can carry 3.1 million trit, or a reduced amount of higher end minerals thats a function of mineral type. trailer = a ship that can carry 6.5 million trit, or a reduced amount of higher end minerals thats a function of mineral type. convoy = a ship that can carry 12.5 million trit, or a reduced amount of higher end minerals thats a function of mineral type. carrier =a ship that can carry 25 million trit, or a reduced amount of higher end minerals thats a function of mineral type. hmm... we should probably make sure transporter, bulker, trucker, and loader have similar rigorous definitions..."

8/4/2011,"you guys probably have a better idea on this than anyone, so i was hoping one or all of you could comment on this. it seems to me that ccp has stopped doing major expansions of eve online. in fact, every expansion since tyrannus, including incarna seems to me a half hearted measure just so ccp can say they are still putting out 2 expansions a year. in effect, it's marketing spin because the actual real content and fixes are very little.now apparently ccp is a big company now.. 600+ employees? my question to the csm is what are all these employees doing? because it seems to me that apart from team bff, no one is actually working on eve anymore. i know ccp counts incarna as part of eve, and i will even give them that, but still.. what is everyone else doing? the csm also mentioned that so much of eve is limited by the art department. why isn't more art outsourced then? perhaps you guys could give us a break down of ccp's departments/teams and what is being worked on by who? maybe then the players will have fewer expectations for the future and either accept the slow development as it is now, or cancel their accounts and wait for ccp to put more resources into their cash cow.-----------------------------------lv [gnstr]"
8/4/2011,"with you on that one.although i can already answer that... they make two more games and think eve player base will tolerate their ""we do something like simulating that we do something"" approach for long. nothing personal, just business. but i would like to know how many people work on eve development and what they do too. not that i really belive we will get an answer to that question. business confidentiality would not allow them to disclose the details.by now probably half of ccp personnel monitoring the forums want to kick and ban me. or send covops to silence me. :-)"
8/4/2011,would like a break down like they provided earlier.even though there was justified rage.plays still feel like ccp is not developing the eve part of eve. team bff seams to be the only team actually working on eve.

8/4/2011,"removing items from a cargo container does not require a targetlock.additionally, i won't support this on the grounds that, with this change, one could keep logistics cruisers permanently jammed with a large enough force. in an incursion site, that could get a fleet killed by sansha, since no ship could possibly fit enough self-repair to survive being primaried by the sansha without a lot of remote repairs or shield transporters being aimed at them."
8/4/2011,this thread is dumb and you are dumb.
8/4/2011,"anything that has a direct negative impact on another entity currently means 'aggression'. how do you propose to get around the obvious abuse of failcons in all high-sec ""wars"" and on low-sec gates if they were suddenly exempt?it is more than bad enough with neutral rr's being abused to hell and back as it doesn't ""directly"" affect the opposition.in short: you are either delusional/naive, too young to remember lr failcons or a high-sec griefer who wants even more alt abuse to prove your leet ""pvp"" skills against babyseals (ie. highsec carebears)."

8/4/2011,"loathe as i am to say it, it's pretty safe to say that faction warfare is still abandoned and will remain so. winter expansion won't touch it except in the form of balancing ships maybe. the fact ccp didn't even attend their own fw session at fanfest said as much - and when called out they promised a devblog - which by the way never came.i personally don't give a rats ass about nullsec - i don't have anything against it, it is a big deal in eve and it's what sells eve more than anything (drama, fleet fights, capitals, etc). i just hate it that a feature (fw) with so much potential is wasted - there are so many players out there that would join eve if it had a simplistic and easy to jump in to pvp system (i.e. what fw was intended to be) that could also be a career - as in a noob player could afford losing a few frigates a day or week and feel like they were making an impact in the game.oh well...i'm probably dropping my last account until winter to see how it goes. ccp hasn't even announced the next incarna release (vacations be damned, you do that between expansions you numbskulls) and rumors are flying you won't even see establishments or maybe even the racial cq's until winter. this is quickly becoming the worst expansion ever - just based off of subscription loss and, more importantly, the fact subscription gain has substantially been curbed. eve isn't dying...but it sure as hell isn't growing like it was pre-incarna."
8/4/2011,"hi there,first, my english sucks, so short version ... a longer version of this discussion in german language runs at"
8/4/2011,"look, it's quite simple. to quote the evelopedia ""the council of stellar management (csm) is a player-elected council to represent the views of the players to ccp.""so although the csm may have been elected by a subset of the electorate, much as happens in most democracies, the csm are mandated to promote the interests of the whole of the playerbase not just those factions who have been mobilised to vote for a particular candidate or candidates.to do otherwise is to be at odds with what ccp set up the csm to do.on your other issue, there is at the moment a lively discussion going on about how we can set up an organisation to do exactly what you suggest. if you are interested in helping you can contact me ingame.the current csm is by its own uttereance, at least those by the more vocal members, determined to do exactly what you say they are not. the aim, as far as i can see of the current csm, is to boost the interests of 0.0 at the expense of the other sectors of the game, the nerfing of abc ore in whs being a glaring example. why, so that 0.0 is ""less dependant"" on hisec. i'm sure the pioneers of the old west would have loved that. bet you those poor souls travelling through death valley would have been delighted to see an interstate highway or a mcdonalds, would have made life easier for sure but that's not how it was and neither should 0.0 after all the people in nullsec are there for the opportunities it offers. they are the pioneers, the tough, hungry ones making a better life for themselves. don't want to be spoonfed as well do they? no, the various parts of eve should be interdependant, hisec making the supplies and services nullsec providing the materials, markets and room for expansion of corps and alliances."
8/4/2011,"contact eve-university, they have a pretty good hi-sec presence."

8/4/2011,"since it's put up by ccp, maintained by ccp and added to by the csm, i'm pretty sure it gives an accurate description of what is expected of the csm.""it's not legally binding"" - of course not. but saying it's not binding is *not* like saying ""it's not accurate"".top contributors for this page----omber zombie [14]----erik finnegan [12]----inanna zuni [8]----meissa anunthiel [4]----mynxee [4]----tasman devil [4]----serenity steele [3]----nexus kinnon [2]----mara rinn [2]----isd alassien [2]category: csm"
8/4/2011,"sure, but there is no 'mandate' for them to represent everyone in eve. i think its their job to help ccp improve eve, and the csms should concentrate on areas of their respective strengths. what started this whole thing was a csm who hadn't a clue trying to tinker with nullsec mechanics. now before you say it, this csm isn't actively pursuing the wormhole thing, so no, i don't think there are any parallels there.this csm is by and large, out to fix nullsec. we're getting a nullsec expansion this winter, so i think its great we have a specialized csm to hopefully get this moved in the right direction. (third times the charm?) there are still a few candidates who are not part of the nullsec block, so its not like highsec has zero representation anyways."
8/4/2011,then what is the point of playing eve. i may have got it wrong but i thought eve was a *game* unless someone is paying you to play of course!
8/4/2011,"some parts of eve are really fun, some parts are not. try doing nullsec alliance logistics without wanting to take your own life on a nightly basis. but i think we all play this game more for the meta aspect than the actual half-baked space sim. it is fun belonging to an empire, protecting your borders and resources from other players in a persistent universe filled with political intrigue.i'm not saying there is no room for improvement in nullsec. i think we'd all like to see an incentive for smaller fleet fights, but large ones are fun too."
8/4/2011,kelduum revaan for csm7!
8/5/2011,"it's all relative--u want to be left alone, play a single player game.if by ""assumption"", u mean the mantra that most eve players go by then yes the point is still valid--don't fly what u can't afford to lose.u were saying, straw man? especially since attempting a suicide gank = automatic ship loss. u were saying?though u actually got the ""not as often"" part correct, that still begs the question: why r u still complaining then?u can play semantics all u want 'cause the fact remains: high sec isn't deserted like low sec. in fact, plenty of exhumers piloted by high sec alts of pirates still mine there and there r plenty of tears shed by them, namely u. so yes it is balanced enough. so u oppose all pirating? because there's nothing cheaper than not losing your ship from what u call ""griefing"" in low sec/0.0.the reward is the same as any other gank outside high sec. and i still haven't read a decent excuse from u.why construe when i can quote:...describes u perfectly. so u wanna try that again because i'd love to hear it."
8/5/2011,"no, i will just smile at your youthful enthusiasm, warily shaking my head about kids these days.please, try again, this time without making assumptions about me. i'll give you a head start:1) i don't fly a hulk.2) i can afford to lose it if i did.now mind you, those are far from the only assumptions you made about me. let's see if you can spot the most obvious one that is left."
8/5/2011,"honestly, i agree with this if nothing else. suicide ganking as such isn't really good gameplay. it exists to balance out concord - which also isn't a good gameplay feature either. what we actually need is a concord that is less omnipotent, which it is not an exploit (but still difficult!) to avoid. this means that instead of using extremely cheap, disposable ships, people will have an incentive to use expensive, purposefull fitted ships to commit crimes, that give them a chance to escape, but which will have a real cost if lost.in addition, we need a properly working bounty system with transferrable killrights to allow those who do get ganked to leverage their wealth to get revenge. that's the real problem here: not that the npc response is inadequate, but that the tools for player response are inadequate.however what we can't have is a situation where it's economically unviable to attack people in empire. that's just an isk farmer's charter, and it would shatter the eve economy.paul believes he deserves more (free) protection because he's spent so much on his over-fitted mission-mobile, while the plebs in t2-fit drakes are ignored by the gankers. it doesn't take much thought to see why this might cause problems - especially for the plebs in t2 drakes trying to compete with the officer-fitted nightmares.in conclusion: dont cry for more npc protection to add more layers of forced behaviour, ask for better tools to provide gameplay solutions to gameplay problems."
8/5/2011,"u're still trying and failing--that's why i'd love to hear it. because judging from 1 and 2, u're flying something else that u cannot afford to lose or else u would not be crying.u say u don't wanna get shot at yet u say u're not advocating for safety so i'll assume u're a moron as well. the carebear angle has been tried and it failed miserably every time, just like u, so like i said, plz continue--i'd love to hear it."
8/5/2011,"assumption...assumption...false...well, technically, the last part is not false per s<U+FFFD>, i don't really want to be shot at, but nowhere in my posts i have said anything towards that end.if you could put aside your preconceptions and read what i actually wrote instead of what you think it is saying, maybe we'll be getting somewhere.i do feel i have to clarify one small thing a bit more: when i say i don't advocate safety i mean i don't advocate hello kitty 100% resist 100k hp shield regen/sec safety, but i kind of thought that would be obvious; mea culpa."
8/5/2011,"""...i cannot do what i want with the ship i've spent hundreds of hours of gametime..."" so unless u're gonna state what u're flying, i'm gonna assume u're just crying for the sake of crying.and i quote:u just stated it twice now.only i'm reading your posts better than u're reading your own.see above. plz continue. /popcorn"
8/5/2011,"aw, you ran out of popcorn, sorry to hear that.well, while you go look up where i said [b]i[/] or where i'm crying i will get you some more popcorn. it might take a while though."
8/5/2011,how about the fact that u're still crying even after i've reduced your arguments down to just that above (if that even is one)? but plz continue if u think u can somehow save face by looking even worse than u do right now.
8/5/2011,"no need, i will let my arguments and your ad hominem stand as they are, i have no need to explain myself further to someone who does not read (or comprehend, which amounts to the same thing)."
8/5/2011,"yes 'cause your many self-conflicting statements and threats to ez the game til u like it or ragequit r so convincing while u still wonder why u're being treated as such. but plz continue 'cause your carebear angle didn't work before so magically, it's gotta somehow work now right?"
8/5/2011,"i didn't like the idea of removing insurance from suicide ganking, i did and still do to a large extent, believe it's a good thing to keep.but i've been thinking about this some more over time and i've started to change my mind.now before those that want this changing, because they feel it would balance some sort of injustice, start thinking that's my reason it isn't.the more i think about this, then more i think it could work to the gankers advantage.if this changes, then many many of those who feel high sec should be safer, would think this had done just that.the tears would be epic.i can't remember the last time i insured anything other than a battleship. i wouldn't bother with the tiny amount of isk needed for smaller ships, it's not even on my radar.the more i think about this change, the more i like it. i may even give it my thumbs up."
8/5/2011,"my two cents?allow transfer of kill rights. you kill me, i transfer the kill rights to someone and they get to kill you. the bounty hunter gets the wreck, you get satisfaction, and copy of the killmail for job well done. the bounty hunter gets an extended period of time to find you in your incursion boat.you can still gank like you did before, just not get away without penalty. unless you crafty (or just an alt) and can hide, or tough that you kill bounty hunters by the score. who knows? i see an increase in play styles available for folks.just enable the transfer of kill rights, and extend the aggression timer (perhaps at a fee to the victim) out for at least a few days.payback doensn't have to be quick.oh, and for pete's sake, flag neutral reppers. helping someone brings you into the fight. period. include repping and fleet boosting."
8/5/2011,"hear, hear!"
8/5/2011,"thumbs up.something needs to be done about this, thats for sure"
8/5/2011,"what about: remove all icons and replace them with a simple black button. in a few months a rookie will probably ask: ""what cool stuff did they introduce with incarna!""and he will be answered: ""cool animations for turrets and.... uhm.... a useless nex-store and one room to walk around and get bored.""he will ask: ""but what about gameplay?""he will be answered: ""well, a lot of new... bugs, glitches, undistinguishable icons, functionality of hangar was removed, scanning was screwed up, fitting manager was screwed up, server database got screwed up.""rookie: ""so ccp invests a lot of money to screw things up...?"""
8/5/2011,"yes does something need to be done about it. but what can we do, some people are fine with it, but for those highsec carebears to those in null sec its like war targets coming into your system and camping you in. maybe you can use a less expensive ship (like many of us do when it happens), but when it comes down to it what can we do? change the cloaking mechanic? make an auto kick after x minutes of inactivity? have the answer before you post a problem."
8/5/2011,fail!!!! lmao. i suffer from afk cloakers all the time. deal with it or go to high sec. your choice.
8/5/2011,"i could see if microtransactions were a big part of making isk, but since it is not.a possible solution would be and probably should be that after a certain amount of inactivity ie: not probing, not chatting, etc then maybe auto log off would be in order.however if this was to be implemented then those seeking low sec iskies who can cloak and wait out a system for the ""prime time"" to farm low sec would be hindered.i do see your point though, however beings i do come from realms where microtransactions effect ingame economy, not making any isk where you can withdraw into cash is no big deal imho.the thing i don't understand is while cloaked if ship is moving why it is not picked up as some kind of anomally from the propulsion say if u had scanner / probers looking for said ship."
8/5/2011,no!
8/5/2011,cosmetic only.
8/5/2011,"nonox shmoks whatever else ccp comes up with to introduce mt they will kill the game that way. they already miss millions of their income with cancelled accounts. remove that ***t and fire ***s who proposed it and attempted to push it through. otherwise they will propose more ***b things and you dear ccp will lose more millions or just break playerbase nerve and kill the game because people will leave by massive numbers.you don't have anything to offer more then it is now (was before mt) and wont have anything at all to offer to anyone if majority of players leave. graphics are outdated. sound not even mention, its laughable. all you have that attract us is unique gameplay and that what we pay for our subscriptions. greed destroyed many things centuries ago and will destroy a lot more in centuries to come. i would suggest you to back off and make loud apologies before you destroy your business completely. but who am i, just a paying customer. i hear you don't care about what we say, only about what we do. well you lost a lot of money with that approach already. happy ccp?"

8/5/2011,"target 0001 game is not real life but if game would be totally out of any logic nobody would play it. so this game have logic and everything interconnected in it like everything interconnected in real life. in this game you can't do something without appropriate consequences. in real life too. so there are similarities more then in other games where you can kill someone in front of a crowd and not be haunted down by game's equivalent of ""concord"".paulize would you like to be spammed countless times or have yourself bashed out in forums or in game or whatever else going on in games where you can change you name. people proposing this have interest in it but i don't see how changing your name will add to game experience. it will subtract from it for sure.you should think about naming the character before you created it. change of name in real life not that easy, have certain consequences and you wont do it each day. you want my vote on name change? fine you will get that if you agree that the consequence of name change will be 5 mil sp deduction from random skills from your char you change name to and if you dont have 5 mil sp you wont be able to change it.that will ensure that name changes to characters wont be epidemic in eve and still force people to behave a bit."
8/5/2011,"you can change your name in real life. you don't suddenly forget how to walk to do it either. it costs you, and you have to convince everyone you ever knew to call you by your new name. is it so unreasonable to be able to change it in game? for money? i'd say not everyone is going to just fork over cash just to change a toon's handle. if your old name is listed after the new under aliases, or change your block settings, whats the harm?"
8/5/2011,"yes, please. if there is a history it shouldn't be a problem. there are 2 possible outcomes. 1, people will change their names in large numbers, ccp will make a lot of money on the cost and people in game will have to look at name history as well as employment history (not a big deal!). 2, only a few people will change their names, ccp will make some money and the game will not be greatly affected.for people like me who chose a name and later thought of something better it would be nice. i put the thought into it and would be happy living with what i have, it's not a joke name but given the chance i would pay to switch it."
8/5/2011,under these conditions i would think about it. but why real money? why not to use isk? some real large amount of it?

8/5/2011,"what if every ship in the game would perform either faster or slower depending on what sort of morale your ship crew had.purpose/function: in pvp it is very important that there exists more possibilities for smaller groups of people to take down a bigger one. how: introduce a series of new leadership skillbooks. called something like 'hero in outnumbered situations' or 'courage in the face of death'. the higher you train it the more of a morale boost your ship crew will have in pvp situations where you are outnumbered and taking heavy damage.result: as a result your modules will perform better. your repair will work faster, your dps will be higher, ship agility and speed will increase etc. etc.cons:- if you decide to train 'hero in outnumbered situations' then you wont get a morale boost when you are not outnumbered."
8/5/2011,"crew morale should be tied to a number of different leadership skills.additionally ships ought to have maintenance costs associated with them to represent costs such as crew retainer fees, fuel, repairs etc.this would be a nice financial balance for the tendancy for supercapitals to blob - as they would have high maintenance costs by nature of their thousands of crew members."
8/5/2011,"i'd suggest you try to play silent hunter 5 with it's ""crew morale"" thingie. nice when you start but after awhile you hate that thing.too much of micromanagement kills the fun.negative on that one."
8/5/2011,well canipostplease my skill tree is pretty dam good
8/5/2011,"wow 3 pages and no one has yet to mention that between the reduction in sp given to new characters and the removal of learning skills, new players trained at 2x normal speed for the first 1.2 mil sp. (wasn't that long ago)didn't break the game... no one suffered...oldsters didn't ragequit en mass... and, it was newbie friendly.the reason that was stopped is fair enough.. ie removal of learning skills...however, new players are still handicapped today because 1) they usually don't train cybernetics to 4 right away (too many other priorities) and 2) they usually don't have a spare 100 mil isk to purchase a full set of plus 4's... much less the half a billion a full set of plus 5's can cost.i say bring back that feature... wouldn't hurt, and would help people like me who just started a new character (revealing my underlying conflict of interest in this post)"
8/5/2011,"the reason ccp took out the double training time was because they found out that new players, with the new attribute system and the double training time, could train up to use a drake, its missile systems, and have lvl 4 support skills in less than 2 weeks. they felt this was too much so they took out the training multiplier."
8/5/2011,"oh my, god forbid new players having a fighting chance, or even a bit of fun, can't have that...having to wait, and wait, and wait until you can do pretty much anything gets old, especially if you're new to the game.vet: h<U+FFFD> friend, come play eve with me, in eve you can do x, y, z ...new player: oh, sounds cool!new player tries x: can't, have to train for agesnew player tries y: can't, have to train for a whilenew player tries z: can't, have to train 3 days to be able to board the ship and fit some modules and still have to warp out every 30 seconds.new player: oh boy, i can mine 34 m3/minute or do level 1 courier missions, joy joy"
8/5/2011,"no guys ccp removed that new players multiplier so that some amebas can advocate for sp being sold to them and ccp will gladly do so ""in response do wide demand"" with help of their brand new nox mt shop.how stupid you can be people?you want more sp? demand return of multiplier not sp for sale. once they start selling something via their mt shop it will not stop and you people will leave the game not that much time after p2w will be fully in place complaining but not understanding that it is you who brought it on yourselves.and why wont you go play instant grat games instead of waiting for sps? what a lovely care for new players. how worrisome. how handsome for you to argue for sp for poor newbies. i am a new player and i dont want any sp for sale."
8/5/2011,"not supported.if you want to use the unfair advantage you already have, buy plenty of plex with real money and head to character basaar. you can get well trained character on day one.those who earn the isk in game to do the same, may spend years to earn enough to do the same.introducing more similiar features to aur shop, would only make things worse. we do not want game changing items in nex. take my word on that."
8/5/2011,"agreed, and because i have such disdain for the eve player base, but am grateful that ccp made such a wonderful game, and because i like to argue, and because your reasoning for opposing skillpoints for money is so flawed, here i am doing exactly what they want.you're poor, huh?money is an ""unfair"" advantage? it sounds like you just don't like the fact that some people have lots of money and want to use the game of eve online to try to get back at them . . . which is kind of sad and pathetic. (no offense)if they're stupid it takes them years. here's what you do: buy a year's subscription and play for a year without spending too much isk on dumb ****, then, buy a higher skillpoint character with the billions of isk you have. see how simple that was? it's not like it'll take you that long to get a good character, though. you should have billions in just a few months if you're halfway competent.as for ""earning"" the isk . . . gtfoh . . . it's a video game. this isn't a chinese sweat shop. you aren't gonna be starved or beaten if you don't make 20 rifters an hour. you need to get out more."
8/5/2011,wait wait canipost please did you just support buying a toon from the bazar in that last statement or am i just that groggy from waking up?
8/5/2011,laughable arrogant post.not worth to comment it.
8/5/2011,"most of the ppl against purchasable sp seem to be in favor of the bazaar (no, i don't have statistics, that's the general idea i got from reading this thread and a few like it), so what is the difference between buying a few plexs, convert them to isk and then going to the bazaar?buying sp instead of characters is a lot more granular, but it amounts to (roughly) the same thing: you pay money, you get skillpoints. if i wanted to, i can create and pay for 10 characters, skill them up, then sell them at the bazaar: bam, 10* x million sp extra in game, without anyone at the controls doing anything with the characters. the mechanism is already there, so what's the problem?"
8/5/2011,"why do governments tax people? i hate being taxed, the government should just print more money instead. what's the difference?"
8/5/2011,why wont you go to play instant gratification game instead of making your proposals of changing game rules?what's the difference if you play eve or wow?same goes to your tax comparison. it's not applicable to this discussion.
8/5/2011,"sp aren't really currency, you can't trade stuff with it.it does allow you to do stuff, much like money does, but in my eyes, sp don't have a value and is therefor not susceptible to inflation like money is.the only inflation it will cause is more ppl able to fit x module or fly y ship, and that is already happening, because ccp is already 'printing money' / handing out sp to everyone. is that a bad thing?"
8/5/2011,...character bazaar.
8/5/2011,"thank you for agreeing with me. at least, i suppose that is what you do..."
8/5/2011,"because those characters still had to go through the process of getting trained, instantaneously creating a titan character is different from buying one that has already been trained the old fashioned way."
8/5/2011,"but either way, they buyer isn't doing the training, they are still buying sp cause they don't want to spend the time training a toon up to do what they want to do. can say whatever you like about this, but buying a toon via the car bazaar or buying sp, is still in the end buying sp. just this way, people get to keep their mains and not buy another toon with a different name that other people may know, for good or bad, not have to worry about character scams etc in the process."
8/5/2011,"it's amazing how you can talk about other people flunking econ 101, when your own notion of likening buying sp to 'counterfeiting money' is abysmally flawed. in fact, it's so wrong, i don't even know where to begin... well, i do. for one, what, pray-tell, is counterfeit sp? sp that remarkably looks like sp, but with a uv scanner and a good loupe can be exposed as fake? /sarcasmno, i think the 'econ 101 qualification class' term you were looking for is inflation. which, mind you, has nothing to do with counterfeiting whatsofrikkin'ever. buying sp, to use the correct terminology, is like printing (legit, not counterfeit) sp out of thin air, thus causing a devaluation of the total sp pool; and thus causing inflation (you need a toon with higher sp for the same value).n.b. for completeness, it's truly out of thin air when you buy sp with rl money; because, yes, you pay for it, but the eve economy is not 'cognizant' of said currency/transaction; so, as to the eve economy, it just appears to be coming out of thin air.so much fail in this thread."
8/5/2011,so terrible.please unfix control key.
8/5/2011,just to bring this update to the new page since it's stuck on the bottom of the last one.
8/5/2011,"it would give us something useful to watch on tv in captains quarters!gas clouds, meteor showers, (comets?)randomly appearing anywhere in space.this would require all pilots in space to keep an eye on their ships, and to remove it from the 'danger zone'to counter this you can fit a damage control, which will reduce the damage taken by 90% but the rest of us will take anything between 1000-99000 damage throughout 1-20 minute period.main argument: space in reality is far from safe, the surrounding climate will get you in trouble 99.9999999999% of the times, not pirates"
8/5/2011,"supported for this, but only if we get hot gallente weatherwomen."
8/5/2011,"yeah not to mention the billboards in space, i hardly ever look for them anymore. makes me sad because they fit so nicely into the game visually"
8/5/2011,supported.
8/5/2011,"split bonuses for something that alters the setup of a ship to the point that you fit 3 logi modukes instead of 6. and please dont whine ""oh the gardian would become useless."" because as a level 5 logi pilot in all 4 ships, and carrier in amarr and caldari, i call bull. logi is about working together at its core. we are the good guys. so if you can bring one race and be good, fine. but personally i hate seeing that guy who can only fly caldari be shut down because it's scimis only, for example. so let's be able to bring one ship to the table and have it work well. but let's also have the option to bring all 4 of them so we can be brilliant. so.. 5 high slots. ships are cap stable with 5 transfers running in battery mode and logi 5, 3 with a tank. amarr distibutes cap to basi/one and scimi. basi reps other basi and... actually.. caldari are ecm *****s. eccm for them? anti jam ftw. onerios rem rep themselves and gardian.scimi gets shields. it might be a hell tank tho."
8/5/2011,"ok, so i was* drunk and chatting with a friend, and had an idea for a change to gate guns.to cut immediately to the chase: scale the damage they do, by two factors:- number of gcc targets in range- size of gcc targetsthis number would scale exponentially, meaning that the bigger your gang the harder it is to maintain a camp on a gate or station - to the point where it can actually become impossible to remain there indefinately.the main possible abuse of this system we arrived at was ""oh let's warp in 20 gcc rookie ships on that camp so they get instagibbed"" - the size component of the calculation takes that into account.now, let's see how hard i get flamed for this.*am. it'll be fun to see how bad my spelling is later."
8/5/2011,why is this specific fix needed? i mean gate camping is fairly easy at the moment made easier by hp buffs and so on but this would be far to easy to exploit. just increasing the dps of gate guns will just increase the number of logistics used in stationary gate camps and discourage normal gangs from engaging on gates. this will lead to a lower amount of pvp over all(regardless of whether they were gate camping or not)
8/5/2011,despite loldrunk postlow sec gate camping is hardly a problem even if there was no gate guns at all.because cloak. if you dont know how i suggest find out.wolololo
8/5/2011,"wouldn't work. the more logistics you bring in, the more sentry dps increases to the point where it's literally impossible to tank."
8/5/2011,"read between the lines, ccp has chosen their words carefully. there will be no enhancements with a paywall! (but actually, there will be, because you can use stupidly large sums of isk to purchase these!! so it's fair, right?)my answer is no to mega-transactions1.2 billion isk for a monacle? thats like buying a spring jacket for the price of an aircraft carrier."
8/5/2011,did i support this already..? if not - here goes.
8/5/2011,"in a perfect world, for sure, i'd say scrap micro-transactions. but you know what, in the past couple years, they have become the industry standard for mmos, and for almost all video games.there is nothing wrong with the micro-transaction model. if you don't like it, don't buy it. you are lucky you play a game, where there is an alternative option for purchasing micro-transaction items (nex items can be listed on the market, and hopefully new additions continue to follow that trend). players of other games don't have that option when it comes to their cash shops. this model has introduced a whole swarm of new and great free to play games that would be unable to exist as f2p without the micro-transaction model. games like wot, lol, and others. hell, the entire free to play genre on steam uses this model.i know does not follow the f2p model, but if managed properly, micro-transactions are fine for mmo's like eve.everything on the nex is accessible to everyone in eve, regardless of the amount of real money you spend. you can buy it all with isk."
8/5/2011,"meh, i don't care about mt's being in or out. i just want actual content. incarna (even for a first iteration) has been a major letdown."
8/5/2011,"i wouldn't mind keeping microtransactions so long as it was set up to withdraw back to real cash when real cash was put in, an example would be a system like eu has."
8/5/2011,"i'll support this, just to prove the csm will not even dare propose it and/or shove it to the side with the excuse that ccp will do it anyway."
8/5/2011,yesget rid of micro-transactions. presence of it makes me actively search for other game to play.
8/5/2011,yes.
8/5/2011,simple thing you fire a tracker dart on someones ship and you can track which system its in. repack the ship gets rid of it and it runs out after 1hour or more. it could have a set range like 3 jumps so your target can out run you. a script for sub cap and one for cap. if you fire it on a cap the range is ly not jump.
8/5/2011,obviously never heard of locater agents. (well its what i use to track people)
8/5/2011,i have an alt thats sits in a locater agent station with another agent 1 jump away. if you are tracking someone who jumps alot you have to wait the 30min timer on each agent you use. also you need to track on a alt because if you go to a location and then they leave you would have to go all the way back to the locater.
8/5/2011,a very interesting idea.i'd say if will be done training should be very long and integrated into scout type of skills.support it a lot.
8/5/2011,"supportedeve needs something like this, locator agents are lame."
8/5/2011,"interesting idea, darts would follow ships, so if someone swapped ships, then they are no longer tracked???and if they gave the ship to a friend, then you'll be tracking a new character?? this might be hard to program in!"
8/5/2011,not that hard to program in. a day of programmer's work tops.and idea is so interesting and truly desired. could make hunting a lot more interesting and challenging. when ship dock it gets inspected by ground crew and probably dart or magnetic tracker or whatever it is will be detected and capsuleer alerted.not that hard to program in. :-)
8/5/2011,fof are under-powered for everything but pve. even then the lack of power and focus is questionable.
8/5/2011,"yep, lots of cheap fun to be had."
8/5/2011,"why do you want to take away my sentinel's/keres'? :sadface:your purpose can be fulfilled by giving the 'off' af's (vengeance, ishkur, jaguar, harpy) logistics bonuses and giving the remainder an extra pewpew bonus (tracking/damage/rof).mass needs to be decreased across the board though or base speeds increased a tad .. they are generally incredibly fat compared to all other frigates."
8/5/2011,"a supercapital bomb launcher for titans only.bombs ""nukes"" can only be deployed every 30min.bombs ""nukes"" will cost 3bil to make.bombs ""nukes"" has the old dd effect and radius.once the titan deploys a nuke it will be unable to move for 10min.general idea, could use tweaks."
8/5/2011,"i've seen a lot of bad of ideas on this forum, and this is one of them."
8/5/2011,:getout:
8/5/2011,"i like how people use the word ""nuke"" in this game they really should read the description of rockets aka frig class weapons before they post another ""nuke"" thread"
8/5/2011,no one in there right mind wants the old dd back in any form.
8/5/2011,"well, hence the build cost being 3b for each bomb.this way each bomb wouldn't be dropped carelessly."
8/5/2011,"isk amounts can never be used as a limiting factor in warfare. if a powerful ship/item exists, it will be used as much as needed to win, regardless of the cost."
8/5/2011,"hence why titans were/are so expensive to build.they were supposed to be a legendary force in space.and were, for a little while.now they're everywhere."
8/5/2011,can you do any other tunes ? this one is getting old
8/5/2011,i vote we ban you for your abysmal failure at posting.
8/5/2011,i suggest you stage a protest in jita with a smartbombing paladin. post km's :)
8/5/2011,"if someone protests then obviously csm doing its job.you might not be doing much if you not criticized.what's the reason for csm recall? trip to iceland? hmm, i'd love to have free trip to iceland too. but i'm not on csm to have that honor.and i don't have either experience and reputation to even be on csm.until i see well grounded reason for csm recall my vote is negative on that."
8/5/2011,"how cute, eve has its very own tea party."
8/5/2011,"considering they are getting stuff done (their agenda, but still), i don't think they are a failure."
8/5/2011,"i've read between the lines, and i'm honestly surprised that more haven't brought this issue to the table.i am one of the few that actually anticipated the new facet of eve that incarna was meant to bring to the table, the ability to experience your avatar incarnate. the idea of seeing the world of eve with your own clone eyes was an amazing dream. being able to stand beside a ship the size of manhattan island, show it off to your friends, then go about collecting the corpses of your enemies to display in your captains quarters was an amazing prospect.however, i no longer see bring things in the future of incarna. the sudden, unprecedented release of the nex market has caused some disturbing thoughts to emerge, which seems to answer many questions i had previously held concerning how we would obtain station slots, upgrade our quarters, or change clothing. any individual of moderate intelligence could now infer the direction i intend to take this topic.the experience of incarna will come at a price, and that price is in aurum. ccp stated that aurum is the currency of incarna, which can only lead me to believe that most all items in incarna will only be available through the nex market.this means the following:to purchase a slot in a station for your bar, you will have to use aurumto purchase a cq upgrade, you will have to use aurumto purchase any additional clothing, you will have to use aurumto purchase any objects to populate player owned station space, you will have to use aurumso you see, the experience really comes at the price of how much of your own money you are willing to spend. there are certainly no performance-enhancing nex items, but pretty much everything in incarna is classified as purely vanity when one remembers that eve is really about internet spaceships.csm, please make sure that ccp doesnt put a paywall in front of the incarna experience."
8/5/2011,"what, did you think it would be free?as long as it can be bought with isk, i could care less if it came from aurum originally. that is the only thing that matters."
8/5/2011,so buy plex with isk...convert plex to aurum....and now you have your experience...
8/5/2011,"i would not have a problem if it was dirt cheap. like pennies. otherwise, it'll just be more stuff i won't use (if i want to play sims, i'll play sims)."
8/5/2011,"simply put... if a pos is anchored and offline for a certain period of time, 3 months or so perhaps, then anyone can come along and unanchor it. it would help clean up space.option b would be for them to decay to the point of self-destructing."
8/5/2011,i would vote negative on first option but second option would modify not to self-destruct but to decay to a point when salvager skilled level 5 equipped with t2 salvager in 6-12 hours could salvage the pos. timeline for decay would leave as is 3 month. then i would vote for it.
8/5/2011,"^^ i'd vote negative for this thought... first off, it makes much more sense of a codebreaker to be used that allows you to unanchor the pos rather than salvage it. that would be much more reasonable! also, hacking a pos would have to be an act of aggression. @ingvaryour first suggestion is alright, but it many people will not like the idea of losing ownership of the stuff they anchor. what about the mods around the pos? do they become unanchorable too, or just the pos? your second suggestion i don't particularly like. my personal thought is that pos's should not be ""destroyed"" unless a player does it. i think the idea solution would be to reduce the hp of pos armor and structure by about 75%. perhaps boost their shields to compensate. then whenever a pos is offline, let it have zero shields. this way, an offline pos can be dispatched by a much smaller force, but it still takes some effort.then a small pos would have 500k hp, and a large pos would have 2m hp. a 500 dps stealthbomber could solo kill a small pos in less than 20 minutes. the only issue with my countersuggestion is that it becomes very easy for a pos to be ganked while its being setup. as such, they would also need to reduce the anchoring/onlining time for towers... and now too many damn things are being tinkered with."
8/5/2011,"you already have keyboard shortcuts for 'attack' and 'return [to bay|and orbit]', i wouldn't mind having some for 'launch group' as well. and ofc, one keybind per group, as you can make more than one group.it would not add in-game functionality, but it would add more things you can do with the keyboard instead of the mouse."
8/5/2011,"the primary use i see for this would be...i have 6 drone groups in my drone bay.light - thermal - assigned to ""launch group 1"" shortcut ""1""light - explosive - assigned to ""launch group 2"" shortcut ""2""med - kinetic - assigned to ""launch group 3"" shortcut ""3""med - thermal - assigned to ""launch group 4"" shortcut ""4""med - explosive - assigned to ""launch group 5"" shortcut ""5""heavy - thermal - assigned to ""launch group 6"" shortcut ""6""when i show up to a mission instead of going into the gui interface, right clicking and saying ""launch group"" i can just press ""3"" and it will launch a group for me, then i can press ""f"" for them to go fight, and when im done press ""shift+r"" to make them come back and then press ""6"" to launch some more drones and kill kill kill.i'm not sure how much this would help in pvp, but in missions it would help a lot."
8/5/2011,"idea:to attract the mission running community to try out incursions. 'incursion missions' where you would basically be helping concord fighting off the sansha invasion.and also those who are interested in transport and industry could potentially start a nice career providing supplies and also transport services for people in the incursion scene. who says missions have to be boring npc stories, when an incursion running fellow such as myself could potentially contract my ships to be delivered to a certain destination or perhaps order a bunch of ammo, drones and ore to be built and delivered for a good price.why:- main reason is alot of newbies in eve start the game by doing missions. 'incursion missions' would give beginners in the game a taste of incursions and its awesomeness. and also expose them to the countless financial opportunities connected to industry/transport/leadership.- im talking about a whole new way of introducing rookies to the game. 'rookie help' channel is not enough because there you can only meet friendly people who are not really looking to fly with you. but if the newbies were to start the game with people seeking to do business in a time of war, then thats more engaging."
8/5/2011,"this piece is written largely to highlight points of interest where progress can be made in the view of the op.the failing corporation and incentives to counteract such failings.we all know quite a few of these. corporations with about fifty casual players of which only a few log on daily and more then half went inactive along the road. the player loyalty to a corporation means they will often wither along with the dying corporation and eventually stop playing eve due to this degradation of the quality of their online time due to having less people around to play with.but how could we place punishments or incentives to counteract this natural development of a good portion of corporations?possible punishments might be:loss of corporate functionality as less and less players log regularly. tying in corporate functionality with the count of active players in that corp. this would be a harsh measure that would punish corporations for growing stale.increased cost to operate from zero isk for fifty active members to a heavy fee as you dip below fifty active members.incentives (an option the writer would prefer, because these add functionality instead of taking it):a corporate hangout tied in with incarna. as you have more active members functionality gets added to this hangout.in game killboard and in game forum per corporation until the active membercount drops below fifty, at which point functionality begins to decrease until non functional at around five members and below. if these are implemented without incarna tie in at first this would not require any art resources.creation of a middle ground between pos and outpost of which the defences and functionality are directly tied to active corporation membership. this would be an extra isk sink that would add functionality to the corporate entity by providing an added level of service for a dual investment by the corporation. one needs invest isk or resources as well as have an active memberbase. the suggested base functionality is docking with module switch-over, repair, defences and social incarna features (hangout with your mates) being tied in with the number of active members. it is preferably located in a deadspace pocket accessible by lockable (but probable) acceleration gate and only permissible in lowsec, 0.0 and wormhole space. this will also serve as an in-between point for corporations looking to venture out and could be tied in with dust 154 (sweep the complex clean, please). the lockable acceleration gate would provide a campable point as well as a betrayable access point (gate permits that are destructible and dropable objects, maybe only used to allow people not in corporation entry).integrating active corporation members in base costs for running a pos. at the moment this is done indirectly via the planetary interaction. but, come a redesign of the pos systems, it could be fully integrated in the basics of the pos. the more active players a corporation has, the less fuel it takes to run (based on the assumption that the active member contributes by just being there for corp).a short little bit on destructible outposts.on this matter i think a testing phase where outposts become unusable for three or six months is in order. this to check beforehand if this mechanism will not be used by power blocks to simply burn everything by shifting alliances repeatedly as well as reduce the chance that smaller entities get a decent foothold somewhere without having to answer to a bigger block immediately. also, outposts represent a huge investment, simply destroying this would be a massive isk sink that would have hard to predict effects on the lay of the land in 0.0. also, just reducing the outpost's functionality would not require any new artwork and could thus be tested before actually committing art resources that could be spent anywhere else."
8/5/2011,"engaging the playerbase, stepping it up.at this moment everything is largely optional with the exclusion of a declaration of war that has not been mutually agreed upon. by engaging the playerbase in a less optional fashion immersion is increased as well as opportunities created for communication in game.one such option would be that the nex ceo could publicise a flight itinerary for his promotional tour and then attempt to follow this route.along similar lines a sansha attack on 0.0 power-blocks / factional warfare fleet engagements / highsec station-hugging griefers and their prey looking to fight one another would be juicy and provide tears as well as jubilation. especially since it can be assumed that any resources committed to these things are resources that might have been lost in the engagement everybody was seeking before the new enemy rolled in. it would introduce a dynamic to any engagement that would give a new meaning to ccp bashing and ccp fanboi.a big plus to such engaging of the playerbase would be a rotational schedule for it where all layers of developers within ccp would be slated for one such event every two months or so with event lasting two hours and upward. this would ensure both ccp and the playerbase of moments of communication that aren't non-constructive shouting matches, but rather playing together, furthering storylines and working towards mutual understanding by shooting at each other, racing each other, hide and seeking each other and all other manner of silliness people will come up with if left to mess around."
8/5/2011,i endorse this idea. it's one of the better suggestions i've seen lately. hopefully ccp takes note and we can get a system much like the idea presented here into the actual game.
8/5/2011,"nariya you say i came up with a pointless mechanic. wrong. no idea is pointless, since assembly hall is a space created for all ideas to be discussed and voted upon, there is no such thing as a pointless idea. so please be more specific or constructive about what you say in here, we are not interested in your attitude, we are interested in the development of ideas and how efficiently we can do it.and about your argument ""be in fleet, get shot, whole fleet gets kill rights, your duel just became blob warfare, congratz"", nariya you are thinking to small because majority of people will never do this, especially those who are newer to eve. also for alot of people in eve lowesec/null is a big block, they wont go there to seek 'fair fights'so basically my counter argument is that something more large scale is needed, you can't expect everybody to suddenly be loaded on courage and wit and do a series of risky things. there has to exist a middle ground. eve eventually has to reach out to these people who are needing a little charity in the pvp department."
8/5/2011,"^^ this.there are already a few mechanics that allow for people to have 1v1s. mechanic 1: both ""duelists"" jettison a jetcan with 1 ammo apiece. both take from the opponent's jetcan. now both players have aggro on each other and can engage at will without concord involvement.the only downside with this is that by taking your opponent's jetcan you are not just ""shootable"" by your opponent, but his/her entire corp. then again, that person is engaging in an honorable dual with you... so won't have to worry about them getting involved... right?mechanic 2: both of you join the same corp. you can freely engage anytime, anywhere, for any reason.the downside here is that your ""opponent"" might not be so ""honorable"" and will kill your ship and pod when you least expect it.mechanic 3: for the pittling price of 2 million isk you declare war on your nemesis and ask for a 1v1 to settle things.the downside is that it is a bit of a hassle to go through the war dec procedures and it does cost a bit of isk (however small) to do it.no... it sounds like you want an instanced environment where a person must conform to certain ""standards"" of conduct. i do not support this."
8/5/2011,"that's not what it sounds like to me? to me it sounds like he want's the option to grant others kill rights on himself.while true, all those things you mention are indeed a way to get to duel without concord interfering, they are also a hassle, some even with additional downsides (which you've already mentioned).eve should not be a hard place, it should be a harsh place, but most importantly, it should be fun instead of gui-imposed tedious."
8/5/2011,just for giggles. lets take away the ability for the largest ship in the game from hiding in something that should be smaller than it is.
8/5/2011,"in exchange i propose the titan's can be anchored anywhere in space and when doing so function as a pos themselves (sans ability to add pos mods).- anchoring allows them to extend their shield to form a bubble (like a pos), they can still shoot using their own guns (no dd) whereas outside forces have to attack it as if it was a 'normal' pos.- increases to shield/cap recharge/capacity and local repair as if a dread in siege.- long'ish anchor/unanchor times.- for extra giggles, if anchored titan has capital rr in highslots, any ship within bubble is treated as if having it applied ""for free"".but we will never have anything but spank/tank options for ships like titan's because ccp have the ingenuity of a mentally challenged newt"
8/5/2011,"the first system is the defender advantage. it allows them to fight at different times of day to harass the attackers advances and not make it all about the final timer.the second system is the attacker advantage, it's the easiest method, but also sets up staged fights in the strongest timezone of the defender.yes it's more like ping pong, but there is the safety net timers as well. the biggest advantage is that it allows smaller groups the ability to harass very effectively and forces the defenders to react. this should promote a lot more confrontations outside of the peak hrs and a lot more smaller skirmishes.10 mil hp with bounties is not anywhere near the boring structure shooting we're talking about today. it's also much more fast pace with 24 hrs being the maximum rf timer meaning fights are more constant. this system, you're talking about 30-50 mil hp minimum to chew through in most systems to be effective with no wait times for stupid modules like sbu's. your also talking about direct harassment and forcing people to respond or lose systems by smaller entities. there's a lot of benefits over the current system"
8/5/2011,does this even matter? waste of code imo
8/5/2011,"then might i suggest that the csm contact those parts of the game which they are not drawn from and consult. if they have gaps in their knowledge about certain aspects of the game then it is their duty as members of a body supposedly representing the players to ccp to find out the views and concerns of all parts of the game. that is, i think a very good reason for have a more representative csm in the first place."
8/5/2011,"they should all have been looking at the csm like this. it's not like we're not all in the same sandbox. someone kicks sand out of one area, it ends up in another.someone throws sand into the machinery in null-sec, it has it's effects in hi-sec. nerf anoms - more lvl 4 runners. nerf 4's - have more explorers (or whatever). change plex or introduce something else to spend it on - change the dynamics of game time for plex. it's all related."
8/5/2011,i live in nullsec and the empty systems there hase no plexes to run.... so u cant make lotz isk in those systems!soon nullsec is all russian and no1 else can live there .... or go learn some russian soon so maby the invite u.
8/5/2011,"are they hoping to avoid another :18 months: thing? time to censor out all the truth about the meeting and leave us with nothing but a hallow shell that we are supposed to be satisfied with.it took a long time to get the csm to something respectable, only to see this current csm undermine all the progress. why do you all do this?"
8/5/2011,if you thought the last csm was respectable then the joke is on you i'm afraid.
8/5/2011,"so insults, hyperbole and poo-flinging apart, we're back to where we started: there are no ""hi-sec"" representatives on the csm because no-one running on the ""hi-sec"" platform had the organisational skills or the motivation to get themselves elected. it's not inherent to the process that ""hi-sec"" reps dont get elected; ankhemthingy and dierdre vaal both ran on a hi-sec focused platform and got elected. if there was a credible, intelligent candidate who ran on a platform of genuinely reforming hi-sec rather than just ban griefers put arkanor in 1.0 mishuns gief x-type l3wtz naow than i'd be quite happy to give them one of my votes.but at this stage i'm just waiting for someone to make the suggestion that ccp reserve csm seats for ""hi-sec"" representatives..."
8/5/2011,"i don't think that has even been discussed. it's certainly not something i would advocate. no, the proper, democratic way is to be more organised than anyone else and this is something that i and others are doing right now."
8/5/2011,"that's good to hear (and i genuinely mean that). there is so much that could be done to make empire gameplay more exciting. a working bounty system alone would have a whole cascade of positive knock on effects. and no one could argue with a straight face that the wardec system doesn't need reform. faction warfare desperately needs updating - the potential is there to make pvp accessible to new players and provide some really good fun.and then there's things like smuggling, black markets and so on, although they're more of a lo-sec focus.i look forward to reading your manifesto."
8/5/2011,withdrawn due to seeing other post below.
8/5/2011,not much to say about greyscale's blog but looks like they are drinking the 0.0 koolaid. seelink
8/5/2011,do you realize that nullsec encompasses a large portion of players and right now it is quite broken?how is fixing that a bad thing for eve or 'drinking the koolaid.'
8/5/2011,this is where you are wrong.
8/5/2011,"there have been a few posts recently suggesting that the csm may not represent the interests of the community as a whole, as well as the fact that only a small fraction of players actually vote. i put this apathy down to lack of knowledge on the part of the players what each of the candidates stands for. if you don't know what a candidate stands for then why vote fro him? i've been thinking on how the csm election process might be enhanced to generate more player involvement. i present here my thoughts on an alternative process and invite constructive comment.objectives:achieve more player interest in the voting process and community as a whole.method:1) ccp to build a webpage that lists csm candidates, where the name of their highest skill point character is presented along with approximate number of skill points, corporation and alliance. candidate should be able to provide a paragraph of text to be entered here with link to forum or website for further info or discussion if desired. the current system where candidates can make a post in a general forum makes it difficult to see easily and in a single place what each of the candidates stands for. we need to make it easy for players to get information if they are to become involved. presenting sp is useful as voters then get an idea of the experience of the character, and if high skill points are a necessity to gain votes it encourages candidates to present their main character rather than an alt, enabling players to do meaningful background checks, if desired.2) make voting a 2 stage process over a longer period. candidates would need say 1000 votes to get into the second round. just like primaries followed by a main election. the current voting process favors players associated with major alliances - in effect players who have already been through preselection. a 2 stage voting process would produce strong candidates but from a wider variety of backgrounds.3) create a list of 'standard' interest areas. each candidate would have to select say 4 subject areas of interest. these would be topics such as: nulsec, sov, faction warfare, pve, ship fitting, cap ships, exploration, etc., to be selected from a standard list. this would enable voters to see at a glance the issues a candidate stands for. limiting the number a candidate nominates prevents a candidate claiming interest in everything, and makes the selection meaningful. the assembly hall forum should be broken up into assembly hall sub forums for each subject area on the standard list. the current assembly hall is amorphous. having sub areas where related threads are grouped and associated with the interest areas of csm candidates makes the forum a clearer means for communicating with csm members aligned with a certain subject, creating proto-political parties, and has the further advantage of making the assembly hall easier to manage.so my proposal in summary is for a set of changes to enhance the csm voting process by giving voters useful and easily accessible information about candidates experience and what they stand for, enabling strong candidates to be established with a wide area of back grounds and interests, assisting players in identifying csm candidates associated with given subject areas, and to facilitate discussion on these subjects."
8/5/2011,"look man, i know you mean well, but you are clueless. i know you will discredit me instantly and say i am biased simply because of my alliance ticker, but i work and lobby for a union in real life, and i work for a political party during provincial and federal elections here in canada.elections, at any level, are always controlled by the most organized special interest groups. winning an election primarily comes down to identifying your supporters, and ensuring they actually vote on election day. no amount of websites, 2 stage processes or lists of candidate ares of interest created on the part of ccp will change this. ccp should simply act in a manner similar to elections canada (i'm not familiar with american, or icelandic election processes, but i assume they hav a similar arms length government organization to oversee elections). their job is to simply provide the means of conducting the election, and ensuring there is no fraud. it is up to the voter to educate themselves on the candidates, and the issues they represent. eve does not hold your hand in the game, why would they hold your hand here?"
8/6/2011,"with no due respect, f u and your crowdsourcing. we have been clamoring for hybrid changes for years and do not even get a chance to vote on it. csm ~ snafu"
8/6/2011,"here's one. 1) add covert cloak2) player in black ops = player not in localthere, now you can pvp in null sec without having to try to miraculously catch people before they run to posses or have to fight supers. not being in local is not game breaking because it is like that in wormhole so that is established as reasonable.for all the nubs that think being able to warp cloaked and cyno is some sort of an overpowered advantage. you should look into combat scanner probes. they can kinda cover an entire system with no prob. and 30 seconds required to covert cyno is more than enough time to spot someone."
8/6/2011,needs a boost to ewar to make them more used. or give them a better tank. that what i say.
8/6/2011,"so what? no, there actually doesn't.your economic analysis is sophomoric, a transparent attempt to affix some sort of nobility to suicide ganking. if mineral prices were to suddenly rise, insurance payouts would rise with them, and suicide ganking would not be affected."
8/6/2011,supported.
8/6/2011,"supported.it's possible that i'm just not used to them, yet, but the new icons aren't as easily distinguishable from each other."
8/6/2011,"agree entirely with your sentiment, but this is wrong. remote fleet boosters function perfectly ""present but uninvolved."""
8/6/2011,"sounds to me like youre arguing for name changes here name changing will not unleash the apocalypse, a far worse option currently exists and no such thing has happened (character transfers, see the following). the same mechanics that keep everyone in line will still be there. as it stands now the only option for obtaining a different name while retaining sp is to sell and then buy a character. these character transfers leaves absolutely no accountability. name changing creates a regulated alternative that has accountability. thus it would reduce the amount of unaccountable acts making eve a better place.had you read the thread you would have seen that already you could also read a thread before posting depending on your nationality, it can be as easy as paying a fee, signing a document, and waiting. all of these consequences have been proposed already and thus it will not happen each day not really. a similar idea has been proposed already, although there are many better alternatives that are more grounded in logici too could care less what currency it is in; they are all interchangeable anyway"
8/6/2011,"why not link their moral directly to your combat logg? specifically how much isk you make or loose on average and your kills and losses. you could even make it ""+ bouyant"" so the longer you go withought dying the higher it slowly, slowly climbs. likewise you could add crew pay just like tax. a % of your taxables to be redirected to the crew. this would have to be somthing that took effect over the course of a month to affect their morale to keep people from paying their crew more as they go into battle and then not paying them after the fighting is over.for instance; you would start the game with a 100% morale. every time you you die in pvp you take a morale hit similar to a sec hit only it's fixed at say .02%. every time you win it goes up. you can counter this to a degree by increasing crew pay but it takes a month of pay before it takes effect. and it also accrues let's say + .5% every 30 consecutive days you don't die.also drawing from ccp's model of possibilities for upcoming crew ideas, you could have command staff purchasable, stealable, or possibly even spawned from your own crews pvp experience from time to time who could also effect this morale bonus of yours. while your crew would be the same for all your ships the command staff could be moved from ship to ship."
8/6/2011,"yeah, except, correct me if im wrong, isnt majority/all ship functions pretty much controlled by the capsuleer by themselves? i dont think the crew really matters at all.frankly with how expendable these people are anyways, i'd say they realistically would always have ""high morale"", else their cammanding officers would take a cue from ww2 ****s and just execute any crew members deemed ""weak""....in other words, crew morale is irrelevant and should stay that way."
8/6/2011,what fascinates me about this particular idea is that its a very individual way for all of us to specialize in a particular form of pvp. it is unique in that way. because the amount of new leadership skills that we can come up with can be endless.for example. i can train a skillbook called something like 'leadership training class where we were taught to handle 5v1 situations very efficiently'now the next time you happen to be in a 5v1 situation you will get something like a 10% boost in defence/offence/etc. (or possibly even increase the enemies stacking penalties on ewar?)sky is the limit when it comes to new and exciting leadership skillbooks.
8/6/2011,yes! remove that aur stuff from the wallet ui. also i'm willing to pay 70$ for the removal of the monocle from the game.
8/6/2011,its a cheap marketing ploy and it disgusts me

8/6/2011,+1 supported.i wish i could trash the free 1000 aur we all recently received too...omg to the number of precision boots that have popped up on market!
8/6/2011,"i give you props for thinking, but it sounds like a balance nightmare."
8/6/2011,i woneder if 'balancing nightmare' is also the reason why hybrids balance is taking so long. if this is the case then this idea of supercharged might not add to the difficulties of balancing since its already a nightmare
8/6/2011,how about a gun that bans people from posting on the forums?
8/6/2011,"adding 'special rules' that go outside the normal characteristics of weapons should be an option of last resort, and this seems to be more about a k3wl/awesome new feature!!! for its own sake rather than any actual attempt to fix a problem.also: does not compute."
8/6/2011,give hybrids an ammo type which translates damage inflicted into minutes of forum ban and i will use that and nothing else for the rest of eve.
8/6/2011,"ok i respect your opinions, and if its not a popular idea, then lets all stop posting on this thread. personally i would give it a thumbs up if i saw somebody confirm that this idea could work well (if done correctly) and that it could potentially fit into the game nicely.also i am surprized i havent heard a strong enough reason why this idea would 'fail miserably if it were to be made real', but thats just my curiosity speaking."
8/6/2011,ranka would you care to clear up your thinking a bit? it seems so clouded that i did not understood what's the connection between what you say and protests against mt in eve. you want to spend your money or dont know what to buy with them. hey i have great useless thin air for sell only for you very exclusive 1000$. you will have your own canister of pure air. and a monthly fee to keep it lets say 10$. oh don't look at these other people who bought it. yours is unique. sounds dumb? well that same dumbness you support with mt in eve.
8/6/2011,bumping because i love this idea.
8/6/2011,"i like this idea. however i would make it so the ship size changed damage done. frigs and destroyers = small smartbomb t2cruisers/bc = medium t2battleships = large t2caps = 7k range (1000 damage)supers 10km range 1500 damagewith racial damage: caldari/kin, amarr/em...."
8/6/2011,"supported, at least in principle. a fair bit would depend upon details."
8/6/2011,"i'd love to see a space overhaul in general. the graphics in that area feel pretty dated.asteroid belts feel too small. i'd rather warp into an area that has thousands of miles covered in asteroids, even if they aren't all mineable.planets look horrible. needs some higher res textures. i mean, hell, look at mars.give some planets rings that are actually huge and you can warp to and it's like a big foggy area.on that note, stars need higher textures as well. it would also be cool to see binary stars (two or more stars in one system) since they are actually pretty common."
8/6/2011,"speaking of stars, solar wind and flares, while it would be purely for affect, shouldnt there be like a random chance that a massive coronal ejection comes off a sun (one fo the larger ones i mean) decimating asteroid belts and/or pos's that are weakly or unshielded, would make planning attacks around these in null-sec kinda fun, especiually if it had a big radiation hitting the shields aurora/drugtrip affect.also, i do believe 2 stars orbiting eachother are binary stars, but if its 3 its a trinary, etc etc. but yeah, definetly need to see some of these, and maybe a massive red giant or super giant with a black hole next to it drawing solar flares into it making it visible. (these kind of stars have actually been seen, i do believe they happen when a one star in a binary dies before the other, not sure though)"
8/6/2011,"i like it.i would like to see more regions that look like (a better version of) that mission through the dangerous green uh whatever.nebula too; 'foggy' space.wspace effects outside wspace, with visuals to match (sorely lacking from wspace as well)."
8/6/2011,"ccp is trying to re-balance the eletronic atack frigates making it a little better, since it is one of the less used ship in the game (along the black ops and titans).one reason that this frigates are not as used as others are, is because they don't do anything special. they are weaker then an assault ship, slower then a interceptor, don't cloak like a covert ops ship, nor drop bombs like a stealth bomber. also they are useless compared to a recon ship that can be fitted to be the useful version of the frigate. also the ew modules that it uses can be distributed among the fleet and you would have the same effect, since every ship can use its modules.so, i see in this topic: (""use of heat, targetable modules, and electronic warfare"""
8/6/2011,"c. balance6. it have to be made so that a group of lets say 5 of those dont insta fry whole bs (heavy stacking penalty for each rack)i will not support it at this point, but go ahead with brainstorming..."
8/6/2011,"one solution for this module balance is making it a hi-energy slot, and since it is only usable by electronic attack frigates you can fit at most 3 of them simultaneously.also this module could have the limitation to fit only one per ship. then the balance would be allot easier."
8/6/2011,"for fitting this module would require 10 cpu, 10 powergrid and consume 0,3 energy/s, also the module could have a max range of 45km, this way the module would fit well on the eafs of all races. also would fit in their optimal range. this values could be acquired with max skills. i'v used eft for this values and it seams good to me."
8/6/2011,"this part made me gigle the most, since that line i cant take u seriously anymore."

8/6/2011,"edit. just had another look and your op just makes gate piracy impossible, and any sort of pvp on gates in low sec impossible (just because if one side agros first they end up get wtfroflstomped by the ever increasing dps of your gate guns), it would basically remove pvp from the gates for everyone who isn't either a wt(militia or normal) or already -10 but not gcc'd.it would be terrible."
8/6/2011,"i have no problem with the microtransactions. they're optional and don't break the game. it seems crazy to shoot down ccp's need to make money during a global recession. many games are going in this direction in some way or other. even diablo iii's will have a new version of it.fashions to personalize my characters seems fun to me. at some stage i can see myself getting a few things. probably when the rest of walking in stations goes live. ;) till then, i'm patient and like watching what they create.a friendly way to integrate the aurim currency into eve, might be to let players gradually accumulate little amounts of aurim while playing - perhaps from multi-part-mission end rewards or from high end ratting/anomalies. that would feel quite nice, because buying aurim would then be a way to top up existing levels.it is super that everyone got some free aurim from the eve is real site.sapph"
8/6/2011,"they already breaking the game. noticed how many players left the game already? check the total amount of people playing now comparing to lets say two month ago. fashions to personalize characters can be done on regular market or in customization screen. your post seems so strange that makes me think you are a dev alt or ccp employee.diablo iii will be totally different then eve game and comparing these two games is like comparing salt and sugar and saying they have similar taste. these are incomparable.oh and blizzard right from the start of it say there will be mt but it will be real money player to player. with blizzard taking fee for transactions. do you see the fundamental difference between what blizzard will do in diablo iii and what ccp want to do in eve?and you can keep your aurum and swim in it. i hate that thing and i dont like ccp pushing their mt shop to me with their ""gift"" aurum. i don't want nor asked for any of that. we asked for fix of bugs and expansion. we got mt shop.and i dont care if ccp have problems with money. neither should you care. its a business and if they make wrong decisions they go out of business. they ruin their own game and i wont say ""oh global recession i need to support them"". that part of your post sounds out of mind.they could make one game instead of two they make now. they could expand eve and fix bugs and see influx of players. no they decided to go other way."

8/6/2011,"i think f.o.f. missiles should be given a new ai which would fire forward (the direction the ship is facing) and then pick a target in that general vicinity, favoring whatever is closest to directly ahead of the ship, though with a bit of randomization. that would give a player some room to pick targets."

8/6/2011,"where exactly do you think all the tritanium that empire miners mine and the faction ammo that empire missioners sell goes to? who do you think buys it?if there's one thing that every intelligent, self-interested hi-sec denizen should hope for, it's that 0.0 is ""fixed"", and fixed soon.edit: and it's that awareness of the interdependency of the empire/nullsec economies - and that what affects one plyer thereby affects everyone else - that seems to distinguish the so-called ""0.0"" candidates. it's an awareness that you would do very well to acquire if you genuinely wish to get elected to the csm."
8/6/2011,"nope, i have no intention of standing for the csm for personal reasons. what i am trying to do though is to organise hisec better and put forward a number of credible candidates who will take a broader view of the role of the csm. like i said previously, we're working on that."
8/6/2011,"i have seen cedille complain in post after post about null sec, the csm, and the mittani but i have yet to see a single constructive post about the improvements (s)he would like to see in high sec.perhaps the op could start a thread about high sec and the problems there and what (s)he recommends be done to fix it and perhaps get involved with the few members of the csm that do have a vested interest in high sec.as a relatively new (have played off and on for several years) player that spends pretty all my time in pvp free i see all the different play styles as parts of a whole. rather than jump up and down and complain about the csm (and a lot of them are petty childish complaints considering that these are people playing a game and not receiving a paycheck) why don't you be a positive force in the debate? all this us vs. them attitude makes it hard for me to take you seriously."
8/6/2011,"i think we should all ask ourselves this:do we want the majority of people playing this game to be of the variety who can only comprehend games as simple as call of duty or battlefield?i say regardless of what platform dust is on, it needs to be complex enough to ensure only the more intelligent/adaptable people can even play it, because frankly, if dust playerbase does draw heavily from the cod/battlefront community, i will not be playing, as even lowly carebear-griefers have more maturity then most of those players."
8/6/2011,i take offense at that. i can hit things once in a while.
8/7/2011,"i support remaps every 4-6 months via cool down, no mt. i'd rather see my sub go up a couple bucks.i started in 2006 with my first toons and ever since, i'd always spend those first few months maxing learning on any new characters. i wasn't thrilled about them being taken out of the game, but i'm glad to see them go if it brings in new players. this doesn't cross a line in my book, and we got up to 5.7m sp to spend in other things, possibly skills on our 'off' attributes technically saving even more time.so honestly, if changing remaps to every 4-6 months makes it more appealing for new players so be it. i support this.i do not support microtransactions of any kind in this game though for any reason. with that said, i will repeat that i don't support remaps for plex/aur/isk nor special time with anyone's grandma.old vet players need to get over themselves; what's the point in being a vet when there is hardly anyone left in the game one day :p"
8/7/2011,"negative on that one.want immediate satisfaction? want to do whatever you want without regard to your own mistakes?world of warcraft awaits.ranka this time i'm sure you are ccp employee. probably from marketing department attempting to push some form of p2w into the game. so far your proposals are so out of place and so far from eve but so close to payments for things we are not supposed to pay ever. and your arguments for all of your proposals and posts you make end up in style ""pay to get stuff"". either because ""other games (wow) have something like it"" which is a false statement since wow is different game for different base or like ""it's recession we need to help ccp"" that is totally out of mind since ccp is business and if they make ***b decision (two games and **ck us) its their problem and should not concern my wallet at all. it would work with dumb youth you probably used to deal with wherever they hired you from but most of eve players are grownups and with enough brains to throw your proposals out of the window. disgustingly clear marketing department.you chose your neurals and you have 2 for starters. then each year you have 1 more. you decide your strategy for a year to come at least. if you can't do that go play instant gratification mmos that come to market work for a year or two and go off to file bancraupcy.and stop your marketing campain. it's already way too obvious.as for players voting for this thing you guys enforce p2w on yourselfes. don't cry out when and if ccp implement it and you will be flying in empty universe before you leave to other games too. you taking part in killing this game too by voting for ***t like this.edit: grammar"
8/7/2011,"a covert ops cloak would be cool but, ya i can see it being a bit to overpowered. for me i think the only thing that needs to be changed is jump range and maybe fuel bay but i won't push it. no need to change dps rate/ rate of fire or any of that...who ever made the comment about them taking a long time to train....really a jump drive equipped battleship takes to long?! give me a break...they are pricy, but well worth the cost. i have no issue paying the current price for them."
8/7/2011,1
8/7/2011,1
8/7/2011,give me back my ship spinning. i would like getting out of your pod to be optional.
8/7/2011,+1full support.
8/7/2011,1
8/7/2011,"+1while i appreciate what ccp are trying to do, cq was released way too early and too unfinished."
8/7/2011,"+1i don't mind keeping the cq, but let's bring back the old hangar as the middle step between docking and entering the cq."
8/7/2011,if name change will involve some kind of considerable consequence to it in game be it large isk or sp deduction (better both) and/or forcing player to inform all his/her contacts in game that name changed so that they have to click something to see the change (dont you have to tell people you know that you changed the name in rl and answer questions why if it's not marriage?) as a measure to prevent frequent or really needless name changes i would vote for it.
8/7/2011,"+1i support this. there are some god-awful names and giving those people an option to fix them, for a fee like portrait swap or character transfer, would make my eve experience more enjoyable :di do like having a name history as part of your character inf"
8/7/2011,"ok, i werent aware we were playing kobayashi maru, fact is, even if your freaking kirk, no amount of leadership skill is going to make your lazors do more damage just because there are more people, and besides, how in the hell are you going to decide what counts as 5 people? if its just reds in the vicinity, you get 4 buddies to shoot you once and there you go, you get your bonus and its still 1v1."
8/7/2011,who is kirk? and you're wrong about the lasers because equipment can always be manipulated to perform better through skillful people (like crew members)
8/7/2011,"works well in sp games, but all it would do for eve is add some ""must train"" skills that are mandatory if one wants to be competitive."
8/7/2011,"all who see ""crew morale"" idea as nice please go check subsim forums for silent hunter v.or even better. play the game.you will drop crew morale after a day or two.and concerning eve it contradicts the backstory. capsuleers are ""half gods"". they don't care about their crews. these are as expendable as veldspar in high sec. low morale? dock to station sack out these losers and hire new crew. it's just sounds fun but when you actually manage that for a week you wish for an option to get rid of it.was negative on that one and still is negative on it.edit: typos"
8/7/2011,"pfft. i think a ship crew would be a good idea, but perhaps morale is more dictated by success as a pve, pvp pilot (as already suggested by combat log record), and has nothing to do with idling a station or otherwise being inactive. paying said crew might be blah, but perhaps the cost of producing the ship can already consider the hire cost of the crew for life or something. it doesnt have to be a micromanagement nightmare.seriously though, why do our ships even have windows?edit: other thoughts, ship crew could have an impact on ship performance, but it shouldn't be too critical, though maybe something like x chance of exceptional boosted performance if ship is in danger of being destroyed or something. this idea definitely needs some thought and refinement."
8/7/2011,+1...and the isk was aligned to left for a reason.
8/7/2011,no support.
8/7/2011,you are the winner!
8/7/2011,truthfully we are all just wasting our breathe with this debate.... ccp isn't going to implement this....it has as much chance of getting in game as golden ammo getting in game.
8/7/2011,why are lower level ships not fun? i had fun with them. most everyone else i know in eve had fun with their first frigates and cruisers. why are you unable to? perhaps the problem lies with you? *gasp* *unthinkable*
8/7/2011,"i never said that. however, the veteran friend will likely tell the new player all glorious things about the game which require at least some training. the new player will have all sorts of glorious ideas about the game, and then it turns out he has to go through a lengthy process to do those things.sure, he can do a lot of other things in the mean time, but those aren't the things that lured him to the game, and quite likely in a different area of the game than what his friend is doing.while you can't alleviate that entirely (playing the market needs isk, running missions needs standing) quite a few thing get a lot better with a few sp (like more cap, pg, cpu, being able to actually fit that second gun or a bit more ehp instead of getting blown up in 2 seconds or taking ages to accomplish anything).please do remember, when you started you probably either started with 800.000 sp or still had the multiplier, so you got to fly something decent quite quickly :)"
8/7/2011,"the 800k sp was killed awhile back (apocrapha i think?).as for the training multiplier... bear in mind that when they were in place, ""learning skills"" were there as well. generally, one's entire training multiplier ""phase"" was spent training up those ""learning skills"" which provided no tangible gameplay ability outside of ""training as fast as everyone else.""with the removal of learning skills and the addition to everyone's base attributes (quite basically, all learning skills became inherent and permanent), there was no need for the multiplier as everyone was now training at ""max speed"" from the get-go. just drive right into training up ships and other stuff."
8/7/2011,1
8/7/2011,"what about the problem with people blowing up in front if jita? no not self destructing, just blowing up. will the damage from any exploding ship be zero within the 250km radius of a station or gate? thus may fix the griefing problem, but then what is the legitimate use of this mechanic? only in deadspace complex or cosmic sites?i would add the following tweak that solves the exploding ship chain reaction exploit: have ship explosions deal only crew damage. not regular ship hp damage. this in conjunction with my recent crew as a necessity proposal, will result in exploding ship damage harm the battle effectiveness of your ship, but not cause it to explode, avoiding the concord and chain reaction problem."
8/7/2011,"i'll support this discussion going on. looks like with a couple of kinks to work out, but some potential here. some made easier with crew. return the favor and consider the crew proposal, adding a new ( but simple ) damage dimension can solve many game balance issues. crew"
8/7/2011,"the simplest solution to exploding ships outside jita is that in highsec, there is actually no aoe damage radius. however, this will be yet another nerf to gallente blaster and drone boats."
8/7/2011,"not if you use use my crew damage addition. yes, i did think of it's affects on gallente. drones have no crew and gallente have the least penalties for crew loss. please read my attached post"
8/7/2011,"bs vs frig is already handled by game mechanics. explosion radius vs sig radius. so there's no sense in arguing how the explosion will affect different sized ships.self destructing isn't the same as being destroyed. during a battle, you're trying to keep your ship together. then it takes too much damage, can't keep the core stable any longer, and catastrophically fails. self destruct is voluntarily causing the core to fail. so once again, why would anyone design a self destruct that only makes your ship -explode a little-?"
8/7/2011,i support this.gg & fly safethe different types of stars should deff play a role in this.i am getting tired of flying into the sun and nothing happening.
8/7/2011,"+1cool thoughts, getting stuck in an electrical storm and ending up on a planet full of apes might... err might be... the wrong genre, but yes, totally support more space effects like weather, nebulars, cosmic anomalies and so forth. furthermore, it would"
8/7/2011,"there is one easy solution. sentry guns should deal damage for every ship with global aggression flag (gaf). if there are 10 ships with gaf in camp, sentry guns should fire on 10 ships at the same time.- difficult rr for 1 logi and 10 other ships- no changes for 1 vs 1 gate pvp"
8/7/2011,my line of thinking was that there aren't enough deterrants in this game to blobbing up. this would be one fairly easy way to make bringing more people a disadvantage.
8/7/2011,this needs a bump.
8/7/2011,engage!
8/7/2011,suggest potential discovery of the milkyway and earth as an expansion to new eden.new race of ships and politics.a deep deep space exploration through a network of wormholes which can't be populated through current mechanics. potential for testing new space and ship mechanics (think first/third person motion controlled space flight).+ expanding the lifetime of the game whilst potentially phasing in a new pvp mechanic.
8/7/2011,"+1would be an interesting idea for like a mega expansion, rediscovering the milkyway through a new type of wormhole like the one that got us all into new eden in the first place. i don't know about adding earth empire/federation whatever as playable race,"
8/7/2011,"currently the only difference between these two is log out restarts your client and you have to log back into the game with your username and password.my proposal is that when you hit the log out button, you are taken directly back to the character select screen."
8/7/2011,"+1i thought i remembered seeing something on here on this already? /shrug.totally supported though, most games are like this when switching to other characters. seems to be a bit dated not having this feature but it's not a big deal. i would like an easie"
8/7/2011,1
8/7/2011,i agree
8/7/2011,"+1remove them from the game. i'd gladly pay an extra couple bucks a month on my sub to keep this the game i signed up for.additionally, i do not support items players can't build themselves, i do not support a new currency, seriously, why do you need a sp"
8/7/2011,i would not call wspace safe from invasions. check out my alliance killboard and you will understand.
8/7/2011,"hello everyone! ill try to expose my ideas as clearly as possible with the idea behind the change.[super carriers]-add a siege mode to be able to deploy fighter bombers, this will make them have to commit for at least 10 mintues to do their enormous dps-not able to use a cloak device, they should be to big for that, same as stations cant be invisible these enormous war machiens should not either and make them more vulnerable-nerf scan resolution to the same levels like if they had a cloak equiped-extended agression log out timer, less cheesy logoff tactics for the ammount of hp they have[titans]-not able to use a cloak device, they should be to big for that, same as stations cant be invisible these enormous war machiens should not either and make them more vulnerable-nerf scan resolution to the same levels like if they had a cloak equiped-extended agression log out timer, less cheesy logoff tactics for the ammount of hp they have[dreadnaughts]- 300-500% extra dmg in siege mode against supercarriers and titans, so they adquire an additional anti super capital role which is really needed on today's game and make them useful again- able to recive remote repair in siege mode, make them a bit less vulnerable[destroyers] (anyone itll uses this?)- give them a 500-1000% extra damage against fighter-bombers, make these currently useful ships into a nice and fun new rolex, kill those nasty fighter bombers[anti capital battleship] (t2 bs new hull or something?)- a new bs hull able to equip 2 x-large weapons with a very weak tank in order to put some pressure into capitals and supercapitals, dunno how else we could balance them but its a bit of a wild idea"
8/7/2011,"i just had a thought. this idea is based on an already-mentioned idea of trading in asteroid minerals for certain nex items like ships and modules.in addition to me asking ccp to make the clothes in the nex store vulnerable to damage in some form, they can also request capsuleers to pay not just with aurum, but also with certain commodities extracted from planets. coupled with the fact that dust 514 will impact the way planetary colonies are managed, conquered, or protected, this could help either increase or decrease the nex prices (and ultimately isk prices in the general market) as dust bunnies and capsuleers fight for control of the planets.the idea is to not only generate pi commodity sink, but also allow nex prices to be better controlled by the players. eventually ccp will have to allow the nex items to be destructible in order to avoid a situation in which every player eventually owns the same item (thus making it pointless to buy more - therefore, making ).and no, we are not naked in our pods considering that after leaving one station in my pod and dock into another station, i find myself still wearing the same clothes from which i left. now, i don't know about you guys, but i don't see a single magic closet in the cq.what do you think?"
8/7/2011,"sorry sir, i cannot support anything to do with the nex except its removal from the game.if ccp wants to make more money they should give people more reasons to play the game, not devise obscene ways to make more money from existing players that will start to unsub.i do support more reasons to do pi though. additionally, if players could manufacture clothing themselves like we should, and it would be epic, then why not throw some stuff you get in pi on the bill of materials? supports new ventures in pi and not more of the same old you require to manufacture mods and ships. i haven't personally done anything with planets, but i'm all about giving more tools and incentives to industrialists."
8/7/2011,"hello ccp.i am one of the players of eve online and i would like to aks you some questions, that i would be glad to your response. but let me start from the beginning.you have done the great game, but i do not have to tell that. you know it. when i compare the very first trailer to today<U+FFFD>s, it is really a huge step. troughout many years, you have improved the gameplay, graphics,.. and all of the ""stuff"" that makes eve (and that universe) so awesome.well, let me tell you why i am writing to you. all this was really great, until the incarna expansion.i know that ""walking trough capitan<U+FFFD>s quarters"" is a stepping stone to the next freatures that you may offer. so, ok, fine. the reason why am i writing this list to you is your improvement of turrets and bays. everyone must see that you have spent many days of figuring how they could look like, and finally made them that way. i can honestly say, that you have changed them into something twisted, mostly brownisch colour  they are unknowable. the older models, icons,.. were trully better. you have changed fighting and mining turrets, and this list is ""aimed"" to the miners, their turrets, icons, but especially their beams. you have set all the mining beams into single, permanent, blue beam. well, what were bad on that previous views of beams? you have erased one of the (very few) differences between normal and strip miner. their icons have also changed, but not very well. one is able to find just via is<U+FFFD>s name, the other does look like an axe.you have used the older models of beams for a few years, (a few is ironical), and i am wondering what led you to these decisions. there are my questions:would be there a possibility to make the turrets still visible, also from more distance than 250m? in previous versions, there was a button to hide them. by incarna, you have just permanentlly turn it on.would be there (please, at least) a possibility that you change the older beam of strip miner back? generally beams of miners? (also the beam of ""miner i"",..) would be there an option to choose, which icons of items would user use? i mean, that the player would to choose from wider options, like: newer icons for figthing/for weapons, and still use the older icons for mining/miners. would be there a possibility to add a button to choose (and switch) between this new station enviroment and that older one? (in order to view the active ship as flying ship in a ""room"" from above view.)in the end, i would like to offer you some solutions to my questions.i have noticed, that during the previous versions, by installing some moduls into ship<U+FFFD>s slots, they did affect the look of other things. i am pointing on the fact, that after adding ""mining laser upgrade ii"" the light around the older skins of ""strip miners"" did change. so, what would you think about taking back the older beam (of strip miners and miners,... generally) and after that add some effect on the beam or on the asteroid that is being mined (their shade, (a little) colour, very little lightning (very), or just sparkling, or nothing) by depention on the usage of ""mining crystal"". on the other hand, your change of beams of mining drones are good. or if you think something gotta to use blue-whithisch mining beam, let it be them.well, i would be really glad if you read this list till here, as much as i would like to read your answers to my questions. i really, really hope that you will care about this. ps: as you maybe noticed, (maybe not), i have published my first list in the forum (""changes that came along with incarna"") at eveonline.com. this is the very shorten version of it."
8/7/2011,parially support in part of answers and some changes to be done with mining things. icons not really important to me i can live with these but if majority want it why not.ladies and gentleman why do i get a feeling that entire incarna thing was outsourced? it have so many inconsistencies with storyline and general look and feel like it was done by totally different dev team.

8/7/2011,the ui just seems sluggish. pods don't warp out right away. also frigates don;t seem as agile. please fix it.
8/7/2011,"thank you for the invitation to reply. as you may or may not have heard a small group is currently setting up an organisation to address this. if anyone would like to contribute to this effort please contact jaxon grylls in game. he has taken the lead on this as i am in infrequent player and have a lot to do in rl so cannot give the amount of attention this subject needs. we have set up a mailing list and ingame channel (external forum to follow, thanks lakitel) and if you contact jax he will be able to point you in the right direction. thank you."

8/7/2011,please be specific and quote the stats. thanks.
8/7/2011,"its pretty common knowledge that many, if not most nullsec players have at least one alt in highsec, probably more than that on average. with the way the game is structured right now, its not feasible for an alliance to operate without trips to jita and at the same time, not feasible for nullsec mains to make the trip to jita. there's also invention, suicide ganking/griefing/scamming, and l4's that many players keep high sec alts for.can i ask players that identify as 'highsec' only players a question? why are you so adamantly against 0.0? have you ever tried it? the game is a lot richer of an experience once you become accustomed to the lifestyle. it's definitely not all blobs blobs blobs, despite what you may hear."
8/7/2011,"i can only speak for myself of course. no, i'm not ""adamantly against 0.0"" what i am against is the perceived threat to hisec by elements of the csm and others to give 0.0 advantages at the expense of other sections of the game. it may not be all blobs, blobs, blobs but it does seem to have a lifestyle different to hisec and one which does not appeal to me. i'm happy to use eve as an occasional diversion from the pressures of real life and a slow tranquil playing style is what i enjoy. i run a few missions, explore, especially in cosmos systems and take my time, for me, at my own pace.i have never said that i want to make the life of 0.0 worse so that i can enjoy playing eve. on the other hand i do object to any attempts to make me pay for the priviledges of others."
8/7/2011,"what are these advantages you speak of? high-sec shouldn't be, (and won't be,) nullified to the point that no one wants to live there. however, eve is based on a risk vs reward concept. some of those ratios are being looked at as possibly needing tweaking; specifically in making industry more rewarding in nullsec because right now its infeasible despite the increased risk and :effort: required."
8/7/2011,"yes, i have tried 0.0 and i have found it boring to the level of tears. in the thread about the last dev blog a guy has made a interesting comment to which no one has replied. for some people the adrenaline rush is a pleasant sensation, for some people isn't. probably a good percentage of the people living in 0.0 found the adrenaline rush pleasant and so accept the negative parts of it to get what they like. others, like me, rarely get an adrenaline rush from a computer game and don't find it particularly pleasant, so they aren't interested in searching for it. for us most of the restrictions, requests and regulations that 0.0 alliances impose to survive aren't worth the hassle as we get little of interest by being in 0.0.all said and done, making 0.0 richer for the single player and/or for the alliances will not make it more interesting for us. making the game more varied and compelling in all the sectors of space will keep our interest in the game and keep us hooked to eve."

8/8/2011,"please visit your user settings to re-enable images.give us actual icons, not blurry images."
8/8/2011,1
8/8/2011,this is a good comparison.
8/8/2011,honestly the turret icons are the last thing i am really concerned about in eve. wouldn't hurt to just have the old ones back until they can make ones that don't look like microwaved turds though.
8/8/2011,yes it is silly as meny ader ting at poses i dont know way wie still have separete all moddules there way they not module build still and ader tings.
8/8/2011,"living in w-space a few issues could use a bit of work:- private tabs in corp hangars- private tabs in ship maintenance arrayswhile it is a group effort, everyone has some personal possessions, especially in w-space where you can't just go on the market to buy that one item your corp member borrowed without you knowing.also, there are some corp members i don't really trust with my ship (like taking on sleepers and trying to perma-run 2 local and 2 remote reppers then wonder why he is back in a pod once the cap runs out ) so i rather they don't have access to it so easily. i don't object to them storing and retrieving their own vessels though.someone with the 'security officer' role (or some new role) would have access to it all in case someone leaves the corp or stops playing, so you can still offline and unanchor if you want to take down the pos.while on the topic of tabs, i'd like to be able to make tabs inside a tab, much like a container but sharing the space available. containers can work as well, but then i'd like for them to be usable without having to put them in my cargo hold first. main reason for this is my ocd-like habbit of sorting stuff :p- ability to repackage at a posi don't know if it was the intention to have to fly every ship you have back to k-space one by one when you retreat from a wormhole, but bringing them there all at once in 1 industrial is no problem at all (well, bs won't fit, but you get the drift).see also my ocd above: i want it to be tidy it would also clear up some of the clutter in the corp hangars, having lots of cloaks and warp core stabs in there"
8/8/2011,"allow public bpo copying.currently your corp can do me/pe research via alliance. your bpo is then simply returned to your own corp hangar at the end. there's no real legit reason the same cannot be done for delivering bpc's to your own corp hangar.edit: i'd rather see public manufactoring too. you know, make renting out pos slots a viable industry (not just for me/pe research)."

8/8/2011,the only solution is to give us old hanger.
8/8/2011,"hello, this is a serious suggestion for improvement and not a trolling attempt, so please read calmly. ;-)considering that one can buy isk with plex, and knowing that ccp needs more money - otherwise ccp wouldnt have come up with the nex clothing-store, which at this point is useless since you can not show it off really as nobody can visit you in your captain quarters (am not saying the nex is bad in itself), or that ccp is right now having a wholesale of their real-world items store.how about the ability to buy skill-points for real-world money ? say 1 million skillpoints for 10 usd ? reason i suggest this: ccp's original idea against ""grinding/camping/hoarding/griefing"" is to make the skills realtime trained, on- or offline.which was good.but now, with the amount of skills available, and lots of them ranging in many days or months even to learn them at higher levels...there are immense daisy-chains of skill learning necessary to be just on your own (example: flying an orca) this isn't just about the ""catch-up game for beginners"". sure, newbies get twice the speed in skill points until they reach 1,6 million skill-points. but 1,6 million skill-points is really nothing. and unless you've been with eve since the beginning like i have (since beta 4), it's rather pointless. sure there are things you can do to be a pvp-tackler, but maybe that's not for everybody?so to further ccps income flow (to accelerate the ""'incarna' across every ship, station,base,planet-surface"") i recommend to allow to charge 10 usd for 1 million skill points. you can also limit it to a total max of say 10 or 20 million skill-points altogether, that way the ""elitists"" of eve arent an 'endangered' species ;-)thoughts? opinions? suggestions?feedback is most welcome.cheers mateys"
8/8/2011,counter-proposal: drink bleach.
8/8/2011,"personally i think if it was limited to each account...not character, there was a hard cap on the amount and they stopped allowing the sale of characters it might be an ok idea.personally i think it would just be a better idea to start characters out with 3mill unassigned skill points so people could start out and choose what they want and also allow the respec of skillpoints for a cost."
8/8/2011,run me through your logic on why you expect a different response here than what you are receiving in the f&i section.no.
8/8/2011,i like that idea
8/8/2011,supported. i have no desire to play barbie dress up and will never use the nex. it's pointless screen clutter for me.
8/8/2011,"even the new guys? on an alt, i can see you'd start with the learning skills, but i'd say it's the new guys that started with things that were actually fun, instead of training something that would, in a few months/years, earn itself back :)"
8/8/2011,this xd
8/8/2011,"back then, if any ""new guys"" asked about what to train first they'd be greeted with ""get your tier 1 learning skills to 5 and your adv. learning skills to 4. no exceptions."" it was actually pretty hostile. the basis for this was that learning skills took about 2 or 3 months to fully complete and usually paid for themselves in under a year.if you didn't train them and just dove right into training ships, weapons, and other stuff then you'd be ""left behind"" after that 1 year mark (i believe i read somewhere that after a year you would have 20% less sp if you didn't train your learning skills compared to someone who did)."
8/8/2011,"actually when i started..you had to train up the learning skills pretty quickly to get any where. i do not even remember what we started with at the time, i keep thinking it was pretty anemic. you were nto going to be able to do ****.however now i guess a veteran can tell new guys ""hey it is much better than when i started, ccp holds your **** for you now"""

8/8/2011,"have you just joined eve online right now? let me enlighten you on something.1. the planets are way better today then they were back when empyrean age was the latest expansion. resolution and visual effects were horrible.2. asteroid belts already had a visual overhaul. although, i like to see those same asteroids spread around the systems like an ""actual"" asteroid belt that's up to 1000km long.3. back then in the empyrean age expansion, stars were so small, that even if you warp at 0 to them, your frigate can block its light. nowadays, the star's corona floods your ship with bright light and they are 3d instead of 2d.4. side note: stations were actually further from the planets until the tyrannis expansion came along.yeah, things have changed a lot since then.in regards to the op, i agree. i like to see space act like real space in terms of the level of environmental dangers present (micro-meteors, heavy radiation when getting too close to the sun, etc.)."

8/8/2011,"i'd like to point something out here... according to the lore, when the eve gate collapsed and stranded/starved all the colonies that would later become the ""4 playable races"" of new eden the ""terrans"" (see: ""earth people"") were far more advanced than we are now. the jovians are the exception, having maintained most (but not all) of their technology after the collapse.it's taken us a little under 20,000 years from that incident to go from the ""dark ages,"" where we had little technology, to where we are now.check out this trailer from a few expansions back... go to 1:27 and see what happens when a battleship fires a modified ""terran"" jump drive as a weapon."

8/8/2011,i agree that ml and pl of blueprint copy should affect invention. however my solution would be bit different;print with unresearched ml would have 10% greater failure change in invention than optimally researched one.print with unresearched pl would have longer invention labtime.this is pretty much all what needs to be done.original t2 prints are what they are and you can obtain one by paying healthy amount of isk. there is no need to nerf those by trying to make current system match the old one.

8/8/2011,i saw a couple of threads in gd that ask specifically for this. support the idea here if you like it.
8/8/2011,the true fix
8/8/2011,how about a change to where the lowsec gate guns start off very low dps to where even frigs can do quick work on a gate in lowsec but not long. the gate gun dps however over time starts to get more and more dps. eventually it gets to the point even heavily tanked ships even go down.this allows lowsec people to use lighter ships and catch more of the sneaky people but the option of just sitting on the gate camping all day getting gate radiation sickness in the brain is discouraged.it mainly also makes the map feature of showing cynos a possibility that some daredevil can go smoke cynofrigs in lowsec no problem for example.
8/8/2011,"definitely something that should be looked into. you could also add progressive debuffs to pirates who linger too long at stargates. scram ,dampening, and tracking disruption should come out of gate towers if enemies spend too long at gates.edit: forgot my thumb!"
8/8/2011,"fyi: frigates, interceptors and eas are already used in low sec as tacklers, on the gate. get with the timesalso, it seems to me that you are trying to abolish gate camping, because you find it boring, and the people that actually like gate camping can go to hell because they are not playing the game the way you think it should be played.get frelled."
8/8/2011,"please check out the following .pdf linkplease note: this document was originally created by p<U+FFFD>tur j<U+FFFD>hannes <U+FFFD>skarsson on behalf of ccp.a couple of the points in the document caught my eye1) 'the purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp. this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness, understanding, and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base.' 2) publish meeting minutes within three days of the meeting. this in the context of the duties of the secretary/vice secretaryso, how are they doing do you think?"
8/8/2011,"jaxon... sorry, may i add a paragraph from just below where you got your info?candidates are expected to be active on the csm forums and participate in the discussion of topics. they are also expected to adhere to the eula/tos and carry themselves in a manner that sets an example for other players to follow.thanks buddy. itallics would be the focal point."
8/8/2011,"i could not agree more and so far, from what i've seem , the current csm or at least parts of it hold certain sections of the players in contempt. referring to a post by the mitanni i believe. to me this sort of thing brings the csm into disrepute."

8/8/2011,meh... nvm.
8/8/2011,agreed there are things that need sorting out in hi-sec but surely the areas where the least ppl are need more work to get a more even distribution?

8/8/2011,i would argue that it's better to have a highly interested and on average more informed group giving feedback rather than every loser with big dreams and vague notions of how eve works.not to mention you need a small group to discuss and debate future proposals under the nda.
8/8/2011,"you had me reading up to ""on average more informed"". recent events is evidential that part isn't true for this csm. besides, what makes a nub with unrealistic dreams any less important than someone who sits in 0.0? especially if said person pays a sub like everyone else?"
8/8/2011,"this csm knows far more about null sec than any csm previous, an area of the game long due for an overhaul. their input, which is by and large representiive of the residents of nullsec, will be invaluable to ccp. how would high sec residents be able to provide meaningful feedback on this area of the game?surveys wouldn't be a bad thing for some things, but they're no replacement for the csm."
8/8/2011,"i'm sorry sir but kindly disagree.a survey would impact everyone the like. everyone would have a say... not just a few. what was the figure, 27k+ voted this time? out of 300k accounts? you can hardly call that representation for the whole.not to mention that one or more of the csm thinks they should only represent players who voted for them. another blaring example of failure in how things supposed to work.edit:btw, not every hi-sec dweller is unfamiliar with life in 0.0. i myself have had up to 6 accounts and presently have 2 supercarrier pilots. all of my toons are now in lo-sec or hi-sec. lo-sec because of security issue. so please understand that not all hi-sec dwellers are unfamiliar with null sec life. it's just that some choose not to be a part of blobbing gates and all the other carebear features that 0.0 sov holders enjoy. those some and the rest of who choose to stay in hi-sec should not be penalized for those choices just as those in 0.0 carebear land should not be penalized.i totally agree that null has been neglected...but i feel lo/hi/wh has suffered the same neglect as of late.peace"

8/8/2011,"actually sir... my idea isn't meant to be a diplomatic solution for a game. it's an idea that would give ccp data in which all who pay a subscription a method in which to communicate preference ideas developers would like to implement. csm only represents the few of the louder ones.we are still talking about a game here aren't we, did i miss a junction somewhere?p.s. i love the way you refer to most of us as idiots. way to go there pal."
8/8/2011,"alright, but i think you're misinterpreting the csm's role. their role goes beyond the crowd sourcing they do ; they are there in part to provide feedback and input into mechanic proposals. the logistical cost of doing what you're proposing far outweighs the benefits, and i'm not even sure it's possible via surveys,i wasn't calling anyone in particular an idiot, but there are certainly lots of them here, have you ever read these forums? although they blend in with the trolls these days."

8/9/2011,"imo the acceleration to 75% of max speed untill warp is initiated should be changed. it causes some problems with speed altering modules. time to initiate warp should be something like 15seconds/warp speed. so a cruiser would warp in less than 4sec, frigate 1,5sec. you should be able to calculate the warp as early as you like. then just align with >0m/sec speed towards the location and warp.anyway i like this solution also. both mechanic change instant full warp speed and the effect."

8/9/2011,"well, that would make it like a full blown space station, really. i wouldn't mind seeing that, actually: people being able to construct entire space stations, from building blocks like docking, repair, reprocessing, fitting, medical, recustomization, etc, all of which can themselves be built too). would be awesome. you could then build entire industrial parks, for instance. but not all in a single pos, of course; and at heftier skills (at least anchoring v required and such)."

8/9/2011,"uhm....i kinda support the idea but also think it should be possible to change name and employment history, without the ability to trace the change. course the transaction should be rl cash but never-the-less the option should be there. it's an option in rl, why not in an immersive world such as eve provided you have the $ to do so.just an opinion which we all know the saying about opinions."

8/9/2011,"end of discussion.well you can go ahead and waste 5 years waiting for an online timer to say you can fly a certain ship (this is what skills are)....i wont.people will money should buy skills if you dont wana change characters.people with isk should be able to buy skills or skill sets (skill sets = characters)people with both can do whatever.as i explained above, this is not a pay to win situation as people can already buy characters. everyone has skills, the same skills, its just a matter of time. you are actually buying time. i dont know about you but my time is my life. i work a lot and got a busy life, i want to get on a play sometimes but i cant because i lack the skills to fly the ships i want to fly. i dont have the cash to buy 30 mil worth of character in isk or cash but i can afford to pay maybe 10-15 bucks to fly a t2 drake and shorten my waiting time by 3 months.i do not agree with being able to buy ptw items, which i define as items which based on in game mechanics, give you the ability to beat other players, like better guns, better ammo, better anything...they key word here is better.what i got for you and all those out there who cannot see beyond the ptw cloud, shove the elitism up your @$$. i value my life and its my time i want to buy"

8/9/2011,"proposal: change the overview column ""size"" into ""signature radius"" the size of a ship is a static attribute based on the ship type. realistically, this means the size column is practically a waste of space. while we can turn the column off, i think we would be better served to change the attribute displayed from size to signature radius. these are the two major pros to replacing the size column with signature radius: i.) you have a much better indication of how well your weapons will hit, as signature radius is directly related to the combat with bombs, turrets, and missiles. this also lets you better assess the impact your target painters have. ii.) it gives juicy intel on how a target ship is fitted. since shield extenders and shield rigs increase a ships signature size, you can make an educated guess how a ship is fitted. this is relevant to pve'ers, grief'ers, and pvp'ers alike. the above-and-beyond carebears will surely use this information to improve their weapon efficiency, reduce plex dps, or something more creative than i can think of. suicide gankers would love to have this information, as it indicates how many shield extenders that industrial or mining barge has. finally, pew-pew'ers should positively drool over this, as it will indicate whether that <insert ship type like rapier/cane/etc> is shield tanked vs (probably) armor tanked. this is wonderful information to have prior to engaging, as you can pre-load the optimal ammo, and better assess ships to be primaried. people often ridicule eve as a game that lacks skill. i vehemently disagree, but i'll concede it depends on how you define skill; eve is not a twitch game. in relation to eve, i define skill as the application of knowledge to repeatedly achieve a positive result. by switching the ship size column to represent signature radius, you will increase the knowledge available to players. your pro-players will undoubtedly use this knowledge to excel."
8/9/2011,"you've just put in a whole list of why not to implement such feature...if you really want to replace it with signature radius, than it would have to be ships base signature radius.if you want more info - fit a ship scanner.or would you rather like to be able to see whole ship fit and cargo hold contents on the overview or directional scanner?"
8/9/2011,"that is how i thought it worked a few years ago when i tried it, signature is the logical metric to use for size as we already have the 'size icon' column available.would play havoc on overview if sorting for size in a furball fight with mwd's going on/off all the time"
8/9/2011,"i like this idea, would add a little more unpredictability and depth to the game.."
8/9/2011,"this change will hugely influence gatecamps and pvp strategy in general. one would have to choose his battlefield carefully and take into consideration the current and upcoming 'weather conditions'. (keep an eye on the billboards and tv's in stations for potential 'weather prognosis')in the case of gas clouds that are forming, because of certain conditions in space (level of toxicity?) they could potentially be predicted.in the case of meteor showers, if they hit a certain gate or station area, one could predict in which direction that 'storm' is heading, maybe the gate/station/planet nearby.in the case of comets, this is one is my favorite. somebody here suggested that they could potentially be mined. i like that idea, because that would make room for mining ships and haulers in pvp fleets!and here's the central beauty of the idea: comets can be predicted far far ahead. and if it were to be passing by 0.0 or lowsec, people would fight for it and have convoys and mining ops in the middle of traffic hubs such as gates and stations."
8/9/2011,"supported for adding extra flair. flares, even."
8/9/2011,another potential weather based factor could be gravity of the sun. effect: the closer a gate/planet/station is to the sun the less top velocity your ship will have.how gravity can be used in weather predictions:solar flares and eruptions could be predicted to have gravitational and other sorts of consequences in certain areas of space.
8/9/2011,"live statistics, means you will be able to see the numbers change real time. a top list of people with highest- dmg done.- dmg tanked.- ship kills. (pve and pvp) (also how many parties were involved in the kill will be revealed for all to see)- etc.result in pvp: people on pvp roams will be able to quickly determine the potential for some good fights in the system. not to mention the potential for determining how many pve targets in system.result in pve: because people are more able to compare their own progress with their peers in the same area, as a result people will be more engaged with the game. at the end of the day it all comes down to 'how well did i do compared to others'why: many other games do it because it is a sure formula for a successful and healthy game! the stronger the foundation of the game is, the easier it will be to build and expand on it. want better expansions? want the community to be less frustrated with the game? it all comes down to improving on 'how well did i do compared to others'"
8/9/2011,"i would like a skill of some sorts that allows you to get closer and closer to the gate per skill lvl.15km------- = 53000mokay, so i did the math and you can have 5 levels easilylvl 1 - 12000lvl 2 - 9000lvl 3 - 6000lvl 4 - 3000lvl 5 - warp to gate at 0also i would like to note that this could be a sub skill of ""navigation""i do not know how this would effect the overall gameplayone more thing too add - i would like the first skill book for my own uses"
8/9/2011,"no.want warp to zero and more secure travel? do it manually.besides, this won't have the effect most people wishing for it think it will. you will just get bumped, scanned and then ganked on the outbound gate."
8/9/2011,"so what you are saying is that you want to be able to travel in eve as quickly and efficiantly afk, as someone can who is at their computer activly playing the game.you lazy bastard.waaa, change the game because i can't be bothered to activly play it."
8/9/2011,"if you think traveling too fast is a problem why don't you crawl to school/job next time. in other words, you can walk quite effortlessly like in autopilot but try to walk with hands. so my logical proposal is: if you walk you must crawl the last 10% of the trip but if you walk with hands you can do it as fast as you can.that is eve logic brought to rl"
8/9/2011,"it's more like if you don't want to drive yourself you take a bus, but have to accept, that it may not take the optimal way and it will stop to pick up other people."
8/9/2011,get off your lazy ass and warp to zero like everyone else.not supporting.
8/9/2011,"and that's the kind of stupid **** you end up saying when you attempt to apply game mechanics to real life.you do understand the difference in the two, right?"
8/9/2011,do you mean it wasn't a good proposal? you should try before judging.either you don't get my joke or i don't get yours because you can't seriously type 'apply game mechanics to rl'.there is a point also hidden in there but i doupt you find it.
8/9/2011,this has been an acknowledged problem by ccp. solution:make all stations in low/null sec have a cyno!to avoid trap blobbing give it a small cooldown. if some ship jumps to a station then that cyno cannot be used again for 1 minute.this is intended to make logistics easier without affecting capital warfare. if soemone wants to blob with capitals then they should light up a traditional cyno.feel free to post any improvements on it.
8/9/2011,improvement: delete this post.
8/9/2011,"so if i need to move several ships around at once, i have to separate them by a minute?wtf?projected improvement - delete your post and pretend this conversation never happened."
8/9/2011,"this where things started going horribly wrong.capitals are meant to be a pain to maneuver. that's why they can't use gates like everyone else. that's why they have to use a cyno to get anywhere.it's not a problem ccp acknowledges, it's a hindrance they've purposely added."
8/9/2011,yes please.
8/9/2011,"currently you can trade on behalf of a corp wallet, but you must give full wallet access to the member. it would be nice if there was a wallet access level that allowed for only placing orders in the corps name and not being able to take isk directly from it. although not fool proof, it gives an easy way to delegate trading to corp members with reduced chance of corp theft. to further this, if items could be tagged for ownership to an entity ( person or corp ) then we can further allow for trading and hauling without risk of goods theft, as corp goods cam only be resold for the corp and not used without ownership change. the idea is so that you can run corporations like hauling or trading ones more easily instead of worrying about corp wallet theft which keeps people from using corp wallets to their full potential."
8/9/2011,"well... if milkyway dwellers would become something similar to the current jove role and currently extinct races playable to include jove aswell :) this would make eve even more epic but i can't even put my head arround ballancing ships + tech after something like this :).definetly something to look into , but maybe in a few years from now."
8/9/2011,"actualy there is need to nerf them complitly.reasons:1. they braking makret and leave meny ppl witout job.2. they are easy money printing mashines, with is bad.3. invention wil have still no point to do untill manufucturing costs from t2 bpos wil be lower than from invented bpc.4. invention start losing his meaning att all an ppl treined meny skil points to be able to do invention.5. curently t2 ship market are holdet almost complitly from t2 bpo owners, with to its bad ting.so here are the reasons to nerf them complitly and leave only as colectibles noting els."
8/9/2011,"so you are proposing we introduce a post-invention step to improve bpcs .. the very same thing i have been spamming in all ""nerf t2 bpo"" threads for umpteen years? invention is already more profitable than owning a bpo, but it requires a vast portfolio. being able to improve me would allow profitability without the need for a extensive portfolio, thus opening the door for the small-timer that doesn't have alts to help run jobs."
8/9/2011,"it seems to me, that you have given the matter some serious thought.yes we still produce as much as possible in 0.0 .you should also consider some basics first.1. there are far too less minerals available.either because mining makes not much sense. you always lack the miners because of security issues. the miners won't go to null because its not secure (enough) and it's in fact impossible to maintain a security level which would appease them.anchoring some bubbles and having at least a small fleet on standby is not a problem. the problem is, that this small fleet can probably kill or fight off the enemy, but cannot prevent the miners from getting killed. it takes a special kind of miner(character) to actually read the intels, be on voice-comms and coordinate with a defense fleet.since mining is by default a really boring and half-afk activity more often than not, most will die.2. there are not enough slots, and if you have the slots the minerals are elsewhere.you can only refine in a minmatar station and the slots are mainly in amarr stations. using haulers and freighters is a time-consuming task, which needs to be planned ahead and a substantial fleet, which will probably able to kill everyone but not be able to save your freighter. you probably do not believe that it takes even a small fleet a very short amount of time to kill a freighter.3. all the slots are always full. you have an amarr station every 10 or 15 systems with half as many slots as an average high-sec station. also the holding corp/alliance sets and gets the fees, so producing is mostly expensive.4. pos is not an option because, one has to mistrust everyone and production at a pos needs far to many rights and roles, not to mention that the role administration under the current system is a pain in itself."
8/9/2011,his space and you never ratign and not mining in the space and not erning isk there :) i puting you in my corp balck list i have bneter ppl hoo understands that not onlky ceo rats there and erns is but they to :)

8/9/2011,"the whole idea of nerfing abc's in wh's is that the playing field is too leveld in there and as such the null sec entities can't control the few abc's from wh's as they do in null sec.there is no local in wh's, there is no option to blob with 40+ sc's, no sov warfare etc. so why would such a place have abc's."
8/9/2011,"mittens don't care, but if you continue to talk about, he may do it, just for the fun of trolling you and harvesting some tears."
8/9/2011,"fair enough,i don't program so i have no idea how difficult it would be to implement a survey splash screen upon log-in. i just assumed (my fault) it was as easy as putting up flash ads we see from time to time upon signing into game. then the results could be tallied by computer and spit out the final tally. <shrugs>also i don't expect ccp to go solely on what that survey suggests because ultimately they are a company and need to do what is best to insure profits and security for their investors and employees.it's just my opinion in light of several comments and actions of some of the csm that there must be an alternative to cater to the whole and not alienate those that disagree by calling them names and telling people they don't give a rat's ass about anything but what they want.we all pay to have access to the game in one form or another, therefore, we all should be able to have input. since at least one of the csms has made it abundantly clear he doesn't care about anyone but himself and who voted for him. i find the csm as a moot point as it is apparent by their own admission they no longer (possibly never have) represent(d) the whole."
8/9/2011,"i believe the current csm deserves a lot of credit for that, as it happens..."
8/10/2011,"i you don't mind terribly i really would like an explanation as to why hybrids were taken off the voting list. the obvious answer is, that you knew it would get the attention the issue deserves and have decided not to act on it anyway. why that is remains unknown.this is just my personal reasoning, but i am sure many people wonder and csm really do owe us an explanation, since obviously they are asking us to be patient/give up on the matter. csm white tree were even voted in on the gallente issue, so please voise your thoughts.please talk to us"
8/10/2011,"i oppose most of these ideas, and here is why:you are trying to make the ship a better combat vehicle, and we got craploads of great combat vehicles already.this is a small gang covert semi-dedicated as a jump bridge for coverts...lets think about what a small gang, far into o.o needs. 1. how about a fitting room for ships, and a repair bay? and they can be used by the smaller gang ships (but not the bo ship itself) when repairs and refits are needed.2. how about a covert area shield, a ship uncloaked by itself is effectively cloaked when near to the bo ship, allow ammo changes, refit and repairs.3. how about an anti-cloak pulse that breaks all cloaks in the grid (friendly and enemy and neutral?)4. how about ability to fit one gang warfare module?5. how about it grants extra bonuses to gang mates in grid, maybe extra sensor/eccm/agility or maybe a speed bonus to whole fleet while in the same grid as the bo ship?my point is we dont need an extra turret or more damage as they make the ship more useful for average pilots and soloers, but do little for the intended role.thank you,aramis rosicrux"
8/10/2011,"more jump range, lower build cost - job done."
8/10/2011,"you have several neat suggestions... although i'm not sure on the implementation of many of them: 1.) this is pretty much like a mini carrier... that uses/fields covert cynos/bridges. probably not appropriate for the bo bs. 2.) this is a very interesting idea, but would be such a pita to program, its just not feasible! what happens when you cloak another ship? can it warp? can it target? can it launch drones? can it activate mods? does it suffer a decloaking targeting penalty? what happens if it has drones out, and you cloak it? will they fail to cloak if their w/in 2 km's of an object? i can think of many ways to exploit this by cloaking my enemy! 3.) this would be op on gatecamps.... the bo sits 300 km's on grid, decloaks and pulses anytime a cloaky ship tries to enter system. there's no defense, and the bo is a little too safe. perhaps if it was a much more limited in range, like 20 km's, and the burst counts as aggression. 4.) this could be nice... 5.) currently fleet bonus' work by system.... i don't think they can program in grid-only bonus', as if they could, they would probably have changed gang links to work only when on grid by now! finally, of course they are trying to make the bo about combat... what is the primary use of a covert cyno bridge? to hotdrop... logistics with bo is just too expensive and limited in terms of range and fuel.... this is not how the ship is designed!"
8/10/2011,"as a suicide ganker among other things,i feel concord response is waay too fast and needs to be slowed down . that or the ganker to have the ability to escape from concord, however that will probably never happen, nor will i ever be able to bribe concord to raise my security status. (which would be nice, but again would probably never happen).the reason i and others go on suicide ganks is mainly because the wardec system is broken. if i wardec another company as an aggressor, the players simply leave their corps or stay docked and evade hostility when they realize the war is lost on their terms. thus, leaving surprise attacks in the form of suicide ganking the only real option to bring about destruction and demoralization to an enemy that would otherwise hangout in an npc corp or bounce between an alt corp and another to avoid hostiles.given this logic its also very common to see other corps paying gank corps/pilots to also target enemiesfor surprise attack. still yet, i and others sometimes suicide gank just for the lulz and half the time i don't even insure my ship. if i need to cover the cost of a destroyed ship i simply make up for its loss by other means most of the time. if insurance was nerfed today, that still would not stop me from committing surprise attacks . frankly, regardless of how much time you put into carebearing, the reality is you can be attacked at any place any time . i can agree that insurance payments to criminals and fraudsters seems wrong, but don't you also think its pretty stupid that concord doesn't just capture my pod and arrest me in high sec? or ground me completely from certain systems ? i've never heard of a navy that lets pirates escape justice after blowing up their ships . . i propose a new skill type that allows for limited concord evasion and yet another to bribe concord to fix security status . these skills would take time to train and would allow greater rewards to dedicated outlaws while filtering out temporary alts and beginner outlaws from being nearly as successful. likewise fixing the bounty system and allowing the transfer of kill rights to licensed bounty hunters would also make for entertaining play.lastly, fix war decs. disallow players leaving a corp for the duration of a war, or if players do leavea corp during a time of war, grant the corp they leave kill rights on them for a week for leaving. also give the ability for aggressors to kill former members of said war dec'd company for up to a week under the same premise. this would also mean a boost in private security corps in eve as well."

8/10/2011,why can't we leave a ship and lock it with a password in space?isn't this a sandbox game?

8/10/2011,"then a person could store a whole fleet of special purpose ships in space, like in a wh, no station needed.-1"
8/10/2011,"these are 2 simple solutions to resolve the abusing of cloaking devices by afk players:1) all cloaking devices need a fuel charge. the fuel is a charge [like crystal t2] that can not be replaced in space and can works max xh (4h? 5h? 6h?).2) all cloaking devices are always under ""pseudo-overloading effect"". the cloaking device module damage itself and can be operative xh (4h? 5h? 6h?). the module must be repaired in a station.with these solutions, a afk cloaker is not able to live indefinitely in enemy territory but can enjoy all the benefits of its role (5h of cloaked operations is enough for a massive alliance attack too). but above all, no macro can avoid the solution and a pg can not log its pg and go shopping all day with no consequences.if you want to be a afk cloaker, you must return every x hours (of total module activity) in an area where you can use fitting tool (solution 1) or repair facilitiy (solution 2) and go back.ps: sorry for my english."
8/10/2011,i think the way 1 it's interesting.nice.
8/10/2011,"oh look... it's this thread again.no. cloaking is fine the way it is. afk cloakers cannot harm you as they are away from komputer. at the same time, you live in null-sec and thus should be prepared for any situation that is tossed at you... including a surprise attack."
8/10/2011,"1. afk = away from keyboard2. a afk cloacker is not a playing player.. it's only a form of terrorism (eve should encourage competition, scam, deception .. but not terrorism). if you wanna be a cloacker you have to play.. if you are afk you should log off and let people play! your answer is just an excuse of safety. 0.0 should not be safe for anyone .. especially for afk players.i repeat: a afk player can't be safer than an active player.with a charge on cloaking device you have the possibility to do the same things.. but not indefinitely all day 24/24h with a alt character."
8/10/2011,"fully suport this and i tink this my work.there is more good tings to then just push afk playstyle out off game. i tink modules shuld be repaireble, if the m,odule played his role hee ned to be destrauded to suport manufuctures and miners.some more:1. demand for clocing devices all kinds wil grow.2. if grows demand for devices that its again mineral sink wath its very needet in eve.and usual scouting its not distrubet to. 5-6 hours usualy inaf for fleet fights and scout enemy or move stuf."
8/10/2011,what is the problem with afk cloaking that you seek to fix?
8/10/2011,"funny how in every afk cloak-whine thread, it's not surprising that they're too scared to explain this: explain how someone afk is ""terrorizing"" u and not letting u play in the first place because it sounds to me u're the ones making excuses for concord-level safety. but don't worry, there is concord-level safety...back in high sec so if 0.0 shouldn't be safe for anyone, it especially shouldn't be safe for nullbears like u who can't handle one harmless neutral while he's hiding behind his entire alliance.p.s. u mentioned macros--is yours not working because of them?"
8/10/2011,"if so many people complain there must be a problem.there is not a problem if a player goes afk currently using cloaking devices.the problem is the instrumental use of afk cloaker to create a climate of terror on enemy territory (every day 24h per day) damaging the local economy with a technique that provides immunity to afk pgs.if you wanna be a afk cloaker, it's ok for me.. but it must be for a limited afk time.. or have to implicate active partecipation of the player. a player has to be active to damage other players.so.. or a player has to interact with the cloacked ship constantly in order to interpret the role of ""menace in local""or the player can do it afk for a limited time (6h is good for me). if you wanna continue, you have to go back home and return: it's honest, fair, and it would be much more strategic than this exploit@anna lifera: never used macros or played afk. i'm sorry, i play eve. your is an excuse to be safe in 0.0 enemy territory sure to be not attacked. who is the carebear?ps: cloacked players are payed to stay afk 24h/day in enemy 0.0 territory. a nerf on cloacked devices imply a loss of an easy way to make isk. think about this."
8/10/2011,"and i repeat:funny how in every afk cloak-whine thread, it's not surprising that they're too scared to explain this: explain how someone afk is ""terrorizing"" u and not letting u play in the first place because it sounds to me u're the ones making excuses for concord-level safety. but don't worry, there is concord-level safety...back in high sec so if 0.0 shouldn't be safe for anyone, it especially shouldn't be safe for nullbears like u who can't handle one harmless neutral while he's hiding behind his entire alliance.u still haven't answered that and fyi, hitting the ""magic"" number of thread 9001 about it isn't gonna get ccp to coddle u."
8/10/2011,"just an answer: 0.0 should be safe for nobody, right? so, if you wanna stay afk and safe.. go back to empire!the rules should apply to everyone.if you don't know how afk cloacked pg role works, asking me how ""terrorize"", i'm wasting time"
8/10/2011,"yes u r wasting your own time because u still haven't explained how one harmless person is ""terrorizing"" u. there r many harmless ppl in high sec and they don't seem scared by each other. maybe u'd like to stay afk and safe so why don't u go back to empire?"
8/10/2011,can i have your stuff?

8/10/2011,"local is being nerfed at some point soon. i'm hoping it will stop all the whining.your main problem is, you are reliant upon local intel way too much. afk cloaking makes you misjudge the 100%, risk free, instant intel it gives you.now if you learn from your mistakes and take certain precautions, you will remove much of the risk.but instead, you've decided to jump on the forums and whine for an easy change. to make your life a lot easier and your isk making near risk free. so i don't think you want to learn anything.i bet you also rent your space. amirite?"
8/10/2011,"mag's, i think you're wrong on this one. ccp has shown time and again they see eve as ""a social game"", and will go to great lengths to increase player interaction. removing local would be counter to that vision, imo. i doubt local will change anytime soon."
8/10/2011,"i did post a reply to you in the last thread bud, i'll paste it here.they have wanted to nerf local for sometime, who knows what will come of this."
8/10/2011,"fact:nobody can relax and operate in 0.0 space unless everyone in system is blue. if you mine ore, hunt rats, or even do exploration with an enemy in system, you are taking a very great risk. in practice, no one takes this risk unless they are very stupid.proposal:1. placing a cloaked ship in a system effectively threatens all activity in that system.2. there is no risk to the pilot who does this by staying cloaked all day.3. no risk for the person disrupting the home systems of hundred of blues, in most cases.either, add some risk to the afk lurker, or limit the amount of time they can be afk, or provide a game mechanic whereby the residents of a system can seek and destroy the afk lurker.i think that ""space storms"" and ""random meteorites"" should be a random event and they can decloak a ship with no warning, leaving the ship decloaked until the pilot comes back and recloaks.this would restore sanity to the game and balance the safety/risk element of holding 0.0 space in the first place.thank you,aramis rosicrux"
8/10/2011,"how does he threaten when cloaked?if he stays cloaked all day, then how does he give risk to any other pilot?1 cloaked ship stopping a hundred blues.? sir, the cloak is the least of your worries.then stop misreading the instant intel, local is giving you.you want more intel power, on top of the already powerful, 100% risk free, instant intel tool called local. that is not a balanced approach."
8/10/2011,"meh, my fault, i lost that other thread and missed your reply. i knew i had said it before, though. sorry to make you drag it up again."
8/10/2011,"and that is bad how?again, that is bad how?why should 0.0 ever be safe?"
8/10/2011,"exactly, the afk lurker has no risk. why should the afk lurker get to threaten the entire system all day long at no risk?random decloaks would restore some balance to the currently riskless lurking threat strategy.thank you,aramis rosicrux"
8/10/2011,cloaking provides balance to risk-free profit in 0.0. so it's balanced already.inappropriate language removed. zymurgist
8/10/2011,"it is guerillia warfare, not terrorism.terrorism is encouraged as well, it is usually called 'awoxing' in eve and is absolutely hilarious. what alliance are you in btw, i'd like to join."
8/10/2011,more psychological warfare (and it's apparently working as intended on the op) but your point is valid :)
8/10/2011,at the same time there is no reward so there is nothing wrong with the low risk.
8/10/2011,"aramis rosicrux hits the point!why an afk player can be safe in 0.0?cloacking devices nerfing solve this imbalance.if you are against nerfing, it means that your role is to be an afk cloaker in enemies territories and get paid to do it.or you are the picker of this activity.scared to lost your job?"
8/10/2011,"its not an imbalance, its not and exploit, and its pretty easy to avoid."
8/10/2011,"there is still plenty of ambiguity in a ship's fitting even if you know ship's current signature radius. in my experience, ships scanners are used to look for smartbombs, cyno's, and bling. i don't think this will infringe upon their use in a significant manner. it is extra intel for free, but i think providing this intel will improve game play."
8/10/2011,good idea :o
8/10/2011,no there isn't you just fail.
8/10/2011,"i have a solution to your problem: other players.how about you pay someone a million or so to light you a cyno? and, how about you pay someone else to watch that person light the cyno (scouting was far and away my favorite activity, and i was damn good at it.)? and, how about you pay two other people to escort you. if you paid them all enough, they might want to make you a regular client, and they might start looking for other clients.i know what you're going to say. ""but, how do i know i can trust them? what if they kill me? what if they want too much compensation?""welcome to eve online."
8/10/2011,"f***ing trolls, go die in a fire.this is intended for single players who always have to wait and can't move around because there is no one willing to go down 30 jumps just to light them a cyno, and repeat that many times if there is more than 1 cyno.if you want to move more than 1 ship then jump to another station, or a system nearby. if you want to gank someone who jumped and that's why you don't like the 1 min, well that's the freaking point! go light a real cyno."
8/10/2011,"stopped reading at this point. you obviously don't understand what ""mmo"" means"
8/10/2011,"would be great for moving my thanny, but ccp will never do it, because so many people have 2 accounts so they can move on their own. xtra $$$ for ccp"
8/10/2011,people who actually have a brain make an cyno alt to take care of that job and then go light their own cyno.... that's assuming you have one too.
8/10/2011,"i bet most of you trolls don't even have a carrier.try having one and then having to move it across the universe.of course i have a cyno alt, but having to run it through 50 jumps of low-sec in a t1 frig to click a t1 mod once, that's a freaking waste of time. there is nothing cooperative or multiplayer or meaningful play.and no, nobody pays a 2nd account just for a cyno.ccp have acknowledged that it is a problem but didn't a find a solution yet, well here is one that doesn't impact pvp in any bit, yet solves a major part of the problem."
8/10/2011,i do. i even have a dred. and even i think your idea is dumb.i have. and? isn't that the point? ships that are huge force multipliers in battle and extremely useful logistics ships being difficult and tedious to use so that widespread proliferation and use is actually discouraged... soooooo... get some friends then? cause that's what i use.evidence please. i find it hard to believe that ccp wants to make capitals easier to use considering that it made them a ***** to move around in the first place and that there is widespread qq about their proliferation.
8/10/2011,"i have never come across a game with so many idiots in the forum. how many times do we have to hear people with arguments like ""life is hard, so eve should be hard, get used to it or play wow. games are not supposed to be fun, lets make it all about the chore."" the best in life is stupid monotone chores. yay!"""

8/10/2011,posting to support the banning of the op since he clearly has no clue what is the correct subforum to post in.
8/10/2011,oh you are a poor naive fool with a lot to learn about the real world.
8/10/2011,"you're asking the csm to defy human nature. i'm going to have to agree with magnus, you sound very naive.i'd like to point out that history has all but proven (with a few exceptions) that the vast majority of public representatives are at least somewhat self-serving. politics are usually a zero-sum game, where somebody wins and somebody loses. elected officials are almost never on the losing side of a decision.the past csms have been no different, they just haven't been as forthright as mittens. i would argue its not that big of an issue really, because eve can still stand to gain from the expertise of the various factions that have held the csm, even if they can be self-serving.its not like ccp is going to give the goons an ""i win"" button because the mittani is chairman. relax."
8/10/2011,representative democracy is fun.
8/10/2011,"son, i expect i can give you a good thirty years if not more. i'm not being naive, it's just that when people are elected with a clear set of rules showing them what's expected of them, and i don't know what that .pdf is if not a set of rules from ccp to the csm as to how to conduct themselves, i expect them to at least try and make an effort to abide by them.still as upton sinclair put it ""it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it."" so that may explain why so many people cannot seem to see that the csm is not living up to the standards laid down by ccp, as it seems to be to the advantage of certain sections of the game, at the moment."
8/10/2011,"do what? you act like mitts has got some kind of power. he was onboard with taking abc's out of lower class wh's and then, when it became a noticeable topic, said he didn't care.if abc ores are removed from the lower class whs, mitts will say he did it. not that it was important to me but i did it because its not k-space null sec. if the status quo is maintained, hell say he didnt really care. it was a trivial matter and i have better things to do.smoke and mirrors, no substance.if things happen that you dont like, dont blame the csm. blame ccp. ccp is the only one with the power and they know the csm is largely k-space null sec oriented. ccp knows the csm does not represent the majority of eve and if ccp doesnt act on that knowledge..who you going to blame? the csm? the csm, particularly mitts, is very up front about who they represent.-windjammer"
8/10/2011,"less blobs? blame ccp about poor sov and capital mechanics underskilled as in no skillpoints to make any differance anyway and being poor as in having no brains or too lazy to figur out to make isk by trading or other stuffs? as in above, and eve is a game about choise... if u lose here u suppose to lose. i can suggest wow to u t2 fitted hurricane cost 60 mil, 24 mil for hull, insure it and u lose 40 mil if u lose the cane in fight. so u can only affort to lose 40 million isk a month? carebears are greedy give them more isk and they spend it on shiny pimped mission ships... only spen more tiem bearingas 2 bad troll sincentces earliertest server ftw no comment"
8/10/2011,"highsec is fine the way it is. leave it alone. carebears are 99% safe there and that's fine. the only possible changes i'd like to see would be either a change to the wardec mechanic to prevent long-term griefing of noob corps, or a change to locator agents so it's possible for people under wardec to go to ground and not be stalked from system to system for days on end (i've heard there are supposedly ways to avoid this, but i've yet to see anyone actually suggest something).what really needs fixing is lowsec. there's very little draw for people to risk going into low except piracy, and any noobs looking to just ""check it out"" are going to get ****d by the indiscriminate ""lol i got another shuttle killmail"" buffoons that pollute the place. i regularly spend time in lowsec and w-space, but i have a hard time tempting my more carebearish corpmates into low because they see so little reward in it.make lowsec more profitable, maybe make it safer somehow (not highsec, but less like nullsec + gateguns), and i think you'll see a lot more semi-carebears take their first steps into pvp as they chase the almighty isk out to lowsec."
8/10/2011,"this, tbqh..."
8/11/2011,i support this.+1
8/11/2011,"give us bitter vets back our icons. i love my old megapulse lasers, these new ones look like extendable toilets with the lid up."
8/11/2011,i support this.
8/11/2011,"thing its such wie was in smaller allince than wie are curently and if allaince have only 3-6 sytems to rat, so imagene wath hapens if there i nal sytems are clouckers wie expirenced that, was no place to rat att all. and that was for 2-3 month so each day there was afk clouckers but if soem one trued to rat his ship after couple hours was blowen up. means they chaking the game but verry rer. so way such play style need to be suported, if you are cloucked look on your screen with your char and dont move from you pc until you not log off or leave system. eve nice miner brings more activity in game and eforce then clouckers, and if soem one wil say they not geting rewarded that thet its wrong they have rewards from loot atleast and intel try bots."
8/11/2011,"wrong. afk cloaking is a somewhat viable solution to local. but local is being nerfed soon, so i'll enjoy your whines when it is."
8/11/2011,"1: onlining timers, it isnt fun or interesting to online silos after filling/emptying, it adds nothing to the game except boredom and it isnt as if anyone can shoot me or anything so its pointless.2: fuel, how irritating to need 34982y349837 fuel types... should be able to manufacture 'pos fuel cells' from the current pos fuels.3: they look crap. they need to be more visually inspiring so that people actually like them.4: did i mention how boring pos's are to work with?"

8/11/2011,pretty sure the reason this isn't possible is the same reason they won't let you perma anchor cans etc. it would probably take about a week before d-scan became worthless. people parking all over the darn place writing their names in space using their ships etc. i'd support it if any ships not docked or inside a pos bubble all floated away at down time and became either1. gone forever2. lost and claimable by anyone who probed them out.
8/11/2011,why shouldn't i be able to take possession of a ship someone left unattended floating in space? isn't this a sandbox game?
8/11/2011,supported but :damage inflicted takes into account signature radius of ship being affected.damage is not huge.(and i'd like to see new design of the wrecked ships. the same old wreck for all ship isn't very attractive for a salvager.)
8/11/2011,"to make the damage scale properly to be not too much or too little, do it based on 10% of the total hp of the ship. that of course being damage done at the epicenter (closest) then farther away go down. maybe even further that the damage is based off the base hull hp without any skill or modules modifiers, because adding armor plates or shields wouldn't make sense for giving a ship more boom. that way a titan could create a cataclysm for just about any insignificant ships around it (if they did not warp off in time, much like when the starwars deathstar was going down). though at the same time the explosion wouldn't kill other capitals (unless severely damaged already).so even if a battleship dies in blob it will not start off a chain reaction if all the ships perfectly healthy (that might be fun to see but... yea), though the damage is still significant to make people think about changing fleet formations to a blob.this idea could be great, it would add a really dynamic feature to eve that would really make people think about how they position ships (people who are up and close fighters might be weary about finishing off a ship if they are too close, or maybe stick close in spite of danger and hope their ship dieing can help bring down the enemy)."
8/11/2011,"the better question is why r u asking to be safe in 0.0 against someone afk when u already r and carebearing it up in 0.0? and u still haven't explained how someone who isn't doing anything shuts down entire systems. if he doesn't do anything, he gets no reward while u do so if anyone should get risk, it's u."
8/11/2011,"i an guilty of afk cloaking. i do it when i'm ratting for sec status.i do it when i'm at war with a superior force (usually in low sec so they get blown up looking for me).i do it when i want to kill people and need them to lower their gaurd.i do it when people are hanging out where i want to hang outinfact i do it as much as i can.i can understand your whining but if there is a ""afk cloaker in your system just jump to the one next door and carry on if he doesn't follow you, you win if he does then jump sombody back through and drop the biggest freaking bubble on the best interceptor pilot you have. of course if he follows you he isn't really afk is he? like wise you can leave a cloaky combat probe alt behind which will make him think there is a target about and keep him cloaked while your off having fun.also i don't get why you have the damage mod idea or the needs fuel idea? how many dockable stations do you think there are in null? all you would need to combat afk cloaking is a cycle timerit would last for 15 minuts and start flashing and making noise 20 sec before you decloak if you hit it before the time was up you would stay cloaked for another 15 minutes. afk clockers would then appear while i would have to pause my netflix and reset the damn timer."
8/11/2011,this is the next point. why you can benefit to stay afk for a week ready to attack someone when the guard is lower and be safe all the time? why a afk pilot can live in enemy territory without the possibility of being expelled? if i have the sovereignty of a system should have the right to hunt (or try to) the enemy. remember that a afk pilot is an alt. your main pg are playing in other place.. my main pg are waiting your alt. players versus alts. zero for a pirate. infact a pirate should go to null sec.. kill those who want to.. and then go back home and not live forever in enemy territory.
8/11/2011,"here's where you go wrong. you have the ""right"" to nothing. especially not in null-sec. even the cloaker doesn't have the ""right"" to kill someone. the onus is on both parties to be more prepared and clever than the other one using what resources they have available.for the cloakers... their strength is that they cannot be probed down. if they get into a system they can bide their time and wait til someone does something stupid (like fly a lightly tanked pve gank-battleship with t1 drones). their weaknesses are that their ship will not stand up very well in a straight fight against a ship fitted with the proper defenses and that their target might have friendly ships nearby to assist.for the ""defenders""... their strengths are that they can effectively deny entry into the system in the first place using bubbles and gatecamps, they have a wealth of friendly ships in system that can assist when needed, they have a station and/or pos to refit or swap their ship anytime they wish, and they can actually do something productive with their time rather than just wait.what weaknesses i can potentially see on the part of the defenders are (but not limited to); not having anyone online to assist (in which case, that person should consider beefing up their ship's point defenses)... and... ummm... uhh... running a bit of blank here. from where i stand, the defenders have most of the advantages except that they have one red ""blip"" in the local chat.edit: fail quoting"
8/11/2011,"i completely agree, also please remove pos shields and stations in nulsec! why should you be safe in them?"
8/11/2011,they should just get rid of local. that way you will have no way of knowing the cloaker is even there and it won't freak you out.
8/11/2011,"that the case there is reward reward:rewards:1. intel with ships with pilots fly its allready bots hoo colect such info true afk cloucked alts.2. risk free kils, he can declouck eny given time and lounch a cov ops cyno (after a week bean afk) and he donr haveeven slite risk to get popt thos seconds itsn ot inaf with you have when you see him declock by you.3. loot from kils.so its inaf rewards to atleast nerf that risk free cloucking."

8/11/2011,"in null-sec with sovereignty, the owners should have a exlusive intelligence system against intruders. intruders should not have access to it. this would make sense. i know that saying this, many pirates weep.null-sec is not anarchy. null-sec is no-concord, security driven by players.. and sovereignty should provide the tools to keep itself."
8/11/2011,"you8 wrong complitly wie have right for thos resurses wie fighted a war until you sited afk some where wie trowed biljons in that sytem to get it in right state for us, wie pay for that sytems to concord, if you wish more reasons than tellme i can name more.you are the one ho dont heve right be there at all, wie pay for sytem and you come in and distrubt our ppl and kiling his ships by using afl clouckers with siting in system weeks geting rewards from it by loot, and intel. i tink you shuld pay to be there to if you are in sytem and using it and geting rewarded at the end or pay for jumping true our system."
8/11/2011,"how about cloaking devices have a 'heat' type problem, reduced by skill levels in cloaking. so a prototype cloak will overheat in about 20 minutes and will switch off until cooled (only a minute or two), a t2 claok will ovgerheat in an hour and a cov ops will stay cool for a good few hours, that way the cloaked person can still stay safe when they are playing (even an overheated cloak isnt a problem as you can just warp safe to safe for a few minutes while it cools off, tehn recloak) but it does demand that players actually play the game to cause disruption.i am not against disruption by players, just against any disruption that can be caused while you arnt even actualy playing, or maybe not even home..."
8/11/2011,"i agree. this was my solution n<U+FFFD>2. heat problem or charge are 2 simple solution that don't damage cloacked ships if played activly (and a macro can't avoid). those who are against this, has its own dirty interests to be afk in enemy territory."
8/11/2011,"and u think u're entitled be safe in 0.0? so in other words, even attackers aren't allowed to come into your system? and how does an afk cloaker kill someone? sounds like it's u who wants risk-free 0.0 because u don't want anyone at all to attack u or your system.and they still haven't explained how one person who isn't even doing anything ""terrorizes"" everyone in the system. all i hear is nothing but qq about risk while they think they're entitled to easy isk without having to maintain it; they just don't want to admit it."
8/11/2011,holy christ! use spell check.
8/11/2011,"aramis hit no points at all. it was just more senseless and emotional ranting, without any logical basis.cloaking is already balanced, what you are asking for is imbalance. you want more intel power and the ability to blob.local is your problem, not cloaks."
8/11/2011,"cowardice, ignorance and incompetence is the problem, not cloaks."
8/11/2011,afk cloacker are payed to do it and wanna continue to be payed. a nerf ruins this easy way to do money. this is the problem.

8/11/2011,"oh.. go tell it to the klingons you big baby. maby you should get off eve and see if you can't find mamby pamby land in space... tissue?seriously just double bubble all your exits and keep them camped or move to another system. or, pick up like the sally you are and go back to 1.0 space. if you can't handle one low threat in local you don't deserve to have sov.<---period"
8/11/2011,"i am a witness of a pirate corp paid to stay in branch, during the war of northern coalition.the purpose was to be afk 24h/day (sometimes attack capital ship opening a cyno for a titan or normal ships with marauders) to prevent the activities of mining and block the production of ships and weapons. the pirates themselves inform us of their purpose and the fact that they were paid.afk cloacker is a subdole job commissioned by enemy alliance to reduce, obstruct and block the production chain."
8/11/2011,"so they did attack while afk? seriously though, what you describe sounds like the sandbox is working perfectly there.one question though, since pirates are usually very reasonable people as soon as you wave isk in front of their faces, why didnt you just pay them to stay afk all the time?"
8/11/2011,"this thread shows me how amazingly lazy most 0.0 carebears are. let me get this straight...you are in a system full of blues, and one or two reds who are cloaked, and there so much fear in your heart to use the word terrorism. lmfao! how about using the your blues as tools and maybe watch some gates, run some scans. if they arent around they are most likely a bomber... one freaken bomber. lmfao thats some serious fear tactics... laughable. are all your blues in mining barges? if so, please give out your system so the real players can have some entertainment at your expense. i thought strength came in numbers, and thats how you survive in 0.0, or eve all together? i guess not when all the blues are just typical lazy carebears wanting more iskies, and not having to risk anything to attain it. learn tactics, learn strategy, utilize the tool of your alliance, and most of all stop whinning like a baby that got his sucker taken away."
8/11/2011,"i like #2 because for active players there is no bad surprise when the crystal pops, you can have a general idea how long you have because it resets at each repair.#1 would screw people who didn't deserve it by having them become visible in situations where even a few seconds is death. it is really hard to judge the life of crystals that don't repair because the use is added up over many uses. it could blow out after 5 mins because you used it ""x hours and 55 minutes"" the week before."
8/11/2011,i support.
8/11/2011,"supported. even if ccp decides to ever add this feature, it'll be extremely half-assed. just like incarna, etc."
8/11/2011,"it shouldn't be as ridiculous as the op described, though."
8/11/2011,suported
8/11/2011,supporting a friend and a good idea.
8/11/2011,it's a very good idea to dynamise weather in space. i travel a lot and i find space nice but to much stable. and travelling into space doesn't be so boring !
8/11/2011,"won't work.reason: i believe the technology that drives our ships, stations, gates and everything else may be the reason. i'm not sure if the back story covered this, but if my theory is correct, each ship and station is surrounded by a field that prevents an object's gravity from affecting the ship/station/gate inside the field.now, if someone can please point me to the chronicle that may or may not prove me wrong, that would be most appreciated.tl;dr - real world physics don't apply on eve."
8/11/2011,"no. this is eve, not cs:s./thread"
8/11/2011,"well since you already bumped the thread.i think you're right, eve is more chill than other games, its not really meant to be super competitive, but a boost in statistics is hardly going to ruin the game, so its totally worth a careful study and consideration.you meantioned cs like its the only game with live statistics. for example look at starcraft2 which is huge now, and what makes it into such a juicy competitive game is the statistics, people can compare, in detail, who is doing better and by how much.there is probably over 50 thousand people that actually watch others play the game live, regularly. not tomention countless more that just likes watching replays, daily. it's quite the phenomenon. so yeah, i think there is something to it that is worth exploring./thread"
8/11/2011,"the current ship effects in eve are woefully inconsistent, and in many cases eye-searingly grating.take deployable warp bubbles: you're either in them for less then 30 seconds, or looking at them for hours. in both cases though, the effect is incredibly over-the-top and irritating to look at.a ship-borne effect would be the current state of sensor boosters: these were ""ok"" before, but now are ridiculous.conversely, effects which might be important to see have been toned down to almost non-existence: shield-boosting and armor repairing, both formerly quite visible (but generally of decent tone) are now almost invisible compared to effects like armor hardening, or the aforementioned sensor boosting. stasis webifiers are another example: the pixel shader distortion may be neat, but it's damn near impossible to see.ccp's art department needs to rationalize the priority of various graphical effects, and change them to be inline with their importance and the time they are likely to be on-screen and visible to the player (i.e. warp bubbles need to be less epilepsy inducing, as should sensor boosters). preferably, they should all be designed so they do not conflict: i.e. so by inspection, the modules which should be visible as being used on a ship, are visible.a quick list to promote discussion:warp bubbles: no lightning effect, no spinning/wobbling environmental mappingshield effects: return to bubbles around the ship so they're actually visiblearmor hardeners: are basically fine the way they are, though very bright compared to other effects.armor repairers: same problem as shields - the effect went from gentle but visible to neat but pretty much invisible at any sort of distance.all hardeners: some type of effect based on color for type of hardening would be logical (that did not collide - i.e. armor hardeners would light different parts of ship hulls in different ways, shield hardeners would have agreeable colors next to each other on the bubble)sensor boosters: the flickering light-ray effect is very large, and very bright, making it hard to look at up close, but is actually hard to see on other ships since it dies to nothing as part of its animation. the old effect was better, and a more subtle shimmer would be better still.targeting computers: commit a similar sin to the sensor booster, but are so dim as to be basically invisible. imo these would be best replaced with some effect on the hull of a ship - a pattern of lights or the like, which would indicate the system is active.jump animations: the old effect was probably over the top, but it was visible. the new animation is waay too suble for jump capable ships - if something is jumping in, it should announce that presence to the entire grid that that is happening. at the very least, i'd make it so the jump effect was the bsg white light flash.propulsion mods: ab's and mwds have long had no effect's whatsoever. it would be nice if there was a thruster color change or something associated with these."
8/11/2011,"love it all.i'd like to add that the new turret firing effects are ****ty as well. same old 2001 tech with higher rez. stretching the firing animation based on distance to the target is so fail it's not even funny... lets add that grouped weapons do not first at multiple points on the ship but instead all fire at the same spot (fail). wrecking hits do not have a special animation (again fail). missed shots are graphically represented by a hit (once again fail). all of these things need to be fixed and honestly should have been with the ""new"" firing effects.considering that vampires online (ghey) and dust (inc fail game) are all hogging the graphics departments resources i doubt we will see any substantial improvements to the game until they are finished."
8/11/2011,"effects are quite important as informative tools. they should be visible but not annoyance.ab and mwd are amongst the most important modules you need to see. overheating should be visible also, specially if you heat ab/mwd."
8/11/2011,"supercapital proliferation has been an ongoing issue in eve for some time. while the actual number of ships that should be in active use is up for debate, we should at least see some balance between the number being produced and the number being destroyed.building supercapitals is hell. one has to acquire the materials, compress the minerals, transport it to a safe production area, and protect the csaa -- it's appropriate. the real issue is how infrequently they get blown up.while a supercapital carries numerous high meta-type modules, only about 50% of these drop and they aren't even the dominant cost of the ship. and now that they're so much more common, killing one today is no longer the status symbol it was in years past.unfortunately, we have to be careful about how we proceed.raw isk isn't a good incentive. not only does it cause issues with inflation, many alliances have so much moon goo revenue that it wouldn't be worth the effort in any case.high meta-level items are also a poor choice. supercapitals need to be an asset sink for these modules, and making them more prevalent is just going to deflate their value.3.) salvage carries the same problem that raw isk does, except that it also specifically screws up an important market.instead, i'd like to introduce limited-use ammmunition, charges, and scripts that provide tactical significance to alliance leadership and fleet commanders.i'll propose a few ideas in the subsequent post to illustrate precisely what i mean. if you're interested in supporting the petition, please feel free to submit your own suggestions."
8/11/2011,"for every supercapital that's destroyed, the corporation or alliance responsible for the majority of the damage would receive the reward at their corporation hq after the following downtime. in no particular order, here are some ideas:optional components that reduce supercapital production times. perhaps a 50% reduction in time they spend in the oven.single-use jump drive optimization routines. let a capital ship jump 30% farther than normal.alternatively, let them consume less capacitor when activating their jump drive, even if it still requires a 70% charge.aoe doomsday scripts. while i know we just got rid of these, they would be at least somewhat reasonable if you knew that on average a titan would only get an aoe once in its lifetime.as mentioned previously, suggestions and amendments are welcome."
8/11/2011,"why not just scale logoff timers with ship base sig radius instead?take battleships as the baseline for the 15 minute logoff under aggro, scale down for sub-battleship and scale up for capitals and supercapitals according to relative signature.would leave supercarriers at about 7 hours timer logging off under aggro, enough to destroy a whole fleet of them that pull a tactical logoffski."
8/11/2011,"it's not just the logoff timer -- it's also electronic warfare immunity. in addition, supercarriers are even more slippery. 15 ecm drones certainly affects the number of interdictors necessary to get the job done.in any case, it's a significant task to organize that many pilots. it should let you do something cool in exchange."
8/11/2011,"hunting down lone supers isnt the issue, that is done easy enough. and killing one is cool enough to go through the effort at least in my book, juicy loot being the icing on the cake.the real issue of not enough supers dying is that in large-scale engagements, simply logging them off is enough to get away with most of your fleet intact if you did bite off more than you could chew."
8/11/2011,"i thought you hated trolls. aren't you one now?manually doing warp is a chore. the logic behind getting something done properly and harder by adding chore is bad design. it is commonly used by ******s to justify bad design they are accustomed to, ""eve is meant to be boring, chore, hard ...""."
8/11/2011,"i think the point of applying game mechanics to real life in that instance is exactly to show how stupid the game mechanics are, so, if what he said sounded stupid (and it did, it sounded ****ing ******ed), then i think that means his rhetoric was successful."
8/11/2011,"manually mining, updating market orders and running missions is a chore. i doubt you would support automation of those tasks.warp to zero on autopilot provides a powerful fast travel option to people that don't even sit at their keyboards. setting autopilot to 15 as it is presently is not artificially adding a 'chore' of manually piloting. the benefit gained from being present and warping to zero is significant and rewards those that make the small amount of effort required to do so."
8/11/2011,"if you say mining, trading and mission running are chores you might aswell say playing is a chore. just being present and clicking a button every minute sounds lots of fun yea. how about we introduce a feature that if you are present and click manufacture job every minute you'd manufacture 50% faster :) but you are correct in that most eve gameplay is just mindless clicking. guess that comes with the server being capable of maintaining so many players."
8/11/2011,"obviously this is highly subjective but for me, the real gameplay is in exploration, high end plexes and pvp. obviously this differs for everyone and where i find missions a chore and a grind with the only purpose being to gain isk; other people love it.the diversity of activities available (especially if you have a creative imagination) are what makes this game so awesome.but i really don't believe facilitating easy travel for no effort has a place here."
8/11/2011,"i have a jump freighter...with all due respect... wtf is your problem again? (btw, at least you can defend yourself! smartass!jf's are unarmed and flying giant bullseyes.)and what is this problem ccp brings up? link?oh wait... to busy crying to moma... yeah... keep bringing those tears to fuel my jump drive.:)"
8/11/2011,"no one here made that argument (yet). games are supposed to be fun... but not always easy.here's the deal... capitals were not intended to be solo ships from their inception. that's why they cannot use stargates and why they require the use of a cyno. the idea was that players who wanted to use capitals ships, ships that can exact incredible pain and/or multiply the power of a ""conventional force"" by several orders of magnitude, would need to make friends and trust them enough with their expensive hardware to get around.however... many players get around this ""intent"" by using alts to put up cynos for their capital flying character (which touches off on the issues surrounding alts in general... but that's a whole other can of worms for a different thread).now you might say that ""this isn't fair for solo players who don't want to/can't rely on other players. how come they can't fly such ships they way they want to?"" simply put... this is an mmorpg. a massivle multiplayer online role playing game. there are multitudes of other players in this game. to ignore them because you want to is your prerogative but do not expect the game overall to be balanced as a ""single player experience."" otherwise it would just be a plain 'ol rpg that you need to log online to and just happens to have other players in it.edit: cleaned up some typos"
8/11/2011,"i was thinking exactly the same, such a pathetic forum community. it's my fault anyway, for wanting to improve something in this game, for thinking it's worth even typing the post. this game and this community is not worth my time.bye."
8/11/2011,"op, the general idea you're proposing has some merit. a dedicated cyno pilot makes sense when moving a capital fleet into enemy territory, but not so much when moving a single capital ship across the universe.however, a free cyno on any station may be going too far. moving a capital ship should be at least as difficult as moving a normal ship. an alternative suggestion: a new type of scan probe, and a new capital modulecynosural resonance probe -- a type of scan probe, which locates natural phenomena suitable to formation of a cynosural field. to use it, you travel to the target system in a non-capital ship, launch the cyno probe, then after it locates a cyno site, you return to the place where your capital ship is parked.cynosural resonance link -- a high-slot module for capital ships, which when activated jumps you to the last cyno probe deployed by the current pilot. the cyno link module carries heavy penalties, rendering the capital ship nearly useless for combat operations. fitting a cyno link is only feasible for long-distance travel through friendly or neutral territory.moving a capital ship would still be a pain, since you have to switch to your probe launcher ship and travel to each jump point via stargates, but at least you would be able to complete the journey by yourself."
8/11/2011,"do away with cynos totally.let the ship jump to any sys within range and have it appear in a totally random spot in sys, show up as a warpable object on overview for 1 min regardless of cloak or not....... lul"
8/11/2011,"i too would like instant travel to any destination for my capital ship without the need for using effort, fore-planning, a cyno alt or two, a fleet, interaction with other players.this is an utterly naive proposal from someone who doesn't appreciate how horribly game breaking instant travel everywhere in the game would be.of course i am just going to be called a 'troll' for believing you should have to put in some effort for your reward in this game but there you go"
8/11/2011,"this is rough draft of a new element in corporate/alliance warfare. where a single person can bring down a major alliance.role of the saboteur would be to make his way into the target corp and involve himself in the build process of ships and equipment. the saboteur would provide his new corp mates with especially modified ships and items that will malfunction whenever the saboteur decides to reveal himself. so for example if there is a big fleet engagement going on between two alliances. in the middle of the fight, the saboteur would apply to join the corp he is loyal to, and as soon as he leaves his current corp he will put offline all the ships and equipment that originated from him.it would be quite devastating if any of the directors or ceo's or even builders of the alliance suddently changed sides.special modified items will have to be part of contraband stuff. simply because in order to build yourself such a powerful position in an alliance, you would have to do some smuggling and alot of preparation. being a secret saboteur will not be a easy careeer to maintain.if you like the idea of big powerful alliances being vaulnerable to having their members bribed to switch sides, then feel free to give a thumbs up"

8/11/2011,"would not workgetting into any null sec alliance and corp is tough work. supplying a full fleet of pvp ships costs allot of isk (i spent billions, for 10 alpha malstorms, 25 drakes, 25 canes), not everyone even fly's the stuff i supply, and total fleet sizes are much higher then what i stock so yea.if the feature is put in most alliances are just going to only have the executor corp of the alliance and long term ceos (multiple years, real life time) supply any ships to alliance directly or through alts.also any way to find out if ships are sabotaged or not? what would stop players from sabotaging any ships they sell in npc markets? greifers would sell these and use myrid of changing alt chars to sell the dummy ships for pranks and isk.are you really planing on spending years of your life on a char, billions of isk, just to win one battle?"
8/11/2011,"bravo, good sir. besides, it would be a great indication that ccp is serious about pleasing the 97% male demographic of eve."
8/11/2011,"i agree with making fw more about pvp and less about pve. also something has to be done with neut gangs coming in the missions. i'm not saying don't let them in, but if they do they should be able to be shot at with no penalty. i would suggest that neuts (non-faction warfare) that when they use the gate, get an aggression timer and can be shot at. this would prevent neut's being exploited, as it forces the plexer to take standing hits even though the other pilot is an invader."
8/11/2011,"copied here: logi improvement suggestionno one uses remote tracking links on the oneiros or scimi. furthermore, with good skills, a basi or guardian can easily fit and power 5 lg rr with a single lg energy transfer bounce between them. i think that with similarly good skills an oneiros or scimi should be able to fit and power 5 lg rr too.--------------------------------------------------my logistics proposal:let's just make logistics simply little carriers. helps in training for the roles.basi and scimi: bonus shield resists (+5%). bonus shield rr and energy transfer cap activation amount (-15%) and range (+150%). cpu need for shield transporter (-50%) and pg for energy transfer (-50%).guardian and oneiros: bonus armor resists (+5%). bonus armor rr and energy transfer cap activation amount (-15%) and range (+150%). pg need for armor rr (-65%) and pg for energy transfer (-50%).all logi: drone bay 100 and bandwidth 50. sensor strength 28. 6 high slots. reduce pg and cpu for respective rr modules as current. adapt cpu and pg of each to enable 5 lg respective rr and 1 lg energy to be fit with logistics 5."
8/11/2011,"i'm not enraged. more a /facepalm reaction.basilisk - groups of logistics backing up fleets using shields.guardian - groups of logistics backing up fleets using armor.scimitar - soloist logistics backing up a small gang using shields.oneiros - soloist logistics backing up small gang using armor.that's pretty much how they work. both the oneiros and scimitar can get cap stable while fulfilling their mission. basilisk and guardians hit issues so the power transfer helps address it.the problem: ""small gangs using armor"" don't really work well in the game. they are slow and, as such, the oneiros really doesn't have a spot that it shines at. also, to get it well tanked, the oneiros fits a shield tank. kind of b-ass ackwards from how it should fit to do its job well.what is needed is some adjustment to the oneiros so it can ""fit properly"" to get its job done and match up with how the other 3 logistics ships work. the situation sucks but it is ""odd-man-out""."
8/11/2011,you should totally set up a gang supported like this and bring to 77s
8/11/2011,any plex that is used for aurum cannot be used to add game time and since that char will have to have game time to show off its fancy new boots to itself in its own lil captn quarters another plex is bought or subscription renewed. ccp 2 - player 0 (can strut in new boots)
8/11/2011,you just answered your own question.step 1: spend 300 million +/-step 2: get plex with isk spentstep 3: change plex to aurumstep 4: look like a jackass wearing something useless you just spent 300 million isk on.
8/11/2011,"i dont tink that about trust.i tink that about saveing time on waiting until some one refits or on counting ships then fc can see with ships hee have and witrh hee stil need more, and not wait on each recuest from fleet 5 mins until all wil x up etc. ader ting its saves time on waitign for ppl to they no need to wait so long until flet wil form up count ships ask for new ships etc. all that forming up can bee speedet up with that ship counting ting."

8/12/2011,"you forget something about yout little step system,supply and demand... you still need people to train up the chars to get to the point of selling one and find someone who like it.if everyone would buy the 100mil chars then the demand goes up and supply goes down... meaning the once 80bil char goes up to 160bil.all the isk spend is mostly still generated through plex and in-game revenue.which keeps it all still within game mechanics.with buy sps for $$$$ with rl money you would replace isk entirely making the rich just uber titan fleets.so sorry i say no to =)"
8/12/2011,"constantly reappearing ""ideas"" like this makes me wonder. maybe ccp should make a different game, which would consist just of getting sp over time. because apparently there are lots of people who play solely ""number of sp"" game. then ccp would introduce paid sp into that game and make a shiny profit..."
8/12/2011,i fully support this idea.
8/12/2011,"great idea.i undock, get ganked on station, and boom, negative sec and standing with the local empire."
8/12/2011,"no, a player's ship exploding, all the damage should count as attacks performed by the person who killed them, so if someone wants to gank-on-station, they run the risk of aggro'ing 30+ players outside jita 4-4 and kicking the concord hornet nest...on a side not, they need to add a new stimulant only available through a concord lp store, concord grape jelly"
8/12/2011,seriously people...stop nitpicking at the stupid little crap that has obvious ways to be corrected. and if you are going to nitpick then give a way to correct your little problem. thanks for those that have given support so far and have given ideas to flesh this out.i like the idea of having the explosion of one ship destroy another and possibly cause a chain reaction. i agree that the damage should never be enough to destroy any ship that has full shields and armor. that would be stupid. self destructing should do damage...but as stated before time and time again...ill state it again for those of you who don't know how to read...change self destruct so it cant be done within 250km of a station or gate. as for who should get credit for the damage...im on the fence but im leaning towards the exploding ship. yes you might get some friendly damage on your kb's but your exploding ship is your damage and should give you the credit if you kill someone with it.
8/12/2011,i like the idea. already its strange that no friendly fire is turned on and lasers and ammo can go trough your ship without cousing any damage.
8/12/2011,"so basically you are angry because your enemies took the time to read and then follow the teachings of great strategists like sun tzu, carl von clauswitz, yamamoto etc. while instead of adapting and practicing the same, chose to use the; cling to what worked in the past and cry about change strategy? like an old man crying about how much coffee used to cost back in 1902? that's a pretty sure sign that your on your way out. move over gramps the next generation is here."
8/12/2011,"back home? 0.0 is far more hospitable to a pirate then low sec! think about it... theres no gate guns... there is however, carebears...ratters...missioners...site runners in crappy fit tengu's looking for wh to farm. i never see carebears and hardly ever see missioners in low sec, and low sec t3's are usually geared much more towards pvp since they can gate hug. and no the number isn't 0 there are a few npc stations scattered about that you can repair and set your clone to. some stations even have decent markets. there just aren't enough to make your idea anything other than a logistical nightmare.and by the way when your flashy red home is wherever you freakin say it is, and all space is enemy territory."
8/12/2011,"if hes quoting gunny, he must be correct!"
8/12/2011,"i think you have to read better.i wrote to go back home after a pirate mission in null-sec.login -> travel in null sec -> stai cloaked waiting your victim -> kill -> reapet -> after x hour go back in low sec to recharge your cloaking device module -> travel in null sec again.i do not think to ask for a modification that kills piracy.you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.i am very sorry for your limits.just like illegal parking attendants.

8/12/2011,"not safe i never safd safe, i sad use resureses niot sit my self in pos for 2 weeks and wait until soem ****ing afker dies or gos away, i wish to kil him find him and be able to find him, in soem monent that he cant sit all the time half or mostly afk, and do noting, i wish to able hunt him dowbn and kil befor hee kiled my corp m8 or allince m8.so in other words, even attackers aren't allowed to come into your system? and how does an afk cloaker kill someone? sounds like it's u who wants risk-free 0.0 because u don't want anyone at all to attack u or your system. way risk free eny way atackes are only rater kilers when comes top real pvp they runing and runing fast, thy dont look for fight but for easy kils only. they wil ned than pay for each jump thathey make in to our systems. atleast hen they will not run so fast to chath them up and kill.and they still haven't explained how one person who isn't even doing anything ""terrorizes"" everyone in the system. all i hear is nothing but qq about risk while they think they're entitled to easy isk without having to maintain it; they just don't want to admit it. explanation :you wish that i show or that i write i wuld liek to show you, name you ratign system i wil bring my alts there and clouck and wil hold close a black ops fleet to jump in you wil know your self how that is if 1 alt wil sit cloucked in each off your aliance system, i tink you wil fist try to bait me then afcors i wil not take bait ;) ( it o sited soem time afk in sytem s and know how to do that). and igf you cant name systme where you rat or you not rat att all you nto sopose to poste even here you dont know about you talking then."
8/12/2011,"yes they are paid and geting prity good money from it, i know my self 3 ppl hoo erning such way money and they have inaf money to hold and play eve with 3 chars and not worry about moeny att all, one even told tha they resiving per alt atraund 300 milj per week to sit and colect intel with bots and when posible oppen cynos for titans or back opses. they even tried recruit me tha t i go do the same ting but i agenst eny boting never boted att all all money waht i have rated with me and my alt, by dual boxing."
8/12/2011,"so you wil be that ho wil sit 23/7 on the gate for month. and wil not go eat sleap to work att all. they to not stupid like you hoo will declouck if i nsytem meny blues and atack some one they will terorize neber hud un til wil be left only couple ppl and some one will make stupid move like start rating. i can tell only one ting afk siting need to be nerfed, wie trued everitng agens them maked flet seted baits of day and day when wie already started to tik so he logs in probably boting just intel after 1 day he decloucked and atacks our member, so thet rater was dead in coule seconds and was shot bu 30 recons and 5 bleck opses.i see that you nver was in sych situation or yopu dont live in sov 0.0 space if so even dont speek you dont understand a **** baout you taliking."
8/12/2011,i live in wh space now so i am rather ambivilant to the issue but...i would say that if cloaking needs to be changed then don't change it to make it easier on ratters and miners...change it because being afk and cloaked can yield a tactical advantage using fear on the locals without actually playing the game.afk cloaking is the only activity that can be done while afk without the use of a macro that yields any kind of tactical advantage in game. for that reason alone i would say there is an issue...but cloaking itself is not broken.that said i would say a better fix would to just add in a afk timeout like every other mmo has. if you have not entered any new input within a certian period of time...say 15 minutes...then the character is logged out. yes a macro can bypass this...but that is another problem in which ccp needs a decent macro detection method and enforce it.my point is we should not ruin a perfectly good working system just to fix another problem.
8/12/2011,everythink in eve has its ballance at some point. and simply afk cloaking has no penalties. afk cloaker will achieve all his objectives that he has setup as goal and in return he doesnt need to do any effort from his side.for example a scammer or corp thief which have nearly similar objectives to steal and disrupt. they need to put lot of personal effort to keep it going on other hand cloaker who just provides intel and maybe cyno hot drop doesnt risk anythink on his game level.
8/12/2011,sin ftw
8/12/2011,"one example, does not a rule make.your problem is local, but i can see you know that as you are avoiding me like the plague."
8/12/2011,no local = no null-sec empires = empty 0.0 = pirate own goali don't think alliances can handle massive industry production in 0.0 without local.
8/12/2011,"but local is going to be changed, no one knows to what yet, but it is changing. but you again avoided the point, that it is local that is your problem and not cloaks."
8/12/2011,"only u're too scared to even try and kill him at all since u specifically stated 1 sentence ago that u're gonna hide inside an outpost for 2 weeks til the one red yet inactive blip on your local goes away. wanna try that again because an afk cloaker doesn't do anything, let alone kill; u're just a pansy.see above.0ek-nj. that's npc space 'cause unlike u, i don't need an army behind my back. u, however, can't even carebear it up even with an army babysitting u so we all know that once again, u're too scared to even try."
8/12/2011,friendly bump.... and supported.. although not a lot of people seem to care about this suggestion....
8/12/2011,i'd like to see this done.

8/12/2011,can this solve 'afk miners' problem?

8/12/2011,"fact is, you want to know if someone is good at pvp, theres a thing called killboards, and if you wanna know whether or not there are some good fights in a system, bring up your star-map, and turn on the markers fro ""kills in last hour"" or ""kills in last 24 hours"" and both of these have options to look at either ships or pods killed in that time span.in other words, live statistics are un-needed and no serious player would use them, just the cod cs fanboys who care about nothing other then their k/d score for a region..."
8/12/2011,"not just no, f no...all this kind of thing does is turn the game into a killboard contest, imho they should not even release killboard data.-4 (accounts)"
8/12/2011,"your idea sounds like a kb monitor for the entire eve universe, available by the tab key. since people are sooo spread out, and the statistics would be heavily skewed by fleet warfare, i just don't think its terribly reasonable. however, you did give me an idea: a small popup that can be toggled like the fps monitor, that gives star map statistics for the system your currently in. i'll check to see if this has been proposed before."
8/12/2011,i am curious to know where this sudden influx of real time kill stat obsessed people came from. did some fps die and abandon them?
8/12/2011,"if you're really really curious you can go on a pilgrimage to the himalayas and study meditation with masters, if you commit your life to studying how the universe works, maybe then you'll understand how people just come up with these crazy wild ideas and all those influxes and whatnotalthough i might save you a lifetime of searching by giving you this short explanation to the phenomenon: the sudden 'influx' you were talking about is a very real matter that needs to be adressed by certain key people (probably not you) and i would also add that it is not irrelevant and pointless, and that it has more to do with the future of the game and what direction the game should be heading.it's long term stuff i admit, but its a real need in the game that will keep growing and it needs to be adressed properly through proper discussions and more productive arguments."
8/12/2011,"ah.in that case, because i'm feeling obstinate and nostalgic, i'll say no."
8/12/2011,"i don't really think making every little piece of intel like which specific hardeners are being used openly visible is a good idea, but the terrible state of ship effects definitely needs improvement. more examples being remote shield transfers are practically invisible on the target end with the logistics at any significant distance and you can't hear anything else if your camera is anywhere near the random loud gurgle of an eccm effect."
8/12/2011,"not a bad idea, not bad at all.supported."
8/12/2011,"scaling the aggro logoff timer like this would be far superior in my opinion, scaling should be proposed instead, though make sure you cant scale it back too much, last thing i would want is to cap-out an amarrian bc with my destroyer, jam it, only for it to log-offski before i could kill it."
8/12/2011,"incentives for killing supercaps? come into any 0.0 alliance chat and say ""we have supers tackled, join fleet for killmails"". then question whether there really needs to be any more incentives."
8/12/2011,"at that point, the hard part is done. who wouldn't want to get involved after someone else has done the work?try asking them ""hey, some supercap pilot's alt just logged on, we're going leave a cyno pilot in the neighboring system for 3 hours. x up if you want to sit in fleet while we wait to see if something interesting happens."""
8/12/2011,"then, advocate for the complete removal of autopilot."
8/12/2011,why? it serves a purpose and is balanced as is.
8/12/2011,"i will support this as long as there is a 20% chance per level to automatically disengage autopilot after each jump.at at level 1, there is a 20% chance that autopilot will turn off after each jump and at level5 there is 100% chance autopilot will turn off after each jump."
8/12/2011,supported.being able to autopilot 20-30+ jumps while warping to 0 definitely reduces the urge to commit suicide from boredom.
8/12/2011,wtz is killing this game
8/12/2011,"so, on the one hand, you don't want players to move around without exerting some effort.on the other hand, the current game feature that allows players to move around without exerting any effort is ""balanced"" and ""fine"".this forum is an orwellian nightmare."

8/12/2011,"i am so sick and tired of reading anything and everything that comes along dealing with the csm. the csm does nothing good for eve unless it benefits the big null alliances. if you don't believe me than take a look at who runs the csm and where they are from.in the last little while i've seen several changes in the game because of these butthurt big alliances don't like how something it does, cry to the csm, csm makes a stink and que ccp bending over to the will of the csm and ta da, patch is released with changes.ccp when will you take your game back and bring it back to the way things used to be? not all of us want to live in null and be butthurt little alliance members that cry and demand changes when were scammed, some of us have been there and don't care. we don't want to loose our wh ore, which by the way if you don't live in a wh and have no idea how dangerous it can be shouldn't be dealing with that topic. i've lost a number of ships, including mining vessels in wormholes. as of this moment i am casting a no confidence vote for the leader of the csm along with the entire csm. ccp please for the love of all things good in eve take your game back from these butthurt null sec cry babies!vancep.s. this is my opinion and i am free to it, if you don't like it that's to bad. i also do not come back to read these so feel free to reply if you like."
8/12/2011,moved from general discussion.
8/12/2011,i wouldn't want to see the csm disbanded but i would like to see the csm being filled by a different way of electing them.
8/12/2011,"i second this, csm should not be voted on in the way it is as it just ensures that the big alliances control the council.yes, the big allainces should have a place on the csm but they should not be the be all and end all of it"
8/12/2011,"so clueless. didn't the csm help ccp understand the issues with nex, or do you want ccp to bring back the ""gold ammo"" issue.""p.s. this is my opinion and i am free to it, if you don't like it that's to bad. i also do not come back to read these so feel free to reply if you like.""lol, this shows how much you really care that you don't want to bother with the issue anymore."
8/12/2011,"forced voting. you can't log in until you voted for someone. would create interesting results, that's for sure. displayed order of candidates needs to be randomized for obvious reasons."
8/12/2011,op is so butthurt its funny.
8/12/2011,"because letting the computer decide randomly is so much better than real voting, yay!"
8/12/2011,"i've seen some tears on this forum, but little that compares to this. especially when it's over something that not one single member of the csm has said they have the least intention of pursuing."
8/12/2011,"null sec butthurt pirates don't sell the damn ore, they turn it into ships and use it, very little is sold. don't screw us over because of some butthurt null campers that have no idea what living in a wh is like. your wh doesn't stay a jump from jita for more than 24h and it could take a week or more before it is within reasonable jump distance from a major hub. a good number of us also use these ores for productions and paying the outrageous price that these null butthurts were charging was no good."
8/12/2011,ive been in a c5 with static c3 for a little under 2 weeks and i can already tell just how annoying it is to wait for a good pipe to open to move loot or ore to and from highsec. i'm not against removing abc ore from the lower sites 1-3 as long as it is as or slightly more profitable than lowsec which is what the lower classes (should be) comparable to. c4-c6 should remain untouched.
8/12/2011,"wormholes are nearly perfect. leave them the hell alone.it sounds to me like the alliance carebears out in null don't like the loss of market control to wormholes. after all, they can't establish an empire in w-space in which they can safely botmine all day long. if anything, i'd say make abc wormhole-only. there's real risk out there.leave the abc in c1/c2 space. it doesn't spawn in nearly the quantities of higher classes, the wormholes are smaller (collapse with less mass) so it's harder to move ore out, and they're more actively visited by pirates and rival corps looking for easy kills."
8/12/2011,"i'm not sure where ccp and csm is going with this removal of abc ore from wormholes. let us shed some light onto this shall we??for anyone, *cough* csm, who doesn't know to much about wormholes and the mining that is done in wormholes here is a little info. first off a wormhole exit doesn't always spawn next to a major trade hub. so those of us who actually live in a wormhole depend on some of that ore to build what we need. next we move on to the actual spawns, so far it's been 17 days with no grav site spawn in our wormhole. so if you can find the profit in not having a grav site to mine than show me. at the moment we count on lower prices to get us by on our production.some of us choose to stay away from null, i don't know about anyone else but i don't feel like living under the rule of some big butthurt alliance that needs the csm to force changes in the game to suit them. nor do i was to pay silly alliance and system taxes to these butthurts.if you are living in null you have 24/7 access to all of the best ores and it is far safer than wormholes. living in a wormhole forces you to actually rely in some skill, it's no walk in the park at the best of times. constant hassle from people passing through, lack of site spawns and no moon mining. take away our abc and force us to pay outrageous prices to butthurt null alliances that have more isk than brains and i don't see the point in living in a wormhole or playing eve for that matter.80% of the population of eve lives in highsec so why do we have butthurt null bangers dictating the changes that should be made that effect us in highsec. changes must be made sooner than later the voice of the highsec population will be herd and the csm won't like what we have to say.vancep.s these are my opinions and views and i am free to them, if you disagree that is to bad. also i don't ever come back to read the asinine comments left, feel free to reply but no response will be given."
8/12/2011,"totally spit-balling here but meh, i feel like spit-balling today. perhaps this has been suggested before or is just a stupid idea and if so that's cool, i'm just throwing the idea out therewhat about a change to faction warfare, where by joining fw you get a t1 fitted faction ship instead of a crappy rookie ship when you lose your ship? that way new players that join and want some pvp may be more willing to take the plunge knowing they won't be stuck mining in a rookie ship to grind isk if they lose their ship. this may require the creation of a ""rookie level"" of faction ship so the bottom doesn't fall out of the market on the current ones. something like a navy merlin or condor, using the caldari for an example. the current way fw is setup is like telling a soldier if he gets his tank blown up he has to buy himself a new one. is this not a little ridiculous in wars between great ""empires""?they'll probably still be fodder, but maybe they'll be more willing fodder. they'll also be learning the ropes and if the experience is enjoyable they'll venture out there in their own ships eventually, with a little experience under their belt so it isn't viewed as such a risk.anyway, just a thought."
8/13/2011,"we need more ways to improve faction standings since many new players start out running missions and may decide to change career paths once they have enough isk, experience, and skills trained. i support option 2 specifically."
8/13/2011,icons that are actually icons. yes please.
8/13/2011,"now, most have been bantering back and forth about 'omg afk cloakers ruin the game' and 'stfu whiner'. now i agree that cloaking is part of the game, and that there should be that feel of psychological warfare, but i also agree with the not having the person afk. maybe adding a mechanic in where the person has to click a dialog box every half hour when there is no activity, booting them from the game (hell do this with anyone that's just afking in general.)or maybe requiring some sort of fuel source for the cloaking ships would be a better solution. this would make the cloaker have to think a bit too as they would have to plan just how long they could stay out before having to get out and refuel.just my two cents into the whole conversation."
8/13/2011,1
8/13/2011,1
8/13/2011,"i want to highlight these opinions, oft reflected, particularly because they appeared in succession:""f*** yeah!"" is my initial reaction, spurned by that marauding spirit i feel most eve players can relate. at the same time, i cannot help but consider the necessity of compromise to success. certainly, that is argument enough against some of the more arbitrary proposals like sp hits as they are both at the extremes -- to the authors: what would the terms, if any, of your compromise be?"
8/13/2011,true.
8/13/2011,"jumping from a system to another is one of the most awful things in the game: it looks like you leave a box and enter into another one.it would be great to have some kind of short animation, even a 1 or 2 seconds one would do it, but it should not looks like it is an animation actually.i think it should be a very high priority that would give a huge boost to immersion to eve."
8/13/2011,"animations can be a great idea but i'm travelling a lot and i find a ""short"" animation of jumping will not be a very good idea, for the time we will loose."
8/13/2011,"yes, because your immersion should be a very high priority for everyone, amirite?"
8/13/2011,"it's not my immersion, everyone would benefit from it.and you still loose a couple of seconds to jump, what i say is just to cover that time with something better.do you understand what i mean?"
8/13/2011,how does one benefit from a delay in jumping?
8/13/2011,"why not.playing some sort of small jump animation wouldn't cause any delay and shouldn't be a problem, unless you're really attached to those loading bars and ultra crappy can't-do-anything-for-a-few-seconds jump effects already in place and/or don't understand the concept of variable animation durations."
8/13/2011,"oh jesus why it's so hard for you to understand?did you even read my previous post?!i'm not proposing to add a delay, just to cover the actual one with something better, since the transition from one system to anoter is not istant, it takes a couple of moments; what i'm saying is simply to cover that time with something better and smooter that give a better idea of the jump travel, instead of the 'box' feeling that we have now."
8/13/2011,i don't get a 'box feeling' but if a < 1s animation is important to you then best of luck with your 'proposal'.
8/13/2011,someone can't count.
8/13/2011,"in a ccp video you can see a pretty nice way to solve the problem, it's like going through a door, very smoothly and naturally, not the crappy effect we have now.here it is"
8/13/2011,"a realy simple but, in my opinion great feature would be an channel motd for corp and alli chat.this would guarantee a better information flow for corp/alli members."
8/13/2011,"just wanted to touch on this flawed argument:monocles bring the benefit of (questionable) aesthetics; otherwise no one would buy them -- its a (questionable) symbol. it is not an 'additional' risk, it stands against the rational/existing default; the exception is the issue here.in true eve spirit i say let it all burn!"
8/13/2011,"i would prefer that podding become impossible by taking pods off the overview and making them un-targetable.at the same time, the need for podding should go - why kill a pod? good reasons like intel, and costing the enemy much money in replacement for a clone but let's be honest here, the podding mechanic and implications are slanted. removing podding, and hence no loss of all implants, but set it up comparably to skill point loss experienced with loss of t3 vessels.therefore, if you lose a ship, the power surges in the destruction damage if not destroy your implants. meanwhile, a capsule should have nothing on the overview save for stations and gates, and no ability to read local.so my ideas might be considered ""carebear wet dream"" but let's consider this: - in high sec or general missioning, you can lose cheaps ships daily at little cost to expensive implants. at a certain point implants can cost more than a clone. how many times do you get podded compared to overal rate of ship loss, and how expensive is getting podded in the eventuality that it happens? - getting podded can in fact be an easier way out if you position your clone in the right place. the reason for podding is so the enemy cannot sit around gathering intel - but if the ability to do that were removed, no overview, no local, etc, there is no reason but rather than being podded to go into what is essentially a ""respawn point"", the enemy pilot has to go back for a new ship. if you keep your clones and ships in one station, getting podded is how long a delay compared to having to go all the way back? i once let myself get podded to spare the trip home.so, what seems like a carebear heaven prospect would, with the right changes to removing intel gathering abilities of a capsule (should not even have d-scan), actually makes the game harder, and makes ship loss more expensive if implants are damaged or destroyed. it also moves the ""total loss"" aspect from the pvp community operating in 0.0 and low sec, partly away and into the high sec missioning community for partial loss of expensive implants. at the same time, high sec dwellers averse to the total loss of being podded might start to venture into low more often and take their chances. so while this thread might be about the ridiculousness of monacles not being destroyed, it would in fact make the game harder across the board where it's easiest (to lose ships against npcs), easier for people who already have things harder (low sec pvp), and increase target chances outside of high sec too."
8/13/2011,"i like the idea of completely removing podding. i say podding is one of the greatest hindrances for people to go pvp. you can talk about risk aversion, jumpclones, carebearing, etc, until you see blue in the face, but the simple reality remains this: nobody takes their billion-isk implants set to pvp; and nobody wants to clone jump to a lower-learning clone for just that few hours pvp op. either removing podding altogether, or make it so your implants don't get destroyed upon podding (the latter, immersion-wise, is harder to swallow).simply not being able to target a pod would therefore be best (and have them be impervious to aoe dmg); and then remove local + overview from the pod pilot, so there's no advantages to be had for the pod pilot."
8/13/2011,"just because you don't use expensive implants or maybe can't even afford to use them in pvp, doesn't mean that others don't on a regular basis.podding is great fun and the icing on the cake, so to speak and can be mostly avoided in empire.oh and it's until you're blue in the face."
8/13/2011,"lol. ""until you see blue in the face"" is perfectly legit idiom. 'are' merely expresses the state of being (as seen from the one getting blue), whereas 'see' represents the perspective (as seen by the observer; 'until you're showing to be blue in the face,' basically). anyway, totally offtopic; and yours wasn't even a correct correction (the worst kind: like people trying to correct you on your 'grammer' when they mean 'grammar').as for podding, you seem to be missing the mark there, too. naturally people who can afford to lose billion isk implant sets on a regular basis won't be dissuaded from pvp-ing. duh. i was, however, talking about people who don't currently pvp, because they can't afford to lose those expensive implant sets. if ccp wants to encourage the latter to pvp, not destroying their implants would be go a long way towards pulling them over the line."
8/13/2011,"i don't mind that you were wrong. i'm not missing any mark. you said ""but the simple reality remains this: nobody takes their billion-isk implants set to pvp"" maybe you should have worded it better, much like the phrase you tried to use."
8/13/2011,"so a ""vanity thing"" must cost aur? so your tatoo, your sweet personnalisation of your caracter must cost aur too. i think i can understand the monocle price but i accept this price because i can personnalize my character in an other way. for me, it's the same idea for my ship. i can pay an artist to do things for price and i can make ""han solo's thing"" with my own hands. i have eternity to do this. if ccp can't make different and personnalisable skins for each vessel because server problem, i understand. but if it's made possible to do this (and it will be pretty soon), i hope it will not cost money... but i think it's hopeless."
8/13/2011,just listening to the eve meetup courtesy of eve radio...what about an organic alien race like the shadow from babylon 5? sorry if it's been mentioned...

8/13/2011,"they're ""stranger"". i think more races can change the game badly. but i think you're proposition is interessant if you mean ""more contact with aliens/strangers"".the few moments i mean snake drone or strange sleepers are my best moments inthe game (i'm pve missionner)and i will be happier if i meet more jovians, for example."
8/13/2011,maybe for capital ships that can't be stored in a pos. i'd like to see a capital docking array for the pos that would allow you to lock down cap ships with a password or via role management.
8/13/2011,"noabsolutely no, because tacklers would just blow up all timepeople should undock more and think less."
8/13/2011,"literally every freighter pilot in eve would commit suicide the second a timer like this was brought in, just fyi."
8/13/2011,i would get behind a fuel charge. of course this just means sneaking in a blockade runner so they can have a massive fuel reserve.
8/13/2011,"as per cue every time somes dares to mention the exploiting of the cloaking devices the exploiters come in force to demonize and make suggestions that are beyond silly. ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" doesn't work against something being exploited.this is the exact same attitude given by those demanding that ccp not change concord and let them have their easy, risk free ganks in hisec. ccp made the right choice and beefed up concord and the resulting tears from exploiters would have breached a dam. this is nothing new folks.the main issue is that the one exploiting the cloaking device can not only go eat dinner but go out, go to work, go to sleep, go 23 hours without touching the client while returning to surely find and get someone who didn't lag the server with constant d scans.a stealth should have an advantage in ability to strike but the way it is set up now is virtually risk free. risk free long term intel, risk free ganks, risk free affect in systems.the simple solution is random decloaks starting after 15-30 mins and increasing in chance the longer the module stays active. this will keep the legit reasons to use the cloak intact while punishing those who think it is ok to stay in a system cloaked while at work or having no interaction with the game other than putting unnecessary load on the server.this will force the one in enemy territory to occasionally have to reset his cloak or log off. no more free intel.this will not fix the marco issue but would help identify a few marcos as afk cloakers get reported after the change."
8/13/2011,not everyone
8/13/2011,"there is one problem with your rant, it is not and has never been deemed, an exploit. you have the 100%, risk free, instant local intel tool and afk cloakers are trying to subvert that tool. but it relies upon you to be effective, as an afk cloaker cannot make you do anything."
8/13/2011,false. afk cloackers collet a lot of intel information without being able to prevent (intel is very important during alliance wars) and have the ability to attack like a clock bomb.we are not naive.
8/13/2011,"please elaborate in what exactly i said that was false.also could you please restate what you just said, it really made no sense."
8/13/2011,"ohmygawdthe levels of pathetic coward afk whining in this thread are far beyond any previously registered qq.i especially like the bit about no local = everyone in high sec. although it was written by a troll, since no one is that laughably illiterate, it still made me laugh."
8/13/2011,"yep the whines from the afk cloakers sound just like the whines from pirates when concord got buffed ""ccp you give freighters easy hisec whine whine whine!""step #1 claim actions are not an exploit.step #2 call others who dare mention the issue carebears.step #3 suggest beyond stupid suggestions for ""dealing"" with the use of the exploit.step #4 beg ccp to not fix the exploit to stem the flow of virtually free kills.step #5 rage on the topic where ccp announces a fix for the exploit.i have seen this before and will see it again. ccp will eventually fix this issue so don't let the afk cloaker's whines deter you. keep up the suggestions for a fix for this exploit."
8/13/2011,"in space, we have dual monitor support. you have a nice little slider in the esc menu so you can center your ship on one screen on another and easily drag your main hud elements in line with it, leaving the second screen for comms etc.whilst there is also a slider for incarna in does not have the same function. it simple moves the camera point of view over one shoulder or another.i would like to see the same dual monitor functionality in incarna (stations) as in space, so moving your center point moves your character position on your screen(s) to the middle or one or another and they stay in the middle of that screen when you zoom in and out, as opposed to disappearing into the cleft between your monitors as they do now."
8/13/2011,"in particular, i'd like to see the ability to make custom columns derived from two other columns. for example, multiplying the target's angular velocity by their signature radius gives you the exact stat to which your turrets are compared for tracking purposes. that'd be quite useful to have.but in the absence of that, it'd be helpful to at least know the sig radius short of looking stuff up in a database."

8/13/2011,"ships in eve fleets have roles. damage ship, tackle ship, ewar ship, cap denial ship, scout ship, cyno ship, etc etc. each bringing utility.having an easily accessible interface that encourages the guy in the damage ship to smug all over the other pilots would be really, really bad. everyone would assume that the damage ship is the best role and then go whine on the forums that their falcon doesn't do enough damage to compete on the official scoreboard.look what happened to wow: you had a bunch of different and interesting roles in raids, then some fool made a damage meter addon and soon the players demanded that every class be ""improved"" to be all identical damage guys with the same abilities.in short, no."

8/13/2011,"my ceo and i were talking about this a few hours ago, trying to think of ways to get the carebears involved in csm elections so that those of us not interested in being beholden to one of the mighty nullsec alliances actually has representation. given the sheer number of highsec residents there are, anyone able to rally enough of them should easily be able to be elected to the csm. the problem is getting them to care.after reading the notes on the idea of removing abc from wormholes, it's clear that our current crop of csms are largely ignorant of major parts of the current game mechanics. i've not even played the game for 18 months and i find myself wondering what possessed some of these people to think they really know the game.carebears unite!(disclaimer: i'm not exactly a carebear, i just live in highsec because the guys i game with do)"
8/13/2011,"it's possible to fix nullsec without taking the nerfbat to every other part of the game. nerf wormholes? really? because they aren't dangerous enough with no local, no gates, no sovereignty, and no stable route for reinforcements?i'd be curious to know the distribution of time spent in high/low/null/w-space. i've heard figures that say that the vast majority of eve players are in highsec. it stands to reason, then, that highsec should be the priority.now i understand that ccp wants to tempt more people out into the nullsec sandbox. the biggest barrier i see to that is lowsec. do something to make lowsec more worthwhile and the switch to null becomes a gradual thing, rather than the ""if i even stick my head out of highsec, it gets shot off"" mentality i see among a lot of the carebears in high."
8/13/2011,"aww, you're cute."
8/13/2011,"some friends and i are trying to put together ""something"" for csm7. we're trying to figure out a platform for improving highsec, making eve more noob-friendly without building walls in the sandbox, and creating better avenues for young, independent players to find their way out of highsec into low/null without getting their asses shot off every time."

8/14/2011,and what about intel infos that a afk cloacker could collect for enemy alliances without the possibility to expel it? owners of a system should be able to repel an enemy. the cloak module makes a spy invulnerable and untouchable.the real cryer are afk cloackers who do not want to lose this privilege.
8/14/2011,"considering they are at no risk of losing anything i don't see why.also, how do they gather intel if they are afk?looking through your posts it's clear who the real crybaby is in this discussion."
8/14/2011,"this shows that you do not know the purpose and how the role of afk cloaker.there are many tools that capture information about corporations that operate in a system. you let the logs record the names of the pilots and the ships they drive. you can check what are the best time slot to make an attack .. and much more. and this force the players to operate always under guard, causing a slowdown in the production chain, causing harm to the economy of the alliance.1000 hours spent afk + 5 (random) hours spent in piracy = clock bomb effect. you have made <U+200B><U+200B>a system unusable while you sleep peacefully, or while you're shopping (because we don't know when are you really afk or when you are waiting for a perfect moment to strike an attack)you will get bored waiting as we get bored waiting for you."
8/14/2011,"my logs dont show that info, maybe you should be petitioning against use of intel gathering macros, not cloaked ships doing noting.you mention being forced to 'operate under guard'. it's 0.0, you should be doing this anyway. why shouldn't people be able to influence your economy? this is a key element of warfare.there is no such thing as piracy in null sec, for piracy to occur there must be laws to be broken. again, cloakers do not make a system unusable, your coawardice and unwillingness to do anything while a random ship sits doing no harm is what makes the system unusable. grow a pair for goodness sake. if you can't handle a single red in your system doing nothing then you don't deserve the right to use that space."
8/14/2011,"this shows how poor is your 0.0 life as citizen and productor. you are a pirate.. you can't understand.your fury against this thread shows how afk cloaker is a necessary role to your gameplay.you call others ""cowards"" when you're the first to fear a change.prove that a cloak device with the fuel (or charge) ruin your game .. then you are right.do not hide behind your ""you are a carebear""."
8/14/2011,"what kind of 0.0 do you live in where you don't have to take care? i don't afk cloak, but i also don't think anythign at all should be done about it. if they are afk, they aren't going to hurt you, just don't talk in local when there's one in your system and they aren't going to be gathering any intel while afk.if cloaking device fuel comes in, all of you nerf cloaking idiots will be on here whining about that after the first time you forget to bring cloak fuel and suddenly find yourself completely unable to hide from a hostile gang (i for one put cloaks on my haulers when i do pi ****, i've relied on those several times when roaming gangs roll though). you are a carebear. if there's one red afk cloaking, just rat with a buddy or two. one guy in a cloaky ship isn't going to take all of you. it's nullsec, htfu."
8/14/2011,"you expect to have risk free ratting without protecting yourself and you claim i have the poor understanding. laughableyes, my reasoned arguments show i am completely enraged by this 'threat' to cloaking. i can't even use a cloaking device and have no intention to waste electricity 'denying service' to other players.first: i don't fear anything and certainly have no reason to believe these whiny threads are ever going to lead to a change to cloaking.second: i can't prove a cloak device with fuel will ruin my game because it wouldn't. you probably meant something else and need to rephrase this statement.who's hiding? you clearly are a carebear, a pretty incompetent one at that since you can't seem to find the jumpgate next door, or simply let an afk player stop all your activity.furthermore i could say do not hide behind your ""you are a pirate"", but it's a stupid thing to say so i wont."

8/14/2011,that does make a lot more sense. another concern that was brought to my attention would be war dec mechanics while on station and on gates. how would we circumvent damage done by an exploding ship to an innocent bystander on a station or gate that has nothing to do with the wardec when hit by the exploding ship? any suggestions on this?
8/14/2011,"i can kind of see why people might want constant afk cloaking not to happen in all systems. that would be kind of cheep. it is always possible, for a rival to afk cloak everything. but... does it really ever happen anywhere that often, on a even remotely massive scate? i have been living in null for a while. the only times i remember \ constant hostiles and nutes in system is around when people are invading or attacking you (so one cloaked ship is the least of your worry's). and when visiting the bigest hub of a allie that is the largest alliance in game, allways a nute in that system (vfk). beyond that sov nullsec space is pretty desolate even with stations so you could just move to a system that is quiet 90% of the time or more. beyond sov nullsec anyone can dock in stations, so a person could remain docked in station and always be a hidden threat with even less effort then cloaking (don't even need to hit a module you are in invulnerable station to start with).this is a elaborate debate about a none issue which is uncommon."
8/14/2011,"if you can't do without local channel, and you can't stand watching that cloaked ship loitering in local, then i think that the action of cloaking should remove the player listing from local. after all they should be hidden from view..."

8/14/2011,"i know you're busy ranting, but just a heads up, for game mechanic reasons us pirates operate in low sec. when we do venture into high sec for lulz, we all expect to get concorded at some point. whether they were buffed or not, makes absolutely no difference to us. which it isn't. you stated it is, please provide proof of this.i've never done this, but it's others choice to do so. after all, this is a forum open for all eve players to post in. calling someone a carebear is quite a standard thing around here, in many regards. but it's a retort made, to elicit a certain response.what exploit? but let's face it, if you don't want to change how you approach pve with an enemy in local, that's not really our problem. but only highlights the one who is stupid.what exploit?again, what exploit? the only thing so far that ccp has said they are fixing, in relation to this, is local. local is after all, the reason for afk cloaking.yet again, what exploit?"
8/14/2011,"you begin to get boring. we understand that for you is not an exploitthe ccp will change the local .. but knowing it, i'm sure it will be in favor of alliances and sovereignty .. and not of pirates."
8/14/2011,nothing is an exploit simply because you don't like it.
8/14/2011,"if you want to cry exploit, you need to then show proof that it is in fact an exploit.we are actually talking about null sec here, aren't we? i'm sure when low sec local changes, we'll adapt and change with it. any chance you could answer the questions i asked, in post 72?"
8/14/2011,i have already explained my reasons for a fix that does not change the game of real pirates but avoid safe espionage and psychological terrorism. i don't want to go off-topic. it would be a fruitless discussion.
8/14/2011,it was a simple question and request. can't see why you would want to avoid it tbh. it is after all on topic.
8/14/2011,it already is. ccp aren't going to cave in to your carebear demands when there are already mechanics in-game to fix what you are crying about.
8/14/2011,"it is quite comical though...so... let us take a look...cloaky guy enters the system of enemy.people notify in intel channels of this guy's existence.possibility 1:after x amount of time, people likely start ratting in the system because they believe the risk vs. reward is a good one (assumptions of the cloaky being afk).cloaky unveils himself onto a ratter.standing fleet pew pews.possibility 2:miner starts mining.cloaky unveils himself.standing fleet pewpew.so sure, i hate cloaky afkers, but look at the facts... the only way a single person could be a threat is if you have no tank and he kills you before the standing fleet can react. amiright?the problem on the afk end and how they can be safe while you are not safe... technically they are not safe. for those who will want an explanation:they can be uncloaked while sitting afk in your system. counter argument? they could be anywhere? awwwh, too bad. if you don't want to take the time to find him (i don't think anyone would ever), that's your choice. you allow him to be safe by not searching for him. (yes, i understand this is weak, but it is true)aside from that one technicality, they generally are safe. i keep thinking, that's not fair that they can afk and be safe. i keep wishing i could agree with you guys that want this changed (not fixed because ccp hasn't declared it broken afaik), but i look at the grand scheme of null and see that the problem is players who play alone. i see this because i play alone most of the time, and afk cloakers used to be the reason i never undocked. afk cloakies provide very little fear to me now. the same cloaky has been in one of my other toon's systems for almost 3 weeks now, i've been mining since day 2 of his arrival.the last comment here made me think of this. before that comment on how the tools are available in game to stave off this... issue, i was erring on the side of option #1, but really, why would ccp put work into an issue that is not logical? sorry guys, i'm a carebear and... you are wrong. :) thanks.join standing fleets.don't undock untanked.log in to your alliance/corp's chat client.risk vs. reward.win at eve. (eve is a game of logic, stop being emotional, it gets you keeled.)"
8/14/2011,i like your answer.but the intel data that a cloaked pilot could collect without be hunted is unfair anyway.
8/14/2011,"please indicate how intel gathering on hostiles is in any way 'unfair', and how the word 'unfair' does not fit in with the cold-harsh universe that is new eden?you have the same ability to spy on others, perfectly balanced."
8/14/2011,heard that as well before ccp nerfed virtually free kills in hisec with the concord buff. nothing new from the pro-afk exploit crowd.
8/14/2011,exploit? how exactly is cloaking an exploit?
8/14/2011,don't expect a logical or factual answer. both omgwtfresearch and cynoska mcnamara are making baseless claims and avoid answering difficult questions regarding those claims.
8/14/2011,"this is not even relevant to the subject of this thread. but to answer your question, intel gathering is a vital part of operations and has always been vital.but just to humor myself, if this were relevant to the thread... it would sound something like...""but the intel that a cloaked ""afk"" pilot could collect without being hunted is unfair anyways""cept... he's not at his keyboard collecting intel.if he were at his keyboard... collecting intel, there are still ways to catch him. on his way out of the system. system lock downs work both ways. it is possible to catch them, just not easy... which would be the complaint. it is not easy. which isn't valid, because ccp has made it clear, this is a game where a group would fair better than a single person.^ this.ccp made a valid point with the policing abilities of concord as well, don't forget that part.pro afk exploit crowd?1. just because someone isn't for a nerf, doesn't mean they are pro to the suggested nerf. the nerf is fairly neutral, but it would be a waste of ccp's time. it's unneccessary considering that they likely (this is all conjecture) might mangle any fix they make to afk cloakers with future releases (the chatter about local getting changed soon due to in-station stuff), and that they also haven't fixed it yet, which makes sense (see my above post).2. afking isn't an exploit. actually, i find it logically deserves it's own term considering the way it works within definition. an exploit (on the internet at least) involves doing something unintended in the game, in the basic sense. now... if you are afk, you are not doing anything in the game. in fact... you can't if you are away from keyboard. calling it an exploit just brings up people getting their jollies over calling you an idiot for terming afking an exploit. i don't see many people explaining themselves. sure, it affects people, in-game, but they technically are doing nothing if they truly are afk. which leaves it to be quite a loophole?edit: i mean, how many years has it been? that people have been calling it an exploit and others have been laughing at them for calling it such? sure it could be deemed an exploit in a sense, but more logically... it isn't.(i think 4 years... maybe 5 years now)i hope i didn't go on any tangents. proof reading is for the real world. not games."
8/14/2011,a couple of you here need to prove that it is an exploit.it's been requested more than once.
8/14/2011,"proof that it is an exploit would involve ccp stating such. i am unaware of such an event, but i would love to see a link if anyone has one. otherwise, no one can call it an exploit. i believe we must assume that it is ""working as intended"" if you are trying to be politically correct.remember that this is a 4+ year old subject so there is a lot of qq to sort through :\"
8/14/2011,i have just as much proof that afk cloaking is a type of potato as these people do that is is an exploit.
8/14/2011,"brain-fart time (brought on by bot reports from the north).we probably won't see sleeper ai on normal belt rats in my lifetime, so why not let them blob like players are prone to do?they already warp-in/warp-out of the belts based on certain triggers, this is an expansion on that.attacking a rat in a belt makes it send a distress call (dc) bringing in other spawns from within range.- range is dependent on ship-type, so a frigate would not 'trigger' a dc whereas an attack by a t3/bs+ would have a long range (several au).- number of responding spawns could be based on a max.dps/signature ratio so that ships like tengu's would get blobbed harder than a bs even though dc range is the same.ps: possible response would vary from system to system as number of planets/belts/distances can vary quite a lot .. making some systems nigh impossible to solo-rat in."
8/14/2011,thumbs up everyone!
8/14/2011,this is a surprisingly great idea.
8/14/2011,no-one else using dual monitors?
8/14/2011,i think more to the point no one else is using incarna.
8/14/2011,"while it may be ""free intel"" it would make sense, considering (at least in the real world) radar picks up radar signatures, thats why stealth bombers look like golf balls on radar, so it would only make sense a ""radar"" passively active on every ship (as in not a module, sense it should be standard equipment, like life support for the pod) would pick up and relay details on signature radius from nearby ships..."
8/14/2011,"if you wanted to balance it then you could also simply add a ""mass"" column which would give similar information about someone armor tanking."
8/14/2011,back up.
8/14/2011,agreed.however i still think that there should be a skill to reduce cyno duration.
8/14/2011,"well, you can always self destruct after you light the cyno. so 2 minutes iirc."
8/14/2011,"supported if they play balance it. you don't want random storm to kill off a bunch of newbies in urlen. weather should be restricted to different parts of space, to fit the genre. not random. scalding pass. great wildlands, vale of silent, these sound like great places to put celestial phenomena. not in high sec. i mean seems pretty stupid to build a multiquadrillion isk starbase and put it in an area that is environmentally dangerous. at least not without some built in shelters for nearby travelers. comets and meteors, sure sounds good on paper but sounds like lag city. as different clients track the movement of the body. it would need to be a moving plex in game terms. and i think thy would have to spend a lot of server cycles tracking it's changing location. we have no planetary movement vis a vis the sun orbits for exactly the same reason."
8/14/2011,"there should be a musical theme, and the weather wench should dance; but realy, i don't think we need actual weather, the weather wench is enough imho."
8/14/2011,it is evident that people who ragequit like crybabies have been using their 5 day reactivations simply to troll the forums and bump their old fail-proposals for a game they no longer have any interest in.they should be treated like trial members until such a time as they actually contribute to the game by re-subbing/adding game-time.as it stands terrible trolls are given free access to spread their poison before disappearing again.
8/14/2011,"good argument, finally a decent response. doesnt apply in pve though.also if we're talking pvp then the scoreboards on websites would still be used very often because it is so specific and lots of details. the 'tab button' in the case of pvp would mostly tell them the exact level of activity and history in the system, so its not about bragging. and even if your properly fitted dmg ship gets outperfformed by somebody else in a different ship, maybe you should start thinking and planning on getting same ship? i think most of us always have something new and different that we want, its never really enough, so it wouldnt exactly change much in that department."
8/14/2011,"most of the responses were decent, they just weren't supportive of your terrible suggestion."
8/14/2011,"i apologize if i hurt your feelings dub step, but you gotta agree with me when i say that people keep bumping the thread with pretty stupi* comments that serve even less purpose than a 'terrible idea'. atleast in assembly hall. so how about/thread"
8/14/2011,i acknowledge there is a problem with ea frigs but i have to say i don't like this solution. not supported.
8/14/2011,"ive never seen the csm do anything other than represent the large scale alliances. if they broke the csm down to represent regions, and have a csm members standing for election within the regions, that way we would get the interests of high and low sec??? either way, as it stands, the csm to me and many many many players is a total non-entity in its current form."
8/14/2011,deal with the bot miners first. then look at the prices a week later. what a joke
8/14/2011,"i really dont understadn the need to remove either, ive been in wormholes, and been in null-sec.from my experience, you can make 10 times or more the profit mining in null-sec simply because the ores are in abundance and everywhere unlike wormhole space that has to rely on gravimetric cites that are not always there.but i guess this is just the nullies wanting to try to corner the market on yet another aspect of the game so that they can force players to come to null sec to be their pets. honestly i think wormhole space is the closest thing to a balanced risk/reward aspect of eve that we have, and messing with it before we fix alot of other crap would be bad bad bad."
8/14/2011,"yes, this storm in a teacup really needed another thread.thanks, vance komorov. your say on the matter is so important that it needs a whole new thread just, so people don't mix it up with the identical opinions that a hundred others have posted."
8/14/2011,just quoting malc - because quoting him is better than reading this thread (again ).
8/14/2011,"not a bad idea, creating perks for the faction war fighters. i would even create ranks, or perhaps award points for fw kills that could be used to buy bigger ship. what would really make fw attractive is if it had its own lp store (or does it? i've never done fw) with exclusive faction ships.some friends and i have been working on an idea that would amount to a major expansion for non-fw lowsec space. we're trying to put together a cohesive idea before putting it out there for the rest of the world to mock us :)"
8/14/2011,"my physical attractiveness has no bearing on how right i am :)obviously the current model doesn't work. if we want more people to get interested in doing more than mission grinding with their buddies, we need to create compelling reasons to do so. i think if we make lowsec something more than the pirate haven it typically is today, we'll see null pick up a lot of newcomers and explorers as low fills out more.the most frequent gripe i hear about null is how empty it is. the best way to solve that problem is to draw people out of highsec. you don't do that by nerfing highsec, that will make the game less palatable to new players and give us a stagnant game. you do that by giving them a pathway out to null besides ""join corp x and follow orders""."
8/14/2011,"been looking over the content of the various eve expansions since i started playing 3 and a half years ago. tweaks and bug fixes in all of them, but i've tried to summarise main features of each as i see it:empyrean age - summer 2008 - faction warfarequantum rise - winter 2008 - orca, weapon grouping, speed nerf, certificates and medalsapocrypha - summer 2009 - t3, wormholes, exploration overhall, l4 epic arcsdominion - winter 2009 - sov overhall, titan and supercarrier rework, nulsec pirate faction epic arcstyrannis - summer 2010 - piincursion - winter 2010 - incursions, noctis, l4 agent quality removalincarna - summer 2011 - standing in stationsapocrypha was a great all round expansion with something for everyone. incursions and pi (tyrannis) could be said to add content available to all, though pi may not be to everyone's liking as an industrialist feature. faction warfare was important for lowsec and good idea, but is incomplete. quantum rise mostly tweaks. incarna a bit of a non-event for everyone. dominion essentially for nulsec alliances. next expansion seems to be for nulsec too.there really doesn't seem to have been much of interest for the casual or hisec based player added in quite a while. i've nothing against nulsec. been there a fair bit on trips and enjoyed the pirate epic arcs, but with another 0.0 focused expansion coming up next and a csm solely interested in promoting nulsec issues, i'm concerned that the silent majority are being taken for granted."
8/14/2011,"sorry but in my opinion, this has affected the high-sec casual players far more than any other fraction.i almost never see orcas but in highsec, i never see as much t3 ships as in highsec, i see a noctis undocking at almost every station in highsec and these hubs have been increased by the quality removal.while it has not been the main focus of the expansions there has always been something to help the casual player or improve the gameplay in highsec.an pi is also something that can be done by a casual player in highsec without investing too much time or taking too much risk.tl;drits fully okay to have a biased view of the different parts of eve but they are just that. different parts of a whole."
8/14/2011,"miraqu,you appear to be agreeing with me. despite constituting the majority of players and ccp customers, hisec dwellers generally achieve only peripheral attention in most updates. i am keen to know what the future holds.orcas are great ships. hisec counterpart to the nulsec rorqual. widely used in hisec and wormholes.t3 introduced in apocrypha. excellent expansion now 2 years old. t3 ships versatile and used in different configurations and for different purposes in hisec/nulsec/wormholes. apocrypha revamped exploration, which is particularly significant for nulsec.i personally have never seen a noctis outside of hisec. nice ship. slightly more useful than the salvage destroyer. introduced as an afterthought because the primae model recievd wide acclaim.the l4 agent quality change is often regarded as a nerf. players no longer gain advantage through seeking the highest quality agents.pi can indeed be done in both hisec and nulsec. more isk to be made in nulsec as is reasonable, and gives nulsec residents local access to many useful materials. agree pi is one of the few things (together with mission running, mining and ratting) that can be done casually. about as exciting as mining though.my position stands. haven't seen a really useful expansion for 2 years since apocrypha, and looking for ccp and the csm to keep the player base interested.best,aleena"
8/14/2011,"that should not be the only answer to ""how do i play this game"" in a game that prides itself on being a sandbox. the point of the sandbox is being able to play how you want, not everyone becoming a cog in one of the nullsec machines."
8/14/2011,"well, i really believe that dominion was the last nullsec-heavy expansion and incursion was the last highsec-heavy expansion.i also do not believe that ccp will abandon highsec because they focus on the really broken part of eve, low and nullsec because highsec would be indirectly buffed by sorting out the nullsec mess, especially the industry.also i really believe in the democratic process. since nobody who obviously supports highsec claims only was elected it can't be that bad, couldn't it?"
8/14/2011,"there's nothing stopping you and your friends from sandboxing it up-- forming your own corp and staking a claim in lowsec/nullsec. however remember there is always the other side of the sandbox-- the freedom for me and all my friends to come **** on your parade if you can't defend it.here's how it works:people have been operating in nullsec for a long time. it's no easy task, there is a lot you need to know how to do. you need competent fcs to lead your pilots, you need jfs to import/export, you need blockade runners and rorqs to do pos logistics.all of the people currently playing in nullsec have friends that they have been playing with for a longtime. they will also be able to roflstomp any amount of new players trying to learn wtf is nullsec/lowsec.however, there are still new alliances emerging at a steady rate, and some even have new players--imagine that. they start as renters or pet corps, learning the ropes riding on some alliance coattails, and after a while they might earn enough respect to become a full alliance member. when their alliance failcascades, they might even have the political capital to start a new alliance.its just not feasible for a corp/alliance of new players to succeed unsupported unless there is literally thousands of you, a la original goonswarm."
8/14/2011,"it doesn't matter how well you educate yourself on anyone running for a spot in the csm. the simple fact of the matter is they are all from null sec alliances, all we are doing is simply putting in our vote for the best of the worst. the csm never used to bother me, but now more and more you see ccp bending over to the will of the csm to make changes that only affect people living in null. having 11% of the eve population cry about something and see a change made when 79% of the population doesn't agree to see the need for the change just rubs me the wrong way. most recently the bid to remove abc ore from whs, the general population doesn't want to see this happen but of corse the csm would love to see this happen. another way the csm is looking to cripple anyone who may offer up a new threat to the big null alliances. this needs to change either witht he removal of the csm or ccp listening to the people who put the most money in their pocket. if the csm would like to stick around and fight for any changes that may be made in null than by all means but don't speak for the high sec pop when you don't even spend any time in it."
8/14/2011,i think you suffer from a complete and total lack of understanding. this is colloquially known as being ****ing ******ed. i think you need to spend more than five minutes thinking about this.
8/15/2011,"""stupid is as stupid does.""gump. forrest. 1994"
8/15/2011,... perhaps its because of thishybrids tweakdon't you feel silly for losing your cool now?
8/15/2011,i like the warp effects like they are but this topic is the closest i can come to warp fixes. i see that when i warp from some stations i can warp thru the station and some stations i have to get far from the station and warp around it. there needs to be a fix of warping thru the station upon warp or going out of range of station to warp. i would assume most would like to warp thru since it is faster to get to a fight or to a location.
8/15/2011,"""stop crying to ccp to fix something that needs to stay the way it is. you wussy hisec freighter pilots need to put up a cap and pull yourselves up by your bootstraps we are not exploiting the game to get virtually free kills and loot that is always worth more then the loss of our battleships when concord shows up too late adapt or die in eve""oh wait wrong topic and wrong time. this was the random pro risk free gank argument that followed claims that ccp would never fix the issue. tho you could change a few words and have the same argument the pro risk free afk cloakers have.nothing new here. they flood into topics and scream and claim that ccp will never change things even tho they are making flawed argument after argument as if they do indeed fear ccp will find time to fix this. now once ccp fixes the issues that prevent them from nerfing afk-cloaking get ready for topics full of people claiming to be leaving."
8/15/2011,yep those would be all the nullsec bears cancelling their subs when their precious local gets nerfed.
8/15/2011,"relax. i am a hisec (err any sec) freighter pilot, and i'm on your side. don't generalize.keep your arguments to the point and within reason. i believe that letting the afk whiners spout their whiny senseless broken logic only serves to prove our point. as long as we in turn do not play their game of generalization and fallacy."
8/15/2011,"assumptions, assumptions.. baseless assumptions.well, yours is that you think that your part of null sec is 'yours' what exactly makes it yours? you can't block out spies and intel gatherers in real life, so what makes you think that you are entitled to in the game?i once a long time ago supported the addition of some new expensive sovereignty upgrade module like a ""tachyon pulse"" which would decloak all cloaked ships in the system. (and to an extent, still do if done properly, and done with the addition of the removal of local in nullsec), but you wouldn't use it all the time anyway, as it would cost a lot of stront or some other fuel. would you? miners should just get pvp friends to guard the gates if you are paranoid simple as that. if you don't guard your gates, then you have no right calling that system 'yours'"
8/15/2011,yes. 100% of all real life spies are always and without fail caught within five minutes.think of the afk cloaker as the chinese/russian/french/whoever spy satellite over your house right now. good luck catching that.
8/15/2011,"thanks for quoting the obvious sherlock. i presume that you thought that i don't know sovereignty works, which is the reason you thought to show how little you read into the responses on the thread by posting the link. yet, immediately after, i just suggested an infinitely better way of handling afk cloakers, yet you didn't even bother to respond to that, either with a 'yeah, that may also work' or 'that doesn't solve my issue because' argument. which only shows to all the readers of this thread, that you aren't really considering all solutions to your 'problem' just your own solution. (which just happens to gimp all users of cloaks, not just the one off case of a covert ops cloaker in null sec.and ps, just because you have sov, doesn't mean you own the system sherlock. (please show me where read this) if it did, then presumably the gates wouldn't let any strangers jump through. (good luck with that proposal) it only means that you have the option to build and operate outposts and infra hubs in the system, and to enjoy the benefits from said outposts and infra hubs. it also gives defensive bonuses to defending said assets. but of course, you knew that already. i mean, you read the link you sent me after all. :p"
8/15/2011,"hey... isn't this thread here to see support or lack thereof? obviously some of you are stuck on technicalities of parts of posts that don't even relate to afk cloakers.explain your support or lack thereof. acknowledge that not many people are bright to begin with. hope that your point gets across to people with a brain. end.raging doesn't help anyone. it just derails a thread.i don't support this.1. not an exploit unless explicitly stated as one by ccp.2. afk players do nothing but instill a fear of the possibility that one ship will attack you in one system.*standing fleet**intel channel**fit omni-tank*win.3. the op says everyone knows it is a problem. it is a problem to someone not willing to take a risk. nullsec is about risk vs. reward.4. the op asks why nothing has been done. 4+ years. nothing has been done. do you know why? because ccp either a. doesn't believe it is a problem, or b. has it low on priorities, because it isn't much of a problem.facts are:people are mad because they don't like to feel unsafe.unfortunately, those people want money.the desire for game money + the lack of risk taking = someone feeling their time is wasted. (in nullsec ofc).the lack of preparation for those that do risk is the reason for lost ships.being prepared still means you are risking something, but an active standing fleet can make your loss worth something. that something would be the removal of the most recent cloaky in system. (if this makes no sense to you, uninstall).please... please... stop being emotional wrecks in the ah... it looks terrible."
8/15/2011,"in real life spies are not hiding in f*ing deep space. and even if they were, you wouldn't be able to find them, even if you knew they were (somewhere).it's not the spy itself that's bothering you. it's the fact that you know he's there, and you take that information for granted. now you want to take even more for granted. nerf local instead."
8/15/2011,you do realize that local intel is not being nerfed. it is being replaced with a better intel tool.i quite wonder just how many will quit when they discover that the new intel will likely be far better instead of the wh like nothing they expect 00 to become.now in the other topic there is discussion on a new type of hull designed to hunt down those who think they can sit in a system cloaked and be safe all day. personally i think it ought to be an expensive module that only works on the destroyer hull. this would give destroyers a job similar to those in the navy today and make them a target worth attacking again.
8/15/2011,"that would nerf the whole stealth game to hell, like it even needed it. and only to make the game more comfortable for few noisy people.limiting cloaking time is the only reasonable idea. but stealth should not be nerfed in any way while local chat exists."
8/15/2011,considering that uncloaking someone in a system requires a hell of alot of time and skill with the proposed module. an active pilot can simply warp off or get out of range. recloak after the short cooldown and resume his activities.meanwhile those who are afk either wont get the warning and be exposed to be destroyed or the bot that runs his client will eventually be exposed and banned by ccp.take the afk out of the picture without ruining the legitimate uses for stealth.
8/15/2011,"someone afk cannot do anything to you,someone not afk is not what your post is targeted atwhats your point again?"
8/15/2011,"sure. but as long as it's impossible to even move around the space undetected (making any true recon/warfare impossible in the game), any nerf to stealth would be just strapping crap on a broken- or at least bad mechanic.local is the worst immersion breaker in the whole game and a bad alternative to more advanced mechanics. building anything on it would just make everything worse."
8/15/2011,this isn't a topic about local. keep it about the cloaking.it isn't a nerf to stealth. it's a nerf to anyone who is dumb enough to be afk after the change. those who are active can know when they are about to be decloaked and move away for the cooldown. resuming their recon afterwards.very simple very effective. no need for stealth fuel or even random decloaks. make the destroyer useful for the task and make those who really put in the time instead of minimizing and going to get a burger a much bigger threat and use.
8/15/2011,supported
8/15/2011,"with the addendum, ""no good features left behind"". you know, just to be precise here. we wouldn't want all those mt for sp winners to have their way."
8/15/2011,bump.
8/15/2011,yes
8/15/2011,i see no reason why not.
8/15/2011,"i agree with you entirely, clothing and eye wear are only worn in stations -- however the monocle is neither of those. described as an implant/prosthetic in its very own description it visibly causes deformation to the socket. so why should one implant survive and not the other? one could say that the character simply removes his prosthetic -- and handicaps himself for flight -- only to dock and plug in a different one (not very hygienic) provided by the next station (otherwise it would be in cargo)... it just doesn't add up... let them burn! ""this isn't hello kitty online""!and the whole 'no podding' arguement is... yeah..."
8/15/2011,"agreed that it doesn't 'add up'.but not much does. (uh, how did my medical clone get halfway across the galaxy in just 1 sec?) sure, you can go pull the jovian/concord wildcard on us here, but then the same arguement can be made for the monocle. it costs so much because it comes with a lifetime talocan/jovian warpvortex, and runs on the same interbus network as med clones transporting does. storyline explanation done.but speaking more practically, nex items are supposed to be a vanity sink for the isk rich. it won't make much sense for ccp to introduce this new sink, only to 'sink' (pun intended) it by allowing them to be lost in podding. it would simply result in no more nex purchases. (or at least, a lot less, given the new risk/reward ratio if they were able to be lost)"
8/15/2011,"arguing for an exception with an exception certainly does serve to illustrate how they are both highly irregular exceptions, thanksprops for writing lifetime talocan/jovian warpvortex with a straigt face, if you did. flying around with only one eye hadnt been resolved, but i suppose we dont really use them in the pod, huh? agreed, but i think this new direction ccp has been taking is softening eve from the original callous marauding we know and love! after all, the initial message from ccp was that they were going to be destructible, right? (i need to fact check that, too)also note that i was only discussing the monocle, an item which describes itself as an implant, not clothes or anything else although i do have problems with the whole every station has every item for every character magic"
8/15/2011,"welp i've already run out of fittings even after basically starting from scratch back in may.and yes anyone who pvp's with any regularity in anything resembling a variety of ships will easily blow past 50 fittings. also the advantage of the fitting tool isn't to save your fittings of course we have eft for that. it's to make it easier to fit as well as share various fits about. say i'm out doing my rvb thing and i just blew up my last punisher, all i had to do is assemble a fresh hull activate it browse to the fitting i want and click fit. a few seconds later i'd either have a fit ship or a partially fit ship with a list of what items were missing. fill in the missing slots group guns add ammo and off to the races. no digging through your inventory looking for that module you needed no trying to figure out which item was missing so you could buy another. just quick fit and go.it was particularly handy for funky fits that i'd only use occasionally but really wanted avalable when they were appropriate. oh and to add insult to injury they removed the ability of the fitting tool to fit friggin rigs which means now even for the 50 fits it will let me have i now have to hunt down the rigs and fit them manually. wtf is up with that bs?like i said i'm already at 50 fittings (and had to delete a few to get a couple new fits i wanted) and i'm about to add the t2 gal cruiser line up in 11 days then 16 days after that it will be amarr then caldari (ok only going to have one fit from that one).i can fly 138 ships already and will soon add another 21, many of which it would be handy to have multiple fits for different purposes available.raises my blood pressure every time i think of this bull****.where the hell is ccp on this?"
8/15/2011,it didn't start that way. but you or op should have searched the forum before posting yet another sp cheat thread. the fact that you didn't is the reason why people are rude to you.
8/15/2011,posting this you know that you would be trolled by everyone...also you know that this is the only thing you cant sereously sugests...becouse ccp already had allot of headache and players leaving just becouse 1 dev sugested the possibility...so...no...can i unsuport the idea?
8/15/2011,"i don't support op's idea, but i do support this counter proposal.incase you live under a rock, this idea was brought to attention few weeks ago with the leak of the ccp magazine. to sum it up, people thought they were going to let people buy an advantage in eve. pretty much everyone, including myself, went ape **** over this. it's a horrible idea. not even wow or any other game that has buy item features instead of paying monthly subscription that i am aware of has the feature to buy levels with real money.one needs to realize that not everyone has rich parents to give their fat loser kids to buy everything. a lot of us have jobs and other **** to pay, so paying extra on top of the monthly costs for a game isn't really something for everyone. then again, if the op and anyone agreeing thinks having more sp makes you better, you are sadly mistaken. i have 110mil sp, and i know for a damn fact theres plenty of lower sp players that could easily take me on in a 1v1 fight."
8/15/2011,"because when you buy a character, it comes with a choice history. not only the choice of what skills it trained, but to what level. what you and the op are asking for, are ways to avoid having to make those choices. you want instant sp and skill level gratification, that is what we are against."
8/15/2011,go play a free mmo. this is the dumbest proposal by far.
8/15/2011,"ps, i didn't bother responding to your other post because you were wildly going off topic (you admittedly like to argue) and if i didn't have a full time job making tonnes of real money, i may have had the time to fully expunge your points. i still can, if you insist, but i don't think it will really pertain to this discussion anymore. you will no doubt declare victory by my refusal to retort, and if that is what makes you happy then go ahead and declare victory. :) but, to your point above, i would like to appeal to your common sense here, you do agree that real money is an advantage. it sure is, and good on you to notice it. but keep in mind that there are a lot richer people in the world than you. (i'm making an educated guess here, given my impression of your age range and education, feel free to correct me by posting your tax return statements) and you know that once you start down the dark path of rm for sp then you are going to get swamped by people with lots of money, lots of time, and willing to start a goonswarm-like tactic of insta-equipping 100 noob alts with stealth bombers or battleships to gank your butts to kingdom come. and it would be possible because of sp for rl. and this doom fleet can be made in 1 day and thrown away. heck, i know a lot of people in rl who would throw away $1000 a night for fun. why not blow that cash to total pwn some geeks on this game called eve online? be careful what you ask for. for every 'legit' player like you who just wants to 'catch up' in the game, there a 100 rich bastards in real life who just love to poop in other people's cereals, just for laughs.it all boils down to this, if you make this a game about real life money, then you are putting a big part of the gaming population in new eden at a disadvantage to anyone in real life who happens to have more money. these people may not really care that much about the game, and not represent a large part of the 'contributing' community. you then remove a big part of the game, and replace it with the meta game of real life economic worth. and friend, i really don't think you really want to do this as much as you think you do. :)and once this meta game is allowed, then what happens when meta-meta games like when all the money made from selling wow characters from china farms are used to built uber insta-fleets in eve? or if blizzard decided to run a eve whispering campaign, by paying its employees to buy up sp'd eve characters (called playwowinstead[0-99]) and start a ganking campaign in jita and highsec in order to frustrate new players. meta-gaming is bad.still not supported."
8/15/2011,i very strongly support bookmark improvements.
8/15/2011,better bookmark transfer and management! also sub-folders!! =d
8/15/2011,"i like this idea. it'd be nice if there was a way to simply send them to people. i mean, if my laptop irl will let me right click and e-mail files to someone across the world, why can't my ship in eve send a set of coordinates to someone else without me having to hand them a hard-copy printout that they have to punch in by hand into their computer?"
8/15/2011,"how about a pos module that requires both a strategic and industry upgrade that allows you to change high end ore to lower tier?obviously a 1:1 ration is ridiculous, but i'm sure you've got enough number crunchers to make it worthwhile.of course, you could also just increase the amount of low-end ore in the sov belts."
8/15/2011,"it seems to me that ccp is aware that they cannot increase the complexity of mining low end ores for three reasons:1. they're trying to make the game more noob friendly, rather than less.2. making mining too hard for bots and/or afk mining would destabilize the entire eve market at this point.3. some dev also said that they want a semi-afk-drunk thing for players to do, and mining is their current option."
8/15/2011,"keep mining the sameadd new shipsadd new modulesmore demand = better pricesban bots.people wouldn't care about mining being boring if it made more isk, hell, if mining was 3 times as profitable as it is now i would be doing it right now."
8/15/2011,"there is an option to lock containers in space, why shouldn't there be an option to lock ships. but there should be a chance that it could be hacked. like the other players said it is space. the skills should be maxed out for ship hacking, and the proballity should be low since it is far more expensive than just rock or salvage."
8/15/2011,"they already have that...as for op's idea. i like the idea and for it, though like other people said, it should be hackable and be easier to scan then it would if the pilot were in it. this is a great idea and i would love to start hacking and taking empty ships in space. lol"
8/15/2011,"my problem with this answer is that some ships cannot be ""stored"" in a pos either.it would be nice if ccp provided a solution for stashing personal ships, because even with a pos (short of every person having their own tower), there isn't a mechanic in the game right now. locking ships isn't really the answer though."
8/15/2011,"you are just noticing this now? i thought that we already went over the problems with this when the point of chain reaction blow ups at jita. wardecs have little to do with it. there will always be bystanders. you either treat them like smartbombs launched by the final blower or don't count them as aggro. both have problems. the first will add a loophole to wardec'd players with human shields, the latter will result in many innocent deaths at station gates. nobody has yet proposed a sufficient solution to this. let me try, make it no aggro from the final blower, no aggro from exploder, no killmail prize to anyone, but make starting aggro within 20km of stations concordable. even with a legal wardec due to danger to innocents. this includes self destructs. you will get sec penalties. next, make sure that the damage from self destructing ships that are cheap and replaceable can't even destroy a rookie ship, to avoid mass grieving."
8/15/2011,"you are just noticing this now? i thought that we already went over the problems with this when the point of chain reaction blow ups at jita was brought up. wardecs have little to do with it. there will always be bystanders. you either treat them like smartbombs launched by the final blower or don't count them as aggro. both have problems. the first will add a loophole to wardec'd players with human shields, the latter will result in many innocent deaths at station gates. nobody has yet proposed a sufficient solution to this. let me try, make it no aggro from the final blower, no aggro from exploder, no killmail prize to anyone, but make starting aggro within 20km of stations concordable. even with a legal wardec due to danger to innocents. this includes self destructs. you will get sec penalties. next, make sure that the damage from self destructing/exploding ships that are cheap and replaceable can't even destroy a rookie ship, to avoid mass grieving. fixes station gaming too griefers will hate this."
8/15/2011,"make a t2 probe that can detect cloaked ships, also make it realy weak that it would take a couple of minutes to have a 100% lock. or make the cloaking device reduce the signature of the ship to have this effect, also greatly increases the probing time. so you would be able to take down the afk cloakers and keep the active cloakers moving."
8/15/2011,"i have heard a good suggestion for another t2 destroyer or a module that only fits the destroyer to find the afk cloakers. (best solution would be to cause a decloak if scan is successful forcing another scan with combat probes) this would be quite fair in implementation in my opinion if the cost in skills and module is high to prevent abuse to find legit cloakers who are not afk.edit: to clarify on the decloak. i have heard that one of the reasons afk cloaking has not been removed is due to how cloaking is implemented. thus my guess is the best solution is a find on a random point in space causes the module to switch off and go into a short cooldown. this will not stop a marco from just recloaking but then it is as easy as clicking ""report bot"" to fix that. this would not affect those who are legitimately using the cloak due to the time it would take to find this point. the warning would help those who are doing activities such as spying on pos structures so they have time to move before the cloak fails.i would not mind having to move probes for an hour or have to train for months to do so. if i have a chance against someone who is afk i will gladly do the training and get the isk to get that trophy.that would make afk cloaking not an exploit but a risky maneuver because you wont know if someone will bring in a stealth breaker to find you.hell, give the cloakers one more advantage with a message popping up saying ""cloak will soon be compromised"" remove the incentive to go afk and we can talk.i am not against tactics such as logoffski or cloaked intel gathering or quick attacks against idiots not checking local that are legitimate uses of the cloak. what i am against is the exploiting of the fact that cloaks don't time out and be able to do other things outside of game until the enemy just cant spam dscan or sit at the pos anymore.you should never be able to get virtually free ganks or free effect by not being active in the client. if you cant bother to turn your cloak back on before the enemy finds you. you deserve to lose your stealth."
8/15/2011,"it already isn't an exploit.cloaking up is a legitimate use of the cloak, that's what the module is for. you might as well campaign against people making use of the advantages of shield hardeners by using them to mitigate incoming damage from npc's for exploitative farming where their ships don't blow up."
8/15/2011,"proposal:make shield hardeners randomly overheatmake turrets randomly jam and require a repair in order to turn back onrequire fuel for all shipsmining crystals explode and have a chance to destroy the ship using them if they are not swapped out before expiring, mining crystals can randomly overheat and need a coolant injection to bring them down to normal safe temperaturesmake shield modules randomly fluctuate signature radius bloommake npc's randomly call in backup that can instapop your ship but give you a 3 second warning messagerandomly log players out of the game to make sure they aren't just idlingall this will make sure people are at their keyboards and pushing buttons and looking at the screen.this will stop people exploiting the easily killed npc's and easily mined asteroids in the game."
8/15/2011,those suggestions belong in another thread. not one about the afk cloak exploit. also note ccp plans for winter 2011. more changes than possible cloak changes will come ya know.
8/15/2011,it's possible they will give us flower picking and wild snakes.
8/15/2011,you are becoming very boring and not very constructive in the discussion.we already know that you are opposed. constantly seek to be right is useless. we would also hear the opinions and suggestions from other players rather than doing call and response with you.
8/15/2011,"now cloaking devices are almost completely useless. can i have the sp i spent on recons, bombers and blockade runners back please?picture this (real scenario). i'm hauling a ton of stuff around in my viator. i jump into a system with a large red gatecamp on the gate i want to use, as shown by my dscan from a safe off grid from the gate. i sit there cloaked up and go to make a sandwich, watch a movie, play a better game etc and wait for them to leave. why is this an exploit? with these magical probes, they'd find me and kill me just as fast as they would if i was flying an itty v, so there's no point in ever flying my blockade runner again. why is this a good thing?"
8/15/2011,"i'm sorry but this thread talk about fuel and charges on cloaking devices with 4-6h of autonomy. ""magical probes"" are on an other thread.anyway if you move your ship cloacked and be active in game, they can't find you with probes too."
8/15/2011,"but that is easily defeated with macros.anyway, are you a supporter of the other proposal where the game would pop up with a ""are you still there? please click ok if you are, otherwise you will be logged off in 10 min"" if you have not clicked on a key in x amount of time?just wondering."
8/15/2011,"macros can't defeat it.. 1) the charge should be fittable only with fitting tool (pos, station)2) a ship can store only 4-6h of fuelwhat macro can work here?macro instead can press the ok button every x minutes (a simple mouse click on x,y coordinate every x minutes)"
8/15/2011,"you are avoiding answering awkward questions. that's pretty damning and not at all constructive.the whole point of finding issues with bad idea like yours, is though back and forth discussion of the facts. something you have shown to have problems with so far.until you start being honest and face the question asked, you can't take the morale high ground."
8/15/2011,"please read again. (sorry if your native language is not english)my point on the ""macro can defeat this"" statement was against your statement: in that i meant that any mechanic that tried to detect if you are active in the game can be defeated by macros.anyway, i think we misunderstood each other.but back to the point. no, i don't want to have to buy/carry fuel just for my cloak, not to mention the fact that cargo space on my brunner is tight already. i really don't want to make it half way into nullsec to find out that i am running out of cloak fuel. all just because a couple of miners in null don't have enough friends to organize a gate lockdown."
8/15/2011,"i like the idea, if they want to grief, then make it cost something. there's always a risk or cost to everything in eve. with afk cloakers, it's none. people are going to want to rat in null, hence the purpose of moving out to null. if someone wants to move out to null for the sole purpose of sitting in station because they don't know if the person is afk or not, is kinda stupid. sure sure, i know it's part of the risk of living in null, but then again, wheres the risk for the cov op pilot? i think the pvp in null should actually focus on that, player versus player. not a 2nd account running 23/7 all paid for by plex for the reasoning it gives players a so called ""tactical advantage"" i've heard these arguments forever, and quite a few always say doing this will kill the desire for cov ops, if that's true, then i hope it does because if one is to believe a cov ops only effectiveness is to give the illusion of pending trouble, then there is a much larger problem that needs to be solved."
8/15/2011,"@shahfluffers- ok. i am confused. afk means 'away from keyboard,' not 'away from komputer,' right? anyways, i am a highsec carebear. to get me out of 0.5 space requires a lot of courage on my part. so i might not 'get' all of your meaning on the subject, "
8/15/2011,"you're right. i misunderstood.i understand that the fuel or charges can be a nuisance..i live in a 0.0 system where a pirate with 5 account stay online 24/7 with cloacked stealth bombers attacking randomly weak ships or destroying drones with bombs. he stay afk all time e sometimes attack us. we can't change system because we pay a rent for that system only.for now he has not destroyed any vessel.. we are stronger e well organized, but this harassment is very annoying because we can never find its position. and even if we destroy his ship, he would return more bitter than before. it is probably a crazy sick player because 0 kill in 2 months.what is the line between rpg and harassment? we only ask a tool or a fix to counter this type of behavior. ask is a right, even if the ccp answer is no."
8/15/2011,"asking is indeed a right. but it has to be in a factual and honest way, not a dishonest and emotional one.local is being changed, the search for player ideas on this is already taking place. the issue with cloakers showing up in local has been in ccp's mind since 2007 and more than likely before.the thing is that you basically can see that he's there, even though he's in a covert ship. but that's not enough for you, because you also want to be able to decloak him. (one could argue it's actually more info than you can handle, hence this thread)"
8/15/2011,"just to clarify, the problem that people are mainly complaining about is the possibility that a cloaker is just afk. because there is no way to tell if he/she is afk.fortunately... the arguments are fairly weak to support enhancing gameplay around this subject. the best argument i've seen towards this is that they can safely sit in a hostile system... unfortunately, the times i've seen this argument in lpay, it was hidden within a butt load of qq. /end facts."
8/15/2011,i'm so sorry but i don't want decloak nobody. i ask for a solution that force a cloaked pilot to play and don't sit in system 24/7 cloacked. macro can avoid afk on/off implementation so i thinked something that a macro can't handle. active player will be safe as now.but ok.. ccp will never change cloack devices. i've tried.ccp says local is being changed. are you sure that will be something like wh systems? i hope (and think) will be more sovereignty oriented.
8/15/2011,except that once something is changed that forces someone to use a macro if they want 23/7 safety cloak. then the solution will be the report bot function. not graceful but it works.the probe decloak system would be very very difficult to use. you cant use it to get a gank on an experienced cloaker who is in front of the pc.and yes ccp will fix this. it is nowhere as simple as the concord buff so they need time to do it. and good suggestions how. you cant target the legitimate uses of the cloak. just remove the incentive to walk away logged in a hostile system.
8/15/2011,"heh... i was a tad bored when i wrote that post. saying ""komputer"" rather than ""keyboard"" was mildly amusing as i knew it would slightly tick off the op and his/her ilk.to the meat of your post... this whole thread is in reference to what goes on out in 0.0 to -1.0 security systems. and yes, your sentiments mirror what i was trying to get across."
8/15/2011,"i would rather the ai be upgraded, the number of npcs decrease, and the payouts be rebalanced based on the increased difficulty of killing npcs. especially in lvl 4 missions and null sec belts. if ccp wants to break up some of the bots, make ratting/missioning require a little brain function so a script can't replicate what a human should be doing."
8/15/2011,"so would i, but as mentioned it is not likely to happen any time soon. we started asking for global sleeper ai the day worms came to eve but since they apparently take quite a bit more juice from the servers it is just not plausible (yet).any sort of predictable/scripted mechanic can and will be botted to death, if on the other hand you go in the direction they took officer spawns you exclude a majority of solo activity .. its a nastily fine line, one i think my proposal is able to dance on."
8/15/2011,"op, just curious, is there another problem that you are trying to solve for here, that cannot be solved by a tackler?your proposal is better thought out than most on these forums, but i hate to support something that doesn't actually solve a problem with the game as it is. ccp is busy enough :)edit: and one more thing, if supercaps is what you are after, then make it only gimp supercaps. makes no sense whatsoever to make big general gimps to address a small localized issue."
8/15/2011,agreed
8/15/2011,good idea! supported!
8/15/2011,hm....it could just be good.
8/15/2011,"when you place an stractor head over other player's stractor head it gets the interference, but you can't notice it on the survay until it is assembled, when you notice that you are not stracting with some heads. so i sugest that the level of interference apears on the survay.i know that allot of nem planetary stuff will be introduced allong the dust514, possibly planetary's region sov and other structures but for now i still dislike dont having this interference information."
8/15/2011,im using dual monitors but i think the real problem is not being able to move the login screen or the combat notifications
8/15/2011,"i'm not necessarily opposed to the original proposal, but i'd also prefer that this information be rolled into the ship scanner module."
8/15/2011,"thumbs up for the signature radius column and mass column, if would be great for the wh fleets comanders..."
8/15/2011,"what they will or will not do we can not debate, they can only decide that for themselves.what we can do is try to come to an understanding from all players and csms of what their intended purpose is. the current csm is acting with an intended purpose very different from what many players, many voting players, had understood previous to the current term.i would argue that we can only hope that ccp clarifies this point before the next election: is the task of a csm to represent those players who voted for them, or all eve players?no amount of voting or not voting will do any good at solving that issue."
8/15/2011,"the one thing ccp should at least change in their csm election method is that it should no longer be possible to cast votes per account.ccp has to change this into 1 vote per player no matter how many subscribed accounts he has./extreme, csm-2"
8/15/2011,"that's a dumb idea, and not feasible.its dumb because people with multiple accounts are more important customers to ccp, and therefore should get a more proportionate say. its infeasible because accounts aren't tied to any identifying metric because you can create trial accounts and pay for them with plex."
8/15/2011,it may sound dumb to you but csm is the council representing the player base.when you speak of a player base you speak of single persons not the number of accounts a player may have.fact is that if it stays based on the number of accounts a person have then the number of votes a councilor will have should be worth a number of votes within the council. say that the chairman has gotten 5000 votes and the 9th councilor only 1000 votes.the chairman should then have 5 votes against the 9th councilor with only one (based on 1 vote per 1000 votes).i don't think such will be wishful by the player base and so the election vote system has to get a major change.i have enough ideas on how csm election should be changed but i leave it up to ccp.
8/15/2011,"this isn't a democracy you dumbass, its a business.as to the rest of your gibberish i had no idea what you were trying to say."
8/15/2011,"you are naming people dumbass probably because you think you are very smart right? never mind commenting as somehow you getting off on being rude, probably have a bad real life or something.have a nice day!"
8/15/2011,say goodbye to your rocks crybabies.
8/15/2011,dream on nullbear
8/15/2011,"how about have the empires tack the living *snip* out of everyone (basically what they are doing: scc) and make nullsec tax-free?or force a concord-tax?or how about changing the way ships are scanned to reflect reality a bit better, and get rid of the insta-id (iff) we have?allow 'roids, planets, stars, and stuff to scatter/distort/shadow-image/absorb/etc. scan-results, especially if you shut down & drift.would give cloak a special, role geared more toward flying through blobs, etc.i mean, there are many ways to make this work.from my submission you can probably deduce that i don't play all that often, and that i'm getting the dynamics all wrong. that's because i'm a casual player that usually has no time to play, but every once in a while when i do get back into it i still sometimes feel as if we're stuck in a big nicely-animated mtg or rock-paper-scissors game. this beats that, all beat something else, etc. nature tends to be a bit more iffy, sand-boxy, chaotic. as long as we are playing an arms-race, those with the most isk &/or time will get the most <U+FFFD>ber1337 setup/team and keep the passive, peaceful (many, but not all carebears) out of null. add uncertainty, and many will slip by.or something like that."
8/15/2011,that's always the risk floppie'...
8/15/2011,"so what's is the incentive that you are proposing to make more people move to nullsec? if the incumbents have a stranglehold over nullsec then the only route you are offering is to become a peon of the mighty overlords. right? why would anyone do that when they can be their own boss in hisec or whs? ah!! i see, the plan is to make hisec and whs so unattractive that people start to think ""bugger this for a lark, i'm off to 0.0, where men are men and i can boost someone else's ego"".so no carrot just stick. err, no thanks i'll stay my own boss of my own corps, poor thing that it is, it's still better than being a tiny cog in someone else's machine."
8/15/2011,"sorry, i missed that. are you saying that because a majority of the players in eve (i'll take it as given that the majority of players are in hisec,) are unrepresented, that this is a good thing?i'm sure that the baath party in syria will love having support for their current stance."
8/15/2011,"waves of love? ya that would be nice, but i see more of this."
8/16/2011,"thanks for your input! i respectfully disagree, two lines per ships means double the screen cluttering. while i see your point i think that the drawback is more than the advantage. consider that to make out the 3d-2d projections, you just have to move the camera a little bit with the right mouse button.on the other hand it could be a menu option."
8/16/2011,supported!
8/16/2011,"nothing to add, great idea."
8/16/2011,he mentioned something about counter-intelligence. i think he is doing a fantastic job of demonstrating counter-intelligence in this thread.trolling removed. zymurgist
8/16/2011,"how wasn't it about stealth or changes to it? keep it to yourself. i just said as long as we have a much bigger underlying problem, a small detail like afk cloakers isn't worth sh*t, like the work of creating and balancing new modules just to give diapers to those who feel eve-pants aren't comfortable enough. well played :d"
8/16/2011,"it's all about local. without local, afk cloaking would be pointless as a psychological warfare tool."
8/16/2011,you do realize that u just pulled that out of thin air right ? there's been no details whatsoever about how nullsec intel will work.
8/16/2011,"i'm going to toss out some ideas for both sides here.local is powerful, but it does have story precedence. every stargate has the records of who has jumped in. that so much is public knowledge. so local is not some omniscient 'immersion breaker'. you get that info via your neocom via the fluidnet. that's why w-space doesn't have it, there are no stargates to record entry and exits, and no stargates to perpetuate inter-system fluidnet.now the destroyer idea is interesting (though not new), and actually may be doable. must make sure its balanced, and requires a lot of skills to get good enough to find cloakers, or use the modules that can send the tach pulses that will reveal cloakers. it has precedence as well, destroyers have little purpose these days, except as cheap non-noctis salvagers, make a new class of destroyer and have them be the only ones that can fit this new mod.the mod should not decloak a cloaker. it should only make a cloaker visible to combat probes. cloakers should be able to see the use of the pulse as 'fluctuations' in there cloaking device. they can decide to warp away, which makes the task of actually locking down a active cloaker very very hard, requiring a good prober working with a 'stalker' class destroyer, or several, depending on the au range of the tachyon pulses.edit: this was proposed before, but i don't remember what happened to the discussion. often afk cloaker threads are so mired in troll/nooob/forum rage that all the sensible people don't even bother reading them.i'm still very neg on any cloak that requires 'fuel'. without people actively searching for the cloaker (with this new stalker class destroyer) then you should be able to afk cloak forever. also, i think you should be allowed to afk cloak forever in non-hostile systems. (people in this thread seems overly focused only on nullsec with sov systems, totally neglecting all the other kinds of systems in the game.) edit2: i'm not supporting this because the subject header of this thread offends me. it breeds dissent, division, and serves only to pit troll vs troll. there is nothing wrong with afk cloaking. so fundamentally, i cannot support this thread. but if somebody wants to start a new one proposing these new tools to help combat cloakers, i will support."
8/16/2011,support this... for a fee or for free? never mind...
8/16/2011,"great idea, also made it to the top in corp/ alliance management overhaul in crowdsourcing:"
8/16/2011,"i never used +5 implants, but if i fit my ship right and wanted those sweet pirate implants, spending a billion or two on them isn't such a big deal, after all podding is much rarer than ship kills.though i'd love to have a skill that would reduce clone jump time. from 24h to say 12h at level 5."
8/16/2011,"if you's would check, i post in a lot of the other threads that propose a idea like this. and a lot of other mmo's, have double xp potions, weeks, weekends etc to help close the gap from newer players and vet players, they do that so the game will survive and attract new players. i know several people who didn't start play eve and a lot more that quit eve cause of the sp gap. if this game is to survive, it needs something like this or will have a slow death. as more veteran players leave the game and the lack of newer players that leave the game after a little, this game will die and none of us will be able to enjoy this wonderful game. if people like you's have your way, this game is dead. say what you want, call me names all you want, you doomsayers will kill this game. eve needs something like this and some other things for it to survive. or the player count when we all log on will keep going down."
8/16/2011,"thanks for putting that so succinctly mag's. i couldn't have said it better myself, and lord knows i've tried."
8/16/2011,"<3 thank you mate, you're most welcome."
8/16/2011,ships should not require sp to fly so idiots can undock and lose officer fitted golems to 100k sp rifters.how about no-100000000/10
8/16/2011,"but what you guys / gals are not getting is, whether you buy a toon via the char bazaar or buy sp, either way you are buying sp. since you don't want to wait the time to train it. just this way, people get to keep their mains, which a lot want to do. and the day a faction fitted golem losses to a max sp rifter is the day i quit this game. that golem pilot would have to be a total idiot."
8/16/2011,here's an idea that might be a bit more palatable:sell attribute and skill point remaps.a lot of people (like myself) wasted a lot of skill points and remaps early on as we were learning the game. i'd trade a plex in if it meant i could remap 1-2 million sps and free up the skills i realize now that i never had a use for.six months from a remap? want to get one early because you wasted yours when you were a clueless noob? that'll be two plex.(prices are completely made up and certainly negotiable)
8/16/2011,"what you are not getting, is that this same tired argument (character bazaar) has been brought up and shot down a gabazillion times.please do read the other more mature threads on this very tired topic. there is one on the front page of this forum (as of this writing) so you have no excuse! :)editlet me google that for youmt for sp... again"
8/16/2011,any movement on this one yet or are ccp moving at glacial speed yet again like with the promised return of decent cap jump effects ? sigh 3 years later.
8/16/2011,it should be possible to make implant from a frozen corpse depending on his clone version.what do you think about that ?
8/16/2011,"thats ******ed, how about salvaging frozen corpses to get the implants back based on your salvaging skill."
8/16/2011,"i think we'd see massive-scale farming of sub-900k sp alts. 1 guy in a battleship with a smartbomb and 7 ""corpse salvagers"" fitted would be able to 'process' an arbitrary number of corpses limited only be the number of clients he could run.now on the other hand, giving a small percentage change to salvage implants from a corpse of a clone that died while wearing them - that would be awesome"
8/16/2011,"my philosophy on argument is that it is not a win-lose activity. it's an exercise in arriving at the truth, and ideally, two parties can arrive there with a smile on their face, without any hard feelings.eve is harsh, supposedly. there are all sorts of different kinds of players with all sorts of different advantages. even now, some of them are overwhelming. i'm not afraid to lose to someone with an overwhelming advantage, because i guess i believe that losing to someone with an overwhelming advantage isn't really losing at all.but, yeah . . . i agree. we disagree."
8/16/2011,"four pages, 111 posts and 3 supports. the math is simple."
8/16/2011,"why if anything like this is going to happen in the future, needs to be via a plex, so anyone has the option to buy one, not just the rich people irl. people already use rl cash as an advantage over others, buy 100000000 plex and sell them and buy what ever they want while others are trying to save up isk for something good. to be able to buy a super carrier or titan or get that faction bs pimped out with officer mods and go roam low sec. yeah, that's not a big advantage for them. (sarcasm) to me that is a much bigger advantage they will get then getting some sp via plexes. for most people, to get them lvl 5's done, getting another 2 - 5% on something isn't going to be overwhelming. but also, if something like this would ever be implemented, needs to be a limit, maybe like 1 plex = 1 month worth of training extra but only can do it 6 times a year per acct. o that someone can't get a max sp toon in a day p.s. and out of them 111 posts against and i know there is more then 3 for, but out of them 111, how many are the same people who keep checking this post to keep on bashing it???"
8/16/2011,"oh the irony. i agree with everything in this last post of yours. every statement. fancy that! that rarely happens for me. :)anyway, where the problem lies in this proposal, is that while losing to someone with an advantage is fine and dandy, if you make this a meta-game, then it's not really a game within its own system anymore, its a real-life game. not a computer game. and i think that most people play computer games expect a system that it treats all players fairly regardless of who they are in the real world. if you didn't want this kind of game, then you would be playing sports, or the stock market in real life instead of eve ;) so making a computer game a real-life game is a double-edged sword. some lessor games may do it (online poker), but they tend to be simple games with little depth, not mmos (or mmos with little depth :). in eve, a game and community that prides itself on being hard to 'earn' your place and status, this 'dumbing down' is not going to happen, unless ccp wants to kill it."
8/16/2011,holy fsck yes. let us drag them to chat windows to autolink them and i'd be back to w-space in an instant.
8/16/2011,"it needs to be said: just don't use it as an excuse to bring back the ""warp to 15 km if you don't have a bookmark"" mechanic. that just ensures that the people entrenched in an area have a significant advantage over everyone else who hasn't been given a set of bookmarks.the game has changed a lot since those days. there are other ways to catch people than being able to outrun them to the gate."
8/16/2011,mining lazers and strip miners already do that. but it would be nice to beable to retarget enemy ships with my mining lazers and strip lazers and use as weapons that they are too.
8/16/2011,"supported, generally. i like the new more customisable hotkeys, but the behavior of the modifier keys right now is borked as ****.in addition to the problems ms spank outlined in the op, trying to multibox across multiple screens is a royal pain in the arse. control will not work to lock a target if that window does not already have focus, so i'm having to tediously click on the client to gain focus and then lock something then vice versa when i'm doing something on the other client, annoying and time wasting. didn't take me long to unbind alt either.definately something for the bff team to look at again in more depth."
8/16/2011,"i've lost count of the number of times i look like a moron because i shot the gate simply because i released the ctrl key at the wrong time and gave myself aggression so i couldn't jump with the rest of the gang.well, okay it hasn't happened that many times, but enough that it's a problem. also, even multiboxing with windowed view causes the ctrl key to work incorrectly when selecting a new client window."
8/16/2011,"how about a docking mechanism that is anchored at a pos? it takes pg and/cpu, lock and unlock functionality can be controlled through roles in corp."
8/16/2011,"last i heard there were ships that couldn't be stored in the capital array. those are the ones i'm talking about. everything else can be docked, loaded, or stored to make it safe.the ship should definitely go neutral so that it could be destroyed, even in highsec. abandoned ships, locked or not, should be considered salvage and treated accordingly.and it should be hackable (though maybe the hack cycle should take significantly longer on ships, making them harder to steal)."
8/16/2011,this doesn't have anything to do with chain reactions. so i am not sure where that comment comes from. as for your proposal...it would work. the idea another person mentioned earlier was to limit the damage to a certain percentage. i was thinking of something along that line but making the percentage based on the mass of the exploding ship and then treating the explosion itself like a smartbomb or missile using the usual mechanics. not sure about not having any killmail prize to anybody...thats kind of unavoidable but after thinking on it the gcc should go to the last person to fire on the exploding ship. keep self destruct only capable 250 km off the gate. that way gcc could go to someone who self destructs but never on a gate or station. but yes i agree...any amount of damage that could ultimately destroy any ship with full shields and armor is too much.
8/16/2011,"well to me bystanders are bystanders. whether they get hurt by a chain reaction or just the initial splash, really is irrelevant. bystander damage needs to be treated as gcc on the aggressors, so we agree there. and self destructing in range of a station is counted as aggression. where gcc should go in a non suicidal case is up for debate. i prefer the final blower. as the splash damage is a result of their action. killmail we disagree on. we need to give no reward for damage from splash if the receiver of the damage isn't in the same gang as the primary target. (innocent bystanders). only if the damage is taken by a fleet mate or a player sharing a gcc or aggros flag (ie helping the primary target) should killmail be given to aggressors for splash damage kills. limiting percentage of damage by ship mass (receiver) makes sense. but we still need to make any splash aggro damage around a station concordable. why? because if not then griefers will just sit at stations and mass shoot all wardecd people for fun. pick a big enough corp to wardec life eveu and you have plenty of targets exiting jita at the same time. they can shoot at their war targets but if anyone is hurt on explosion, concord beats them for it. make this station 'concord safety' area 15km else people will use bystander human shields everywhere. this makes the only safe place to shoot war targets at gates( or deadspace) but at least there bystanders have a fighting chance to avoid unwanted splash due to random spawn, the 30 second cloak (which should make you invulnerable to splash) and you can time your incoming jumps not to be too close to others, unlike stations where you don't know when others undock. if you do get hit accidentally, and were damaged already so you happened to blow up, no killmail prize for the aggressors for the bystanders one again. no incentive fo causing collateral damage. unless the bystander was a ally of the prime target. bystanders naturally then should avoid staying too close to a ship being shot. same goes to fleetmates. within station zone, aggro will reduce. as bystanders can get aggressors concorded."
8/16/2011,"that is simple enough, remove the pilots of cloaked ships from the local channel list.bam, no more incentive to stay logged afk while cloaked.ccp, fix it naow pl0x!!!11"
8/16/2011,"please stop being dishonest. of course you want to decloak them, that's why you've set a time limit for the cloak in both your ideas.do you honestly think your idea wouldn't affect the active player? it would basically ruin covert ops ships.your ideas avoid the actual reason for afk cloaking and in doing so, ruining the active players game.but time is now getting shorter for the present local channel and we have yet to see what will replace it's intel function.but if this thread is any thing to go by, you and omgfailresearch won't be coping well with the change."
8/16/2011,"if someone can't hit the warp button when a window or message pops up warning of impenitent decloacking they deserve to be found and destroyed. because they are either afk, a bot, or plain stupid. bad things in eve."
8/16/2011,"wow yea, they can warp. that completely solves the decloak issue and yet again makes this idea viable even with the active player. damn you're smart."
8/16/2011,"6h charge / fuel / overload damage is sufficient for any mission in covert ops (8h is the same for me). do not ruin anything. also i'm not dishonest, because i don't decloak a ship.. but a distracted cloaker decloak itself."
8/16/2011,"6 hours is not any where near long enough for an active covert ops guy.you talk as if scouting and intel gathering is always about being there instantly, looking around for a few hours then leaving. guess what, you're wrong.your idea does a great job, of screwing up any reward for long term reconnaissance.also what? 8 hours is 6 hours? what?of course you ruin the module. you are basically restricting the proper use of the cloak, simple because you're incapable of dealing with a guy showing up in local.and you are asking for a system to de-cloak him, therefore you want to de-cloak him.you either don't want him to de-cloak with the timer or you do. so, which is it?"
8/16/2011,"a covert recon mission in hostile territory can very well take multiple days or even weeks without docking for sov nullsec or w-space.it is not always about finding a target to hotdrop a few minutes later, but learning the habits and active times of the population of an area, finding weak spots to prepare for a pinpoint strike or a large-scale assault.again, i still believe the best thing for all involved parties would be to just remove cloaked ships from the local channel list.those that only stay cloaked in your system to scare you into submission and prevent you from grinding will not do anything to you anymore.those that genuinely collect intel do not have to stay logged in 23/7 driving up their electricity bill just because the targets immediately know when they are being watched from local otherwise."
8/16/2011,"support the other idea, the one about a destroyer class that can make cloaked ships detectable by combat probes. this will work even if cloaked ships are removed from local (in fact, better! as you really don't know you have a cloaked ship, you need to actively look)it's a lot better than any cloak fuel idea. most of all the opposition to your idea here are coming from people who stand to get disadvantaged just because you have a little bit of discomfort. well, the right solution is not to make you happy while making many others unhappy. the right solution is giving you a tool to fix your unhappiness yourself, with effort on your part.tachyon pulse mods"

8/16/2011,may i bring the council this
8/16/2011,"currently the tutorial for beginners is unpolished and will eventually need to be renewed, in fact ccp is probably working on ideas and angles for the future of npe (new player experience) as we speak.i would like to introduce a rough draft for a new angle on the new eve tutorial (that is inevitably coming in the near future).the jovian capsules are limited edition, they are not produced anymore, they were a one time thing.the jovian technologi works flawlessly, but people still malfunction. which leads to problems connected to cloning and rebirth, which in turn leads to brain damage, one of them which is amnesia.the leaders and politicians in eve will have a new ""trend"", which is to recycle all the brain damaged and 'lost cause' capsuleers and give them a new identity and put them to work as workers (miners, soldiers, builders).as soon as a new player enters eve, he will have flashes of his future (glitch in the machine of the jovian technology). this is considered as a normal part of the recycling process.these flashes are short playable big battle scenarios. the purpose for these short scenarios is: to give new players in eve a taste of wide range of exciting ships and battles that are possible, and also the ""future vision"" that is shared by everyone in the game. so every time eve is coming out with a new expansion. they can introduce it to new players by letting them try out the new functions in the 'future flashes'"
8/16/2011,"hence why the csm should be disolved as it serves no purpose in a g-a-m-e! this isn't a democracy... it's a ****ing game. the csm should have never been created and should cease to exist as it serves only a few losers that not only have shown us they have little or no idea of the mechanics of the game, but also self serving *****es much like rl self centered politicians of the western world. this mentality does not belong in a game where people go to take a break from the real world."
8/16/2011,"if the players knew what goes on with the csm-they would be surprised. sometimes pleasantly, sometimes not. the csm actually works pretty damn hard for what we perceive as beneficial to the game, but our ideas and yours may be different as to what constitutes as beneficial. that being said, we look out for issues in hi and low sec, in addition to null and wh space. being elected to represent trolls, outlaws and criminals of eve has not stopped me from supporting many different hisec initiatives, many of which focus on gameplay improvements for such groups as: miners, industrialists, missioners, traders and couriers and ratters. the csm knows that gameplay improvements benefit everyone as a healthy balanced eve, means more fun for everyone and more subscribers and a more diverse playerbase. nearly everyone in the csm has extensive experience in all phases of the game and all occupations and strives to make improvements. while the rest of the csm may not like me, and even if ccp took a wary approach to someone who cheated in the election-everyone was able to look past that and make progress at the emergency summit. in short, we are already doing the things you seem to want and think we are ignoring. if people knew how demanding and at times tedious, the 'job' of csm is-i don't think there would be many people running at all for it. the vast majority of us spend so many hours a week working on csm related issues-it would quiclkly add up to man years if anyone was keeping track. d3"
8/16/2011,"then should what you are saying about how hard the current csm is working be true, and i reserve judgement on that until i see any concrete results; all i have to say is the communication skills of the csm are sorely lacking. six weeks from the emergency meeting and i have yet to see any minutes, i may have missed them, if so my apologies, but the delay in publishing the minutes of the first meeting was shocking. you do know that the minutes are supposed to be published within three days, don't you?"
8/16/2011,"mittens - you're a moron. please, go mine in a c1/c2/c3 wh and enjoy your express trip to hs.maybe, before commenting on w-space, you should try living there. it requires dedication and skill, unlike.. oh, i don't know.. paying sov. bills?"
8/16/2011,since when does spamming dscan constitute skill?
8/16/2011,same time the csm members opened their mouths and removed all doubt.down with the csm.remove the csm and incorporate a flash screen for every one to vote for upcoming changes upon logging into game.
8/16/2011,what is this i don't even....
8/16/2011,"since stealth bombers, recon ships, and cloaky t3s became the tool of choice for jumping w-space miners. d-scan doesn't have much value. i've met blackops fleets who exclusively roam wormhole to wormhole killing miners and pve ships."
8/16/2011,"six weeks ago i was summoned to ccp headquarters as active csm member to participate in an emergency meeting in reykjavik iceland. as last place csm alternate i had zero expectations of ever going to any of the meetings. i was somewhat active in the various communications channels afforded to csm, and did take time to read each and every official post and the reply's to them. this was fortunate as i had good understanding of the issues to be discussed. many of you know i was elected by the utilization of a combination of trolling, ganking and scamming as well as marked influence peddling. as a candidate elected by such methods, the rest of the csm and, i assume, the playerbase as well, had low regard for my candidacy. despite such low expectations, i did in fact, take my csm alternate position seriously. for the players who expected me to violate the eula, nda, or to be generally disruptive to the communications within the csm, i regretfully have to tell you it won't happen. i reserved my judgement of the csm and ccp in general, with regards to the csm's influence with ccp. i am very pleased i held back and did not display too much asshatery. after meeting many ccp employees and attending the emergency meeting, my initial low opinion of ccp,the csm as a body, and as individuals,dramatically changed. my initial assessment was indeed shortsighted, misinformed and premature.if the players knew what goes on with the csm-they would be surprised. sometimes pleasantly, sometimes not. the csm actually works pretty damn hard for what we perceive as beneficial to the game, but our ideas and yours may be different as to what constitutes as beneficial. that being said, we look out for issues in hi and low sec, in addition to null and wh space.being elected to represent trolls, outlaws and criminals of eve has not stopped me from supporting many different hisec initiatives, many of which focus on gameplay improvements for such groups as: miners, industrialists, missioners, traders and couriers and ratters.the csm does not, contrary to widely held beliefs ""focus solely on null sec issues"", and in fact addresses nearly every conceivable aspect of the game, regardless of location.the csm knows that gameplay improvements benefit everyone as a healthy balanced eve means more fun for everyone and more subscribers and a more diverse playerbase.nearly everyone in the csm has extensive experience in all phases of the game and all occupations and strives to make improvements to all sectors. while the rest of the csm may not like me, and even if ccp took a wary approach to someone who cheated in the election-everyone was able to look past that and make progress at the emergency summit to issues spanning all of new eden. in short, we are already doing the things many of you seem to want done yet think we are ignoring.if people knew how demanding and at times tedious, the 'job' of csm is-i don't think there would be many people running at all for it. the vast majority of us spend so many hours a week working on csm related issues-it would quiclkly add up to man years if anyone was keeping track for those that do not think that the csm is influential in it's dealings with ccp, i have to speak out and tell you-nothing could be farther from the truth. the tone of the meetings was mostly formal and on topic, without much banter and with seriousness displayed by all parties. ccp for their part-listened to us and i am glad to say progress was in fact made. the csm has stakeholder status and it was evident during the meetings that our collective opinions were taken at face value by ccp. tl;dr-the csm works hard to get players opinions out to ccp and ccp actually listens."
8/16/2011,"i really have nothing to gain by posting this, as it will likely cost me next years election. many people voted for me hoping i would just be disruptive and leak info from the meetings. to those who voted for me to troll ccp and the csm-do not despair, i did not let you down entirely. i did troll both groups effectivly. i gave the rest of the csm and a fe wccp guys a box of candy and for ccp so they always have a tangible reminder of what happened when they did not consult with us about nex pricing and the aurum scandal-to them i gave a golden monocle the monocle was made of from astronomical grade crystal, and was a focusing lens-with no magnification."
8/16/2011,don't worry darius we haven't forgotten you..
8/16/2011,"thank you for your serious response.words are great, walls of text are better!why don't we all settle down and respond accordingly. i personally prefer to take the ""pay attention to what they do, not what they say"" attitude. it's working for ccp thus far.i still support the idea of everyone in hi/lo-sec saddling up and riding down to 0.0 to clean house. but that's just a fanciful and delusional idea that will most likely never take place. i find most people in hi/lo-sec perfectly content staying in hi/lo-sec and leaving null alone. just wished this mentality worked both ways."
8/16/2011,"you had me right up until you started suggesting changes.it's really a great read on the whole ""i wanted to be a hero"" bit. and it's very true: eve right now doesn't reward heroes. i'd love to see a mechanic that created rewards for being the good guys. it would create an engaging pvp game even in highsec. it was also building a good argument about neutral rr needing to be fixed, then just dropped it.then you got all troll/crybaby and ruined what could have been a really good topic."
8/16/2011,"...you can. i did this morning.this doesn't exist. isk/m3 rises the rarer the ore gets. there's no imbalance on mining.also, belt npcs are a big part of pve ratting in low/null and a major source of income for non-miners.eve is an rpg. part of rpgs is the growth of characters and the gradual addition of skills and abilities. removing that so fundamentally changes the game that you'd lose more of the player base. i can get on board with some of that, especially the notion that defending yourself when attacked shouldn't get you locked out of anything. if i'm aggressed and cannot flee by warping, i shouldn't be locked out of a gate for simply attempting to survive.bumping as aggression is just silly and impossible to enforce. accidental bumps happen all the time."
8/16/2011,the death star webbed and scrammed the falcon :d
8/16/2011,i have some tings to outline in december to revolutionize hisec. not that they will be accepted however my own main occupation is in hisec. granted it is as a pirate and ganker though none of my issues i hope to table concern piracy though. i'd say more but between the nda and someone else in the csm stealing my thunder and taking credit for my work-i'll have to just bite my tongue. d3 the vast majority of these expansions get more players from hisec using the content than anywhere else in the game.
8/16/2011,"i still don't understand why people want to change much about highsec. after spending most of my first year of eve finding everything there is to do in highsec, i find it to be a good environment that needs little improvement and certain doesn't need to be nerfed. if anything i'd say most of the highsec-related changes need to be in regards to making the game more accessible to new players. right now there's a big gap between the tutorials and actual gameplay that leaves a lot of people wondering what to do next and ultimately leaving the game. most gamers i've talked to who have tried eve have left at the end of their trial because they felt like they were on their own and uncertain of what to do, not because they didn't like the game.let's revolutionize lowsec."
8/17/2011,...
8/17/2011,i agree. the destroyer idea is very good.
8/17/2011,"there is nothing wrong with active cloaking. afk is a completely different ball game but yes this destroyer idea would make things better by.a) with a very expensive modules that only fits on a t1 destroyer hull. it makes these craft useful in the game again. the t2 or another destroyer variant idea is virtually the same but i would like to see the t1 versions do more than salvage.b) giving a new dedicated ""job"" that can be hired out which enhances game variety.c) gives a fair balance to those who walk away (which now involves great risk) without seriously effecting those who are active in their clients.d) exposes bots when people who are cloaking 23/7 are reported legitimately for either botting or account sharing.now if i may to add further balance to protect active cloakers i propose that this new scan module works by finding a random point in space or puzzle which is generated every time the cloak starts.otherwise i see an exploit where people would just camp the area with probes at lowest setting making active cloakers life hell if not impossible. random point then bring in the normal probes if the ship is afk."
8/17/2011,it's also broken because i enter systems through wormholes and i still magically appear in local.
8/17/2011,you win. report to ccp and i guess they will get right on fixing that :)
8/17/2011,"so are you going to start a new thread, or do we have to continue this on this wrongly named subject thread?a) i disagree. t2 specialty class is better. interdictors are specialty ships, and these should be too. just because t1 destroyer should have a use is not good enough reason to break the model of special roles go to specialty class ships. t1's frigs, dessies and cruisers are for noobies anyway.you completely lost me with this puzzle/probe thing, tachyon pulse is a ranged pulse. i was thinking more like depth charge analogy. if hit, target cloak destabilizes, making them probable. they can reengage their cloak after some cooldown reset time.why don't you start a new thread. this thread is already troll heavy enough."
8/17/2011,the reason is an afk cloaker is not going to stand within range of an aof module. and much worse it would harm active cloakers. you want to target the afk aspect and little else.
8/17/2011,"you misunderstood my idea, it's a probe that sends out a aoe tach pulse. the module is just a launcher. but i'm not going to continue this on this thread. you have my ideas, you got the gist of it, distill it and post it as a sensible proposal. keep the flames and the accusations and the hyperbole to a minimum to keep the anti-whiner sentiment low. good luck."
8/17/2011,"oh yes please. i just had to buy a bigger monitor (27"" with low res) just to be able to play for more than 30 minutes at a time.i was also playing the game at launch in 2003 and had to stop after a few months, partly because i could not drive my irl car anymore. i have 20/20 vision, tested this year."
8/17/2011,"glad you still have your sense of humor. i don't use smileys frivolously, i expect readers to either understand sarcasm, or miss the joke.at this point though, it would have been out of character for you to miss any opportunity to 'make a winning point'. so i'm glad to see you in full paulize regala! so you seem to agree that there are exceptions everywhere, irrational game mechanics that just need to be that way for practical reasons like med clone mobility, we all accept them as is... but you persist on trying to rationalize implants, monocle destruction, and flying with one eye in your pod?why?this, despite having the practical reasons for nex item's invulnerability explained to you. regardless of whatever ccp may have 'said' (awaiting proof from you on this though) it's what their 'intent' or 'goal' which is the point. and making the nex fail can't be ccps goal.edit: paulize, is this why you want name changes so much? so that you can change your name and change your looks, and then people on these forums won't know who you are anymore? start from a clean debating slate? (j/k). in fact, if it weren't for ranka mei's name, i almost mistook her for a new person. ranka, nice new hairdo, very power-femme, u go grl."
8/17/2011,"nah, i was actually attempting to answer my own question here  im weak on lore, but i think i may have read somewhere that we dont use our physical eyes in the podalso too lazy and lacking in motivation to verify(drat, i cant express myself clearly even with the aid smilies?! never again!) ill accept the irrational part, but i dismiss practical as it is neither necessary nor rational. thus i propose -- that someone else proposes -- that med clone relocation be delayed till down-time at minimum! mwahaha!sill too lazy to verify that ah! um... hmmm... dunno... maybe i just like arguing with you! nah, the explanation hinged on the supposed failure of nex -- but i dont think one type of item being destructible is necessarily the end of nex (remember, im only arguing the monocle here because it calls itself an implant and visibly disfigures the recipient)meh, if theyre unique enough to spend that much on it once why not again! nah-hah-ha, i guess i just got a thing for lost causes -- but i do like this rep!"
8/17/2011,"personally i would never get a monocle even if i afford one because it would ruin my makeup.now custom manicure jobs though, when will they start doing those on nex?and once they get the station casinos open, i would like some nice evening dresses and jewelry to wear to my high stakes poker game."
8/17/2011,"exactly, even if you buy a character by plexing, the money you got from buying the plex was still generated in-game, its just changing ahnds, if you buy sp directly, your taking isk out of the equation and are making value appear out of thin air."
8/17/2011,too bad... i'm quite sure its happened... in-fact it happened about a year or 2 ago when someone bought a char with 2 rorquals... fully fitted... and tried to jam the thing through a stargate. the neighbors where quite thrilled and laughing so hard they barely had a chance to catch the 2nd one due to the fact they where in need of oxygen.so yeah... quit the game...because your obviously too foolish to think before you say such foolish things... jokingly or not... its happened in eve.. repeatedly... just wait for those killboard links to show up... i'm sure someone would be more than happy to slap you across the face for your ignorance.
8/17/2011,"whilst i understand that you may feel that you wasted time on training that you now feel you did not needi dont feel that ppl should be able to pay to move skill points aroundalso as your char grows and develops you will find that those skills will be usefullimo no training is wasted training, at some stage you will need those skills"
8/17/2011,"the ""bitter vets"" as you put it, have spent years paying for this game and have spent alot of time geting the skillsthats why they do have a lead over new chars, its time and effort put into the gameif you dont like that, then go play a game where you are instantly uber and will very quickly get bored of it"
8/17/2011,"i always thought this thread was a joke or troll, but i see some people are serious nono&no!!"
8/17/2011,"i for one think this is a smashingly brilliant idea!while we're at, let's add this module. it requires no fitting, and takes any slot. when you find yourself in combat, you can turn this module on. what it does is increases your dps. the module is tied to your credit card. you pay 1 cent per point of dps extra per second, meaning it costs a dollar per second for 100 extra dps. there is no limit to how much dps you can add. that way, you never have to think about combat again and can just engage whatever in whatever, because it's not like anyone wants to expend effort at this game.now, you said your idea would let people keep their mains because that's what most want. i got news for you buddy. that argument doesn't make sense. name one instance where someone was so poor they sold off their main account to support, uh, their main account? people sell off alts they've trained. anyone selling a character doesn't give a crap about that character anymore. ah, wait. i get your point. people are selling off their main to buy a better character, is that it? let's put it this way, the average eve player is no where near as lazy as you. they simply, aren't...may i ask, then, if you're going to give a crap about the game after you've bought this sp? methinks not. this suggestion entirely cheapens the game.but but the character bazaar omgomgomgomg!!!!!!!time and effort still goes into those characters, they actually mean something, even if its to the seller. tl;dr htfu or gtfo"
8/17/2011,"well think of the kb's and market according to you's, a bunch of noobs flying caps and faction fitted t2 bs's around that not know how to use them, bunch of easy kills for you bitter vets while the economy gets a big boost but seriously, why do you guys and gals think so many other mmo's have something similar to this in their game? so many don't start up a game that has been out for years cause of the gap between newer players and vet players. they simply go to another game that is new so has something similar to this already going. so if you pilots have your own way, most likely will lead to a slow death of eve online as barely getting any new players and the normal attrition of people leaving the game. p.s. you notice that most people favoring something like this usually speaks nicely without name calling and swearing (for the most part) but most of the people against it is always doing name calling and some swearing (for the most part). imo, that goes a long way to tell us the age and maturity of the opposing sides"
8/17/2011,"i'll take a slow death of eve over a fast death when much of the ""bitter vet"" player base leaves.also, a passive aggressive moral highroad argument? grow a pair and just call us a bunch of mudslingers. the knee jerk reaction that you're getting is because you are attacking the fundamental core of why so many people like eve - it's not an instant gratification game."
8/17/2011,"you silly noobs, mudslinger #36 here. i'm actually only a < 10m toon so technically still a noob by your standards. so why am i arguing for the veterans? because it takes less than 10 mil sp to do well in this game, it's real world experience that matters more. one of the selling points of eve. by the way, you do know the skill tree is exponential right? and everyone, new and old earns sp linearly right? so what that means for the mathematically challenged, is that the difference in ""skill"" quickly becomes less and less the higher up you go. you can't ever totally catchup to vets but you can get ever closer to them, i've heard up to 80% effectiveness. which really boils down to choices in which skills to train. a vet can spend the 3 months training for titan, in the mean time you overtake him in gunnery skills at the same time. if you are still thinking in terms of wow xp levels. stop. just stop."
8/17/2011,"um.... so hate in barge in on your steam, but if you read banner on the wall, it clearly says that this forum is for csm petitions, not ccp. if ccp reads this forum at all, is a blessing at best. sorry to waste all that precious steam you vented. try venting it on the features and discussions forum."
8/17/2011,"if you notice, with people like you complaining to no end about what ccp plans on doing, the number of people logged on when i log on is still slowly dropping. so if you keep doing it like this, soon eve will be dead. look at other mmo's, they have xp potions, double xp weekends etc, i know eve is not them or even played like them, but that is something they do to attract new players. so many won't start up a older game like eve cause of the sp gap. so unless there is a way to help attract new players, eve will slowly die and less and less will log on. so if we keep doing it your way, your dooming eve to a slow death. ccp is trying to do what other popular mmo's are doing and what works to help attract new players and to keep the ones they have."
8/17/2011,"though your argument is steep full of pathos, if only it were backed up by facts instead of anecdotal evidence. (1 player, noticing that less people log on at their times recently, does not a real trend make) if you would like to pursue this line of reasoning, please provide some evidence to support it that doesn't require the rational among us to 'just trust you'.anyway, i personally think that you folks are going about this the wrong way. perceived problem or not (and for argument sake, let's assume that their is a problem of subscriberships. it's irrelevant anyway), the problem here (and in fact, with most proposals here on forums) is that people try to solve their tiny problems with big big solutions. it's like killing rats in your house with rpgs. and they wonder why people don't support them. if you have a problem, you have to distill it down to its fundamental core, and them make a solution that addresses just that core issue, and not affect anything else. for this 'problem' making sp buyable is just plain ludicrous, and will create more damage to the game than good.if your problem is that players find it hard to 'get up to speed' when starting the game, then make some sp packages that are given to you as rewards for completing the training courses for the career professions, which are sp that you can instantly assign to select skills that have to do with that profession. just finished the industry training course? then you get 200k sp to put into industry skills. advanced military course done? then you get 200k to put into electronics or gunnery skills. simple. elegant. direct solution. i will encourage people to finish their training schools, and not be repeatable so you don't have abusers who can 'buy' up to a stealth bomber pilot in just 1 day of starting to play the game.if your problem is that you think that eve isn't fair because you can never catch up to people before you, then you really have to ask yourself, what does catching up achieve? there is no contest for who has the most sp. many many times already people in the game (who have played for a long time) have explained to you noobies that sp means little in terms of being a contributing player to a team, or having fun, or you being able to shoot down a veteran with more sp than you. (heck goonswarm proved it. google it!) if you still think that you will never get satisfaction out of the game unless you have more sp than your enemies, then go get a penile enlargement, buy a porche, or a harley instead, because the problem is your self esteem, not the game!"
8/17/2011,"all you have to do is look at the amount of people online when you go to log on, plain and simple, nothing fancy about that. like 6 months ago when i logged on, would be around upper 40k people online to lower 50k people online, now about a good 20k less people then that when i log on. atleast people like me is trying to solve a problem instead of trolling these threads saying we're all nuts. and how would you solve the problem of new players trying out this game and seeing the huge sp gap. sure you can specialize, but to be good at only 1 thing really limits the fun you can get out of this game. for most people, they like to be versatile and that takes time. or to say, hmm, today i feel like missioning, tommorrow i may feel like mining and a few days later i may want to pvp. that's literally how it is for me and my 3 toons i have. sure a lot of others are like that also. why so many other mmo's have something similar to this in effect now to help out with that and that helps them to get new players. and even a lot of vets in that game like it cause they get to train up alts faster and to get more people close to their level faster. so maybe instead of complaining about this problem, try coming up with a solution yourself or just be quiet. so many people who create threads like this don't do it to get ridiculed by people like you."
8/17/2011,except that the reason why there is so much less players is ccps continued attempts at introducing rmt.
8/17/2011,"right, and the number hasn't changed significantly for me. but that doesn't mean squat, which is my point. anecdotal evidence is anecdotal. ie does not pass muster. maybe i'm being too obtuse, but if you wanted to do that, then why wouldn't you just complete all the career training courses? are they insufficient? then why not propose ccp to add more that make sense? make them part of storyline mission rewards, etc etc? put the rpg away!the only logical reason that people argue for the rpg approach (lemme buy what i want!) is that they secretly just want to be 'kicking butt super cool' flying that cerberus, or hacking like a pro, or maxxed out their arty specializations immediately. which breaks the game dynamic."
8/17/2011,"it is summer afterall, online numbers are always lower in the summer. not that this accounts for the entire slump... but a lot of the vets are *still* ****ed about nex. funny, i ""specialised"" in t1 sensor/tracking links a week or two ""in"" (after the requisite 2-4 weeks of learning skills). had a great time with the (non-rookie) people i flew with at the time and the bonuses i could grant... yeah, they weren't much, but enough that the other guys could target a little farther, or hit something that was normally out of range or too fast to track... granted on one of the early forays into low/null, i got insta-popped by an assailant (which was painful) funny story, mission running and pvp use the same skills. you might need a few thousand ""extra"" for pvp though (mwd, point, webber), but it's not like you can't do different things every day.as for mining -> the frigates aren't *bad* at mining (yes, there are better ships... but they take time). l4 frig, and the l4 basic mining skills takes maybe a week (probably not even that). you'll be pretty close to mining as well as a barge (few per cent difference, tops).i'd say to become ""easily"" versatile in things takes about 4-6 weeks; where ""easily"" means skills in enough areas that they can give fair dps, have a fair tank, or mine a fair amount -- roughly l3 across the board, a few l4's here and there... probably no l5's yet.or, in that same 4-6 weeks, a rookie can be 80% - 90% as effective in one area as a vet (give or take, some areas will take longer ... skills and percentage based modifiers only. player skill only comes with time)."
8/17/2011,"some was due to mt, for sure, but the decline started, from what i saw when the anomaly nerf happened. that started it, then mt, then bc fell. sure by that point, thousands basically said screw this, especially with all the doomsayers about mt, omg, eve will die unless we get rid of all mt. saying so many worse case scenerios, kinda like 2012 and people making billions of the fear of others. is there some danger in mt, sure, but was a much better way of handling that and scaring so many who didn't know better."
8/17/2011,"@ li, this has nothing to do with warp to 15km this is solely about a horrible and obsolete ui code"
8/17/2011,"my proposal still allows for all those points to be ""as is"", bots can still bot and drunks can still procrastinate.my aim is to make mining in itself slightly more interesting (+realistic) and in the process give coordinated mining operations a yield advantage.does that mean that you are perfectly happy with ""progress"" made in this niche area of eve to date?because that is exactly what ccp has done, added ships and modules with no change at all to the mining part of the equation.hopefully the new ""report bot"" will have an impact, but i doubt it will as big as people think.the big price changes will come with the null industry revamp and if i have my way, the droves of aborted supers that comes with assembly arrays outside pos shields ..... but mining itself will still be niche, boring and 'beneath' most people."
8/17/2011,there is nothing realistic about your proposal. if/when we ever get around to mining asteroids (irl) it won't be by blowing them up. it will be by carefully extracting the materials we want. blowing them up would be a very very bad thing. consider how much we are spending trying to track the asteroids and how many we are missing because they are too small.
8/17/2011,"henceforth, there shall be a restraining order between the parties of: the acronym ""afk"" and the various synonyms of the word ""cloak"".these two distinct and separate words are not to be used within 3 words of each other, as they are too often associated together in a negative connotation.should anyone from this day forth use ""afk"" too closely followed by ""cloak(er/s)"" they will be assessed a 1mil isk fee.if players have a problem with cloaks, first realize they are the proper game mechanic to counter probes. the ability to hide is not a problem, it is a valid tactic.if players have a problem with other players being (a)way (f)rom their (k)eyboards, perhaps because those unattended computers will gain sentience and kill someone... said paranoid care bears need to embrace the spirit of eve online, coming to realize the only safe place is while docked in a station.there are far too many threads attempting to complain about players cloaking somewhere and then going afk for hours. while there is a strange face staring at you in local, that does not mean you are physically prevented from acting in the game.so quit your crying, and play the game! and stop making new threads! each has 200 responses, and less than 10 votes of support. this should say something about the public opinion."

8/17/2011,"the problem for me is that a modifier key is being used as an action key when that modifier key is being used elsewhere as a modifier key.this wouldn't be an issue if we could map ""lock currently selected target"" to some other key, and still have the ctrl+left-click to mean ""lock the target i just pointed at"".either it's a modifier key or an action key. it should never be both."
8/17/2011,"umm, no key will go to the client if the client doesn't have focus, that is the way windows works, welcome to multiboxing.anyway, old thread, they fixed this a week ago."
8/17/2011,no they didn't.
8/17/2011,"after reading some stuff about low sec, i've come across bounty hunting problem and got few ideas that i thought i would share before they get forgotten. some ideas are ""improved"" based on information i've found on this fine blog. some thoughts you might have heard, however after doing some of research i was not able to find workable solution.problems:all bounties are collectible by pirates alts or their friends.very difficult to hunt down and kill/pod solo.solutions:make bounty hunting a profession.each target should be requested from agent - like missions. one target could be hunted only by one person at a time (might be changed if there is lack of targets/activity). depending on skills, person should be able to request up to 5 targets for a limited time (skill dependent).hunting solo possible.each ship would be given special item that must be fitted to hi/mid or low slot. this item would have small radius warp disrupt effect for ""target's"" pod for a very short time. both skills would be trainable where lvl5 would give a good chance to actually lock the pod with even a bc in low sec. the effects would be also dependent on security regions. let's say there will be effect ratio from -1 to +1. to avoid ganks, pod warp disrupt effects will be decreased dramatically if more ships are engaged in attack.invisible bounty.targets to bounty hunters are distributed privately by agents. the amount of isk received upon termination is only visible to the hunter. the pirate would only would have a ""wanted"" sign on.extra information.each player that puts bounty can also put a personal message attached. like promising extra reward for this pirate's head (checking kill mail that its not been killed by nubship in alt, also provide all information available (possible/playstyle/anything..)extra information2.bounty office offers locators for free to all region with very little delay between searches. also history of activity and some other infoextra rewards.based on skills concord could offer extra up to 20% payout together with standing increase and maybe some other benefits to encourage bounty hunting. some federation faction stuff as reward after certain amount of kills. sky's the limit.protection from alts.despite long training times to be able to hunt more than few people at a time, despite ""decline hunt"" delays (~6 hours), there would be protection, that once you kill the pirate, you will have no chance to get another target from same corp and very slight chance to get a target from same alliance unless you kill other pirates from totally different, unrelated areas. meaning good luck organizing ganks on your main for more than 1 time. plus you will never know if trouble is worth it due to invisible bounty.collaboration between bounty huntersthere would be also availability to randomly assign a team of 2-4 people of bounty hunters to hunt some ""hardcore"" pirate targets. something like match making to provide help to get down the ""top dogs"". if bounty hunters are trustworthy you can always check their rankings and history. in the end there could be lvl5 hunts that requires teamwork. bounty ratings optionalhall of fame for the heroespossible new problems:possibly pirates will get overganked in their ships and podded in high sec, without noticing bounty hunter in the system (hunters should not be flashy reds to have a chance and element of surprise). oh look, i'm just another neut in the syste... surprise buttsex.there. i've tried to cover most important aspects on how i imagine bounty hunting would be fun. please post your feedback and i will keep editing article, adding your ideas or amending others. maybe together we can make a new beginning for a new profession.tl;drpirate gets ganked, pod gets killedcan't do with alts"
8/17/2011,"you may want to do a little reading before you spin off yet another bounty hunting thread.already donespecifically, the nil mortifi sine lucre document."
8/17/2011,"i did read the document and the forum thread. while some points are similar my approach is very different. the solution mentioned does not stop from their alts/friends podding them and also good luck getting a pod. successfully podding in low/high sec is almost impossible and if you need to bring bigger ship than a frig to kill your prey, you wont get anything but a ship kill at best.want to make bounty hunting a solo profession? make it super hard for pirates to escape. this also would require a lot of skill training and dedication for the hunter too if he wanted to be successful at what he does."
8/17/2011,"really? sorry, i'm calling your bluff, and saying you didn't because you obviously missed the parts on pg 3 paragraph 5, and page 4 paragraph 2.edit: kill rights allow you to pod in highsec without concord, that was the whole point discussed on the first page. so yes, it does handle the case of podding difficulty.seeing as you have already gotten a reputation for not reading a thread before posting (as evidenced in your post in the exploding damage thread) i'm more than 75% sure that you didn't really read the document.but that's okay, maybe you are just lazy.i shall paraphrase:-kill rights optionally must be approved by the bounty issuer before a bounty hunter can hunt a bounty.-bounties are paid in proportion to damage done to the target.you know that doc and proposal was written by 2 ex-csms right?"
8/17/2011,"maybe i was not clear enough so let me comment on below:1. by podding difficulty i've meant locking the pod before it warps away. if you use anything else than a frig, podding chances are next to 0. blowing just ship shouldn't be enough to collect bounty.2. i never said my ideas were not repeating. i wrote the flow on paper to show all the picture. there are some issues to the proposed system discussed in forums. i nearly try to give some additional though that might have couple of good ideas that could be used. p.s.regarding explosion thread. i've meant if you kill megathron with megathron and both are in hull, you know what is the outcome.. same can apply to bcs sig radius. and to blow batthleships on not moving afk smaller ships, sig radius wont help much will it?"
8/17/2011,i have five targets.one's in a completley opposite timezone to me.two are in deep nullsec.one's a station trader and never undocksthe fifth is in a titan.what do?
8/17/2011,"ye sure, lets **** up blaster boats even more. i imagine pvp situation if you manage to kill bs yourself being deep in hull. now would that be something?i would personally gather all alliance with 10% hull battleships and let one guy selfdestruct. imagine chain reaction on 4-4."
8/17/2011,2 things people are not reading.#1) it does dmg based on sig radius....so no tacklers will not all die.#2) the damage done would be less than a smart bombing battle ships getting a few pulses off. if i want to gank you in high sec with aoe dmg there is far far more effecient and practical ways of doing it than suciding my own ship.these are the main concerns raised and they are somethign to be balanced out. the concept of this mechanic is sound.
8/17/2011,i don't see how this will be a problem for blaster boats at all. typically the larger the ship the larger the range even with blasters. the smaller the ship the faster they are so they are a lot less likely to get hit and even if they do the damage will be a lot less. the explosion radius doesn't need to be all that great either. 7.5k...maybe 10 unless we base the explosion radius on the size of the ship as well. most blasters if i am not mistaken fire well out of that range optimally. might be nice to see capitals have an explosion radius of 25k or so...
8/17/2011,*bump*
8/17/2011,"i think you've mistaken eve with a feature complete game, rather than one that is still limping along on the novelty of 'spaceships!.... in space! (new!)now with people inside!(new!)'.how you can be so truely incompetent at coding that you require your customers to work around technical problems for you, rather then simply automating such things and/or just plain coding it better, is beyond me. yet ccp delivers.this is evidenced in many ways even aside from the case you present.ze clone jump-*pause training* <---programming fail*leave ship* <-------programming fail*clone jump**resume training* <--programming fail*enter new ship*ze +4 implant-*pause training* <---programming fail*inject implant**resume training* <--programming failso much herpderp in this game... why do i play... oh yeah cuz its free... meh."
8/17/2011,in my opinion the destroyer only module with long scan times with high skills to uncloak people who are afk is by far the most fair for everyone involved.if done right and warnings are given to those about to be decloaked. this will only affect those who are afk and not those who take the time in front of the client to do the damage.take the afk out of the picture. i am sure ccp knows this.
8/17/2011,how about they just log out players that are idle for a couple of hours or more. nag boxes telling you someone is probing out out is a really stupid suggestion.not that i care and afk cloaking is only a problem because players are risk averse cowards and can't operate in 0.0 unless they feel they have complete immunity.
8/17/2011,"the pirate says ""coward"" to the miner ... like the spider says ""coward"" to fly .. *facepalm*"
8/17/2011,"keep avoiding those inconvenient posts youth, it speaks volumes."
8/17/2011,no need for nag boxes. the indicator could appear just like one for scramming or damage indicator. the reason to have it so you dont suddenly decloak without warning in front of pos guns. that would be unfair to active cloakers. i want the afk to be risky not to active users.edit: the log out idea is feasible but i fear for effect on non cloaking activities. also i think the destroyer idea would add a new layer to gameplay and that is worth the time to implement in my opinion.
8/17/2011,"i don't think he was being serious with the log out idea. as its about as silly as any auto-logoff idea, for any kind of afk. afking is fine, this isn't farmville or punch the monkey. it's fine to be away from keyboard as long as you assume the risk that that entails."
8/17/2011,"well there has to be risk. and afk cloaking entails no risk as of this post. the expensive, time consuming, skill heavy destroyer module would put risk into going afk while cloaked. this would also protect those who are active and cloaking from other ideas such as fuel bays cuttoff timers and others that would do more harm to them.add risk to going afk. nothing else folks please."
8/17/2011,are you preaching to the choir? if i didn't agree with this then why did i post the last 3 posts that i did?big mod?you mean heavy expensive tachyon pulse probes right? the mod is just a launcher. finding the cloaker still needs to be a 'chore' not a walk in the park.
8/17/2011,"so what's the problem, if there is no risk?"
8/17/2011,"in keeping with the fact that monocles are strictly vanity items and have no direct bearing on the game, i propose that not only should monocles be lost in pvp, but that a vanity reward me made available to those who scoop out enough of them. through the nex store, one should be able to turn in 'harvested' monocles which may then may be made into a trophy, a wearable chain for example, or a sculpture for the cq. this way the vanity item stays in game and it becomes even more valued. (at least to the victor)"
8/17/2011,we all know they won't ever have mt vanity items be destroyed. no one would buy a $50+ monocle if it could go up in smoke along with their pod.
8/17/2011,"...and anyone that proposes so, and any that agree to said proposal immediately get classified as 'whiney have-nots'. having status is part of the game really, let the rich have their monocles, and wear them with style. with all the sp for mt thread nonsense going on recently, and the 'we can never catch up to veterans' poppy****, you would think that most would be glad that veterans are blowing their isk on monocles, instead of battleships, griefing noobies."
8/17/2011,"new players won't know the background for changes that was made prior to them joining, so it won't affect them.lowsec boosting, sounds fine. i think thats included in the long-term plan though.you can't simply cater to the majority of the players to bring a game in balance. you have to consider minorities too. right now thats just null-sec dwellers which is fine."
8/17/2011,goons lead the way.
8/18/2011,"black ops needs a buff of their jump range and fuel bay.base jump range should be at least: 4ly, 9ly with lvl5 jump drive calibration. that's the very least, it wouldn't be overpowered even if it surpassed carrier jump range. their role is to ambush and sitting 2 jumps from the target system is not what i call ambush.black ops fuel bay should increase at least up to 3000m^3 at the very least, possibly even up to 5000m^3. or they could decrease fuel usage, either way works."
8/18/2011,"besides mining been boring as hell, i personally find the idea of having so many mining barges and then having haulers to transport them to a location on and off a pain.its also rarelly cost effective vs time spent. this is not cost effective: > find a nice belt > use barges > use transports to move them > reproses them > produce a product (and btter hope is not tech 2 cos it will take even more time)production takes too long for tech 1, never mind tech 2 items, so moving stuff from high sec is time effective and cost effective so mining is never done and 0.0 is never exploited fully. to fix this you have to change the speed of gathering and moving materials.{edited, forgot something}mining barges are very expensive and you need to skill up for a while.this is also important concidering they are also very easy to kill.make the time it takes to mine and build cost effective against getting it from high sec and this will be fixed."
8/18/2011,it is adorable that 95% of the people in this thread have missed the op's point entirely.he is not complaining about cloaking mechanics.he is not complaining about risk vs. reward in nullsec.he is not complaining about local.he is not complaining about enemies in his home systems.he is complaining about afk'ers. simple solution: a timed afk flag.
8/18/2011,anyone afk does not represent a risk therefore why bother.
8/18/2011,"timed aft flag is the stupidest idea ever ( and that's a lot coming from me, i'd like to think i'm open minded about all things reasonable )that pretty much makes eve into a whack-a-mole game, prone to accidental logoffs or decloaks, and easily defeated with existing macros. not only ineffective, it serves only to punish the legitimate players not using macros. people who propose it need to take a course in game design. or just recall the last time windows asked you to reboot and install new updates and gave you 59 seconds to click no else it would do it for you. just plain dumb ui design."
8/18/2011,"because you don't know if they are afk. the enemy might have gone to bed six hours ago. maybe he is actually playing and planning a strike. it has become common practice in my corner of nullsec for reds to leave their characters cloaked in popular jewing systems all day, every day. obviously, they are not at their keyboard 24/7. why should they be able to do anything (even something as small as tactical pressure from their presence alone) when they are not actively playing?this isn't about risk vs a single enemy. this is about allowing people to participate in eve while not at their computer."
8/18/2011,"i said nothing about an auto-log. a simple light on the character portrait in local would work fine. there are ways around macros as well, like captchas. obviously captchas wouldn't be an elegant solution, but surely there is something similar that could be done."
8/18/2011,"soi you would also wish for skill training to stop while offline and for market orders, industry jobs, contracts, research etc. to be cancelled while a player is offline?"
8/18/2011,"maybe, maybe not.he actually mentions this in his second post and calls exploit.not directly. but they are inextricably linked, so you cannot talk about one without the other.but it goes deeper than that, as you can afk and use local for psychological warfare without a cloak. this is why most of us know the actual problem, is local.well actually he is.this is where we find you adorable, for suggesting an idea that is so easily bypassed, not in anyway new and at the same time totally unnecessary."
8/18/2011,i made a new thread discussing the dubiously unethical acts such as afk cloaking in eve general. please check there for some fresh new thoughts on this perennial problem.
8/18/2011,your complaining about catching up?your in the wrong game.eve isn't a racing game... go try need for speed if you want that.eve is a game of patience...practice...and ambition.if you can't handle the heat... gtfo.because you'll never best someone by getting more sp's.when you figure out its not a matter of sp's but one of practice and experience...now your getting somewhere.but your too blinded by your pocket book as a solution.waste of time if you ask me.do you always grease the vendor if you don't get what you want?won't work here... i'm sure everyone here would accept donations however.
8/18/2011,"losing a frig/cruiser is no fun, but you pick yourself back up (this is a good thing). losing a 600m - 1b ship would pretty much make a rookie ragequit (this is a bad thing). other games don't have ""passive"" training. a brand new player can have a rifter at all l4 skills (per certificates) in 31d 12h or so. certain stuff ""required"" for pvp will be absent (e.g. a point) ... but you can get l4 pointing skills in another 4-5 days or so. this 31 days of training gets you 80% of the sp/skill levels that are relevant to the rifter (and, for the most part... all minmatar frigates). you'll be approximately 10% less ""effective"" than if you had everything at l5. let's say you have 200 dps and can tank 300 at l4 across the board. is it really worth 1-2 years to get yourself up to 220 dps and a 330 tank? or would your time be better spent by taking 2-3 weeks to step up from frig to cruiser (again at 80% of skill levels), and another month or two to get into a bs? eve is not a game where the ""biggest"" is necessarily the ""best"". i've flown before with ""can barely fly it"" ecm corpies (in frigs) who have saved my ass in deep hull by breaking the other guy's lock on me... yeah, having 40, 50, 80, 100m sp can be used for bragging to some degree... but how much of that sp can be used in a frigate fight? i am dead-set against sp for mt. it's a terrible idea that will cheapen the game and, most likely, cause the ""bittervet"" players to leave. turnover for the people who just buy what they want will likely be exceptionally high... since there's nothing ""keeping"" them in the game (in the sense that if it takes me a month to train something... i may start hanging out with other people... those people keep me around... ).character bazaar is different -- yes the buyer gets ""instant sp"", but that sp was still earned through the time/effort of the seller..."
8/18/2011,"you know i've watched just about every sci fi movie that's ever come out and i have a feeling it's somthing like thisjove= the ancient ones=humans ones who didn't have as big of a hitch thrown into their evolution. probably ones who know what happened to the gate or may have even been responsible for it. im guessing there was a catastrophe so the ""ancient ones left their home galaxy for new eden for good,abandoning their home and then collapsed the gate. in the comotion thousands of worlds were left on their own evolving into what we have today. the jove being the last root to our ancient selves thus their interest in our well being. sleepers= ancients version of rogue drones. probably the ones responsible for the catastrophe or if the catastrophe was caused by somthing like the ultimate evil (like on star control 3) then perhaps the lack of sentience made them unedible. or maybe they are working properly but don't recognize the less advanced mutation that is humans.rogue drones= rip off of every robots go crazy and kill humanity book and movie ever made which is all just a rip off the terminator anyway.rogue drones are no different than cylons and aren't aliens and the sleepers aren't anymore aliens than the mrnmhrm from star control 3 that while made by aliens were still just robots. if people would just use the 3 laws of robotics none of these movies would have to have happened. thank god all the robots the military is making are all endowed with the 3 laws of robotics. or we could face the same problem in rl somday:("
8/18/2011,"heh... close. the jove were the only [known] ""colony"" that didn't completely collapse when the eve gate closed. they exhibit isolationist tendencies, not really caring about what happens outside of their borders... with certain exceptions of course.joves are largely considered ""strange"" for various reasons... the big one being their appearence. apparently they have played around with genetic engineering for the better part of 15 thousand years which, consequently, has taken away their ability to procreate, largely wiped out their more ""humanistic tendencies,"" and given rise to a genetic disorder called ""jovian's disease"" which causes terminal mental degradation.your version could be it... but honestly, no one knows. from what can be gathered by various people who live in wormholes; sleepers are some defense mechanism from some long dead civilization. what this civilization is, again, no one knows. but there appears to have been some kind of biological catastrophe that required quarantine in some of the complexes.yeah... rogue drones are nothing new in science fiction. though... even isaac asimov would disagree that the ""3 laws"" are infallible. circumstances do come up that would put the rules in conflict with one another... especially in eve as capsuleers are a particularly amoral bunch lore-wise."
8/18/2011,wasn't the while point of the asimov robot series to show that thethreelaws are fallible once robots gain the ability to reason?and why no robots were allowed in the foundation times??anyway it's been a while since i've read them but i sure remember coming away with the opposite feeling about the infallibility of the 3 lawsback on topic. i think more aliens should come with future expansions or with dust. the eve universe is rich and fertile. wait and it shall bear fruit.
8/18/2011,"in an effort to improve gameplay, pvp and forum posting in general i propose that local chat be changed to work exactly as it does in wh space. local exists but no notification of who is in it without that person saying something in local. with that i also propose that an afk timer be set in place to kick people off who have been flagged afk for more than 15 minutes.2 birds, 1 stone.thank you."
8/18/2011,"i agree completely with faces in local. it would save all the null sec care bears from turtling up whenever they see a stranger.as for the afk timer, 15min is far too short a time. sure, it works in other mmos where the pace is faster. but eve is a lot slower of a game.i'd vote for more like 1hr afk timer."
8/18/2011,afk timer of 15 years might be okay.
8/18/2011,even 23 hours and 30 minutes would be fine...
8/18/2011,"they are tech 2 battleships, here is no reason for the sensor strength to be cut in half.giving it t1 battleship sensor strength will not make it op in any way, it will not make it really any better in missions, only basically only gurista's jam and with the new jamming they perma jam u anyways.in pvp it will make it more viable, a single ecm module wont lock out the ship anymore, maybe it will get more use in pvp.maybe in earlier days it would be too strong, but eve is different now.a side note, the only thing i see this strongly changing is the alliance tournament, marauders are worthless if 1 ecm is on the field, but with a little more strength it might be possible."
8/18/2011,there is. to keep them out of pvp.
8/18/2011,why.
8/18/2011,"i know you are a horrible troll but i will reply for the benefit of people genuinely interested in this question.ccp did not intend for marauders to be used in pvp hence the sensor strength limitation.the only problem with that is that a single falcon will lock you out permanently regardless of what you are flying* so you might as well use a marauder. it makes little difference when ecm is as overpowered as it is *with the possible exception of 3x eccm mod setups, but hardly anyone flies those."
8/18/2011,i've personally never much seen the point in punishing marauders in pvp so severely considering faction battleships are similarly strong with similar price tags.
8/18/2011,"command ships need it boosted, not marauders."
8/18/2011,"you used to be able to check another players standings with npc corps. i'm sure many people used this feature to track where someone was likely to mission. i've asked around why this feature was removed and the genearl consensus was that it caused lag.my proposal isn't to bring this back, but however when you run a locator agent on someone, just to provide their npc standings as well (maybe for an additional fee?)."
8/18/2011,"why exactly was that functionality removed in the first place? i liked being able to look and see what factions were friendly to a player and such, just out of curiosity."
8/18/2011,thats whyalso i agree.if it was removed because of lag then fair enough but adding the standings with a locator agent would be cool
8/18/2011,"curius how it really causes lag and i do agree that i want the standings towards npc's back in show info window to track there agents, cant belive they removed a valuble intel tool fromt he game, least for high sec war decs"
8/18/2011,"you know you are being just as bad as the doomsayers. at any rate i have no fear of eve dying if they stick to their guns, and keep on offering a game which is fundamentally different from the others. the worse strategy they can take is to copy and clone what other games are doing. then it just becomes a dark prophecy clone. older too. take a lesson from mac. stick to your guns. offer a better solution. unique product. the naysayers who doubted you will come crawling back in the end."
8/18/2011,"the point about rp-wars is a valid explaination as to why non-mutual wars can even have a place in the game, however it does not provide an explaination as to why the costs of wars are linear.- with suggested changes to the costs of war, it is still perfectly possible to run rp wars, and as many as you'd like. the suggested changes does not alter this.the ingame explaination to the suggested changes to war-decs, have base in the fact that wars cost more, the longer they run. its the same as in real life. ask any country/government in the world currently at war, if the costs of war are not higher today than they were when war was initiated. wars simply cost more, the longer they run.game mechanics could reflect this.+1 for suggested changes from a ceo who's corp on 3rd week is under unprovoked attack from a 1-man corp. the 1-man corp supplying base for exploitatious war-behaviour of having alts/friends setup a high-sec gategamp, entering his corp to instantly get into the war with us. hereby legally being able to kill our members without concord moving a muscle. seconds after a kill they simply leave the 1-man corp again and re-enter npc corp, to get away from any kind of possible retalliation from us."
8/18/2011,"maybe add a new kind of bomb to bomb launcher of stealthbombers, a none aoe like weapon that does massive amount of dmg to a singel target in its path. that will keep the population down.and/or make it so a sc takes 3-6 month to build and a titan takes 6-12 month."
8/18/2011,"yeah, i'm up to about 15,000 (fifteen thousand) bookmarks, and it takes me about 10 seconds to open people & places."
8/18/2011,replace the bookmarks.
8/18/2011,"for contemporary asteroid mining, yes you are probably correct .. i too have perused what related nasa documents i could dig up.but in twenty thousand years when we have ships, stations and metropolis' with shield bubbles?when we have constructs so large that their gravitational pull can affect planets below and faster than light travel?"
8/18/2011,"meh, not a bad idea, but i don't see it as worth the dev time.i would much prefer the dedicated gas ship someone posted."
8/18/2011,you need to at least know what you are talking about before making threads like this one.
8/18/2011,"you're absolutely right.i haven't seen the thousands of threads b!tching over cloaked ships being in system, and the pilots being afk for hours.and i certainly don't know what it's like to wonder if there's hostile forces lurking in the system with you... oh wait, i live in a wh. and we don't have the luxury/crutch of local chat to tell us when someone new is around.so once again, suck it up and play the game. =)"
8/18/2011,fixed.and supported.
8/18/2011,there should not be afk pilots on eve.unnecessary load on the server.afk? forced logout.do you use macro to stay online? ban.
8/18/2011,you are incredibly immature and offensive.please grow up.
8/18/2011,"offensive? i basically reversed what you said so perhaps you should stop being a hypocrite. also this isn't a discuss afk cloaking thread, why don't you go continue to cry more in the 2 current ones and leave this thread for people who are petitioning to ban discussion of afk cloaking from clueless wimps."
8/18/2011,"i'm anti-extremism so i can't support this. if indeed the op wasserious, which i truly doubt. but i had my giggle anyway. thanks for that. but i do agree that most whiners whine without thinking. but you really can't blame them too much. at least they are better than the sp for mt crowd. which are truly whiners who i wish would leave the game. i think that null sec miners should htfu, but at the same time i can see the benefit of a system where cloakers can be countered. like the uboats of wwii. at first they ruled, but later on anti-uboat tech got to a point where they could not operate with the impunity that they did at the onset of the war. this is progress. and it makes sense."
8/18/2011,"yes, afk cloakers aren't a problem. they aren't playing the game, they aren't a threat to me.i've always suspected the complainers are botters, and their bot program docks up when someone unknown comes into system. so you can see why an afk cloaker could ruin their fun...."
8/18/2011,"yeah, it is definetly low-priority, just wanted to make a suggestion since this is bugging me.when your starmap is flattened, its easy to see who holds what sov based on the tiles, but i like the unflattened map, but when you unflatten it, tiles become useless.what if when you unflatten it, you get the option to enable a ""nebula/sphere of influence"" effect, where it basically creates a bubble colored the same as their corresponding tile around all the stars they own, that way in the unflattened map you can see little spheres around stars that are owned by small aliances or are all by themselves and not near another system owned by the same holder, and larger groups of sov would have a big ""blob"" kind of sphere around the territory they own.the idea is pretty rough and suggested how i put it would probably look a little fugly, so it would probably need soem refining, but i think it would look cool.also, the option to ahve a 3d map in cq that works the same as the star-map would be cool.and on to a function, since it is tedious to go through all the tabs and lists to find a system with what your looking for, why isnt their a search bar above those lists so you can just type in whatever your looking for (certain sov, certain service, etc) instead of hunting for it?also would be nice if i could enable any 2 search functions at once on there, like say, if i wanted to search what systems have a cloning service, but only insystems i've previoulsy visited, or only in systems that have a another service as well, i think it would be convenient.there is no tl;dr for this post, so either read it or don't bother commenting."
8/18/2011,"there was a whole patch dedicated to it, not downloading optional updates?"
8/18/2011,clueless much? that 'whole patch' changed a single buttons downstroke behaviour to upstroke and addressed nothing from the original suggestion in here.it's a step in the right direction but it is not a proper fix.please read the thread before spouting complete crap.
8/18/2011,"i've read this, it is a amatuer idea to fix a simple coding mistake; which was fixed correctly by the devs."
8/18/2011,"using a modifier key as a hotkey is a simple coding mistake, true, but it isn't one that's been fixed."
8/18/2011,"supported, the old behavior was fine and made sense. bring it back."
8/18/2011,english comprehension failed on my part. sorry carry on.
8/18/2011,it's called a ship maintenance array.
8/18/2011,"edit for clarity.overview: the wall of numbers is useful, but sometimes overwhelming in the heat of combat. a visual representation to replace the numbers in some columns would be a drastic improvement. for example, i would love to see the angular velocity column replaced with a bar that is empty vs targets that are at 0.0, but maxes out at the peak tracking speed of your current turrets.this visual representation shows a target that is currently: trackable:[iiiiiiii--]moving too fast to track:[iiiiiiiiii]at zero angular velocity (trackable):[----------]this could be implemented for several of the columns and make combat more of a visual, dynamic and stimulating experience rather than a pretty numbers game.also, a timed afk flag for ****s sake."
8/18/2011,"sunken user, you are confusing sig radius with explosion velocity. also you should post these questions in the proper thread :)"
8/18/2011,so why don't you run and represent the issues you care about?
8/18/2011,"darius succeeds in being a classy eve criminal, rogue and ne'er-do-well so i would support him again in the next elections"
8/18/2011,thank you. that is the funniest thing i have read here all week.
8/19/2011,"i'm gonna repost my post from features & ideas because i believe in it that muchwant to give the biggest boost to nullsec industry possible?ban npc corps. scratch that, make it so that npc corps are only available to trial accounts. if you're still not in a corp by two weeks, or are kicked out of a corp, you become a 'free agent' who can be individually wardec'd for a slightly lower fee then dec'ing a corp. because low-level industry in nullsec will always, no matter what you do, be inferior to highsec industry because a nullsec low/mid miner has to deal with constant threat from other players while in a slow and defenseless ship, deal with the logistics of living in nullsec, and dealing with pvp commitments (or rent) that come with living in 0.0; all while directly competing with an npc corp in highsec with the exact same ship mining the exact same ore but has zero risk, zero impediments and zero obligations. the only problem for the highsec low/mid miner is that he has to undercut countless of thousands of other npc corp miners, because all of whom are equally invulnerable (except for the rare hulkageddon) and thus there is no way for any of them to eliminate their competition. so really, the nullsec miner loses every time.then, high-sp nullsec players, taking advantage of a freighter alt in, again, an npc corp can slowly haul the compressed minerals bought at rock bottom prices across new eden with, again, zero risk to where it can be jump freightered right past lowsec straight into an alliance station safe and sound.if these high-sp nullsec supply lines from hisec could be disrupted, say, by not letting their freighters be freakin' invulnerable, it could actually be worthwhile for 0.0 alliances to bring in miners and builders for their own sake. hisec piracy could expand beyond the suicide gank and hisec miners could command a higher value price for their work instead of grovelling for crumbs."
8/19/2011,"there is nothing wrong with afk cloaking, ethically, or otherwise. stop thinking that there is. let's start here. identify the problem at it's core. it's not afk cloaking, it's people who can't do anything about it. give them a tool to do so, problem solved. if they don't want to act on the problem they deserve to suffer for their laziness. captchas???? seriously? you want to make this game as fun as signing up for a web account?shame on you for even suggesting it. its ridiculous. you want to put the onus of work on the cloaker? no. you are just a lazy miner. this is the reason why you get so many scathing responses on these forums for your selfish suggestion. anyone can afk. it's allowed in the game. you don't like a cloaker in your space you need to find and evict him. afk or not. if not afk, good luck. it will be impossible. but that's fair. if a cloaker wants to harass your system then you need to expend a hunter killer to stalk him and both of you spend time at the cloak and dagger game. no side gets to be lazy."
8/19/2011,being intentionally thick is not becoming of you.
8/19/2011,"do i really need to point this out to you? impossible is the problem. it is a problem because it is specifically not fair. impossible is the opposite of fair.why not a ghost cycle on the cloak module? where it operates just like it does now, but only stays active for an hour at a time. yes there will be macro'ers, but not everyone cheats at this game. it would dramatically cut down on the majority of people leaving themselves cloaked in a system while they go to work or sleep. thats all i want. something that makes it so you can't be absent from your computer all day and remain cloaked and invincible in a system. eventually, macro'ers will need to be dealt with, but as long as ccp benefits from their subscriptions, it is not likely to happen anytime soon. in the meantime, it would be an enormous help to this particular issue."
8/19/2011,now i could just be mean and point out how silly you sound not even having read the whole thread and spouting off. so i'll just let you get the hint yourself and do so quietly to save your dignity. credibility -10
8/19/2011,"its threads like this that make me want to demonstrate that there are nastier, more evil things out there than an afk cloaker.i just slip in an interceptor, maybe a dramiel, find a deep safe, point it in an oblique direction away from all celestials, fire up the mwd to about 10,000 m/s speed, give the middle finger in local and go afk for the night.even if and when you might get a warp in off the combat probes, it will be off grid before you can warp to 0. chase that around till you get tired frustrated and angry...it's called the greased pigglet...and it will still be sitting there in local."
8/19/2011,for me is ok.. a dramiel is proportionate to the damage it can do.
8/19/2011,"ahh, the 'not fair 'card. nice move.you've yet to give a good reason why this is needed. by this i mean, a none emotional factual reason. you also have to include local, as it is the reason for afk cloaking.but in the meantime, you want to push an idea forward, that promotes the use of macros. great stuff."
8/19/2011,"i really like the idea of a new destroyer for that, seems better than nerfing cloaking ships and logical aswell - the bit about gates though says that if a ship enters a local but not through a gate then they shouldnt be visible in the local channel right?"
8/19/2011,"i thought about it some more and wanted to say i would whole heartedly support a new destroyer that does some sort of cloaky (sub) hunting type thing, the more i think about it the more it sounds like the way forward - infact all the otehr ideas seem well, just effin dumb compared to it"
8/19/2011,"make larger fleet warfare more dynamic.1. change current targeting to variant: active targeting.2. apply progressive penalties to attacking scan resolution for more than 1 target.3. apply progressive 'noise' obscurement to reduce defending vessels signature radius.4. create new targeting variant: passive targeting- the active lock: - can only facilitate hostile actions thru this lock, no remote repping, cap transfer, etc. - an active lock will generate a specific amount of ""noise"" which will gradually obscure the signature radius of the targeted ship. - this affects several things. multiple ships locking a single target will at first take longer to lock the target, and ultimately a hard limit of attackers will be reached and no more will be able to target it. - additionaly the ever-reducing signature radius ( as it gets further obscured by scan resolution noise of it's attackers ) will begin to reduce damage from incoming missile explosions, and other non aoe damage. - to prevent folks from using the active lock on friends to make their friends invulnerable, we must introduce the following: - the 1st active lock, after completion, will be assumed to have 'tied up' one-half of the attackers scan resolution to maintain the lock, leaving the other half free to lock the 2nd target. this means that the 2nd target will take twice as long to lock under the new rules than it would currently. - the 3rd would be 3x as long as 2/3 of the scan res is being used to hold the first 2 locks. - the 4th would be 4x as long to lock, for the same reasons. - this means if people did try to make their friends signature radiuses smaller by locking them, they would make it take far longer for them to cycle thru hostile targets which provides a deterrent.- the passive lock: - introduced to provide a means of supporting friendlies without adversily affecting lock times, or giving signature radius bonsues to friendlies. - this lock, being passive, would take longer than an active lock, but would not tie up any scan resolution resources, nor would it generate any 'noise' that would reduce effective signature radii like and active lock would.the end result should be that huge fleets tackling smaller targets would have to spread their fire more, creating a more dynamic combat than the current ""make a list and cycle thru primaries"". it would suddenly mean even a large fleet would actually be comprised of many small groups that both would have to work together and work independantly at the same time."
8/19/2011,"when it comes to supers the game is broken, an aeon can easily sustain 120mil ehp for 2 mins with overheated hardeners (70 without) and titan bonuses. now throw reps on top of that. after getting blobbed with 60+ supers all the time, by drf, white noise, nc. and friends, it seems no one can match their strength, for every super they lose they got 3 in the oven and 2 on standby per pilot. within a few days titan pilots get new titans if the lose one. now my solution is simple. dreads......they are useless right now except for structure bashing. what changes need to be made? dreads need t2 guns with ammo made specifically to do massive damage to supers. also they need a ""warfare module"" mode that increases resits for everything, increase tracking, increase damage even more, invulnerability to dd, 600% local rep bonus, -100% scan res so they cant go after sub caps or carriers or other dreads effectively. this will bring dreads back to the role they were made for to counter supers. a super fleet without sub cap support should be dominated by an equal sized dread fleet. a sub cap fleet should be able to dominate dreads hands down, and like now supers should be able to dominate sub caps fleets. and titans should have a slight advantage over all, like they already do. 10 titans vs 10 dreads should end up with 5 titans and 0 dreads by the end of the battle. it should take a mother ship blob to take out a single dread.comments welcome."
8/19/2011,"i dont see anything wrong with paying for a months worth of sp if it costs the same as a months game time, the only bad thing would be the amount of greifers who would surely start dying to noobs - did i say bad thing?if a player wants to pay for 3 years worth of sp using real money, hes paid the same as any player thats been playing for 3 years so whats your beef?"
8/19/2011,"one of the nice things about the back story of eve is the humans only nature of it. with only humans, it is the differing politics, nation states and groups, alliances and corporations the make the sides, and it is a very rich universe because of that great depth of sides. as soon as you add an 'alien' element i think you run the risk of eve diminishing down to an us vs them game. as all of those fractions are human, these newcomers are something else. there are crap loads of those games out there."
8/19/2011,"how about literally flagging people that have been afk for 30 minutes.put a little yellow z next to the local chat list of any character that hasn't interacted with the game in the last half hour.now they might be right there watching, but as soon as they move to do anything the z goes away.this might give the carebear in the anomoly they've been watching just enough time to realize they are now on the recieving end of a rotary fastener."
8/19/2011,"how am i a troll... not intending something for pvp is fine and all but its a tech 2 battleship, it makes no sense for it not to be for pvp. a hulk is a t2 mining barge, its meant for mininggoing from t1 to t2 shouldnt nerf a certain aspect so severely. they are expensive shipson top of all that, battleships in no way need nerfs in a battlecruiser/capital heavy pvp game."
8/19/2011,about 9 of 10 recons ive killed is falcon or rook i dont know what you are smoking i find rapier curse or arazu more scarier
8/19/2011,"from a game-world perspective, how does it make any sense that you can simply look at the pilot's publicly available information and know how every other entity in the world feels about that pilot? stalk him. watch what stations he docks in. you can get the information you really need by using a locator agent. no sense in making it easy for you.i could support a locator agent of a particular faction telling you what the character's standings with that faction are, but not a blanket ""here's how everybody feels about this guy"" report."

8/19/2011,"lets face it, leadership skills takes a super long time to complete in order to use them correctly. for implants, you need level 5 skills. then you need the gang assist modules which are also level 5 (the ones worth using of course).the best part is theres 3 each ?? wtf is that. in conclusion, theres no love to leadership skillseveryone or lots of people here lots to get in fleet. we would like all to get some bonus too. it could be more fun since you could have a big avantage.it also gives the surprise aspect. you might know the fc so you may think you know how he attacks but with a different person giving bonuses, it might be very different from what you know.here are my suggestions:less skill requirements for implants and gang assist modulesif you dont wanna reduce skills requirment, add more mods and implants with less bonuses.more different type of gang assist modules. 3 is not enoughfor the skill requirement, its pretty simple, for all the bonus it gives and especially the time it takes to train to level 5, its worthlessits great to get a fleet with loads of bonuses, it encourages to get in a fleet.the fleet is less ortodox with its method when you get a bonus even if you know the fc..well it could be.ie: shield bonus are only for resist, active shields and shield cap usage ? i could use shield recharge, more hp in shields bonus. almost the same could apply to other types of mods. (yup, armor recharge per sec lol...why not ?! lol)leadership skills are in bad shape right now and don't apply to all kinds of fleets. some but not all of them...and they should if you ask me."
8/19/2011,"and for those of you that says: ""no, that will encourage blobs. bigger fleets and more ships with more bonuses"".for that problem we could apply a ship limit for the mod. that could limit the bonus and render it useless after a certain number of ships."
8/19/2011,"leadership skills apply the moment they have been trained. you do not need to wait a super long time to start providing advantages to your fleet.the implants are very powerful and should require cybernetics v to reflect the advantage they give.eve is not an instant gratification game and specialised leaderships skills are not expected of every character. only those who wish to specialise in the role. the basic leadership skills can be trained up in a very short space of time.the advantages mindlinks and tiii/cs fleet boosters give are significant and should take time to train.yes there are '3 each'. what would you suggest to replace or add to the current options and why is this necessary?most fc's are not the people providing the major fleet boosts so it is irrelevant. fleet boosts can be assumed and figured out simply by having knowledge of the ships flown by the gank (not even having to see any links boosters in the composition).if you don't think massive bonuses to tank, navigation, tackle etc are worth the training time then do not train for them. people that realise the significant advantage to be gained can, and will make the effort.how are these skills 'in bad shape' exactly?"
8/19/2011,"i'd rather say we need a slight nerf to leadership skill cut down the maximum amount of members in a squad to 5. this is in line with the wing command and fleet command skills, and instantly cuts maximum fleet size by half."
8/19/2011,"imho, skill training times are fine (speaking as someone with fc 4). you are providing huge bonuses once you start stacking up the percents and multiplying them by the 50 people in a wing or 250 in a fleet. this also means that, on average, only one out of 50 people needs wc, and one out of 250 needs to train fc.what i'd like to see is more variety. right now, there are four leadership skills and four fleet command ships. each can use three links without a processor, and there are three links of each type. only in very very specific circumstances is it ever worth doing anything else than fitting the three links your ship gets a bonus for. if there were, say, 5-6 links of each type, there would be the need to choose which ones to bring - or use a processor and sacrifice other useful ship stats."
8/19/2011,"i too would like to see a bit more variety. though i don't think that the leadership skills are too hard to train at all. the one tweak i would like to see, however, would be for command processors to only need 4 levels of warfare link specialist instead of 5. the month of training for those is pretty steep imo."
8/19/2011,"i'm in favor of this too. if both sides are enjoying the war, it can be mutual, there's no issue there. but if the aggressor is just looking for easy killboard padding, they should be discouraged for spending weeks on end picking on one group. and if someone angers you enough that you want revenge on them, then you'll have no issue paying increasing costs for it. because of the gradual ramping of the costs, it won't stop corps from being wardeced, it'll simply curtail the corps who want to get easy kills off of inexperienced players. i honestly don't see any significant downside to this for anyone except bullys who want carte blanche to pick on newbies (i will admit the rping corps is a good example, but how difficult would it be for them to cycle through wars with different corps?)"
8/19/2011,"*that* is probably able to be petitioned... provided you have names for ccp to check out... ed... the cooldown shouldn't be as bast as the initial ramping... e.g. costs go up by 50% per week (*1.5), but only go down by 25-33% per week... to make it slightly easier to rebuild..."
8/19/2011,"op idea wouldn't work, titans and sc would stop being used, back in the day titans would appear dd a fleet and get wtfkillmails, then cyno back to safety"
8/19/2011,"i support this proposal. it's incredibly painful to a lot of players, but it is a very good solution to the current problem. i would go with the fast method however, the slow way would take years and effectively close off access to those ships to anyone who doesn't already have one. the fast method kills it for everyone all at once, so it's fair even if more painful. there is a small issue however, what about the sansha sc? i can see all sc's becoming the sansha variant because the hulls themselves would be far less important than the core.that said, i do have an idea on this, make the sansha sc actually just a faction carrier. i'd also like to see navy variants of the standard 4 carriers introduced as well. this would give older players a new shiny to compensate for the old shiny no longer available to them. should also help out with the lp saturation we're seeing these days."
8/19/2011,"might have worked if it was implemented alongside the ships, but now that you have 3-4k sc and 500+ titans it won't make a lick of difference.the only way to get proliferation under control is to make them die a lot more and make construction a lot riskier.the former ties into the balancing of supers;- tweaking ehp values and other attributes.- segregation of drones and fighter/f.bombers- and my personal favourite, removal of immunity when away from own sovereignty*the latter is going to depend on what happens with null in general, but having csaa and other modules outside of pos shields would make the super-farms a very risky endeavour as all it would take is a single covert with a cyno and a swarm of bo to kill the ships in the womb.* helps solve supers in low-sec, solves massive nap-fest fleets protecting blue space and adds danger to offensive campaigns .. what is not to like?"
8/19/2011,"i actually like this idea a lot. it would keep supers decently strong, but it'll also keep them from being tossed around randomly just for fun."
8/19/2011,i like the idea of putting the csaa outside the pos shields :)would cut down on the amount of new suppers and would make it a lot harder to replace lost suppersthen when the amount is down a lot the idea of the cores looks nice but as someone said it's hard to predict what would happen with the suppers that are there
8/19/2011,"the power cores are an interesting idea, but the method described in the op would ultimately lead to one alliance all the cores, or to supercapitals becoming a collector's item, too valuable to actually put into combat. if i were to go with the power core idea, i'd create a fixed number of cores seeded throughout nullsec in magnetometric sites. those cores would be required in the blueprints of new supercapital ships. when one of the new supercaps was destroyed, one of these mag sites would spawn somewhere in nullsec. this would result in a frantic search all over space for power cores every time a supercap was destroyed.another idea would be to create a mechanic that would limit the number of supercapitals in a system. like maybe the presence of their power cores (running with a theme) disrupts further cyno activity. obviously this could be a problem when one fleet caps out the cyno limit right away, but i would say anyone willing to put that many supercaps on the line with this new system should reap the rewards of that risk."
8/19/2011,"how about this... make a new galaxy which has to be accessed via several ""black holes or perma wormhole"" the wormholes are not big enough to take super capitals or freighter to fit through and on the other side you can not mine the minerals for a super in this new space therefore it has to be imported.then all the people moaning can go make a new home if super free space (for a while) and have all the fun in the world and then leave the big boys to have super fun who arent so scared of supers...?problem solved"
8/19/2011,... called worm hole space. already implemented.
8/19/2011,"i really hope this was a joke...if not, i really suggest never commenting on supercaps ever again."
8/19/2011,"interesting idea, but it suffers from a pretty major flaw. in eve, there has to always exist an opportunity for a smaller power to grow enough to challenge a larger power.with this system, regardless if the number of power cores is 10 or 100, eventually the majority of those will end up in either one corp, one alliance, or one bloc. if they are strictly limited, they then have the absolute monopoly on super caps.the root of the super cap problem in eve today is not supercap proliferation, that is merely a symptom.the problem is a viable counter. the only counter to super caps is more super caps."
8/19/2011,i can't say i really like the idea. it seems a little overthought and complicated for what needs to be done. frankly if you want to make titans more rare in the game then make them harder to build. make them require 10 times the resources and take 5 times as long. no need to make some arbitrary mechanic revolving around a limited indestructible item just to limit the use of an already existing ship.want more titans to be destroyable? make them incapable of entering a pos's forcefield. problem solved.
8/19/2011,1
8/19/2011,"a new and better system would be a good thing. no more stone slabs but co<U+FFFD>rdinates that can be exchanged, mailed, corp/alliance-shared.however don't forget the implications to stuff like wormholes (being trapped)."
8/19/2011,ccp have done donation drives but this one will be for expansions/fixes. the idea is to have 2 or 3 top issues or features players want and the ability to donate plex's toward there development. want to fix lag? want to revamp pos's? want a low sec expansion? want new ship models? all the money from plex's will go directly to the teams like on the other donation's.
8/19/2011,that's a very cool idea!
8/19/2011,i think module which shuts down all drones and makes mining with guns useless would be cool
8/19/2011,"its funny, people in null are so scared of cloakers, had my buddy in his cloaky ship go out to a null-sec region and just start buggering around in local, the carebears were so scared to undock he invited me to come out and mine for a while.3 hours in low-sec with a retreiver, never saw a single eprson undock."
8/19/2011,"i actually wouldn't mind having a second filter set for the maps, but i don't want to have to go and check and uncheck boxes when i want to switch filters. i would suggest a pop-out menu where you can select a second filter and it simply overlays that on the main map, and there's a ""none"" option in the second one too so you don't have to have two filters. and so long as you don't mess with my flattened map, i have no issue with tweaking the unflattened map. i'm guessing you mean something like translucent metaballs around the systems to show sov?"
8/19/2011,"yeah, the meta balls were what i was talking about, i just couldnt think of the name for them, thanks."
8/19/2011,"hello folks,the incursion pve content introduced by ccp half a year ago has become a pretty popular way to bring people together and make some good isk in empire. so thumbs up for it.but it has some downs.the main problem is that about 80 % of the incursion pilots focus on running vanguards only. the reason for that is quite simple. its the easiest and fastest way to make isk. so a proper fleet can make about 100 mill an hour. i would like to see that ccp works a bit on the balance between those three major sites(vanguards, headquarters, assaults).organizing a fleet with 20 pilots should be more profitable than running a fleet with 10 pilots.or what do you think?"
8/19/2011,i agree the assualt sites and hq sites are rather fun its nice to fly a sniper ship mixed with close range ship also fun to logi for more then 10 some times.but most fleets for assualts and hq's take like an hour to force together and fall apart after 1 maybe 2 sites sadly.better pay out for them would make them more viable and i would actualy like to see fleets competing at same assualt or hq site that would get intersting.
8/19/2011,i heartily agree when you get 150 in 3 vg systems (thats 150 in each system) either running fleets or waiting to get into a fleet...it makes me almost want to go missioning
8/19/2011,"i agree completely. it should easily be worth more to actually complete the harder sites per hour. boost the rates a bit, and i think you'll see people start to bring the right gear more often.also, remember to hit that support button!"
8/19/2011,"the assault sites can be ran at the same isk/hour as the vanguards (with the proper fleet composition) with the exception of the ""nation consolidation network."" the incursion playerbase has been calling out to ccp for 8 months+ for some love on that site, to deaf ears it seems.the idea of a two-pronged attack on a sansha base appeals to me, however the spawns inside each level of the encounter are extremely battleship heavy. the high ehp coupled with the high resists of these battleship spawns make them very time consuming to kill, expecially for a fleet that already has it's dps cut in half. i would like to see one of these two changes made to the ""nation consolidation networks"". i believe that doing so would greatly increase the popularity of this site, along with assault sites in general.1. replace approx half of the battleship spawns with cruisers. the average ncn site (in it's current state) requires players to defeat `24 battleship spawns compared to the other assault sites needing only `12. i would like to see that disparity reduced. 2. reduce the ammount of levels needed for site completion. currently a fleet is required to complete 3 split levels before merging with their fleet mates on the 4th level. this could be reduced by half and still be on par difficulty wise to the other assault sites.often, when my corporation decides to run assault sites, the system with the sites are usually full of ncn's only. because of the issues listed above, i cannot, in good faith, ask my troops to run these knowing that they will cut their income to 30% of usual. thanks in advancen00n"
8/19/2011,"yo, my name is phatt, as the creator of btl pub, i approve of this message."
8/19/2011,"as said, previously, get the composition right for your fleet, and you are golden. just because vg's allow for the newer people to go in without having super shiney ships, and actually make some isk is no reason to raise your flag and say oh noes there is too much isk here. vg's are fine the way they are, they allow the inexperienced to come in get a taste, make some isk and have fun. why try to ruin the way things are? either that or start moving to systems that aren't flooded and run some of the ones that aren't being ran."
8/19/2011,"besides the isk-time ratio for assaults and hq totaly beeing out of wack, it would be nice to see more incursiosn up at one time.half the incursion community are carebears, wich means low sec or ""pocket"" incursions dont do much for them.note that btl pub holds a good number or people, around 700 i think atm.so if two highsec incursiosn are up with 1 assault system each, well you can do the math."
8/19/2011,"the last time i tried joining up for assaults, we sat at a planet waiting for over an hour waiting on ""just one more person"". by the time we'd get that last person, someone else would get bored and drop, so then we'd need ""just one more person"" again.vanguards are far quicker to get organized, as well a to run. so players with less than 23:30 to sit in eve can still get something accomplished.if anything, ccp needs to increase the number of vanguard systems. otherwise, as stated, there's too many players in each system."
8/19/2011,"everyone knows the current way of voting is a farce, its nothing more than a popularity contest with each member looking out for their own interests only.the idea of breaking it down into different regions sounds alot better tho rather than the current way of doing things. csm are a total joke."
8/19/2011,"this is seriously messed up.i especially like the ""who were surprised to learn that wh space was nullsec"" part. well hello. there are no rules in nullsec and there are no rules in w-space. sp why is there supposed to be a differance?just because w-space is not smack in the middle of the pvp-greifing zone suddenly w-space residents don't deserve the same even when everyone who wants to is just as free to come blow us up as they are in nullsec?to me it sounds more like ""we are to lazy to go there so make them come to us""-whine from the nullsec residents."
8/19/2011,when are these going to be released?
8/20/2011,"for me the worst experience is the hisec to lowsec gate camps. the system is meant to be that the further you go into low sec the more dangerous it's suppose to be. but it's actually the opposite for new players. your first trip in to a 0.4 system is likely to be the first time you get podded. most of the hisec to lowsec gates i've been through have permanent camps of organised players making them the most dangerous parts of space in eve. what i think needs to be done to balance the game and make the 0.4 systems less dangerous than the 0.1 systems is random sweeps of each low sec gate by concord based on it's sec rating. so that a 0.4 would get swept more often than a 0.1 also there should be a warning before you jump as to the concord presence on the other side so that both pirates and new players know if it's safe to jump or not.i would like to point out here that concord would not chase after campers that fled so once a new player leaves the gate or if concord finishes it's sweep and leaves, then it's every man for him self again.i hope the developers consider this concept as i think it would increase the number of players willing to risk missions into low sec space.cheers, guys"
8/20/2011,"i think the mechanic is working as intended, but they effect that you are seeing is due to geography, not any flaw in mechanic. you will always find gate camps at the boundaries of highsec/lowsec and lowsec/nullsec. that's just the nature of things. you shouldn't try to correct for this artificially, the fact is that you will always get this boundary effect.what new players need is more video guidance, and noobie forums, where noobies start making friends and playing cooperatively right from the get go from their home starting stations. sure there are rookie chat rooms but something more local would be nice, akin to a game lobby room for any given station where noobs can explore together and learn to act together. who knows they may end up being friends. trying to play the han solo type of character in eve is hard, unless you are very resourceful and have lots of patience."
8/20/2011,"[expand='bla-bla-bla']when i read this topic on wiki i found the drones to be the main gallente weapon.may be it is the right time to re-balance the drones?i do not remember any changes affecting drones for the last 2-3 years except the nerf of some drone-ships through cutting the bandwidth or limiting the drone bay. nowadays we see a lot of changes in the world of new edem, the projectiles were re balanced, becoming a panacea for big fleet fights (arti abadon =_+), t3 ships were introduced (all glory the proteus as the ""nerd ishtar""), there were the incursions, pi, 3d characters, wormholes, slippers, dramiel is still insane and now even considered ""overpowered"" and waiting for treatment in the form of nerf. the ""not to be named"" was named so and spawned tonns of hateposts (butthurt if you want) and a lot of mems (may be a lot more), there were the unscan ships (nerfed by the last patch), a subsystem for t3 ships, giving them resistance against bubbles, thousand gallente shed tears on hybrids... and what about drones? nothing.[/expand]what is offered?1) drones are to serve as a main weapon!what are the main instruments of destruction in eve?projectiles, rockets and lasers (yes, i'm not mentioning the hybrids by purpose). for each type of weapon there is a special module for low slot, increasing its damage and rof (heat sync for lazor, gyro stabs for proj, ballistic control for launchers).each type of weapon has rigs increasing damage and rof.there are, also, implants, increasing damage and rof. even some boosters (drugs) affect the fighting qualities of weapons.but nothing for the drones? the gallente main ""weapon""!?what is offered to implement:[*]rigs increasing drone damage and rof (not affecting fighters and fighter bombers) [*]special module for low slot, increasing damage and rof (not affecting fighters and fighter bombers) something like the gyrostabs for projectiles.[*]boosters (drugs) increasing fighting drone characteristics (not affecting fighters and fighter bombers)[*]drone implants, increasing the damage and rof, and lot more, all like the ones for ""main weapon types"" (not affecting fighters and fighter bombers) [*]overheat option for drones! give the possibility to include overheating. focus on the guns of this class. take into account the skill of thermodynamics. if a drone ""burns out"" - he will try to crawl without the mwd (mwd also heated) to the ship without being able to shoot. repair them just like a module only if it is damaged less than 100% for complete combustion - in drone-service at the station!through this changes the the phrase ""a drone holder"" will no more mean ""a fanatic nerd"".2) drones4all!you are disgusted by the gallente ships, but somewhere deep in your heart you like the drones? we'll help you!let us introduce a number of modules to control the drones.what generally do the offered modules is - +1 module +1 drone in space +n m3 in drone bay +n mb bandwidth -1 high slot and -pg, -cpu.where n - equals 5, 10, 25 for 3 class of ship size, namely - frig-destr, crus-bc, bs.this module should consume as much cpu and pg as the gun of the same class (can not tell the exact numbers, it's up to you :)).the ideology is simple - ""remove the gun - get a drone"".there should not appear any overpowered ships, for example a dominix will lose 5 hi-slots to control 5 additional drones, meaning that it will not anymore be a neytrodomi, rrdomi, blasterdomi, it will be just a pure dronedomi.btw : why a passive module? it will give drone usage possibility to the ships which have no bandwidth and drone bay. the same domi will lose its bonus to hybrids (lol), and the +10% drone damage bonus will not make it overpowered."
8/20/2011,"3) science does not stand still or stop the gallente scientists cry on hybrids!the drone modules mostly are limited by t1 version, or fraction. why is it so?develop the t2 modules.[*]drone link augmentor[*]drone navigation computer[*]omnidirectional tracking link[*]ew drones (i cannot understand why we don't have them yet :()4) stop this outrage!change the proteus subsystems - give us the possibility to drive a t3 ishtar!proteus offensive - drone synthesis projector - adds 25m of bandwidth! instead, take out a gun. it's the gallente t3 ship or what?so, using the drone subsystems - we will construct something like a t3 ishtar :)5) drones need brains!!!there are more good and different, namely:[*]setting the preferred target - for example - i want the drones to fire at primary targets (e.g. the light drones to attack an interceptor). i've got two kills of rookie ships, made by my drones, as i was relaxing in permajamm[*]option to set emergency return - a drone taking damage to a certain level (70% structure, 30% armor, 10% of the shield, or whatever stated) returns to the drone bay6) drones are your friends![*]allow the drones to repair their ship-owner, because it's logical![*]allow the drones to protect the ship-owner! drones were the argument of gallente against the caldari jamm technology, as a consequence, it is logical to use the following - i have a problem, i order the drones to protect me - they go and kick the ass of whoever attacks me.[*]drones can help you - allowing assists from drones for yourself - you shoot the primary - drones do the same![hr]at least - i opened this topic at a russian eve community forum and it was supported. although we had some argues associated with the precise figures.let me retell the situationin our discussion we were speaking about dominix. in my proposes i told about +1 drone module, modules for damage increase and rigs + implants. i was not speaking about precise figures, but in our discussion we used some ""prototype modules"".maximal damage increase for turrets is something like 200% (this is an empirical figure, i calculated the mega pulse laser armageddon damage in eft (450 dps), and the same armageddon with two imps (+5% damage, +5% rof), +2 rigs (+10% damage, +10% rof) has 1045 dps (all without drones, with drones we have 1361 dps)),in case of dominix it will be looking like - 475 dps from 5 ogres ii, and if we use +1 drone modules - there will be 10 ogres ii and 950 dps, if we install all modules for damage - we will have something like 1900 dps :d gallente - the melee kings!!!111 all right - that's a joke ;)in case of a centry dominix - it will be looking like 450 dps base, 900 dps from 10 drones, and 1800 dps with setup ""all in damage"", vol 2.to sum up, at the russian forum we thought - ""the smart guys from ccp will make it more realistic!""but we have to remember what drones have many differences compared to other weapons, i will mention them here for people who are scared by my idea of drone boost:[*]drones are destructible[*]drones have to reach the target[*]drones need a lot of med-slots (centry's without 3 omnidirectional tracking links are useless)[*]you can not carry an infinite amount of drones with you[*]drones cry from the smart bomb of scorpion[*]many targets are simply faster than drones (hurri on a mwd is faster than the drones, and something like a vagabond just laughs at drone speed)[*]drones are often left on the battlefield, because waiting for them to return sometimes means that you do not return to the base."
8/20/2011,"do the projectiles, lasers, rockets have all this problems? can you kill a cannon? is anyone spending a whole cargo of ammunition during a fight (or is anyone limited by the types of ammunition he has in cargo?)? guns are tied to some place? do the smartbombs make you drop a laser or break their lens? do we have to wait until a rocket returns to the cargo bay, or will you leave your launchers on a battlefield?this topic on ru-community site."
8/20/2011,drones are way overpowered as they are nerf dronesy u velator with 1 drone does probably more dmg than raptor wtf
8/20/2011,the podding mechanic in eve was always bad. now with the ui not responding its darn right stupid. the podding mechanic is more of a test of your internet connection and possibly your computer hardware. it has nothing to do with skill.
8/20/2011,let it go already.implants add to ones ability to kill whereas monocles just add to the satisfaction.not supported
8/20/2011,"the likelihood of this happening seem slim considering the way gun mechanics work, but i like the idea."
8/20/2011,"it will need fine tuning, but the concept is what i want to get across. right now we are trying to play rock paper scissors, and supers come along with their chainsaws, cut off your hands and say i win. i know it's not perfect, it needs some tweaking. but the concept is sound."
8/20/2011,"your solution is ""super"" indeed."
8/20/2011,"this goes back to the dev blog a few weeks ago that basically said if ccp makes something annoying and boring, but advantageous, people will still do it and just hate the game for making them do it. it's a lot of hard work creating a massive supercap fleet, but as we can see, people are now doing it, and it's breaking the rest of the game.ccp should have known it was only a matter of time until a critical mass of characters would be trained and rich enough to fly blobs of supercaps. just like you see in a typical pve grind mmo, by the end of the expac, nearly all players will have the best loot, and thus be expected to use ""epic"" ships just to participate effectively in large scale combat.the only ways to fix this is (1) like other mmo's do, you raise the level cap, and make better epics, i.e. you introduce death stars or some crap, which someone will eventually obtain in mass, and we're back at square one, or (2) you create a specific counter that makes these ships more of a strategic gamble to take to the field, and not a situation where if you have more of them than the other guy, you automatically win.i like the idea of dreads being that counter. they're already technically the counter, but they aren't as effective as they should be. like the op said, 10 titans vs 10 dreads should end up 5-0, and 10 titan vs 10 dreads plus support should be 0-10 at the end. dreads have the very specific role of putting godly damage on things too big for battleships to blow up in a timely fashion. i think supercaps and pos both fit that description quite nicely."
8/20/2011,"scan resolution of zero? awesome! also, i think you meant ""decrease tracking"" - as you say, you don't want these things hitting subcaps."
8/20/2011,"well, for the most part ignore the numbers, they are just something to give a general idea. about the -100% scan res was to take a godly amount of time to lock sub caps, not zero, my mistake (while still having great targeting on supers, around 10-15 seconds). the reasoning is, so you don't have a repeat of the problems you have now by having dread blobs just killing everything. and yes i did mean increase tracking, the turrets base tracking speed is already slow enough, tracking computers should definitely have a better time when ship can't move. however, like i said, the specifics aren't perfect, it's the general concept of making the dreads effective for entering a fleet battle, to do what they were meant to do."
8/20/2011,"i like this idea. it reminds me of the ion frigate on home world. i've thought if another idea i think would go well with it. more of a cheap fleet addition perse'.does anyone here remember that episode of battlestar galactica where they sent starbuck on that suicide mission in their new stealth fighter? she snuck in close and then attacked the resurrection ships ftl drive? i think they followed it up by jumping some of those little puddle jumpers in with nukes and blew it to cylon heaven? ok mayby i've got the wrong spaceship movie, im pretty sure i've watched them all and sometimes they all run together. anyway to the point.why not make a new stealth bomber from the dessy hull that has only 2 high slots. one for a covert ops cloak and one for a specialized anti super capital torpedo. it would have enough cargo for 1 additional torpedo, and could only hold one torpedo in the launcher.the launcher would only be able to fire once every 15 minutes with heavy bombers specialization trained to lvl1, and could be lowered down to every 10 minutes by lvl 5firing would take 3 seconds after hitting the fire button and would disable the cloak for the duration of the 10-15 minute reactivation timer. additional consequences for using the weapon would be the inability to eject, jump, dock or store the ship.this would make it completely hunt-able for 10-15 minutes.this would give any super caps surviving a first strike a very strong signal that it may be time to leave, if they didn't bring appropriate defenses, and give them enough time for their own doomsday devices to cool down and gtfo. if they are in a well trained and balanced fleet, the first strike would be completely ineffective and would result only in the wholesale slaughter of any heavy bomber squads foolish enough to try and engage. any members who managed to fire and warp out would also be hunted down and eliminated.the reasons given for all these disabilities will be conjured up in the following posts.when the torpedo is loaded it would drop the ships manuverability to that of an orca, but would still be able to reach the same cloaked speeds as the regular bomber, albeit more slowly.after dropping it's payload it's maneuverability would return to the same as a destroyer. which would be important because it's ability to drop and run would be it's only defence.the torpedo itself would be unguided put, put, slow;and would have to hit directly to cause it's terrible damage of (to throw a random number out there) 200k damage to the target and 6k starting damage to everything within 15km. the 200k direct damage would be constant while the aoe secondary damage would be effected by the heavy bomber skill, and would have the same 5% per skill level damage increase as the normal bombs. secondary aoe damage being the same as a regular bomber's aoe.the heavy bomber would have no secondary weapons meaning it drops it's payload and runs before it blows itself up. it wouldn't be able to land it's primary damage on anything smaller than a super capital ship. only the secondary regular area of effect bomb damage would. this would make them even less of a threat to sub super capitals than regular bombers are now. despite the devastating power of the anti capital torpedo it would still take a lot of them to take down a titan or super carrier. requiring several waves. these would be the kind of ships carriers etc would carry in their maintenance arrays incase the occasion presented itself. they wouldn't even be able to (direct) hit pos due to their sig radius being less than that of a super. meaning a normal bomber is far better suited for pos bashing the primary (direct) damage would only detonate within a certain range of a suitable signature radius. ""like hitting wombats"". this would make hitting a moving super like trying to get the lucky shot into the death stars exhaust port.continued in the next post--->"
8/20/2011,"the second posti would make the torps have just enough flight time to fire within 6 km's of the cap putting them in smartbomb range.the stats, meds and lows would be the same as the thrasher 3 and 2 for shield tanks and for armor 1 med and 4 lows. (note: ballistic control would only effect the aoe damage not the direct damage, same as regular bombs.) this means that if a bomber chose gank over tank it would probably not survive if the cap has a smart bomb fitted. it also means that a super surrounded by ships equipped with smart bombs would have a pretty effective screen;while an all capital fleet would have major holes in their defenses.a properly tanked heavy bomber could possibly survive, launch and retreat but the gank boat would never withstand even light smartbombing long enough to launch it's torpedo.by keeping the aoe damage the same as the typical damage a bomber fleet can put out in one organized bombing run, and making the bombs hit points the same; you would still only be able to launch 6 at a time with ought blowing the excess bombs. meaning a single strike would be worth about 1,200,000 damage. that may sound like allot but imagine a typical battle with hundreds of pilots and many of them in capitals and super capitals on each side and imagine if one side had hired an all heavy bomber merc gang of 80 heavy bombers. as long as the cap fleet is flying in formation with smart bomb equipped ships or fast locking high tracking types, or possibly even having their own bombers bombing them sporadically just to make sure. many of the bombers, and even the crawling slow bombs, would never reach their target. if there was an interdictor it could pop a bubble around the cap at the first sign of heavy bombers ensuring a higher casualty rate yet. meaning most of them would not be comming home. and many more would never get to fire their second torpedo. so while adding a new element of risk to flying supers solo it doesn't make them useless or too at risk as long as they are flying in a balanced fleet. it does however discourage the use of an all caps fleet which would probably not be able to lock onto the bomber in time to defend itself.also since hitting a moving super would be extremely hard from the flanks it would force pilots to attack mainly from the front or rear of the super or force them to kamikaze by all approaching to 0 and launching at point blank range. sequencing a kamikaze attack would probably catch some of them before they even hit the fire button making them ineffectual.i would imagine in the heat of battle these things would die in droves and would quickly earn the name ""suicide ride""."

8/20/2011,"disclaimer before you read this: i'm not necessarily in favor of this idea. i wrote this after a conversation about whether or not is would be feasible and not ruin the game. just an idea.tl;dr:the idea:-1 plex = ~1.5 million sp-limit to one use per month to prevent instantly perfect toons.why:-other mmos have level caps that limit the gap between young and old-skill gap confers significant advantage to older players-character bazaar already allows players to purchase skilled characters-newer players can become more useful to corps/alliances quickly--------------------------------------------------------------i've been playing eve for about 15 months now. i have over 20 million skill points on my primary character. i own two alt accounts, each approaching or exceeding 20 million sp themselves. i say this first so that you have a frame of reference for my perspective.why it might work:in every other mmo i know anything about, there is a hard cap to abilities. your level 80 mage won't be level 81 until a new expansion opens up new skills and abilities. this means that most players in every other mmo that exists can reach ""the top"" at whatever pace they are willing to grind for experience. once they've achieved the highest level, other priorities take over. there aren't people in wow with level 400 paladins who have been leveling since day 1. this gives newer players the ability to one day achieve the same level as the best player.in eve, the top is so high up no one could have trained all the skills yet (evemon claims it will take 20 years, if i recall correctly--just mechanic, science, and electronics skills would take two months short of five years). i'm not advocating for an accessible cap; i'd just as soon see the skill set continue to expand so that there can never be a ""perfect"" character. i'm not suggesting eve be like other games at all. i'm proposing that there be a mechanic which will allow newers players (yes, like myself) to gain ground on those who have been around for years.as it stands most players with less than two years of game time are at a significant disadvantage in pvp because we lack the ""all level 5"" benefit older players have, where their superior skills give them superior firepower, defense, and ewar capabilities. in identically fit ships, with identically skilled pilots, the older pilot will always win, until you reach the point where it's possible for the younger to have ""perfect"" skills for the ship fitting.i'm not asking to be able to pile on 100 million skill points tomorrow. that would be absurd, both in price and the results in-game. i'd suggest a monthly supply of skill points on the nex, priced so that a plex would be worth somewhere around 1.5-2 million skill points. no more than one plex worth of sp could be bought in a given month, and if you skip a month you'd miss out on that opportunity. if you want to instantly have a fully-skilled character, that's what the bazaar is for.speaking of the bazaar: yes i know this is a tired argument that's been done before. but it's part of the larger picture i'm trying to present here, that skill point microtransactions would not damage the game. if i'm willing to drop the cash on enough plex to purchase a 20 million sp toon, it stands to reason that a similar number of plex (i would say slightly more actually) could allow a player to get the skills they want immediately. this is different than the bazaar because i've invested a year in this toon and don't want to drop it and everything i've built around it just because i put together the isk to buy a different toon with the skill sets i want.how does this fit in the storyline of the eve universe? we can instantly transfer consciousness across the galaxy. we have neural implants to improve major attributes and confer increased abilities. it stands to reason that it would be possible to accelerate education.(continued)"
8/20/2011,"this isn't a game-breaking mechanic. it won't result in a massive crashing of the plex market and everyone having all the skills they want. what it will do is let you skip that 30-day level 5 skill that stands between you and that shiny new ship you've spent months working toward. it will allow newer players who have made the leap into big alliances to quickly improve when they find their skill set lacking. it will give players who have recently realized they noobishly wasted months training skills they didn't need an opportunity to take a leap in the right direction.an added bonus is that this might, might drive up the price of plex, which makes illicit isk sales and the bots that drive them less profitable.i've had two other ideas on this subject that might be worth considering:-selling attribute remaps. let me trade in a plex to get a remap. this was my noobish mistake: remapping too many times trying to figure out what i wanted to do, and locking myself into a mediocre attribute mapping for a year. i'd have gladly turned in a plex to get an extra remap.-selling skill point remaps. instead of selling skill points directly, give us the ability to ""unlock"" 2 million per plex so they can be reassigned. i've talked to a lot of people who say they would love to be able to remap all their industrial skills and other things they acquired in their early days of eve, before they found whatever they've settled into as their corner of the game.if you've been playing eve for more than 3-4 years, probably none of this would affect you except in taking plex off the market. at that age, a couple million sp aren't as signficant to you. for some of us, though, they would make a world of difference in what we can do.added note: seriously, i'm just putting these ideas out there for consideration and to make the debate more productive. this is how i would implement sp purchases if i had to, and an argument in favor of doing so. i do think there's some reason to at least think about this, but i'm not sold on the idea myself. if the system existed i would definitely use it from time to time to get through level 5 training that i needed to advance."
8/20/2011,"you do know that a certain null power block had a benefactor, who was an aluminum tycoon? yeah he poured thousands of dollars in to the game to buy himself a win. it did not pan out of course, he could not buy everyone the skills points to get everyone capitals."
8/20/2011,"why it won't work:not all sp is applicable to everything.take, for example, an new toon with 8m sp, everything is in frigate combat (sans ""forced"" starting skills in something else); now, they come up against an older toon with 80m sp, 60m of which is in industry/mining, and the other 20m spread out across a bunch of ship classes/guns/etc.new guy -> tristan, 8m sp available in frigate combat skillsold guy -> kestrel, 75.5m useless sp (60m industry, 15.5m in cruiser, bc, bs, cross-faction), 4,5m sp available for caldari frigate combat skills..hm, seems the new guy has a bit of an advantage, no?"
8/20/2011,"sure you can cherry-pick a few examples where players haven't developed any combat skills in years...or more likely invent them, because how often is someone with all those skills going to be out in a combat ship they don't really have the skills to fly well?my point stands: all other things being equal, i can't hope to stand against someone with perfect combat skills. we could do the exact same things and they would win because their account is older than mine, allowing them to have the skills to deal more damage while having more hp.i don't want to sound like i'm complaining ""it's not fair."" i don't expect it to be. i accept that there are people who have these skills and know that i can't stand in a fair fight, and i'm fine with that. but it is probably the most compelling argument for the ability to purchase skill points to accelerate training. and the longer eve runs, the more some sort of mechanic will be needed for new players to not simply be overwhelmed by those with nine-digit sp counts. i love our little sandbox and all, but the wider the gap gets between the oldest players and the newest, the harder it gets for new players to feel like they have a chance at becoming something more than a minnow among sharks."
8/20/2011,"which is why i suggested limiting sp purchases to once a month in quantities that would represent maybe a 75% increase in rate of training. you could get that cap ship pilot ready faster, but it would still take a months just to be able to fly the ship, and longer still to train the fitting skills to have an all level 5 pilot."
8/20/2011,"obsidianhow about the organic aliens are some kind of aggressive, man sized, silicon based, sentient alien ant, that has somehow fused with an equaly agressive semi sentient crystaline based fungus. think of that picture in national geographic where that dead ant has fungus growing out of it's head. only now imagine they were actually evolved over a melinia or via a lab experiment into one sentient aggresive antlike creature with fungal attributes. let's say they can live in both freezing and molten temperatures, and can colonize frozen asteroids, or can colonize deep into the crust near the molten mantle of a planets interior. all of that is without a single tool. unfortunately they have tools lots of tools, and big powerful space ships and technology far beyond our own.perhaps this parasitic race used to spread from planet to planet by hitching a ride on other aliens spaceships. slowly spreading from plannet to planet, but somwhere down the line they developed spaceships of their own becoming for lack of a better phrase, a space born disease. jumping a massive pod ship into a system and launching hundreds of of smaller ones and thousands of spore ships in a overwhelming initial attack. unless the pod ship is destroyed before launching it's deadly spores it is usually too late. the obsidian starts by harvesting most of the indigenous populations as incubators for their reproduction cycles and food. (think aliens methodology, not skyline)after a planet or structure has been stripped of all animal life, the mother pod ship moves into position and strip mines the plannets to the point of collapse. leaving behind only the shattered remains of what used to be beautiful thriving worlds.fortunately for us the jove have been fighting off this plague, and humans have never even been aware of it's existence. until i just now spoiled it for everyone. unfortunately. in their quest for perfection the jove have ruined their reproductive organs and their only method of reproducing themselves, cloning is failing because; as anyone who has watched multiplicity knows...a copy of a copy of a copy only tends to get less and less accurate.(an idea for a proper introduction to the obsidian.)jita, near the main trade station.a giant unstable wh the size of a small moon appears. plainly visible for anyone around that station and area to see.you can warp to it and clicking information says the normal class 6 warning. you click jump and it works! but; instead of a normal system you find yourself face to face with what appeares to be a glowing blackish bluish moon. the blue light would pulse every here, and there. the entry point would look like a normal sized wh that would need to be book marked. upon panning the camera, a planet becomes visible, a shattered lava world with huge cracks, and molten effects, surrounded by space debris. clicking on it's information will give you the typical life bearing world description.when you click on the giant glowing moon it gives you the option to warp to it and the option to hail it.if you hail it, it will give you a message that it is not responding and that perhaps the energy field it is encased in is preventing it from doing so. it also notes the pulsing and that it is doing it more frequently.if you warp to it, it fills up about 60% of the visible space and becomes concave seeming to encompass the player giving you the fish in a fishbowl feeling the wh are known for. the plannet doesn't change in appearance. still filling about 25% of the available space.this would be set up this way, and the messages would be designed to make it look like this could very possibly be some kind of colony ship trying to escape a dying world. the messages should all make the player believe that the giant pod ship may be trapped in the pulsating blue energy.2 hours into it's arrival, concord suddenly warns people to stay away from the wh and not to enter it under any circumstances. explaining that the warning comes strait from the jove!this too will be posted in local when you jump in.this should draw a crowd. suddenly concord issues the order to evacuate the system and warns of a possible invasion. the gates in warn you that there is an evacuation taking place and it is inadvisable to proceed.the pulses will have become much more frequent, and the flashing effect will be very noticeable as well as the growing intensity of the light around the ""glowing moon"" ship which is slowly going from bluish to a more silvery appearance.i'm counting on human curiosity and rebellious nature to fuel a growing crowd.continued next post---->"
8/20/2011,"obsidian the next postthis would all be setup so that after about 16 hours the pulsing would have become so intense that the alien ships hull would appear to be made out of the same stuff as the wh and it would be phasing in and out of existence slowly at first and then so fast that it appears out of phase.this would all culminate at peak time when the servers are most loaded with ...witnesses?suddenly the ship would emanate a huge energy wave which would instantly vaporize any ships inside the wh. but not pod them. out side, the wh would suddenly turn blindingly bright for about a split second, as the enormous energy wave explodes into jita, vaporizing any ships around that planet, again not poding them unless they ere just in their pods to begin with. the blast wave would put any pos around that plannets moons into rienfored mode and completley incapacitate all external modules. more noticeably the jita station and any other stations around that plannet would now have new graphics showing massive damage caused by the energy wave. the reason for this is to drive home the point that all of these things were almost instantly destroyed.as soon as the light from the blast wave dies. about how long it takes for everyone to enter their pods; the alien ship inside the wh appears to be growing more concave than ever, and is starting to encompass the ships inside and is even starting to block out the molten planet. out side the wh is transforming into the giant alien ship. suddenly. in jita,a rip in the sky opens, and a huge jove fleet, super capital capitals and all appears,firing instantly before they are even out of the rift in space;firing what appears to be shimmering wh's into the giant wh. a massive concord fleet warps in about 2 seconds later and unleashes hell too. inside the shimmering wh torpedoes emanate along with whatever other weapons, lasers, missiles, etc from the wh entry point, hitting the center of the giant ship which has almost completely encompassed those inside.about 20 seconds later, the giant alien pod is obliterated. on the inside it looks like you are inside an inferno.on the outside, the wh takes on the appearance of a molten fiery ball bubbling and frothing before returning back to it's original wh appearance.inside, the ship is destroyed leaving stars and a system full of destroyed worthless worlds with no resources of anykind to be found. which can now be explored.the jove open another rift, and enter the dead system. they warp to the sun and appear as warp-able in your overview. their giant super capital, capital ships form up and together create what appears to be a small black hole.they then give a speech about the sadness they feel for the inhabitants of this now dead system and the shame they feel for having to destroy it's remains. they explain that the obsidian are just too dangerous to allow even the remote possibility that any if them may still be left in the system. they fire a weird beam at the black hole and it slowly warps towards the star.they explain that they will be collapsing the artificial wh in 15 minutes, and that the system will be destroyed in 20 minutes. they ask that those who do not wish to share it's fate leave the system.the exit becomes warp-able on your overview.those who choose to stay get to see a beautiful scene of the star being anihalated, visible from anywhere in the system. if they are around a planet they will get to see it be torn apart before the shockwave hits them.it should be beautiful.staying true to jove history they are just gone again without any further explanation.after what concord is calling the incident. everything goes back to business as usual. new ships will be bought to replace the ones lost. pos owners can repair their modules and refuel their strontium bays. and the hub stations can be repaired.for many players it will just be some emersion thingy that happened while they were tending to more important things. but for those who wittiness the obsidian event, life in new eden will never be the same.the best part is that while it not only gives people the chance to interact with aliens; it's a one shot deal that doesn't have to be explained or repeated to have a everlasting effect.like the mystery star that appeared for a couple months and then just disappeared, this to would just fade into the back ground.p.s. just a hunch. that mystery star is probably light from the collapse of the star in the system where the other end of the eve gate was; just now reaching new eden. all the wh turning new eden into swiss cheese, is probably a side effect.and ccp probably got the idea to make the wh look like they do after hilmar accidentally dropped his fushigi on his head.;)"
8/20/2011,i don't know. when i read it back in 7th grade in 93. it seemed to show how they would come into conflict with reality but always ended up obseving them in some degree. like the robot constructor that wouldn't let the man do what he wanted because he was endangering himself even though it was killing him by keeping him confined to a building with dwindling air supply. or where they enslaved humanity to keep humanity from destroying itself. but like i said 93. there is allot of fog between then and now so mayby i'm missing the one where they tried to make man extinct. i remember they were kind of boring but thanks now i have to re read them just so i can feel smart again. ;(

8/20/2011,"results / consequences:- warfare will be more realistic in the sense that you fight for the enemy resources/treasures. and you will also be making a ""win all or loose all"" gamble.- gives mercenaries and 'bounty hunters' a reliable income and a nice career.- a global ladder system, with nice isk reward along the way and also at the end.- smaller groups of people can take on bigger groups and win a handsome reward for their efforts.- big powerful alliances will think twice before declaring war on a smaller group (becuase they will have more on the line)- the more successful a corp is at winning war declarations the more it will be challenged by others.- if a big group targets a small group and looses, the victem would get a nice pay.the basics:- to declare war on somebody one has to put at risk what is in the corp wallet into ""the pot"", the victem will be forced to invest all his corp money too. the winner gets what is in the pot.- what determines who wins the war? once the war has started, the team that has inflicted the most damage (isk wise) in a weeks time wins. there is however going to be a way to win wars without having to wait a week. depending on how much isk in the pot there is going to be a certain ""standard"" assigned to the war, whichever team is the first to reach certain objectives/goals of the standard will win. (example of such an objective might be to inflict a certain isk damage within a certain time). the bigger the pot the higher the standard.- escalation: once you win the war and you have gained the money. you will not be able to make a withdrawl for 24-48 hours. this means other people can observe the amount of money that is dwelling in escrow, and they will be able to challenge you for the money.- never ending escalation? once the the pot has grown up to a certain amount of isk (like 1-100 bil isk) there will be something called a 'higher standard' and if the objectives of the standard are achieved, you will be able to make a withdrawl of the money. (i.e. inflict a certain isk dmg within a certain time)- you get 'respect points' every time you win wars. respect points is a way to sweeten the pot for every war declaration, it is a permanent bonus that you will bring to every war. in other words respect points are a permanent isk in your corp wallet.- other corps can join in on the war as 'allies' by investing equal amount of isk into the pot as the original two corps that were fighting.other fun consequences:- mercs: fight for one of the teams and take a percentage of the payout. whether the team you were fighting for wins or looses, you still get your cut, but if your team wins then you get your bonus.- bounty hunters: you get a opportunity to participate in the war dec that your target is in. (also mercs and bounty hunters should have the chance to quickly leave any wars they involve themselves, less commitment and more of a drop-in style of pvp)rough draft, ideas welcome"

8/20/2011,"...decisions beat numbersit should always be the case that inferior numbers can win with superior decision-making. large fleets should be much less about who has the most ships and much more about who has the smartest commanders and sub-commanders.active componentsintelligence-gathering should not be a purely passive occupation. there should be plenty of opportunities for gatherers to take a more active stance, either to take shortcuts in gathering the intel, or to act on it right away and sabotage or otherwise mess with the enemy's stuff. there should though always be the risk of getting caught, and having your patrol cut short on top of the usual drawbacks of eg getting shot. this serves to make intel-gathering a little more interesting and engaging.bigger ships/fleets travel sloweras the amount of power your fleet can deploy increases, its mobility should decrease. small, flimsy fleets should always maintain a mobility advantage over big, dangerous ones. this ensures that a wider range of fleet compositions and sizes remain valuable, catering to more preferences and playstyles. it also makes fleet composition more a case of selecting the right tools, and less of just dumping the whole toolbox onto the floor, encouraging players to innovate tactically and strategically.moving large volumes should be a group efforthigh-volume shipments should be a special occasion, and as much as possible we should encourage them to be a group activity. these tend to be high-value shipments also, and bringing players together to appreciate and protect the value created, and put them in a position where they're likely to interact with other groups, is a positive thing."

8/21/2011,"i just can't resist flawed arguements:then you're saying that mining, scanning, hacking, archeology, etc. implants shouldn't be destroyed either?let 'em all burn! (yes, monocles are self-desribed implants)"
8/21/2011,"i propose a new ship type that will fill the void between transport ships, and freighters.i would suggest a ""cargo ship"". no slots, but give it bonuses equal to that of freighters, but still keep it about 1/2 the max a freighter can hold.the amount of cargo hold difference between a transport, fully trained, and a freighter, stock, is huge. i believe thereis a good spot in the middle for new players wanting to get into courier/hauling, but cant afford a full fledged freighter.plus of course, it opens up more manufacturing, blueprint research, etc.i honestly cant think of any downside to a ""cargo ship"". as long as it follows in the footsteps of freighters in thatits made for one thing only, hauling freight. no slots, just like freighters, but cheaper, and can only hold 1/2 the amount of cargo.thoughts?"
8/21/2011,"yeah. what if it could run mining links, and also store ships in a ship hanger?orca already does this."
8/21/2011,"no no... i am talking specialized sub-freighter ship.orca has its purpose, to help mining ops, but there is no dedicated hauler in-between a transport ship, and a freighter."
8/21/2011,"instead of a new ship class, why not just make a budget version of the current freighters?like the orca is to the roqual.and make them use the same skills, eg, for the mini charon: cal freighter lvl 1, since they are working to freighter anyway, and this way they only need to add 4 ships, instead of 4 ships, new market sub-menu and 4 skills.the 5% speed bonus should changed to a agility bonus, to make getting into warp faster, and because we can warp to 0, so a speed bonus is unnecessary,as for the cargo space, 1/3 of the current freighters would be better, as not to encroach to much on the current freighters.and they should warp at 1.5 au/s, instead of 0.75 au/s to make getting around faster, and since they carry less.as for the rest, yes, they should have the same restrictions as the current freighters.the orca also needs other skills then a freighter, and carries less then the proposed budget freighter."
8/21/2011,"the only reason i did not suggest this, is being 1/2 the size, or 1/3 as you recommend, is they would no longer be in thecapital size demographic. they would be closer to the size of a battleship, but for hauling only.i agree to this as well. 1/3 is ok, that can maybe get trained up to 1/2 cargo room of a non-trained freighter?the agility bonus, as well as a 1.5au/s warp speed, also goes with being 1/2 the size (or 1/3 in your suggestion)."
8/21/2011,"while you do have a decent idea here, it would be more prudent of you to make your own proposal thread. thanks for supporting my idea but your post is a little off topic. on a side note, since i have no idea how missiles work, i rarely use them myself, if someone knowledgeable on citadel launchers could comment on them please do."
8/21/2011,"not a bad thought, though i fear the counter is maybe a little bit overpowered.setup: 10 dreads vs 10 titans.result: 0 dreads, 5 titans.the people flying titans would lose about 250 bil, while the dread loss is maybe max 20 bil.maybe implementing a high cost for the special warfare module would be in order, 4-7 bil maybe?i like your idea though, even if prices of dreads won't change, it will give people who don't have access to supers a chance to fight against an alliance with a large super force."
8/21/2011,"let me give you a battle scenario if my plan goes into effect. our 500 man hellcat fleet goes in to take down sbus. all of a sudden drf jumps in 50 mother ships and 20 titans, we start losing battleships in droves, with no recourse, we are eating away at the enemy nyx but they are holding reps. we try and buy time while we move our hictors and dictors in place, once we get a bubbles on them we bring your dreads in, finally we start breaking their tank and they start losing motherships. but what is this? a cyno gets lit right in the middle of our dreads and in jumps their abandon fleet, we only have 30 dreads on the field, within a few minutes we have already lost a couple. however, you have also devastated their super cap fleet, they have already lost half of their mother ships. before the baddon fleet can kill off our dread fleet we jump in our super caps, and begin the work of dismantling their abaddon fleet. whats left of our sub cap fleet is working on theirs at the moment and finally we can focus on their dreads they just jumped in. both sides are pulling in reinforcements constantly. however, on the other side of the map a black ops fleet has effectively cut off their reinforcements using a currently non existent mobile jump jammer. (new idea?) the only thing they can take into battle now is more dreads and carriers and supers. but they know that the battle is lost, since they cannot reenforce their abaddon fleet. they chose not to throw more away. by the time the jammers get taken down the drf fleet has dwindled, heavy losses on both sides but since the drf so foolishly put their faith in super blobs, they have lost trillions. instead of escalating the battle in an effective fashion by putting in place their sub cap fleet first they lost the battle and possibly the war. the beginning of the battles from then on out were always decided by an effective sub cap fleet, the side that could hold the field with sub cap fleet, and when a side starts to lose the advantage in a key system they have no choice but to support the sub cap fleet with carriers and inexpensive effective alternative to supers, that can easily turn the side of a sub cap battle. or what have you.the thing is, from then on out battle escalation is always started with sub caps, and the possibilities for how you escalate the battle to your advantage is endless. everyone will have an effective role in the battles and the skill of an fc will matter greatly in a fight, rather than just having numbers."
8/21/2011,these sp for cash threads are like std's they keep coming back and you cant kill them! dam you std's!!!!!!!
8/21/2011,"first off in most alliances you do not have 2000 to 5000 low sp mouth breathing ******s that can barely fly a rifter (bort).but if someone, that had the money, could effectively get a minimum of 10% of the alliance to have the skills to be a skill effective cap pilot. that would be a huge boost for the alliance to get an additional 200 to 500 new cap pilots using the average numbers i gave.this creates your imbalance."

8/21/2011,"life time subs have a way of popping up, when an mmo is on it's last legs. we are far from that stage, even with the current issues.but this is a bad idea because of the loss of revenue, something of which ccp is having problems with atm or so it seems."
8/21/2011,"eve online is probably one of these games that has a lot of loyal vets, lifetime subs for loyal customers wouldn't be a good deal for ccp.also, there is a lot of isk in game, they can purchase plex on the market, that means someone buys them with real life money first.when lifetime subs are introduced, think how much this would affect the plex market. demand for plex goes down, prices go down, less people will buy plex to sell to compensate the balance = less revenue for ccp."
8/21/2011,"does this mean sto was on its last legs before it had even come out :-poh wait, it was :-p"

8/21/2011,i can accept this proposal because it wouldn't effect me. i would just set up a device that would move my mouse around in a circle when i go afk for hours at a time. i love making carebears cower in fear. this would just make it even more effective.
8/21/2011,"indeed, a well flown curse will ruin anyone's day, including a falcon/rook. back to the topic though, i agree they shouldn't be nerfed like that. given that pirate faction bs for the same price is typically superior in most respects anyways, giving marauders enough sensor strength to not get perma jammed by a single flight of ec-300's wouldn't be a major game changer. it would just make another class of ships viable. i fully support violencing your vargur or kronos, thus i support this proposal."
8/21/2011,problem with a marauder is that its a logistics and damage dealer in one ship (have the paladin in mind). with normal sensor capabilities it could quickly emerge to something which encourages blobs like supercarriers - just a different shipclass. there was a alliance tournament match with a set of 3 paladins if remember correctly. they tanked the other fleet until they lost the lock.
8/21/2011,"you've forgotten the other problem with marauders in pvp: they're just not that amazing compared to t1 battleships. a hac will have anywhere from 2-3x as much ehp as the corresponding cruiser, along with significantly higher dps. marauders on the other hand have ehp along the lines of a rokh or abaddon, and their dps is nothing special by battleship standards.then you've got pirate faction battleships which are in roughly the same kind of price range, and are vastly superior.so yeah, even if they had decent sensor strength, could you really justify flying a marauder in pvp over the other options?"

8/21/2011,"i see where your coming from dut but i think if you just made it easier to fight back by reducing docking range, giving neutral reppers an agression timer and maybe increase station agression timers to 2 or 3 minutes."
8/21/2011,"mobile jump jammers. they work like cyno jammers, and they show up on the overview like cynos, and they can prevent titans or other black ops from opening jump bridges in a system. they can be taken out, but the few minutes they can keep the enemy from supplying reinforcements, turning the tide of a battle. this would not prevent cynos from being lit, it would just prevent titans and black ops from connecting to cynos in other systems. another idea since you would have to be uncloaked to light it, you could also have it not show up on the overview and have to scan down the ship to kill it. just an idea. the black ops ships themselves are already expensive, and the jammer could also be equally expensive, since the jammer would most definitely get killed, it would prevent them from being abused to the point where you could down a system for hours. once you lose two that's already 3 bil ish. they might need a strong tank and with possible local rep bonuses to be able to stay up for about a minute rather than just insta pop when a fleet finds them. the jammer would also not take down an active bridge, nor would they effect anchored jump bridges."

8/22/2011,"you know it would be pretty difficult to infiltrate any organization if all roles could be restricted to one particular item.what you're failing to see here is that maybe roles were probably meant to be ""dangerous""."

8/22/2011,"i can't resist flawed logic. when did i say that implants shouldn't be destroyed. in referring to the fact that learning/pvp implants help ones ability to kill, i can't see where it says that this should exempt carebear implants from destruction. pull your head out of your ass and read the comments before you quote them. the only ones comparing monocles to implants are the forum warriors, and choosing to describe them as implants doesn't make them so, just like calling onself a pvper doesn't make one a pvper."
8/22/2011,"i agree with op in that if you get podded, these vanity items should get destroyed with them, or conversely the cost of implants should be increased and be allowed to survive podding, because its inconsistent as is. although id rather see the former than the later, because theres no point at all to podding someone if they dont lose their implants... infact, podding would then be prefered because it would send you back to home system to reship quicker at no cost.so basically yeah, podding should destroy the vanity items."
8/22/2011,"nah, you took the stance of let it go already which argues for the status quo and supported that with the dichotomy of implants add to ones ability to kill whereas monocles just add to the satisfaction. your argument thus favored the status quo of monocles being indestructible because they provided no ability to kill -- incidentally, neither do the implants i listed.evidently you need to pull your head out of your ass and read the comments before quoting them because im making no comparison, only stating fact that in its own item description it calls itself an implant  dont be so hard on yourself forum warriorbut now that you are saying implants should be destroyed, im so glad i could convince you that monocles (which are implants as seen in the description) should be destructable. gold star for you, kiddo!"

8/22/2011,there have been many pay for sp proposals...i like the proposal it's not a new idea by any means but maybe its improperly approached.it needs balance (not with our wallets) but with more of an ingame expanse.say a special line of missions is developed where u earn a certain type of lp. when you complete the set of missions you will have aquired enough of a certain lp to exchange it for sp from the npc mission provider. the lp store could have item requirements like the lp stores now this would be the case here. the requirements are 1 plex and a certain amount of lp from the mission a mission that would only be available only once a year.i say plex because its now a tradeable game item and it generates income for expansions. example:mission: all mission are a(solo type) this is for individualsmissions: choose 1 category and only 1 there are no repicks/redo and they only become available once a year similar to remaps. once a mission is started it has an experation date.lvl 1-1 room mission-easy and provides 1000 lpslvl 2-2 rooms-moderate 2k lpslvl 3-3 rooms-hard 3k lpslvl 4-4 rooms-very tough 4k lpslvl 5-5 rooms-extremely difficult 5k lpslp store:requirements: 100 lp = 100k sp50mil + 100 lp = 100k sp redeemable and allocatable (lp and sp never expire) 1plex + 1000 lp = 1mil sp-plex + ---- lp = -mil spetc......

8/22/2011,"i have suggested such a ship. it soul dbe easier to fly than orca/freighter, no slots and just a tiny amount more hit points than a regular industrial and less than a blokade runner-so it will be easy to suicide gank. d3"

8/22/2011,it's called an orca.... we do not need yet an another ship.

8/22/2011,"+1 for this. i like this idea a lot actually. i know personally, i'm part of a corp that does enough mining for it to be a pain to haul the ore between systems in an orca but not enough to really justify dropping 800m on a freighter, despite having the ne"

8/22/2011,"out of all the horrible, asinine ideas that get proposed in this part of the forum, this is one of the few i find to actually be a decently good idea. although, admittedly, i would much rather the supercap counter be a subcap option rather than putting more capitals on the field, as even the grind into a dread can be rather arduous and i'd like to see eve be more egalitarian than it currently is where people dont have to have a corporate sponsorship to get into the more powerful pvp ships. but, if ccp were to institute something similar to what youre proposing, i would accept it with a minimum level of grumbling."
8/22/2011,"i personally, don't think a dread is that hard to get into, but maybe that's because i can already use them. an individual could train the necessary skills in less than a year, but with my proposal, there doesn't need to be many dreads on the field to suppress other supers. the most important ship on the field would become the sub cap, thus allowing more people to feel more important in fleets. we could possibly even see battle cruisers and cruisers become a more integral part of fleets as well, because taking out battleships would be the primary goal of the fc, and supers would be preoccupied with dreads and other supers to go after sub caps. using my idea capitals would become a much smaller part of fleet composition, and probably not even used in small to medium fleet battles. now addressing corporate sponsorship to get into supers, an individual would have minimal ability to protect their own super by themselves. supers are made to protect corporate assets, my idea is to make it risky to take out supers in any situation. last thing this game needs is more people getting into more powerful ships."
8/22/2011,your proposal has merit and bears further investigation. d3
8/22/2011,"i like what i see as a whole. dreads see very minimal use outside of structure bashing, and even then, they aren't usually fielded because of the 10 minute timer on siege mode. as they are now, in siege mode, the phoenix (top of the dreads) puts out a reasonable 7950 dps (4x cn bcs, meta citadel torp launchers, standard kinetic rounds in siege mode at all level 5, no drones/rigs included) but at the cost of being stuck in place for 10 minutes, so in many situations, they're left off.i like the idea of a separate ""shoot even bigger things"" siege module of sorts. other options i'd throw out is adding 2 highs (turret/launcher hardpoints) and 1 mid or low slot to all the dreads. also perhaps a 5% resists per level bonus? (i know, that'd be 3 bonuses per level, so what? they're capital ships) make them a little hardier than they are right now, and perhaps see use. but make whatever it is specific to dreads, not allowed on titans.and as far as making something available to all, dreads can be built in empire. just hop on into a low-sec station and build it, making this available to the masses, not just the big sov holders."
8/22/2011,"there has to be some effort and some risk involved, and in my opinion even dreads are pretty cheap if they would be designed to kill supers.dreads are also in heavy need of a new purpose as mentioned at fanfest, so this idea kinda hits ""2 birds with 1 stone"".this is currently the problem:many supers together is the next ""i win"" button, currently overpowered and unstoppable unless faced with an equal or larger super capital force.one thing is for sure, wars shouldn't be solely decided by whoever logs in the most supers.this idea brings back some options and balance.for example:i would make sure i have my anti dread fleet ready before i bring out my super capital fleet.the enemy can anticipate this and bring a counter to the anti dread fleet, in turn i could anticipate that and bring a counter to that as well.the point is, a wider range of ships become important at a certain stage.it's fun if people feel they can make a difference in their ship, and fun is what it's eventually all about."
8/22/2011,"i think this could work, although the numbers need to be retweaked heavily.still, a cautious thumbs up."
8/22/2011,"this is what we need, i don't know if dreads are the answer for it but i like the thinking behind it."
8/22/2011,"this is assuredly not a new idea...it's been proposed many times by myself included and ccp tends to just ignore it. i however support ""your"" idea. =d"

8/22/2011,"no, sorry not even i will side with you on this one-even to troll. also the bleach."
8/22/2011,"its been said by many other people on this thread already, but i wanted to add another voice for emphasis just in case ccp for some god awful reason thinks this would be a good idea...no, no, hell no.confirmed that op should go drink bleach."
8/22/2011,"funny story mate, i can't fly combat ships well. yet, i still find myself in them from time to time (mission to get standing, or tackle frig, or ""i can sorta give some dps... please chribba don't let them shoot me!"").i have a plan around here somewhere... you can be at level 4 (80% ""max skills"") in one month for a rifter. no, you won't have ""all"" of the useful skills (it's missing web/point and other various things... i built it from the certificates recommended for said rifter), but those take another few days at most.the plan leaves you at most 5-10% behind a ""max skills"" pilot. rifter base stats:structure -- 336armour -- 351shield -- 391so, you'll be down (at most, sans implants...) structure -- 33.6armour -- 35.1shield -- 39.1total -- 107.8 hpi don't have eft here to check, but i'm pretty sure this amounts to about 1-3 seconds difference in survivability (yes, you can get 50+ dps off a rifter... and that's probably generously low). in other words, one of two things will determine the survivor:1. survivor got the rep timing right.2. defeated guy missed the survivor once. first -- if it's a ""fair"" fight, someone made a mistake . after that, total sp is not an indicator of how well a pilot may be in a combat situation. yeah, you can (usually) assume that an older character has their core skills trained to 5 across the board, but that's about it.it is completely likely that any miner/industrialist you come across has the vast majority of sp in those skill trees. it is completely likely that a pvp pilot has most everything trained to four, five if it was a prereq. level 5 takes significantly longer than 1-4 combined... so it's a matter of ""is that 5% important, or should i get 20% better in something else related?"""
8/22/2011,"one month to be merely competent with a rifter, and with no tackle at that.and folks wonder why so many people try eve and don't even play out the whole trial period before they get bored with it and go away."
8/22/2011,i don't wonder - they quit about the same time the realize they can't buy their way to max level or grind to it in a few days.what i wonder is why so many people who obviously don't like the game continue to pay for subscriptions and play it.
8/22/2011,"does the truth hurt so much that you need to lash out at the messenger?because it is the truth. eve was always a hard game to get started in, and changes they've made lately have only made it harder.if you want to watch your character get better instead of making your character get better, i might suggest progress quest as a cheaper alternative to eve."
8/22/2011,"this would allow character farms to be cheaper which is badcould crash plex priceseve has growth, but its slow, lifetime sub's are usually for mmo's that dont need a lot to be profitable or its a special offer for only the first month of the game opening.it would hurt eve, not help it =\"
8/22/2011,"the csm's role does not encompass the business side of ccp to that degree. also ""lifetime"" subs as earlier poster pointed out-crop up towards the end cycle of a game. as same poster also mentioned-we are far from that point. thank you for bringing up a change you would like to see however, as any input is better than none-even if we can't even hope to get that one done. d3"
8/22/2011,"whatever happened to the quarterly economic newsletter?the last qen i can find is from q4 2010. q1 2011 should have been out over a month ago.i am particularly concerned to see the subscription numbers, as in-game signs (e.g. concurrency numbers on the login screen) seem to indicate the subscription base is shrinking drastically."
8/22/2011,"excellent, very entertaining. with a few little changes, you could turn it into a personal story instead of a 3rd person view and place that in the proper sub forum as well as enter it into the creative writing contest that's happening right now."
8/22/2011,"i have argued against every afk cloaker crybaby post i have come acrossed, i absolutly despise them.this isn't that. i think the timer needs a tweak. other than the timer i don't see any risk to any afk cloaker, including myself.the advantage of wh type local more than makes up for the logout timer. the way it's set up now forces cloakers to go afk for long periods of time to utilize the only advantage a cloaked ship has. surprise.the only cloakers that can even pose a threat to an alert pilot are the ones that can use covert ops cloaks. and those have so many counters and disadvantages that they don't require. the super nerf of showing up in local.they have already extensively tested it in wh space and it works fine. even for care bears."
8/22/2011,"the whole point of people going afk cloaky is denial of ratting due to the presence of the person visible in local. if you eliminate local, then you eliminate the reason people go afk cloaky, thus making the timer needless.the big problem with your proposal is that a) local has uses beyond allowing ratters to stay safe, such as allowing fleets to know who is with them in system and eliminating this tool would make fleet coordination in nullsec a nightmare and b) the reason there is no local in wh space is because the rewards there are much greater. if you eliminate local, you make isk generating activities in nullsec more dangerous and would need to therefore increase rewards for those activities accordingly, but if you do that then you completely eliminate any difference between wh space and nullsec, thus making wh space little more than glorified npc nullsec.i prefer it as is where you have several tiers of risk/reward available depending on how you want to go with it, and eliminating local would eliminate the tiers, where you'd essentially just have high sec and other."
8/22/2011,i wouldn't mind a afk indicator. there have been many times i make an attempt to talk to someone or its the other way around and they're left hanging.
8/22/2011,"i don't know, faction battleships are very prices, mauraders arnt as much but then again, in nullsec prices are wtf differnt, each ship has a ew bonus in some way, paladin gets a web bonus golem has target painters. maybe they wont be used much anyways but how about this why not let the option be out there?i dont see the point of not simple changing the stats to be in line with the t1 counterparts, it wouldnt damage much maybe a few more will be lost cause people used them in pvp."
8/22/2011,"marauders are the king of pve... these ships have a role, a widely widely used role. golems are everywhere (and paladins, vargurs and the occasional kronos. wtb railgun buff)no one said every ship has to be capable of doing everything. you don't see scorpions in pve, or hyperions in.... much of anything really, and pirate faction ships outside of angels in 0.0 pvp, but anyways reduced sensor strength ""makes sense"" in a lore sort of way, as they have thicker armor, so sensors are weaker going through that. i like that pve has jammers, there needs to be some drawback to the marauders (wtb more scramblers in pve, needs more risk)there's a long list of ships that are rarely flown for anything at all, like eafs (except kitsune), black ops, half the t1 cruisers, frigates, many assault frigates, etc. if the goal is to make every ship usable for every purpose, (hint: it's not) then there's a long list of other ships that need work too."
8/22/2011,"i support this idea. i know they didnt want marauders used in pvp, but this weakness has rendered them useless for pve when used against guristas who jam, essentially making them useless for any function if you do missions that involve guristas or live in regions that involve gurista ratting. i think the cost alone should make it rather impractical for pvp."
8/22/2011,its called 'balance'. i suggest trying to learn about it.
8/22/2011,"i'd like to see more marauders in pvp, and this is the un-nerf to achieve this. since the marauder active tanking bonuses are worth squat in larger fleets, this is actually an incentive to small gang pvp. also, more marauders being blown up is always a good thing."
8/22/2011,"you might want to take a look at my post above - even with a better sensor strength marauders are pretty lol for their price, and they get completely stomped by pirate faction bs."
8/22/2011,"you realize that is one more reason to un-nerf them, right?"
8/22/2011,the cost of a ship is irrelevant to it's ability. marauders are not intended for pvp and the fact you think it needs sensor strength adjusting because of it's price is naive at best.
8/22/2011,"i agree 100% that it was better to be able to see the players standings, for a few reasons. you could tell if someone was really a bear or not and tracking them was a bit easier without using an agent."
8/22/2011,"yes, pleaseit will also help us to hunt bots"
8/22/2011,i disagree with almost everything op said.
8/22/2011,"0 aur, 1000 aur... the actual value stays the same. zero and just a waste of screen estate. even worse that aur is a personalized commodity with no means of direct transferral, and with prices in the nex store it's practically a given that even if you use the aur to purchase something there's always a leftover amout of practically the dollars you donated to ccp."
8/22/2011,"uhhhh... why exactly would you want to nerf missiles again? they are already underpowered in that they are one of the lower dps weapons available and that dps is on a delay thus rendering them practically useless in larger pvp fleets that required coordinated target calling. projectiles are another issue, but missiles are already weak enough as is..."
8/22/2011,"its not exactly a nerf, because the less missiles you load on to your launchers, the more volley dmg you will do, but overall dps will drop because of the multiple reloads that you would have to do."
8/22/2011,a reduction in overall dps would infact be considered a nerf.... and you never addressed my original point that missiles already suck as is.
8/22/2011,"the idea is that what you call a 'nerf' or what i call 'overall drop of dps' will be a choice of style, it cannot be considered a nerf if you are out doing guerilla tactics on a big fleet, you wont afford to stay in the same place for a long time, because then you would get omfg ganked. so its only a nerf if you decide to load up to little ammo on your launchers in a normal fight.and to adress the missile suck issue, i'd say yes they suck in certain situations that are common, but tactically missiles provide a very important role, and that role states that you cannot have imba damage output"
8/22/2011,hell yea great idea. make a shill for salavaging clones.
8/22/2011,i support the idea of ravaging corpses for financial gain.
8/22/2011,"i support this to a very limited degree. there should be some kind of accelerator up until they reach 5 or 6 mil sp, at which point it cuts off. that way new people can get to a functional, but not advantageous, point rather quickly, and the old vets get to keep their advantage while increasing the number of prey available."
8/22/2011,"if you want to be a 100% carefree miner living in a gumdrops and rainbows carebear land of utter safety, then stay in your npc corp and organize mining ops from there free from war decs. no need to change game mechanics to accommodate op's desire to avoid any semblance of danger."
8/22/2011,"i think bo are pretty marginal as they stand and would love to see a buff for them. the buff i would like to see is covert cynos in hisec, and i assure you i am not alone in this desire. should coverts be allowed in hisec-bo would have a new and fun expanded capability."
8/22/2011,"while i agree with you that supers will soon be at a tipping point that imo, will be bad for new eden, i do not think that a balancing measure will require the creation of a new ship class etc. i am not anti-supers, but we will sooner than later, see the first 100+ titan fleet. this is not good with current mechanics for what should be obvious reasons. i would love to see an upper limiting factor for supers though, and your post about power cores is a good one.(minus the creation of new ship class imo) thanks for posting. d3"
8/22/2011,"i think it is unfortunate you feel this way. i assure you the csm works hard on a very large number of important issues. if you saw what efforts are put forth into every segment of the game by the csm you may not feel the same. while i won't touch specifics-things are being hashed out. if the players want to make more of a difference, they should vote. d3"
8/22/2011,do we get a choice on what form of acid it gets dissolved in?
8/22/2011,"if you want to see the csm ran in a different way and feel that a lot of people agree with you, then announce your candidacy, start organizing, and campaigning to run for yourself. otherwise this whole argument that ""boo-woo theyre only on the csm because more people voted for them its not fair1!11"" is rather unconvincing.so basically, if you don't like it, then start doing something about it or shut up and stop mindlessly whining without offering any alternatives."
8/22/2011,"what do you mean ""turning into""? many thought that they had turned this way around csm2."
8/22/2011,"heh, take away abc from wh space and also remove local from null sec then lets see who cries more"
8/22/2011,"the only real benefit that is doable here is the object rendering part. missiles contribute to lag and would be nice if they didn't. however, missiles have a great advantage over guns in that they always hit. the ability to destroy missiles in flight or warp off as a volley is released is a nice balance to guns. i don't think you will be seeing this change in eve for this reason. d3"
8/22/2011,"while missiles always hit, the dps is reduced by the factors above, explosion velocity, and lack of criticals. i consider that to be more than balancedas for the destruction of missiles mid-flight, i believe that would be better tempered by making tracking disruption ecm affect the explosion velocity. not only would that remove the ineffective system of defender missiles but buff ecm and standardize it"
8/22/2011,"people keep getting this terrible notion that they can fly solo successfully. even han solo didn't become a name almost everyone knows because he single-handedly defeated evil. if you really have to put a moral to a story like star wars, it is that teamwork defeats evil/bullies."
8/23/2011,partial updateplease head over to features and ideas section here and contribute to the 0.0 stuff.
8/23/2011,"i stumbled across this thread while searching for info on whether ccp have ever considered increasing the frequency of neural remaps. i've got to say, eve veterans are easily the weirdest gamers i've ever encountered in any online game i've played. the way people throw around the term ""instant gratification"" is actually hilarious. only an eve veteran would say it's instant gratification to want to fly x ship fitted a certain way with such-and-such support skills in, say, 100 days rather than 110. nobody in this thread is talking about a remap after every skill completion.i'm not in love with paying for remaps either, but it's about the only thing i would pay for. really, i just think they should reduce the neural remap cooldown to 6 months so that everybody benefits from it, and these bitter vets can stop accusing the rest of us of being ccp shills as a debate tactic."
8/23/2011,"to boost industrial production in 0.0 - make it possible to cash in your r&d points with an agent at any station or outpost, and change outposts so that you can invent and build in the same outpost. it's the only way to get people producing t2 in 0.0 rather than just shipping everything in from jita. also alter moon balances in different regions for basic low-level materials, so that it's possible to build any race's t2 more easily. may also want to consider making it possible to refine and process small amounts of moon goo in an outpost, rather than limited to those who can afford the time and effort to run a whole chain of moon extraction pos'es and a large refining pos. you want more grassroots production, rather than having the extremely high barrier to entry on t2 production in 0.0 as it currently stands.all nerfing jb's, and jf's will do is make people spend more time shipping stuff in, with longer and more complex logistical chains, as it will still be easier than producing in 0.0 as things currently stand.more carrot, less stick."

8/23/2011,"as far as i'm concerned, the only bone i have to pick with the warp mechanic is how we warp through planets and other celestials.my solution would be to alow curved warping. it's a stupid concept to explain, so here's some art please visit your user settings to re-enable images.the red line is the current warp path from station a to station b.the purple line is the proposed warp path from station a to station b.now, for most of us, i'm sure warp travel is envisioned as a point to point straight line travel system. unfortunately that kind of system would only allow for two solutions:1. you need to warp from point to point to point to get around a celestial.2. ccp would have to adjust all the celestials so you could warp to any of them without passing through another celestial. that would prove nigh on impossible.choose your poison, personally i'd rather sacrifice straight line warp to save time accelerating and decelerating by having curved wormhole-ish warping."
8/23/2011,"if it is accepted that afk cloaking is zero risk then something needs to be done, the difficult thing is what?removing local, would require the afk pilot to simply type something into local every 10 minutes or so to have the same effect as letting everyone know he is around, this does not introduce any more risk but is now semi afk. perhaps a system that enables you to find the pilot with time and effort but then all the pilot would need do is move from safe spot to safe spot every x minutes. a common practice by non cloaky ships, this introduces, a small amount of risk but i would say its not exactly a balance if all the pilot has to do is move every twenty minutes or so this provides as above a small amount of risk and semi afk status.one option that would increase the risk and deal with the afk is a random probe success anywhere from 3 minutes to say 20 minutes that would give a guarantee warp point by use of a specialised trained for probe. this gaurantees risk and ensures afk is not an option. imho"
8/23/2011,"actually, it causes a single problem: they might kill you. unless they're afk, in which case they're completely harmless."
8/23/2011,damn it. we totaly should remove trading. and production. and invention. and planetary interaction. and research. and corp tax...........
8/23/2011,"the idea isn't to completely take away the effectiveness of cloaking - merely to give players a way to fight back against stealth targets - defend their systems, engage cloaked convoys, track down that titan that is cloaked and trying to log out...but as i said - it makes it more difficult - and obviously, the idea of this thread is to make it more difficult for the cloaked individual.now, of course, you can warp around and avoid being detected. however, it does generally take time to manage warping, however minute, and that requires setting up warp points to warp to, as well as using them.if you really wanted to stick it to them (the cloaker) though and equal things out, all ccp would have to do (and this would probably require a decent amount of coding change) would be to reset the scanning progress of each signature every time that someone enters warp. every time the cloaker warps, he has to start scanning again. this would seriously cripple the ability to find a site to attack - and certainly increase the amount of time.however, it should be noted that most people are too lazy to enter warp, over and over again - and that the detector class destroyer, in this case, would have the advantage - it only has to find the cloaked target once.one thing to note is that a cloaked harassment ship is often smaller than the large ships that capsuleers use to rat or mine in. they would be harder to detect due to their small signature radius - except that the cloaked probes are not looking for an exact location - merely something within maybe 50-100km of the target.the cloaked ship can still warp away after this - but its cloaking device will be disabled for a period of time, which does make it susceptible to having its pinpoint location scanned down.does this mean the ship will be caught?no.can ccp take this one step further and say that the pulse would actually temporarily offline the navigational computer of the ship, preventing it from warping out? if the ship had in fact used a cloaking device in x so many seconds (as a minimum, due to the cloaking delay of some ships being zilch), it could do just that.but any changes to the cloaking system or detecting cloakies would change much more than just searching for 'afk cloakies', and any changes in the system should be made to remember that.imagine, cloaking a titan, being found, and not being able to jump out for 20-30 seconds as a result?or being in a stealth-bomber gatecamp fleet (which are very popular for some alliances!) and suddenly having your entire fleet of stealth bombers unable to warp away while a battleship group comes through the gate.or even getting caught this way while flying one of those cloaking blockade runners... might be worth getting concorded to prevent a runner's escape in highsec!pros and cons aside, this would certainly be one way to bring more pvp fleets into contact.stealth cookie, anyone? cloakies!"
8/23/2011,"you forgot to mention quafe sales. my character drinks 3,924 24oz bottles of quafe a day while i am offline, and the number continues to grow daily. do you know how long i have to grind to make enough isk to satisfy her addiction? i say no quafe, and she just goes and starts drinking again as soon as i log off! it's a never-ending battle!"
8/23/2011,"really. hmph.the problem isn't cloakers, whether they are at their console or not.covops ships are already gimped regarding pvp, and don't pose a significant threat to well prepared players.the problem is cynos.if any ship in space can become an entire fleet in less time than a reasonably fit/skilled opponent can kill it when it is right next to them, that is a problem.covops players should need to act, well, covertly to get their job done. flying right up to your target and decloaking with less ship than is needed to get the job done isn't very covert. the seals would laugh in your face if you suggested such a tactic to them.put a one minute timer on cynos, allow specialized ships bonuses to cut that in half. people will adopt new tactics to deal with it (at least the ones who aren't too stuck on having them as an iwin button with little risk)."
8/23/2011,"really? cause if i told them that one guy could charge in, place 40 tanks in the room from across the country, and loose nothing but his t-shirt, they would ask me where to sign up for that."
8/23/2011,"well yeah, but that one guy *still* wouldn't show his face if he didn't have to.besides, the tanks would be much more useful outside the room."
8/23/2011,"frankly, if you can't deal with an afk cloaker by putting a defense fleet up, or having guards accompanying your hulks, you deserve to lose your ship. i put it to you, that in fact, with these measures in place, an afk cloaker, whilst afk, has no tactical advantage, and poses no threat whatsoever. the only harm he inflicts by his presence is the fear factor. if you can't handle that by recognizing fear as an integral element of 0.0 life, or be organized enough to eliminate its impact on isk production by working with other players, then you should go back to high-sec where you can grind your isk feeling safe.when the cloaker engages a target, then he is at equal, if not more risk than the target he is attacking. he's deep in hostile territory, with a local filled with reds, and likely dozens more in the surrounding systems. the whole point of guerrilla warfare is to tie up a disproportionate amount of resources to the level of threat posed - it would be a shame to see this tactic removed from eve because incompetent carebears can't pvp, and whine on the forums instead of taking matters into their own hands."
8/23/2011,"thank you for pointing this out. it would still take a disproportionate amount of resources to achieve tracking down and dealing with the cloaked target. so the objective of the guerilla warfare would still be achieved. the only difference is how long would the cloaked hostile, ie, the guerilla, be able to project this effect. due to the current game mechanics, this is an infinite amount of time.however, should the mechanics be changed in a manner that neutralizes this, it might take half an hour to two hours to track down that hostile or neutral. it might also take the neutral or hostile that long to trek back to the target system.another valid point. thank you for agreeing with me.yet, due to the manpower it would take to track down the cloaked target - the objective of guerilla warfare in this sense would still be achieved. the difference is that the defence fleet would have the ability to proactively do something about the situation, rather than having to wait. keep in mind - most defence fleets guarding hulks are making 0 isk, just like the guy out there doing the cloaked harassment. this would encourage player interaction, whereas the current system encourages player disinteraction, in this case - harassment.the capabilities of covert ops and their brethren to engage in their primary combat objectives - using black ops ships to warp in tons of stealth bombers, blow up lots of targets, and warp out before the enemy has a chance to respond, would still remain unaffected. if you intend to do something - you are going to do it before the enemy can form a response fleet - and you should. if your targets are smart enough to head to a pos and wait for a defence fleet to arrive, well, that intelligent response mechanic hasn't changed, now has it? still, you are costing that ops fleet or group of locals isk while they must remain pos'ed up and unable to make use of their time. mission accomplished.rather, i like to think that being aggressive and harassing should feature some form of forethought, planning, combined with a cunning delivery of destruction and death. these changes would encourage players that use covert-ops ships to work together in fleets to accomplish these goals, which is somewhat the point of 0.0. it would not completely disable the point or capabilities of the harassment - merely limit the length.but as you say, if someone in 0.0 can't deal with harassing a defence fleet that can find them and kill them, they're always welcome to return to highsec and flip cans like a carebear pirate."
8/23/2011,"well on the other hand, by neutralizing this tactic by having ccp do it for you, you will see a lot more blobs landing on your door step and then you do not have to worry about shagging down elusive afk cloakers. it is pretty simple really, by taking away ""something"" from null, they will find another way to make your life hell.it is null space after all...right?after you have had your ass handed to you a number of times, you will then head back to hi-sec and get ganked by carebear pirates that do not really employ that cloaking tactic."
8/23/2011,"you are talking about replacing operations done in groups of 1 to 15 or so, with larger scale, militarized incursions. this would be extremely unlikely.larger scale militarized incursions happen on a per alliance basis, and one is not going to replace a 15 man fleet that might have an isk risk of 1b isk (although this will most likely be more along the lines of 100m isk at max, which is worth sacrificing if you can kill just one hulk or orca), with a 100+ man fleet that has an isk-risk of 5b isk or more.if they can - they are welcome to do so. isn't that what 0.0 is about? having fun, controlling space, and bashing heads with your less than friendly neighbours? and if they can - they are probably already doing so. those people that can lead such large groups that also do the covert op squads - do the covert ops squads for fun when they don't want to lead a larger fleet.that being said - smaller fleet covert ops squads of 3-15 people would see relatively no change at all. the only difference is that they have an amount of time to make their strike in, and might not have an opportunity before they are kicked out.that's why you send 1-2 low isk covert ops frigates, light a covert cyno, and have a black ops ship jump your guys in. precision, control, and no contest. these changes aren't going to dramatically affect the lives of anyone whom is honestly going to engage the target. they're searching for a target and will generally move on if there is none. and there will be plenty of targets of opportunity just as there are now - this isn't a change that automatically makes people warp to a pos whenever a neutral or hostile comes into local. as they say - you can't cure stupid.as for incursions done by individuals - these will make it more difficult for the individual to harass a group. he will only be able to keep it up for so long. is he going to rage and spawn a blob? no, not really. if he had a group, he'd probably have a group in doing this. he is welcome to try to organize a fleet if his group even allows him to fc, but chances are, he's just doing it for his own ****s and giggles and fun, and while they may have the blessings of their alliance in doing so, he probably doesn't have the alliance's support.to compare small groups having their capabilities nerfed and resulting in big blobs is like comparing apples and oranges. 0.0 groups are going to replace apples with apples - or pears, at best.as for getting ganked by 'carebear pirates', i'm pretty sure that is a risk anytime you undock in highsec. that will exist if you return from 0.0 or never go to 0.0. simple solution? if you aren't willing to take that risk, go play something like the world of warcraft. but make sure you don't play on a pvp server if you do so!ps: you guys should really consider how this will affect other aspects and fleets in eve. there's absolutely no debate on that in here at all - merely talk about how people are griping. there's always two sides to a balancing argument - often more.pss: there are plenty non-carebear pirates in highsec. imho, if you have the knowledge to gank and profit, you aren't a carebear pirate. i proudly support such said piracy as a part of eve online gameplay. if only we had a hunting season for idiots in rl."
8/23/2011,"if said group can no longer use the tactic to stop or slow the farming of isk to fuel their towers or replace ships, then said group will employ other methods to do so. it is really easy to get 20 or 30 null bears together on a slosh op to **** off the neighbors. you seem to be unaware of this...considering it happens all of the time. i would think given the choice, the jewbear would just hop next door to rat or plex to avoid the afk cloaker, verses getting their **** pushed in by a group fast moving *******s.oh and by the way, the term ""pirate"" is thrown around fairly loosely by peeps that have no clue what one was if they came up a bit them on the bum. just stop."
8/23/2011,"i don't consider a 20-30 man fleet to be a large fleet or even a blob fleet. but it's certainly larger than the number of covert ops pilots that it takes to pull off a successful operation - especially amongst guerilla warfare scenarios.if you had 20-30 people to spend and wanted to do covert ops fleets, you could harass an entire constellation and trollolol your way around for hours, which actually would be more effective way of disrupting your enemy than getting a 20-30 man fleet and attacking them head on.i am quite aware of numerical scenarios. perhaps you really ought to consider them yourself. or are you afraid to do a nullsec covert operation assault without having 20-30 people with the way the game mechanics currently work?"
8/23/2011,1- please tell me more of what i supposedly have or have not done.2- you obviously have no ****ing clue how current mechanics work.

8/23/2011,frieghters currently have no slots..this is wrong. customizing your ship is a big part of eve.i propose frieghters be given 3 rig slots.over all cargo would be reduced on the frieghters so that when thay are fitted with cargo rigs they equal there current cargo capacity.the idea is that you do not always need or want all that storage but there are no other options. maybe you want to fit agility rigs to align faster. maybe you want some tank rigs to be tougher..all at the expense of cargo.this gives us more options and allows plays to balance the pro's and con's of a given fit.psrigs rather than slots because it is usefull to armor and shield tankers and forces players to chose between the desirable stats they want.
8/23/2011,bump
8/23/2011,i like this idea. like drugs...the good ones make you smarter right?
8/23/2011,"i take it as a compliment when im insulted without any supporting evidenceindeed, plucking out a good eye, scaring your face, and jamming in a piece of metal may be cosmetic to some, but speaking for an equal portion of the eve base  that isnt cosmetic, its... lets just say i cant fix that either. in any case, the use of aurum and thus plex has an impact on the market and the implant monocle has a (questionable) aesthetic 'improvement.' using your terms ('cosmetic', 'impact', and 'improvement') you've again defined the monocle as destructible. just stick to offering me congratulations.let 'em all burn!"
8/23/2011,"i am sure everyone has heard of it, the so called 'logoffski'.today i got to find out how much of a pain in the ass it is.we get a report from a scout we have a freighter undocking from jita, so we all spread around the different gates surrounding jita and wait for it. one of my corp mates spots him in local, and tackles, after 30sec the freighter disappeared. so we figured, **** it that's gay but ahwell...an hour or 2 later, i notice the freighter logging back in, we dont move and wait for his corp mate to web him into warp, surely that would get him agressed with a 15min counter. his corp mate webs him and the freighter happily warps off, we set up a little camp on the gate and tackle him on the other side. he logs again, we're not bothered and primary his alliance mates that tried to defend him, they die in a fire. freighter disappears again, so we're like wtf is this all about.we set up a trap, i had a neutral alt to suicide into the freighter to make sure he had a timer while we had a corp mate on the other side to tackle him.freighter logs in, warps to gate, gets hit by my suicide alt, jumps through and logs off. after 30seconds he disappears again. during all this we had petitioned ccp multiple times seeing as the dudes alt was still online so he clearly didnt disconnect 3 times in row.we had the gm check out if the freighter had a timer, atleast the third time when he agressed by my suicide alt. he did indeed have the timer, however when he jumped he also jumped between nodes, and we got told jumping between nodes resets the 15min timer. so naturally we asked the gm if there were any other node jumps on the freighters route, at which we got the answer 'sorry we cant tell you that.' so i am slightly annoyed now that there is such a thing as disappearing after 30sec even after agressed, they could change it that you'll only be able to disappear out of thin air if you've emergency warped. but besides that we can not even know about stuff that would drastically change the outcome of a trap, seeing as if we knew about the node switch we would've set the trap in another system.surely there is a way to fix this very old exploit, if i remember right we were promissed a logoffski fix roughly 4 years ago?"
8/23/2011,"yes, jumping gates resets your timer, always has. your mistake was waqiting for his alt to web him to get him going.. tackle him there before he can log off, and you have him."
8/23/2011,"so it would seem, however every single time one of us would show up in local he'd insta log off, along with a rapier/ hyena webbing him into warp it was pretty much impossible to tackle him before he logged/warped/jumped.either way, something should be done about this lame logoffski strategy, it is virtually impossible to kill a freighter like this."
8/23/2011,"we got told by a gm that agression goes through the gate. and he confirmed that if an alt webbed him, he should get a timer, and the timer should still be there when he jumps unless he jumps to a different node. then the timer will be reset.but the biggest problem with the current mechanics is that there is no way you can tackle the freighter before he logs off. what happens is that the freighter jumps in to our camp, and when he is still cloaked from the gate he will just log off. then when he uncloaks he is ofcourse already logged off and will only stay for 30 sec.so that means that a freighter can travel across the map without getting killed by small gangs, because they cant kill a freighter in 30 sec."
8/23/2011,"again, no. rehashing the same fail idea, still makes it a fail idea."
8/23/2011,"the only thing i would even consider if anything would be something like a 2 mil sp budget for all new players, for 1 player 1 time per account. they would also have to give every account that already exists that same 2 mil sp boost as well. however, that's not gonna happen, just like the terrible idea you proposed."
8/23/2011,"you know what this game doesnt have enough of? boring mission grinding! lets have half of every nullsec alliance fly back to empire to grind sp to keep up with each other, what a wonderful idea!this is a horrible ****ing idea, please dont ever post in this part of the forum ever again."

8/23/2011,"huh ????the idea is to make the missions only available once per year per character it could even be limited to just once per year per account. they're solo missions, so fleet members wouldn't be allow; if that's not possible then they just wouldn't acquire any of the lp.wheres this all day all year idea coming from? read the post twice because it's not truly not a horrible idea."
8/23/2011,"too obvious, 1/10"
8/23/2011,"no, there should never be a way for someone to get skillpoints other then playing the game."
8/23/2011,i think you need to learn how to read. you focus too hard on one thing in the entire op. doing missions for lp is playing the game.i think it is a rather good idea. keep plex out of it completely though. i think the tradeoff of lp for sp should be minimal and very time consuming almost to the point of just not being worth it. if i had enough lp to say purchase just enough sp to finish off a train i have been waiting on for a while then thats fine. i still had to put in the effort to do missions to obtain the lp.this is a good idea. again...the tradeoff should be for a small gain of sp for a lot of lp but i like it.
8/23/2011,"i disagree. mission runners already get plenty or reward in the first place, and at very little risk. why the hell do they need more?"

8/23/2011,i know we have a difference of opinion here but that made me lol
8/23/2011,maybe you should learn to play the game and actually use the orca for transport of goods and not focus on the eff'ing ore hold or ship bay for once.i use it as a medium sized freighter all the freaking time.so scuse me for bursting your delusional state of blissful desire. i prefer practicality... adding an another ship to the broken game is going to make things worse...not better.

8/23/2011,"and hundreds of days to achieve the skills that give you the additional 2-10% to speed, damage, armor/shield/hull hp and resists, tracking speeds, et cetera. someone said earlier that in a rifter fight that 5% doesn't matter a lot. in a hurricane fight, it does.there's not a plan here that wouldn't imbalance the game and make it a pay-to-win system. but the current system already has huge gaps between the earliest players and the newest, and that gets a bit bigger every day. what can we do? (edit: these are all different ideas, not meant to be put together)start new players with a fixed number of sp they can assign, or give it to them after they've played a month or two and started to find their niche. a friend of mine suggested this. just a few million sp, enough to let a player who is starting off feel like they don't have to wait months to get into ships that the rest of us see as basic ships.allow sp remaps, like we do with attributes now. a certain number of sp per year, or maybe it's a nex or lp store purchase. this would at least let people who trained skills they never needed recover those sps and use them for something else. how many people who started as real noobs don't have a million sp they could get more use out of?sp as a mission reward maybe? i don't know. just trying to think out of the box to have a third bullet point. this would mean it's something you have to grind for specifically. if you've bought the ship and fittings and just don't have the skills to fly it, you go do these ""learning"" missions that reward with sp to accelerate your training.actually, i kind of like the last one for something i just made up as filler. it makes you choose whether you get isk or sps and mean you can't just buy a bunch of plex to build your new cap fleet."
8/23/2011,"statement of problem: using bots to run complexes allows for the accumulation of large quantities of extremely valuable loot, especially in nullsec. this skews the economy far more than other macro activities because a single character can find hundreds of millions of isk worth of loot in the time that a macro miner might mine a few million isk worth of ore.proposed solution: once per pocket or grid, a player must enter a ""combination"" to ""unlock"" the loot in the area. this combination would be similar to a captcha code, though hopefully something more eve-themed. having to do this once per pocket would not unduly hinder legitimate players, but it would make it very hard to get the loot from these complexes while afk.technical considerations: the captcha challenge must reside on the server so as to prevent the cheaters from locating the response data in a local cache. by restricting the demand to one successful challenge per entry to the pocket and limiting attempts to one per five or ten seconds, this would impose a minimal load on the server."

8/23/2011,"if there was one thing that the ""ludicrous speed"" era (caused not by faction mods, but the implementation of mwd overheating and out-of-proportion modules and rigs that caused the based mwd speed multiplier to explode), was that we saw an increase of small ship pvp. while thankfully the days of seeing 11k/s nanophoons are gone, and though some have blown the idea skirmish warfare out of proportion with i-stab stacking and polycarb stacking on every ship that could fit a microwarpdrive, there was a main benefit that i believe ccp have overlooked: a) putting experienced pilots back into frigates, b) the niche ""dogfighting"" style of pvp (unlike the current i scram and web you, and see who's tank dies first), c)made newer pilots interested in flying smaller ships and brought more people to pvp in smaller ships.that is not to say that it was balanced as one particular weapon system had the advantage of always insta hitting (crow), but this was mainly the issue of ships flying at 12k/s and guns not tracking above 6k/s.there was a ship type that *used* to counter this however, which was the destroyer-cass interdictor with its dual role of bubble dropping, and anti-frigate warfare. this however with the first interdictor speed nerf, followed by the overall ludicrous speed nerf, has rendered the interdictors woefully useless, and namely the infamous eris still generally useless other than a suicide bubble ship - leading to the irony of high skill level required to fly a one-trick suicide boat.my proposal is to undo the initial interdictor speed nerf and to increase their speed level to attain an average speed of 3-4k/s (as opposed to the current 2-3k/s), thus allowing to speed tank better - as already the signature bloom with the mwd on an already large destroyer hull makes it *extremely* fragile.in line with every ship having a role in a fleet, the interdictor should be something more than a disposable use-once ship, and should bring more to the fleet - also allowing it to take part in a more active role in lighter and faster skirmish gangs."
8/23/2011,"interdictors are flying coffins and had speed nerfed twice before the big nano nerf happened. give them little bit more speed again so you can maybe survive more then 1 bubble :p oh and something i have been theorycrafting about, maybe give them imunity from their own bubble ? so you can try warping out after bubbling, but only from your own interdictor sphere. just a thought."
8/23/2011,lol @ eris :d i like proposal. d3
8/23/2011,"even more than undoing speed nerf, dictors need a sig buff. they're almost the size of cruisers. ideally the sig buff should be inversely proportional to the final mwd speed, so the sabre, being the fastest, ends up the largestthe flycatcher, eris and heretic also need a fittings buff so that they can match the sabre in this respect. the sabre can fit a dual mse tank with a full rack of weapons."
8/23/2011,"speed is bad, if you want survivability then here is a better option:- decrease signature of destroyers slightly, and by extension that of interdictors.- give interdictors the same mwd bonus that interceptors enjoy.they (t1/t2) could also do well with a decrease in gun count with 2x bonus instead (think pirate/marauders), small guns are rather pricey now."
8/23/2011,"sabre is ridiculously overpowered compared to other interdictors, even if you drop weapons for 2 bubble launchers it's still better in combat than any other interdictor with full rack of best possible guns.first we need other dictors put in line with sabre (namely all of these: buffer, speed, dps) then we could think some kind of oomph. even sabre is a bit fragile, but only against bigger ships like cruisers.generally i wouldn't suggest oomphing sabre further until other dictors would be somewhat useful for anything.what i am trying to say is that interdictors are fine, if sabre is only interdictor in game."

8/23/2011,consider the advantages gained in exchange:- bs range with cruiser weapons and hac range with frigate weapons.- 100% pure selectable damage types.- monopoly on ecm-shielded weaponry (goddamn fof's are op when used right).- tracking formula immunity .. goes so far that you can rig a ship for even better immunity (imagine if guns could adjust sig.res. in the same way .. drool!).in short: missiles will/should be nerfed long before they are ever buffed.

8/24/2011,"currently we do have few too good intel tools. it's too easy to spot enemy, and hard to hidden yourself.local channel should be same in all sec space than it is in w-space.we shouldn't be able to see if character is online or not, if we don't have good standings to them. it's way too easy to have your enemys titan/sc pilots in your addresbook and get instant warning of hotdrop when they start log in.with these two small changes, there would be more chances of surprise. more changes for small gang and solo pilots, more changes for epic battles when you aren't sure what others can throw at you.we need fog of war to make pvp in eve intresting again!"
8/24/2011,"leave local alone. removing local removes part of the social part of eve, which any mmo needs to be more than just a game where you shoot internet spaceships.the watch list...maybe. maybe give players the ability to opt out of certain people knowing they're online? i don't know. forcing you to have mutual good standings would be too much as then it's impossible to open a convo with someone because you never know whether they're online. somewhere in between ""no watch list for non-blue"" and ""you can monitor everyone you want"" is probably the right answer."
8/24/2011,i did not say that.i said that make it like it's in w-space.no updating list of channel members
8/24/2011,"here's the major problem with your little plan: the whole reason that there isnt local in wh space is to make it more dangerous, because living there is more profitable. the game is set up with tiers of risk/reward that you can control. if you make nullsec more dangerous then you have to make the rewards of living there greater to the point of making wh space and nullsec no different at all, in which case instead of whs being something different in the game it becomes essentially ""high sec"" and ""other"" rather than as it is now. in addition, it makes fleet coordination far more difficult to the point of it being unreasonable. you need some way of knowing who in your fleet is in system. stop your whining and go to wh space if you don't like the local as it's set up. no one's making you live in nullsec, if you want to sneak up on people wh space is your place to live."
8/24/2011,"you are comparing different magnitudes - comparing apples and oranges. whenever you have a group of 20 people, it will have a much more numerically significant influence on matters than the number 5.those 1-5 people that make a covert ops fleet are not going to cast mirror images of themselves and become 20-30. if they instead attack head on, they are going to be a group of 1-5, not 20-30. there are fleets of 20-30 covert ops, yes, and they can certainly do wickedly sick things.however, the quantitative majority of them are within the 1-5 man size range. anything larger than that is an irregularity, that while worth noting the impacts of - does not mean that every single outcome will - or even has the possibility, of resulting in that outcome. mathematically, 5 does not equal 20, and certainly not 30, and so it is very much impossible.learn to count on more than your 8 fingers and two thumbs and you might be able to appreciate numerical terms.what you have and have not done makes no impact on the overall statistics of eve. you can try to ignore this, but you will be wrong. and your ignorance in the matter is exactly why i am not going to re-address you again after this post."

8/24/2011,could be good
8/24/2011,supported.
8/24/2011,1
8/24/2011,hi!+1000totally agree with the author of topic!!!drone holder should not learn weapon skills to participate in the ctadrone holders weapon must be the drones
8/24/2011,the short answer is ccp have neither the will nor the in-house talent for a rewrite of drone behavior at the moment.they are actively discouraged due to the load they put on the servers and that in all likelihood will never change.
8/24/2011,"i was under the impression that ships in eve did not have a crew, only the capsuleer?"
8/24/2011,"i too was under this impression. there is no crew in the ships other than yourself. so, unless you're dysfunctionally depressed, then there really isnt crew morale to measure."
8/24/2011,"choice is good so i would support this if, and only if, the cargo capacity of all freighters were nerfed so that it took 3 t1 cargo rigs to get to the size we have now. then you could choose between cargo or whatever else you wanted to rig for without having caps and freighters being able to fit in the cargo."
8/24/2011,"i would make it 3 tech 2 rigs, rather than tech 1, but i agree with the principle of your statement. the max allowable cargo space should still be under 1 million m3 with max skills and all rigs. as long as that limit is maintained, i have no problem with this."
8/24/2011,you can't equip 3 t2 cargo expander rigs due to calibration. 2xt2 and 1xt1 is the best possible.
8/24/2011,"you're right, of course. i think the basic principle remains unchanged though. all combinations of rigs + skill level must yield cargo space < 1,000,000 m3."
8/24/2011,could someone link me a good obelisk fit?
8/24/2011,the only rigs i'll ever support on freighters would be to help with hauling of rigged ships. im stiff
8/24/2011,drugs
8/24/2011,"yes, everything in the game is pvp... no, not all of it is necessarily combat.however, no to the idea anyway. risk what you can afford to lose ... be that nothing, +3s, +5s, hg pirate, whatever..."
8/24/2011,"supporting with monthly payed booster (drugs) you dont loose by dying for a fair prices like current prices / 12:+5 = 8 misk / month+4 = 1,5 misk / month+3 = 0,65 misk / month+2 = 0,25 misk / month+1 = 0,1 misk / monthalso introducing 2 more steps for lp store via a pill which is sellable open at markets:+6 = 30 misk / month + 25.000 lp+7 = 100 misk / month + 50.000 lpin order to boost low sec without nerfing high sec this could be sold at pirate npcs only and/or with lp at a lvl 5 agent earned by doing missions for them (similar to datacores but you really have to work in those missions)"
8/24/2011,if you are not in a bubble you spam the warp out button when your ship is in structure and just keep spamming it. the thing that determines if you get caught is if you have internet or client latency - that is how good is computer and your connection.so if you have a good computer and good internet connection you can fly with implants which give you a very large advantage over people who do not have a great internet connection or computer. is this good for the game?
8/24/2011,they changed timer to reset ages ago seen trillion lame logoffskis after that srsthis has become standard for flying freighters and other big ships which can take beating until it vanishes
8/24/2011,"now, obviously i am bitter as we didnt get the freighter kill, but this sucks big time! kind of makes even trying a complete waste of everybodys time. at least give us an inbetween timer to probe in this scenario"
8/24/2011,typical scenario used was to wait on next gate with a cloaked stealth bomber with a smartbomb. he might jump in and thinking he is safe to initiate warp get tagged by the sb. then you have 15 minutes.
8/24/2011,"my dear capsuleers,it's not a new idea, i know.i read the devblog and saw that ccp aren't that happy how fleet fights are done.let's see the facts :- the fc (and eventually the 1/2/3 target callers) are the only ones making decisions in a fight. grunts only follow the broadcasts and push f1-f2-f3 to pewpew/rep. the only exception i see are the dictors/hics and the bombers.- if the fight is big enough, most of the dps is wasted following the broadcasts and locking the targets. you could have 2x more maels/badons you can't kill **** faster.- there are two ways of winning a fleet fight : more pilots (blob) or better ships (scs). a blob of supercapitals should have many drawbacks, but a few of them supporting subcaps sounds perfectly fine.- the squad/wing/fleet thing is mostly useless, since you're only following the fc, and it's not even a good idea to have him a booster/commander. nobody gives a **** about its ""squad members"".- if the fight is big enough, any subcaps will be alpha'ed (arty or not). you could be an ~elite pro pvper~ and you will still die in 2s because the ennemy fc said your name.- the only thing that matters are the primaries. the 99% remaining ships are floating around in space, somewhat pewpewing in calm.proposal1/ fleet members cannot broadcast targets.only fleet commanders, wing commanders and squad commanders can broadcast targets. squad commanders can only broadcast targets for their own squad.2/ the duration of a particular locking is increased for every other current lock attempts (example below, if it's not that clear. basically more people locking someone = lower scan res).3/ your squad members (and the squad commander) don't increase your locking time.the malus is halved if you're trying to lock somebody that have been broadcasted by your wing commander.effectsbattlefields could become a skirmish paradise, with an hundred squads chasing each other.you still can alpha/blob, but you must : defend your fleet/wing commanders, or have very clear comms and people ready to find the names in the overview. and you will have a longer time to lock the ennemy ships.but with such a shift in pvp warfare (going from a ""destroy this ship, then this one, etc"" to a ""we're shooting 10 ships at this moment with our 15-squads fleet""), will the rr become too strong ? i doubt it, because if someone requests rr and every logistic ships from his fleet try to lock him, well good luck saving him in time. sc blob vs subcaps ? the subcaps don't even need a broadcast (""shoot shadoo's leviathan"" should be enough) and a longer locking time don't really matter. but if 20 nyxes are trying to lock that poor harbinger, well... take your time (wtb shadow serpentis sebo ).note that titans can still murder a subcap fleet with dds at ease, but that's :ccp:'s fault.example and picturesi'm in band of goons, in my nice meta2 dreak (a powerful battledestroyer).our fleetplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.my lovely leader made some decisions :- 5 wings, we need broadcasts (otherwise we are terrible, they say)- but most of our strength is in one wing, which will do the job. the other wings will welp and shoot random targets, but can help to alpha ****s/gank a capital with a broadcast.we're fighting the evil coalition of titandot.they have some dreak meatshields and a bunch of licorns (it's a space poney but 10x stronger than a dreak, the only drawback is the low scan res).it's a lot differentplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.- they have 3 squads, each completely independant. since they are good and serious at this game, it works well for them.(next post)"
8/24/2011,"i'm in the battle, lazers everywhere, great.- i could lock a random target and shoot it (until it dies). i'm the only one locking him, full scan res [scan res 0]- my dear squad commander colonel freeze really wants us to kill that dreak, yes this one. he broadcasts it, 11 dreaks are shooting it with full scan res (because we're all in the same squad, good job bros) [scan res 0].- we got the evil dreak, but it was difficult. we team with the wing1squad2 to kill another draek. 22 people try to lock him, but we got all got a malus (the 11 other dudes which aren't in my squad) [scan res -11].- my wing commander omiga is calling us ****s because we lost time locking that dreak. the next one is broadcasted by him, w1s3 and w1s2 shooting at will ! the malus is halved because it's my wing commander and even he always says i'm bad at this game i like him very very much. [scan res -5.5]- the fleet co mettins wants us to kill one of this licorn, saying that they are ""armor hacks"". i don't get it but i followed the comm order (he didn't broadcast because he got blackscreened again, maybe it's the ""hack"" ?) and start locking him. 105 pilots are trying to lock this licorn (even the logis, they are such km*****s with their civilan watergun !). it's not that efficient but once locked, the licorn went down very fast. in facts, almost faster than we locked it, meh. [scan res -95] next time we'll lock&shoot 2 different licorns in the same time.- while shooting the licorn, i saw a dreak near us. i know that it's gonna become the new target of the w1s2/w1s3 team. i lock him very fast (no one was locking him at this moment) [scan res 0]. when the licorn dies, the guys in the w1s2 will lock him a bit faster, because i'm no more trying to lock him. hey, we got a small advantage because i made a smart decision and managed wisely my targets [scan res -5].- colonel freeze is being shot ! ohnoz my squad commander ! omiga saw it, and made an important decision : he broadcasted his squad commander, allowing the logis in the w1s4 & w1s5 to lock colonel freeze a bit faster (since they are in the same wing). but we're terrible well i was listening a nice song and not the comms and well i got the killmail because hmmm my finger well pressed f1 f2 f3. he's a bit mad. :( omiga said later it's something he saw this in a cool rooks and queens video but well it doesn't work with us.etc, etc.charts'n'numbersso, what could be this scan resolution penalty ?it must be logarithmic (or at least square root).the maximum reduction should not be more than 25% (otherwise all the fleet wars will become a nightmare).we should see it when another squad (11 pilots) is locking the same target, but not that much of an effect (75%).excel madz skillzplease visit your user settings to re-enable images.note that it doesn't include the 50% bonus while following a wing broadcast.benefitsyou're not a nameless grunt.you're a pilot in a space warmachine and your skills will help your squad. your small squad is an important piece of your wing, and then the fleet. your acts will hav---- what eh ccp told me a single merlin can destroy an alliance you know eh.you need good tacklers when gate camping. a blob of 30 dreaks sitting on a gate will not catch a lonely dreak if they all try to lock him."
8/24/2011,"i'd be more interested in the proposal if the ship names were spelt properly... as it stands, i'm on the fence."
8/24/2011,"it's on purpose. btw i don't know any ""battledestroyer""."
8/24/2011,"bad move -- just makes you look 12, and lowers people's support for the issue at hand ..."
8/24/2011,"two useless inputs ; please consider the option to get out, thanks."
8/24/2011,was trying to help you look less retarded.the idea might have gained some support ...
8/24/2011,"we've all seen lots of ideas for fixing the supercap blob issue. most of them come down to massive overkill to kill supers faster (death stars, dread boost, moar new ships!) or massive nerfs (fbs disabled from shooting structures, etc). the problem is that very few of these proposals address actual balance issues, or in the end the solution would produce exactly the same problem 6 or so months down the road when someone builds a massive number of giantnewthingthatkillzsuperz. i don't think we want that.proposal:1) remove supers' ability to field sentry, heavy, medium, and light drones. 2) permit carriers (as squad commander) to jump all ships in their squad to a destination cyno. the carrier is required to jump as well.explanation:part 1 means that supers would be unable to defend themselves effectively against gangs of sub-cap ships without escorts. this would force more fluid fleet composition without negating the supers' usefulness is bashing sov structures. part 2 lowers the entry barrier for bringing a fleet to the party. this means that smaller entities can gang together to respond to a super attack without having to build supers themselves, while larger entities can field a fleet with more flexibility and not have to depend on their titan pilots being a 23/7 bridging service. this part also permits faster reshipping when losses happen with just a little creative fleet reorganization.considerations:fighters can still be a counter for battleships and to a lesser extent battlecruisers. so a supercarrier blob would not be completely helpless against sub-caps, just much less effective. logistics would be needed in the subcap fleet to counter this.carrier squad jumping would need to have some kind of mechanic in which the squad sub-caps slave to the carrier's jump drive and use some part of their cap for the jump (say dependent on jump drive operation skill).carriers would still be highly vulnerable to fighterbombers and doomsday, but then anyone who isn't going to sacrifice a few ships to kill off a super probably isn't going to fight anyway. conclusion:the idea is to bring some balance back to the game without creating an new fotm which seems to be the inevitable result of any change. i'm not saying that this might not do the same, but i don't think it will.in the end i think we'd end up with combat that is more fluid and more interesting and isn't that the whole point?discuss."
8/24/2011,"sounds interesting for #2 --> this can only be allowed if the carrier is the squad commander. wing/fleet commanders (or squad members) can't bring anyone with them.make it drain 75% of cap (or whatever, carrier pilot level dependant) from all the ships being jumped... if the pilot doesn't have enough cap, he doesn't come along."
8/24/2011,"sounds good.#1 might be a less radical alternative to boosting dreads to make dreads the new anti-super ships although dreads right now are almost totally useless.#2 everyone in the carrier's squad will have their cap reduced to same extent the squad leader's carrier is reduced upon doing the same jump. agreed that each person must have the same cap % to initiate jump as the carrier or that person won't jump out.right now, carriers are used far less often in battle due to the massive numbers of supers in the game. fighter bombers (and rightfully so i guess) omfgwtfbbq carriers. this reduces carriers to shield/armor pumping of pos's and stations, logistics and very few combat opportunities. though #2 is more of a logistic role than anything else, it at least means carriers get a bit more use."
8/24/2011,"i purposefully avoided the dreadnaught issue. i really couldn't come up with a solution for that problem that doesn't lead to dreads being the new fotm. so i stuck with this to see if it can retro-actively fix the dreads on its own. but i have my doubts on that score.@velicitia: yeah, i should have clarified that the carrier would have to be squad commander to do it. modified the op to reflect that."
8/24/2011,"this sounds like a pretty good idea. i like the idea of restricting the drone abilities of the super carrier to that of its roll. it makes sense really to permit something the tools needed to do its own job, but not everyone elses too (reasons why they took away triage). my concern would be that carrier bridges might become too powerful, but i think the ideas of applying the same cap restriction is a good one. the fact that super carriers would still be able to much up a carrier would be a real deterrent from doing this too much. at the same time i like to idea of reducing the load on titan pilots as the jump bridge service. if this idea isn't something that is implemented, i do hope that whatever is implemented will be a well thought out idea like this. i'd like to get back into eve more and maybe see about getting back into 0.0 but the broken nature of super carriers is a real put off to me."
8/24/2011,"i don't mean for this to work like a titan bridge, where the carrier stays safe in a pos bubble and pushes everyone else through. i mean that the carrier would have to jump to take the squad with it. so the carrier pilot has to commit to take the risk along with everyone else. if the carrier doesn't jump as well, then yes, its way too powerful given the huge number of carriers out there."
8/24/2011,"i did know that you intended that. i guess that it wouldn't make a huge difference most of the time. i was more concerned with the use of this carrier bridge idea in times when you didn't have a fleet of massively superior capitals to worry about. i still really like this idea though. at any rate, maybe this would make hot dropping things a lot cooler, and that would be a plus (as long as it didn't get out of hand)."
8/24/2011,"fighter bombers were stupid idea from start. someone was cool bombers lets do it without thinking.supercarriers were pretty much fine before oomph, maybe except hitpoints whatever. they already had their ewar immunities which is very powerful feat alone but they weren't too powerful to be automatic choice over dreads or carriers which were much cheaper.why does it seem no one has ever even thought about that.look capitals.im just waiting actual cynonerf which should've been done 2007 already. it would change so many things. without nerfing any ships."
8/24/2011,"not another ""i have no patience let my buy my way to what i want and screw what it does to the game"" thread.not supported."
8/24/2011,have you ever done missions for lp before? it takes a rediculous number of missions just to get the smallest of items. i think its rather ubsurd anyway...which is why i dont do missions. the level 5 missions have plenty of danger in that they are mostly in lowsec and nullsec already. not to mention they are the only missions that give you enough lp to be worth it.
8/24/2011,if you did a little homework and actually paid attention as to why i'm still here... you would have the answer already.not too bright are you.ps: its the same reason the bulk of us are still here.
8/24/2011,"the ship-slot would be a highsec transport. t2 hauler, optimized more for carrying capacity than tank.there is *potential* room there, certainly there is a market for such a ship."
8/24/2011,"wrong, sir.see, as i don't really care about your ""broken game"" argument, why would i do the homework to find out truly why you are here.so, to you, the game is broken, good for you, feel better about yourself?if the game was as broken as you claim it to be, alot less people would be playing it.so i actually am pretty bright. i just choose not to care why you think the game is broken.so, why do you just do the same, don't care why i don't think the game is broken, and quit trolling because myidea is different from yours.i am so tired of ""entitled people"""
8/24/2011,"i am a fan of supporting a change and/or buff to dreads in making them a capital ship worth using for something else other than shooting a pos.while i do not have stats to show of myself, i believe a dread should be the counter to scs and titans. now how to implement dreads into a role like this i do not know, but i feel as though it would certainly increase the dread's usefulness in game.edit* forgot to support"
8/24/2011,"so lets see, i think we can say right now that dreads are perfectly balanced, but the issue is supercaps are horribly overpowered. but looking at other caps and subcaps dreads are fine, now half your ideas boost them against subcaps and regular caps, why? tracking really is not an issue in a fleet fight, put it in eft and see for yourself, and yes eft is accurate if you use it right, in the end eve is just math. and local rep boosts only makes them overpowered for small gang use in low dps situation (wormholes, lowsec away from the large hotdrop alliances), and has no effect against supercaps, really you arent going to rep against hunderds of fighterbombers.anyway dreads are fine, supers are too strong, so nerf supers."
8/24/2011,"oh hell no this thing needs some attention. come on ccp some recognition, hell how about you go ahead and add unlimited fitting slots to the nex store for 1000 arum since we know you were planning on putting it into the nex store anyway."
8/24/2011,bleh meant to edit not reply
8/24/2011,"the more i think about it, the more i like the idea of missions that would award sp. it solves the problem of buying a win, but people willing to spend cash on plex can still get isk and devote their grind time to sp missions to speed up their training.issues:-i don't know what sort of sp bonus there should be. it would have to be worthwhile without completely overshadowing the need to spend time earning isk. there would have to be a good balance of sp/hour.-one idea might be to charge isk for starting an sp mission. this makes it an investment and requires something more than just time to fuel it.-would it reward points to be assigned, or just add points to skills in the current queue?"
8/24/2011,"if 5% matters in a hurricane fight, you are a crappy player and allowed someone to put you in a unfavorable position."

8/24/2011,nice stealth ninja loot whine thread either way noits hard enough for some of us to read the eve txt atm even with glasses without needing this captcha bull to go with it here is how you will beat macros you wont live with it
8/24/2011,"just...no.if you want to make plexes macro-free, take them off the overview and make them signatures. they can still be static to a system, but will require being scanned down prior to warp-to. moving all ore to grav sites would have a similar effect (it would require mining barges to be able to launch special probes or something similar, but it's certainly possible). you could still scan down a site and then start the macros mining in the site, but it would at least require some activity by a human prior to the bots becoming active.unless there's a scanning bot out there that i've never heard of."
8/24/2011,you are trying an unusual way or just not really interested about detecting bots
8/24/2011,and captcha has stopped regular internet bots how?
8/24/2011,"sometime late this year.maybe next year.gonna bet next year.i miss the expansion cycle...ccp had deadlines then, and waiting 6 months was not that big of a deal. now? oh it'll come out, eventually. no worries though, faction warfare improvements are coming too. so are pos improvements. hybrid rebalancing? yup. mining content, you betcha. new missions - oh yeah. we're even gonna get to walk in stations with other people - three long years, but by god you've got a station room for yourself that rivals the best mmorpg games of the last quarter century!"
8/24/2011,"the idea is sound, but not remotely original. pos misery is one of the oldest and most glaring examples of the above post's point - player groups, even with well thought-out plans for development of the game, are generally ignored by ccp. csm has a fair chance in influencing ccp, but rarely does the csm actually benefit all of new eden.fact is ccp has a forum full of great ideas and practices that could begin improving eve right now. however, the agenda is not to improve eve, but fix and maintain it so that ccp can move onto other ventures - most notably its new mmo that will most certainly feature a much more invasive (and thus profitable) mt model.pick one of the many existing forum topics that you agree with and work on those - or let your actions speak louder than your words (again, pos misery excellent example of players being ignored) and cancel your account until the game you want to pay for returns. who knows, if eve begins to collapse at an accelerated rate maybe a new sandbox spaceship game will emerge to take over. it's about time eve had some proper competition; i had just hoped somebody would rise to the challenge, not eve fall back to the laggards."
8/24/2011,"lord of the rings online once had lifetime subs - then they canceled the option when turbine bought the game. considering the game is still going strong (not large mind you, but healthy) and the fact turbine honored life subs...anyone who got them at launch has long since made the money back.life subs are good, but really only in the first couple of years of a game. afterwards they drop usually because demand is low or, more importantly, companies avoid them because of the backlash they get when the game folds before a life sub pays out.determining what a lifesub ought to cost is a bit tough too - lotro was two years value. given eve's current situation, i'd be somewhat surprised if they could sell even two years. the point of a life sub is to come out ahead in the long run. most eve players can afford a life sub (given the majority of the playerbase is older and employed), but most of them are also wise enough to realize eve's stability isn't guaranteed at this stage over the next year...let alone two years.the winter expansion will likely decide if the game survives into summer of 2012. i for one have canceled all accounts (this one expires in a week or so) and will wait to see what that expansion brings. incarna is a great idea...but there are a lot of other great ideas that could have built eve to be an even stronger game that could then generate the resources needed to develop both eve and ccp's other ventures. poor business practice in my opinion - and i don't invest in poor business."
8/24/2011,"errm........doesn't the fact we haven't seen them yet tell you somethingwe are not going to see them, they want it to all blow over and for us to forget about itif they wanted us to see them. then they would of been released a long time ago"

8/24/2011,"range -- it can easily be toned down. i do propose the title of longest range be kept considering afterburners/mwds take the place of defensive fittings. what do you propose as reasonable?selectable damage -- most ships receive bonuses to kinetic dmg and without that extra 25% dmg the advantage isn't much to speak of (then there is also reloading to be considered, especially since ships don't last very long)ecm-shielded -- fof are a joketracking formula -- instead there is ""explosion velocity / sig radius formula"" although your rigging argument is something i haven't heard of before, i'll give it some thoughtgiven how your points weathered, i don't see that justifying the disadvantages i listed at all"

8/25/2011,"the reason for wanting a reduced reload time is to be able to switch ammo types more easily. ""instant"" ammo change is a major advantage for laser turrets."
8/25/2011,"i'm not convinced that blasters are 'broken' per-se. the thorax, demos and brutix come immediately to mind. also, the myrm and ishtar seem to get along fine without out them =p even the domi doesn't seem to mind. certainly railguns need work. they are damn useless. the issue with rails is what role should they fill? lasers do good sustained damage over range, artillery does massive alpha. what is left for rails to do? if they out-alpha artillery they are going to be overpowered, and if they have better tracking they will be straying away from the 'railgun' philosophy of lugging a heavy metal cylinder into someone as hard as physics allows. i suppose an argument could be made that railguns could accelerate the projectile to warp-speeds, thereby traveling faster than light and track better than lasers, being that they could hit the target faster than even a laser... give them a massive tracking buff to represent super-high speeds and decrease their damage to compensate. not sure if that is useful, but it could be argued for.but blasters... well, blasters do massive dps (if they can hit anything) so the question is, what needs to change. again, certain balsterboats are quite effective, face-melting pawnzasaurs. their strength is their ability to destroy larger ships due to their damage being nearly a class above their hulls. the weakness is against smaller, faster ships, but that seems fair to me. a thorax can kill a bc much easier than any other cruiser. maybe make gallente hulls a bit more resilient to make them even more effective at 'up-class' combat, but the blasters seem to work just fine."
8/25/2011,"a useless mechanic that would either force you to max out some more skills, or make it so that once you've had a run of bad luck it's harder to get back up because ""crew morale"" keeps your ship from performing as well as it did before things got tough.if there were any metric attached to ""crew"", i would make it that a ship's crew gained experience the more a ship is used. this would reward those whose ships survived combat frequently. but we could do without all this entirely."
8/25/2011,"i like your idea too, in any case it would be exciting with new leadership skills.and yes it is true that you are not the only man inside a ship =) why do you think there are so many windows"
8/25/2011,"actually capsuleer ships do have crews in the lore, but they're orders of magnitude smaller than on non-capsuleer ships of the same class. that said, since the capsuleer does all the fighting, the crew's morale really isn't that applicable."
8/25/2011,"i think every crew would need a leader in times of battle, and only the capsuleer can take on that job. also i believe the crew executes all the commands of the leader in times of battle. handeling a big big ship takes teamwork, so the capsuleer cannot really be separated from the crew unless its a really small ship. like battlestar galactica"
8/25/2011,"that's just the thing... the crew executes none of the commands of the capsuleer... they are just there for maintenance. the crew does not pivot the turrets, reload the weapons, activate the reppers, turn the ship, direct the drones, etc. etc. that's all more or less automated in a capsuleer's ship. the crew is there to make sure that everything is running smoothly. you don't need morale for that.in fact... given the nature of eve, i would go so far as to say that ""morale"" is meaningless. the crew works less because they are ""happy with their job/ship/pilot"" and more because they ""want to live."""

8/25/2011,"great idea.the existing +x implants need to be converted to something that benefits people who use them so that players don't lose half a billion isk worth of implants to an update.edit: dying should stop the booster effect, but it would be cheaper to buy a new pack of boosters than to buy new implants. i agree with the op that this makes it easier for people to get into pvp as they aren't risking high-value learning implants (just do your pvp roams near the end of your booster cycle if you're still worried) and doesn't penalize people who live out in null and can't afford to risk that much isk on their pod.attribute booster times should be present in the api along with your queue so you can get alerts on when you need to pop another booster."
8/25/2011,"why not just just use +3 or +4 if in nullsec atm. or even more cheep just with the two attributes you likely be training for (perception and willpower?).risk and reward, you could risk much less and get still a good bonus."

8/25/2011,"yesfalse. remapping/changing implants/jump cloning (and any other ways to change your attributes if i forgot one) forces you to pause your skill queue while you do so, and the training time is also re-calculated after getting podded."
8/25/2011,"however, getting podded (provided you do not touch the skill training stuff) doesn't. or at least it used to leave your sp/hour at the ""with implants"" numbers after getting podded (until, pausing/changing skills/jumpcloning/etc)"
8/25/2011,"this was true a few expansions ago, but they changed it. if you get podded now, when you awake in your cloe bay your skill que is immediately altered to reflect your new (lower) attributes. i do like the idea of attribute boosters. its an outstanding idea. however, what is to be done about the faction implants? currently slaves and the like fill in implant slots 1-6. removing them from the game will rightfully cause quite an uproar. also, since implants are one of the major lp to isk conversion tools, your might significantly hurt carebears with this change. i think all implants would need to be reworked with this change. perhaps make implants slots 1-5 related to defense, and slots 6-10 related to offense, with attribute enhances limited to boosters (lol, go go mentat addictions!!) the other option, is that the drawback of attribute boosters, is to limit or eliminate the effectiveness of various implant slots!"

8/25/2011,"whoa, steady your temper there jack. while this is indeed a ""temper tantrum"" thread you missed the fact that it's something of a troll. through its sarcastic/hyperbolic direction it brings attention to the fact that the monocle -- which in its own description refers to itself as an implant -- is for no logical reason immune to destruction and thus goes against the precedent of all implants being destructible. essentially ccp needs to htfuand monocles do bring a (questional) aesthetic benefitlet 'em all burn!"
8/25/2011,"fellow trolls/players, in the past few weeks, we've seen ccp speculate wildly about one-year plans, two-year plans, five-year plans, and oops-maybe-next-year plans. the recent extolling upon the expansion of the virtues of null security space, and the underwhelming devblog only drive the current problems deeper, like an infected splinter. once again, we see ccp planning blindly for the future, while remaining blissfully ignorant of the present. there are issues in incarna - deep-seeded issues which have yet to be addressed. what we, ourselves, are witnessing is more of the same from ccp. i'll quickly list a few to remind you of things that may or may not be coming soon.-fixes to lowsec-fixes to faction warfare-the return of ship spinning-pos permission fixes-better information from ccp-a commitment to excellencethese are just a few of the things that we've been told were being looked into. this does not even begin to address the massive ui problems introduced with incarna.i am asking ccp to hold to their word. commit to excellence, and focus on improving the things you have told us you would improve. don't simply rush into yet another plan meant to change the game drastically while the game is still in it's current state. from a personal point of view, i am a forumwarrior - and also a player. i am a subscriber, and therefore, i am also a supporter of crowd control productions. as a supporter, there are times when i must put the mantle of ""forum trolling"" asideand instead use what little voice i have to try and bring sense to all of this. thanks for your time.your local forumtroll/player/paid subscriber/supporter,r. t. sibling"

8/25/2011,sounds like u need my pants titan to alpha him
8/25/2011,yes. it is nearly impossible to kill people who don't make an overt mistake when you are attacking them in high sec. my biggest problem with the current mechanics of high sec is they heavily favor more experienced players at the expense of the new players the mechanics are supposed to be there to coddle. high sec mechanics need a lot of work.
8/25/2011,"part of me thinks this is an exploit, and i've never done it myself. my corp does not endorse exploits either, so if it is an exploit i'll probably get in trouble with my corp for suggesting it!!! at the same time, i loathe log-offers.... so, with that said, when he enters a system and logs off because he sees your threat, he will disappear about 12 km's from gate after 60 seconds. when he logs back in, he will instawarp to that same spot, a nice distance off gate. option 1: go to that position with several ships that can warp quickly and can hold tackle. log them off there! then use a dispable ooc alt to wait (perferable cloaked) in that posistion to immediately tackle him when he logs back in. it will get concorded and die, but its job is to aggress him and prevent him from warping for the 10-20s it takes your tackle to land... right after your alt aggresses, log in your tackle. they should be able to land on grid and tackle the freighter before he can warp away, you then have him aggressed, off gate, and tackled.... nomnomnomnomnom.... option 2: i know you used to be able to aggress gate-cloaked ships with smartbomb aoe (i once lost an inty because of this). something to test, is if you can hit gateclaoked ships with an ecm burst (20 km aoe)... if you can, use a disposable alt to ecm burst from gate once he comes into system, before he decloaks, and you have the potential of getting him aggressed before he logs off. this needs to be tested though."
8/25/2011,oh so u never tried double or triple... heck multiple logoffskis ? 2nd time you relog you would always get back to the point where you were warped for safety first time you logged off. not sure how the inertia influences multiple logoffskis warp back locations because i am not being a freighter pilot but that's hard to work arround. for ded plexes i saw someone logging off and on just to lose agro when things got bitter always getting back to the room he was fighting in without him needing to get back with a key or losing something for this and gms said it's not an exploit. this adds up quite badly to your initiative to hunt down any ship.
8/25/2011,"tigresze, mulitple logoffskies no longer work.... in dominion they ""fixed"" the warp overshooting deepsafe creation mechanic by forcing ships to complete their warp prior to a log-off emergency warp. this means, the freighter will always warp back to the spot he logged off at. the only exception to this is gated plexes/missions, but that's not relevant here. so, they fixed super (500+ au) deep safes and the ""get away from bubblers and tacklers via multiple logoffskies"" at the same time."
8/25/2011,to the top !
8/25/2011,i like this idea. i'm all for boosting things towards balance.i think the cap drain is likely enough to minimize the lowsec hot drop overpowerness. if not that it might need a slight sensor recalibration delay.
8/25/2011,i like the proposal on both counts. removal of anything smaller than a f-bomber from a sc's drone bay would not only give more relevance to sub caps but it would force more thought into fleet composition.
8/25/2011,this is a good idea and more realistic. it would require more mixed fleets andwould make frigs far more useful.
8/25/2011,"a dread should beat a carriera dread shouldn't beat a super carrier, but do serious damage. 3? dreads should kill a super carrier ( depending on range and such)i think the issue is they cant be remote repped like super carriers because out of siege the dps is low.simple solution is make a siege module for super carriers so to use fighter bombers they have to lose rr support, or have incoming rr cut dramatically."
8/25/2011,"1. too big of a limitation. a segregation of the dronebays so they can't spam vanilla drones perpetually is enough (and better) i think.2. actually a good idea to give a bridge type functionality to carriers. should require fuel and cap both for the tag-alongs though .. or rather it should not be able to supplant bridging but rather supplement and provide a low-tech/high-cost option.add in the ""usual"" stuff: loss of immunity when away from hometurf (sovereignty) and ehp tweaks."
8/25/2011,i like both these ideas.maybe even extend the removal of drone bays (not fighter bays) to normal carriers and dreads? capitals should always require sub-capital support to defend them.
8/25/2011,split drone bays are theoretically coming in the winter. i assume they will hit both scs and carriers though (as they should). that makes the second point a reasonable idea.
8/25/2011,"i've always thought it odd that 'bridging' was a feature given to titans and not carriers, as force projection should be the role of a carrier. i like and support that portion of your idea."
8/25/2011,"i disagree. the problem is that right now the supercarrier is a one-size-fits-all-and-is-really-badass-at-everything class. it can bash sov structures and poss in a way that no other class can come close to matching. in groups it can defend itself against all other classes with clouds of drones. it is ecm immune. it can only be stopped by focused points and bubbles and has an even chance of killing those and getting away when attacked. all this and it only has two downsides. it can't dock and its expensive to lose. the first isn't much, and the second is irrelevant to anyone who' has lived in 0.0 for any length of time. i'll agree that segregating drone bays is a step in the right direction, but its not going to go far enough to matter. lets say you have 20 supercarriers. let's say each supercarrier can only carry 20 sentries, that's 400 to kill before you've negated their damage. what fc in his/her right mind is going to call the fleet to kill drones with those kind of numbers? it would always be better just to go after the supers themselves. and 20 supercarriers is a fairly modest fleet these days, you're more likely to see 60+.as for those who chip in about boosting dreads, while it seems like a good idea on paper, overall i don't think it works. we've gotten into the situation we're in now because of the boost-the-weak-things mentality without thinking of the longer term balance issues that will go with it. my guess is that if we can get ccp to move supercarriers into a more vulnerable place without a major nerf, dreads will become more attractive again just from a cost per loss perspective. that's hard to say though."
8/25/2011,"a couple of thoughts: 1.) reducing the number of standard drones a sc can hold is coming. i think this will go a long way in limiting the jack-of-all trades supers, especially if they limit it enough (less than 500, perhaps only 250). 2.) i like the idea of carriers bridging, however, it would need the bridge range significantly reduced from the carrier's range. i also think all capitals (orca's, frieghters) should not be bridgeable with a carrier. bridging should also cost more fuel than a titan, but less fuel than a bo. 3.) i don't believe it needs to be tied into the fleet structure. this is probably a cumbersome thing to implement. instead, the limits on how many ships a carrier can bring should best be resource limited. the portal can only take so much mass (harder to implement, but probably the best idea), or they require so much fuel that bridging in 10+ ships becomes fairly unfeasible. idea: if i were to implement this, i would have the mechanic similar to bo/titan bridges, where the carrier must fit the appropriate module (requiring appropriate pre-reqs and significant fitting requirements), and then they right-click capacitor and open a bridge to the destination. the bridge would last for 30ish s, where ships in bridge range then right click on carrier and bridge through to the cyno. at the end of the bridge cycle, the carrier bridges to the cyno. if they cyno is destroyed the carrier instantly jumps through."
8/25/2011,"goddamn mace sc vulnerable to frigates!entroduce critical point jump drive,drone control tower etcmake this **** game more interesting.rock,paper,scissors ftw."
8/25/2011,supers should be like stations in that they have have sections that can be targeted and damaged separately.
8/25/2011,"i like the suggestions, as well. i think that it sounds like the split-dronebays is in the works, so no need to touch on that. i was thinking about how one can 'nerf' the sc without making them less powerful against their actual targets, caps and structures. my idea was that they should be more vulnerable somehow. instead of lowering their hp, what about exploring that bridging concept as a benefit and weakness.suppose: supercarriers can only travel between systems with the bridge. certain other ships can come along with them. that should be discussed more, and i wont weigh in on it currently. so, no cynoing for the sc, just the bridging. give the bridge function a long delay, say 15 minutes or so before it can be reactivated. therefore, the supercarrier can only enter and exit via a somewhat expensive bridging process that leaves it stranded for and extended period of time. also consider making the bridge accurate to only 5,000 km so bridging in several scs at once might leave them scattered about until they can warp together. maybe after a 90 second warping delay after bridging. discuss =)((edit)) perhaps instead of completely screwing the sc with the lack of a cyno jump ability, allow it to use the cyno, but lock it's drone bays for a certain amount of time after cynoing in order to make the bridging necessary for combat jumps, but keeping it's cyno available for staging/logistics jumps."
8/25/2011,"even if a split drone bay is brought in, it probably won't help that much. as the op stated, even if only 20 supers got together and each launched 20 sentries, that is 400 sentries. when you have to deal with a blob of 60, 80, or 100, that means you face (only in regular drones) 1200, 1600, or 2000 drones. consider this also: the super carrier should really be called the super drone carrier. as this name implies, they should have a impressive capacity to field drones. having not kept up on this split drone bay idea at all, i would still guess that the drone bay on the super carrier will remain large. personally i'd be willing to get in the area of 1000m3 and in that case, there is nothing to stop a vanilla drone spam. it just means the pilot needs 2 open drone windows instead of 1.lastly, while the super carrier does need to be taken down a peg, it really shouldn't have the primary function (that of being a super drone carrier) removed. i think that if this happens they would end up being nerfed under the table like pre-dominion when they were basically only used as a ***** extension ship. restricting super carriers to only fighters and fighter bombers allows them to retain their role as ultimate structure/capital killers. one the same token, if they were slightly more vulnerable this might resurrect the role of the dreadnought as the sort of budget structure/capital killer. after all, with the ultimate power of the super carrier comes a very high cost. right now, if you have enough of them, there isn't substantial risk to make that cost mean anything. if you introduced a greater risk for a little less reward, people might be less eager to deploy a 15-20 billion isk ship when they can do almost as well with a dread for 1.5-2 billion isk instead."
8/25/2011,"i'll repeat, reducing the number of drones a supercarrier can hold is a useless change. it simply won't make a difference. with the skills trained up a super can field 20 drones. this is where the problem is. the sheer number of drones on the field when a fleet of supers is active is not going to go down unless you make the drone bay so small that it becomes useless; 100m3 is enough for 20 light drones. furthermore, the segmented drone bay change isn't there to cut down on the number of deployed drones, its there to make managing hundreds of drones in the bay easier. so segmenting the drone bay or reducing its size doesn't negate part 1 of my idea, it simply isn't germane to this discussion. the better, more effect, option is to remove combat drones from supercarriers altogether, and leave them with fb's and fighters only.other points:once again, i'm not talking about carriers having a bridge like a titan. i'm talking about them jumping their squad only. giving carriers a titan-like bridge is far far too overpowered. i can agree with limiting it to combat ships only to avoid people squad jumping freighters all over the universe (though the possibility of catching a full freighter squad in a bubble does appeal to my bloodthirsty nature). i disagree that the subcaps in the squad should require fuel to jump. i think that a requirement like 90% full cap at the start of the jump and say 10%(modified by jdo skill) at the end would be appropriate. adding fuel would make it too cumbersome. we've all been in fleets where it took an hour plus just to get everyone to the same system to get started, imagine adding fuel calculations to that for every single ship in the fleet. screw that. imagine having to do that to counter a sudden invasion. screw that even harder in the bad place.i can agree with limiting jump range for the squad to some extent, but i don't think that this is really all that necessary if the squad is limited to combat ships only. if this were implemented, it would be appropriate to match it to titan bridge range.i disagree with limiting the number or mass of ships that a carrier can bring through the jump by resource. regardless of how cumbersome it might be to code it to fleet structure, in game it shouldn't be more complicated than right-click>jump squad. likewise i disagree with making the fuel requirements astronomical, an unfueled carrier is a useless carrier. why would anyone use this if their carriers are stuck at the destination?a squad-jumping module is a good suggestion.as for requiring super to get around with bridges only; might as well simply remove them from the game then. why would anyone have one otherwise? but since that has nothing to do with my proposal, i'm going to leave it alone."
8/25/2011,"how about increase fuel costs on the carrier by something like 2-5% per squad member (20-50% total for a full squad) when doing a squad jump? it shouldn't empty the fuel bay, but it'll make the ""we need to get there now"" aspect more expensive ... the squad members should have to be within x,000 meters of the carrier... or they aren't able to come through the wormhole. also, bring back the old cyno effect"
8/25/2011,"that's reasonable. but i think there needs to be some penalty on the squad members too, such as cap usage, which is why i suggest that. it wouldn't be unreasonable to have both. hell yeah, and the big boooooom when you arrive at the destination too. that was the best part."
8/25/2011,"yeah, i wasn't saying that to negate the cap usage on the small ships (their shields or something need tuned to the ... blah, blah technobabble). i agree with that idea, and was only commenting on the fuel thing."

8/25/2011,"the agents in space cannot be warped-to by right clicking their name and location in the journal window like agents in stations. for example, if i were running a mission for ansbivand boe, in the mission journal it lists his name and location in a hyperlink format. if i have completed the mission i can right-click his name and set it as a destination, and then, upon being in-system with his location, i can right-click his name and dock at that station.when running agents in space missions it will display their name and the ship they are in, for example - jannegiers estacan's tristian in audaerne. i can set a destination by right clicking his location, but then when in-system that hyperlink is to the system, not the agent, so it cannot be warped to via the journal.i realize that this is because the agents in space are linked via their solar-system in the journal, not a bookmarked location. this would be one of many fixes to cosmos missions that would make the experience better.thank you."

8/25/2011,"fact of the matter is, the ships were *far* too overpowered before they started segregating bays (iirc, rorq on launch had approx jf-sized cargobay when rigged/fitted for transport).yeah, the way they have things now might not be ideal, but they're getting better (except incarna... that was a few steps backwards)."
8/25/2011,"quick comment on the bounty hunting ""contract idea"". the major flaw withthe current bounty system is that any friend or alt of the ""mark"" can collect the bounty by killing the mark - and giving the isk to the mark. so thatreceiving a bounty ends up being a joke.now adding a contract system in the way proposed still doesn't solve this flaw -since any joe alt can train up in bounty skills and then ""accept"" the contractand do exactly the same as paragraph #1 above.this doesn't take rocket science folks. and many players have already reiteratedwith the devs and ccp several times on this issue.in order to avoid the mark or friends getting the isk for a bounty - the contractormust be able to choose for himself the bounty hunter (or multiple bounty hunters). that is - there must be a pool of bounty hunters (skilled) that a hiring entity can choose from and then contract out the isk for the kill.obviously this would required more developing effort on ccp's side rather than justjury rigging the current contracting system. i know - any kind of serious developmentoutside of minor changes - given that two other games are being developed on evesubscription money - is a bigger priority right now and sounds impossible - but i guess it's still worth pointing out before yet another silly implementation is introduced that has little value."
8/25/2011,"locking time will make them useless, and since a subcaps job will be to fly close to dreads for maximum damage, dreads would never be able to track them even with tracking boosts. on top of which dreads will be a little busy dealing with supers to pay attention to sub caps. also sub cap fleets should always have logi support so any damage that does happen to come off dreads will be quickly repaired. making dreads stronger against supers with my proposed idea, does not also make them strong against sub caps.also let me add, since the mode will make it so you can't get remote reps, all low slots would be equipped with armor mods (so tracking and damage mods would be gone as well), local rep bonus is only to make them a little bit more resilient, not invincible, it's just to increase field time for a short duration, if your not getting neuted."
8/25/2011,"i'll call bs on this.the player base discovered long ago that the whole csm concept was just a grand circle-jerk, hence why voting numbers drop off year after year. it's just hillarious that some treat it so seriously - but of course, a free trip and nights of booze can alter your perception. and being such a grand concept, you only have to see how many of the previous half dozen csm's are still in game"
8/25/2011,i hate to break it to you all but all elections are popularity contests. that's why they call it the popular vote.and forcing people to vote on login? just creates disarray because the people that whine and gripe about what they think is important on here are the very vocal minority of players in eve online.
8/25/2011,"but so frigging what? end of the day ccp will implement changes that bring in $$ to the game, not to pander to squeaky wheels. the squeaky wheels certainly don't pay the bill's and the vocal minority could pack up tomorrow and go and play wot and ccp wouldn't give a tinkus."

8/25/2011,incarna is fine but it does not replace development on the space portion of eve.you can not shelve eve's art development for sofa's and expect players to be okay with it.focus on eve!
8/25/2011,"nah, thats not quite a bonus, any ship that fires before being sunk has their attack hit. (also, when did it change that missiles fired before destruction, but still on the field, hit? i only have old data)sounds reasonablei probably missed some (ignoring rails and non-dps ships):* those who dont: raven (+navy), rook (only 5), osprey navy, widow, golem, scorpion navy, rattle snake, hawk, worm* those who do: drake, nighthawk, phoenix, cerberus, onyx, caracal (+navy), tengu, buzzard, manticore, crow, hookbillbut really, if you cut out the faction ships and expensive t2 bs, there are very few practical ships really only the raven, rook, and hawk really only the raven is a missile speweras for the fact that they favor kinetic, some race has to. im sure caldari dislike the em from amarr and if you look at it another way, it would be great if missile users could trade range for dmg via ammo like turrets canthanks for the scenario this time (youre doing it right now!). so really its only a small fleet thing then?yeah, i try to be reasonable -- bear with me, i usually get the idea. could you give me data on that disparity by the way?"

8/26/2011,"with the recent complete lack of information in the new dev. blog, and the complete skullhammering of autopilot/routes today, +1.hell, +100 if i could. fix your product, ccp."
8/26/2011,"a player in null sec on a diet of sanctums can earn about 45 million an hour. however, a player on a diet of vanguard incursions in high sec can earn about 100 million an hour. when done competently, high sec vanguards can be done rapidly and with out risk where as sanctums are vulnerable to ambush. i've seen a few pirate faction battleships with multi billion isk fits in incursions.perhaps this is unfeasible, but incursions should drop the security status of a system below 0.5 (become low sec). if that is unfeasible then divide the concord payout by 4 or more.i suspect that the profitability of incursions is driving inflation which i find most notable in the gtc and plex trade. the last time gtc prices were this high was right before ccp's isk farmer purge; gtc prices then hit about 850 million.sanctums began to inject too much isk into the game before space improvements got nerfed and now incursions are doing the same, and with a very unbalanced risk to reward ratio.tl;dr - nerf incursions: reduce highsec payouts or have incursions reduce highsec to lowsec. as every player knows ccp is really good about nerfing.as an after thought, another nerf could be to slow each incursion spawn rate, perhaps to one per hour."
8/26/2011,"hmm. sit safe in alliance territory and run santumstrust a few random logistics pilots to my 2bil isk shipyep, nullsec is safer then low sec so lowsec should give 3 times the payouts as nullsec. also the best ore should be in lowsec. moon goo only in lowsecalso incursions are in null go for it"
8/26/2011,incursion's make more isk but for vangards you need about 10 pilotssanctum's you run solo so you don't have to depend on some random logi pilot (know that i fly a guardian in high sec incursion's) and if something goes wrong it usually goes wrong big time resulting in the los of at least half the fleet costing a lot more then your 0.0 ratting bs
8/26/2011,"i figured a couple of carebears would protest.first of all, herping yourderp, in a high sec incursion, you don't need to risk your 2 billion isk faction to the competence of an unfamiliar logistics pilot. you do it because you are in the comfort of high sec.null sec is safer than low sec only if you are friendly to or part of the alliance controlling that space and only by the effort of those players. trillions of isk are risked to control null sec space for which there should be ample reward. low sec does not have to worry about bombers; low sec does not have to worry about doomsdays; low sec does not have to worry about interdiction; low sec does not have to worry about losing access to assets. low sec is the low hanging fruit of experienced players killing inexperienced ones.the competitive payout method of incursions drives an elitism among incursion fleets for which there are enough uber fit faction bs to fill. that supply and demand can displace less wealthy players from participating. high sec incursion ultimately reward already rich player at a greatly reduced risk.bartsos100, losing ships to npcs is not risk; it is incompetence. i speak from experience.both of you ignored my main argument that this low risk high reward is a driver for inflation. this further displaces less wealthy players in general. high sec incursion returns don't just beat out sanctums, they beat out null sec complexes and their escalations too."
8/26/2011,incursions are for low and null sec aswell. go for it.
8/26/2011,"i support this idea.. it doesnt make any sense at all that if a system is invaded by sanshas that somehow concord can still attack on player ships, but cant attack/drive off the sanshas... if youre going to have a constellation get 'invaded' then concord should be disabled with security penalties still in effect but no ability for concord to come in to defend ships.either that, or don't allow any incursions to appear in hisec."
8/26/2011,"i've proposed this as well, and would very much like to see it.ccp wants money with micro transactions, well this one doesn't need to be so micro and i think it would get lots of use.i would also like to point out that names can now have two spaces, that wasn't possible when older characters were created."

8/26/2011,"this was indeed the best option we had, however he had his alt in a rapier (and later in a hyena) to sling him into warp with double webs, reducing his align time to only a few seconds. that's why i missed tackle when i attempted it, however i only got one chance so i bet if i perfected it a bit i would've had him. most freighter pilots wont log back in as often as this one though and after getting away the first time they'll usually call it a day."

8/26/2011,logoffski works in 0.0 and low sec too and there's freighters running through gates all day long you just don't see them since they just logoffski once someone is in local
8/26/2011,"you only get an agression timer if you agress someone. freighters have no guns/drones, thus they tend to not be able to actually agress."
8/26/2011,"thats not right. if you get agressed you will get an timer aswell, which will make you stay in space 15 minutes after you log off. if you agress a target before he logs off, he will get a timer that will make him probable for 15 minutes. confirmed by a gm. the agression timer your talking about will, for example bring concord on your ass if you jumps from low sec to hi-sec. the timer we are talking will not."
8/26/2011,the greatest mistake ccp ever made with regards to logging mechanics is not resetting the vanishing timer when new aggro is received.whether a pilot is online or offline when aggro is received should be irrelevant.
8/26/2011,totally agree!
8/26/2011,this was also a post idea by ris dnalor.+1 to any idea like it
8/26/2011,"the threadthe main idea is the same, yeah, but mine's doesn't affect the sig radius (which could be abused with a third ""neutral"" fleet) and is (i hope) a bit simplier."
8/26/2011,"problem is that by trying to avoid the scaling issue you are making them nigh useless when the 'blob' is not present .. in other words you are removing them from ""normal"" play.besides, if you are up against a carrier/sc blob using only fighters then you won't live long regardless as they can bounce the fighter swarm between targets thus eliminating tracking tanking .. can be ""solved"" by nerfing activation/weapon range of the fighters though.oh you mean like we have been used to for 4+ years when using bridge networks with a bring-your-own-fuel system .. took all of 10 minutes to get used to.if the carrier squad jump does not include fuel in excess of what a titan/pos bridge requires then we will be neck deep (instead of knee deep) in carriers and force projection control becomes futile .. not to mention titan's will be left as freighter catapults and lol-hotdrop mobiles."
8/26/2011,"not a big forum poster, but this is enough to make it worthwile.having owned a sc (sold due to lack of use) and using it in large , small fleets, and the lol-solo-hot-drop i do beleve they are very overpowered. the idea of removing the regular drones and limiting it to just fighters and fbs is a clear fix for scs. this also gives them a clear role as capital killer and sov structure grinder.the idea of allowing carriers to do what irl they do is amazing and i am suprised it hasn't come up before. allowing them to jump their squad is great.the only thing i would say is it has to be somewhat costly and a bit restricted.say bridge opens everyone jumps, the carrier has to be forced to jump aswell. or make it so that when the carrier jumps those in range are also jumped.reduce ccap of all ships to that of the carrier when they arrive.10%per ship fuel cost in addition to the cost for the carrier.limit ships that can be jumped to something that would normally fit inside the carrier. not say 1 bs, but all 5 as each would be able to fit inside. this keeps the carrier from jumping other caps and fts.just like the titan dd limit it to once every xx mins. this keeps eve big and keeps the titan bridge much more useful for moving large amounts of people quickly.having both the sc nerf and the carrier boost allows for a more balanced approach and should allow for some interesting tactics."
8/26/2011,"precisely what is ""force projection control""? if you mean countering the carriers deploying squads, then we have built-in methods of doing so; titan doomsday and fighter bombers. far from being futile, those methods are exceptionally effective. right now we're neck-deep in supercarriers which, for obvious reason, have no effective counter other than more supercarriers. carriers are relatively simple to counter.i have suggested no changes to titans, nor am i aware of any planned changes that would result in them becoming as useless as you suggest. nor do i believe that allowing carriers to jump a squad will result in them becoming useless. limitations on how the carrier squad jump works would prevent that. i hate to keep saying it, but calling it a bridge creates a false impression that this should be the equivalent of titan functionality. i've modified the op to reflect this, that i always intended for the carrier to jump, and the whole squad to go through the jump with it. if the carrier doesn't jump, nothing happens. i would expect the squad to be within close proximity of the carrier before this works.i don't know that giving this a time limit is really necessary, but i also don't think there's a good argument against doing so. the only argument i can think of in favor of a time limit would be to prevent a carrier from jumping a squad in, and then immediately pulling it back out again if the tactical situation looks worse than expected. but that squad could simply run for the gates anyway. i don't know. i'll have to think about that a bit.really, reading back over this thread, its surprising how much agreement there seems to be over the idea in general. there are tweaks and such needed, but that's inevitable. now, someone make sure a member of our esteemed council of stellar monkeys gets wind of it."
8/26/2011,"what ccp is planning in regards to cyno changes, jump ranges and what not .. jump-bridge nerf was first salvo in that particular fight. has nothing to do with ship balance per se.they sure are, but what about the remaining 9/10 ships that comes through with the carrier?directly, no .. but if carriers (which can dock, are dirt cheap and are built in stations) become capable of generic troop transport at marginal cost then titan's will become logistics tools for carebears and dps bricks for ganks .. because why use it for troops when you can just attach a bunch of throw away triage carriers that are probably going to be needed anyway?it is essentially doing to titan's what sc's did to dreads, obsolescence by doing the job better/cheaper/faster."
8/26/2011,"i'm afraid we're going to have to agree to disagree on that then. i doubt it will make much difference. titans will still be used just as they are being used now, backup for the supercarriers in sov bashing."
8/26/2011,"not empty quotingyou say keep isk completely out of it but by making it ""tradeable"" you give isk sellers and bots a whole new can of s*** to rmt and farm. once again giving the rich a way to outstrip the regular joes.fail idea. go home. stop thinking so hard."
8/26/2011,"lamo u guys still need to slow down when u read.first off its not something that will be farmed.it is a mission available to each person only-only once per year....annnnd u don't trade sp that u already have in your skill sets (because that stuffs not movin).it is merely a small bit of lp u earned from a new (not yet implemented)and special npc corp.that lp if u so desire is redeemable at that 1 npc corp (for sp), so u get that sp... ? well it goes into an allocation spot and sits there until u use it and its very little say 100k - 5mil. thats only once a year mind u and its a push so u get to 450mil+sp before u pass to the after life.the point is that the small amount of lp / sp thats earned and hasn't been allocated should be tradable. even lp u currently have from current missions. lp is like a store token system."

8/26/2011,the algorithm wouldn't affect caps. the lock dynamics would remain the same in those instances. it could implement a change in large fleet warfare. i c it making individual squads being lead by the squad commander with the fleet commander issuing tactics and objectives but more/less that end result is left on the shoulders of the squad commanders to lead their squad to accomplish victory and ultimately a fleet victory.

8/26/2011,"the csm started out as a noble idea to bring player issues to ccp attention and to discuss issues which effected all of or certain playerbases before implementation.but as soon as the people that use it for their own ends got into it, it became a joke, just like modern day politics.the csm now is just a group of goons and other douche-nozzle alliance reps that have ccp's ear. it will never be anything more than that in its current incarnation."
8/26/2011,how's that coming along then?
8/26/2011,"i agree that psn getting hacked was a huge blow to them and their users and is completely unacceptable.. on the other hand, i trust them to correct it as theres no reason they couldnt. im sure they have learned from their mistake.since they arent making(i assume) dust514 a pay a monthly fee game, the best other way of making sure you earn money on the game is making it a console game. i also think that linking a console game to a pc game is even more incredible than linking 2 pc games. i also agree that announcing the coorporation with sony right after the hack is a strategic mistake whatever their reasons were. but the way i see it, sony has made the best ps3 games thus far and so even though making dust514 is a daunting task i would like to trust them to make the best of it, these days theres very few game makers that i completely trust."

8/27/2011,"in general i support fog of war. ccp, nerf local."
8/27/2011,"negative sides of local chat are so much more than minor social benefits of having everyone listed in local. it is also possible to make it so that it only shows you to people you want, i am sure. but then people can just use spais in your pathetic corp to watch you.not only does it make theoretically impossible to catch anyone since they just warp out to safety when they see someone in local (especially bots), but also evil pvper sees the carebear instantly in local when he comes into solar system. this is also true for low sec. in hi sec you don't need to care.problem with delayed local in normal 0.0 is that it would take ****ing forever to see if there's someone in system with current scanning mechanics. but it surely would be better than instant local intel lololo."
8/27/2011,"have local have a delay for updating.. u appear in local if u remain in system for more then 2min, this means a frig passing through isnt seen in local, also if he enter he has 2 mins to find that damn hulk pilot that is mining, hope he picks the right belt!"
8/27/2011,"i would change local to something like; you warp in system, you are not seen on local. if you type something in local, you're name will appear."
8/27/2011,"i agree with the op. the problem, as i see it, comes with the combination of the extended afk cloak combined with the cyno. since anything can be brought through the cyno, a small pvp gang of 8-10 simply will not suffice as a defense against a single, risk-less, afk cloaker. i have seen dozens of supercaps, a dozen titans, dozens of carriers, and other ships jump through a cyno. while you could go to the next system, i am seeing more and more afk cloakers so that most systems are now being cloaky-cyno camped by them.here are two ideas: 1) automatic log-off for any character inactive for 1 hour. meaning absolutely no interface with the eve client for an hour straight. 2) auto-decloak after 30 minutes. a message comes up alerting the player of the time remaining before auto-decloak. the player simply has to re-cloak (meaning be at the keyboard). could be something about the ability of the ship to maintain cloak for a finite amount of time continuously. 3) mobile cyno jammer ship. add that ability to a hic. have it activate on an ihub or sov structure so the ship can be scanned down and destroyed by a small gang if unsupported. optional: require blue standings to sov holder to prevent neuts/reds from jamming the system."
8/27/2011,"really, really cool idea! +1 i would suggest no decloaker as it could be very op at gates, but cloaking scan probes can probe to zero, but the time between scans is several minutes and requires a system-wide warpable field active so that the cloakers can warp directly to or near the prober for intel on fleet comp or for attack."
8/27/2011,"how about bringing some friends while you rat in nullsec?if you want risk-free pve and you can't make any friends to help you, go to highsec."
8/27/2011,"did ccp state they want to introduce anything but cosmetic features into the in-game shop? in the current system you can buy a character off of other players legaly, as in get sp for money, you can legaly invite yourself to a buddy program and get a 51 days for free. it doesn't seem like ccp's after the money. ccp introduced the plex, they let you pay for anything you want with in-game money. i bet 90% of you never spent a dolar on this game and you're trying to portray ccp as money grabbing *******s."
8/27/2011,"it doesn't matter. you can already buy anything in eve with real money, just buy a ton of plexes.it's really a stupid move by ccp, because now everybody is in arms against microtransactions. before they were easily getting away with it, through plexes. and the vets might dislike it a bit, but they accept this because it means they can play for free."

8/27/2011,"manique, your comment is biased.the argument is that incursions in high sec provide an imbalanced risk to reward ratio, the competitive payout method favors the rich, and this is a potential drive for inflation which would further favor the rich ...and i think you're attire speaks for itself."
8/27/2011,"hey, flamebait, leave the trolling to the professionals.there's already a whole section of you newfound null-sec carbears whining about how awesome high-sec is over that way.if you really like the profits of high-sec so much, move there.payouts for incursions are already scaled to be more profitable in low and in null. useless thread is useless."
8/27/2011,"first of all i don't like the profits of high sec incursions, and your back handed comment begs the question ...hey, i didn't know trolling is a profession! how much isk have you earned doing that? are you sponsored?...and if my thread is so useless, why did you post? you mad, bro?---since the comment that ""incursions are for null sec as well"" has been put forth and my snide response was poorly received, i'll address it. due to the highly hostile and competitive nature of null sec, access to it is very limited. i mention this because you don't seem to know. on the other hand high sec is near perpetually accessible.in high sec the same fleet, corp, alliance, gang, blob, whatever can glut themselves on incursions day in and day out. the income is phenomenal even compared to level 5 missions, which are, incase you don't know, solely in low sec.i think this is so broke that i bet if you averaged the players income earned off of incursions in high sec and compared it to the average players income earned off of incursions in null sec that the average income off of high sec incursions is significantly higher than that off of null sec incursions."
8/27/2011,supporting because this is true
8/27/2011,"good job of selective replies because you still can't answer my question: how is it in any way logical or consistent that concord can enforce defense if a large fleet of players was to fire on another fleet of players, yet concord is somehow unable to fight off an 'invasion' by relatively weaker sansha forces? (and they are weaker, otherwise incursions would never get completed.) it makes no sense at all and is utterly ridiculous in any way you look at it.concord should be disabled during incursions in hisec, keep the security penalty, but keeping concord active is idiotically inconsistent with what is supposedly happening. either that, or don't allow incursions in hisec."
8/27/2011,"i have never done an incursions. i just know your a moron if u think they need nerf because sanctums are easier and safer to do.also, payout in nullsec is 2 times that of highsec last i checked... cant u also assign fighters to your fleet? if not oh well still nullsec incursions existof course though, anyone who disagrees with you is a carebear"
8/27/2011,"wrong. the payout is a couple of million more (15m for a vanguard, what is it in empire?) and how can you assign fighters when you can't get caps into the system?"
8/27/2011,"isk reward is morelp payout is moreif cap is in system wouldnt it be possible? doesnt matter, in the end, its safer in nullsec as long as u own the space or know how that area works"
8/27/2011,and you apparently don't have the slightest clue how nullsec works.
8/27/2011,you have the right to your own thoughts. also you think wrong of me. as for inflation make it riskier to the highsec incursionists. the mechanics are there. the numeber of groups pirating/warring the incursionists is ascending.
8/27/2011,"i agree with the basic statement that empire incursion rewards are somewhat unbalanced, warranting a moderate nerf."
8/27/2011,"nullsec is highly hostile and competitive. except when it's a massive freaking naptrain, and you blue everything. in regards to your comment about average income - all you'll learn is that a vast majority of null players aren't running incursions. too busy ship toasting on the forums. someone besides null-sec is making money. create more whine threads."
8/27/2011,"my reply wasn't ""selective"". i just decided to point out the stupidity of someone who would go through the trouble to edit someone's forum name to try to degrade them. (while failing miserably, i might add..)i actually somewhat agree with you on this, chun. however, seeing as how ccp probably won't ever remove concord's involvement in high-sec, i would suggest that they *significantly* increase concord response time. think of it as concord having to break through the sansha hordes to get to the scene of the crime."
8/27/2011,"manique, i'm comparing the nex attire in your portrait, pricey threads i might add, and your post's bias toward a system (high sec incursions) i'm calling out as an unbalanced risk reward ratio. i'm insinuating that you are of the uber wealthy that this system favors. also you're comment was snide and i responded in kind, and perhaps insultingly so. i'll edit ""idiotic"" to ""biased"".""who's more foolish, the fool, or the fool who follows?"" - ah star wars quotes. if you're having trouble with the allegory, think of it this way, ""who's more stupid, the idiot who starts the thread or the idiot who posts in it?""is this any better? after all you insinuate that you are a pro troll ...or are you just the mold hiding in the forgotten lunch sack under george turklebaum's desk."
8/27/2011,"did you see me buy a monocle ? nope.did you see me buy an under 200 mil pice of clothing? yes? why 'cose it was same set with the white pants available for my carebearish achura caldarian character. why did i chose the vanity? 'cose 200 mil was not so much effort after almost 5 years of playing. also i barely pay for my game time so i see no real issue. if you do not know ... hush!on another note if you knew high sec incursions well you would see the 2-5 bil ships handing their asses to logi pilots and so much more dangerous moments for them because people get very creative to kill this new kind or breed aka incursionists. want to bring havoc to them and lower their income, 2-5 bil takes alot of effort to get even in the not so safe heaven of called empire *high security* and it will make people reconsider runing incursions if you make them loose those. ofcorse there are hardcore incursionists and there's also alot of people who can not run them. overal incursions won't make much difference if another special breed of people -read this as incursionionsm griefers/pirates - which i already see active makes people lose their hard worked uber pimped incursion ships or keeps them on hold by war dec-ing them all the time. also high sec incursions means alot more close team work then null sec. much more team work and much more trust involved each moment.my concerns right now is low sec, which my carebearish guts tell me to avoid. null sec ftw, high sec not so much as it gets borring.a change to the whole incursion sistem is a must, wherever it is- high, low or null sec, it's too much isk. but then again, there is no important inflation if everybody can make isk. no one keeps you bound to high, low or null sec. as for high sec incursions i personaly know people who keep their null sec war machines on by runnign incursions... ahh there is so much more to this. no one keeps you bound to null, low or high sec. move arround ... opportunities are all over and can make your null sec dwellers happier with ""safe money"" which means more *pew-pew*. sink the new isk in more *pew*."
8/27/2011,"perhaps i should illustrate my concerns with some estimates.tl;dr - i estimate that incursions print an extra 0.3 to 1.0 trillion isk per day than before the incursion expansion.first let me stipulate the difference between generated isk and earned isk. for comparison a level 4 mission will typically generate around 15 million isk in mission rewards and bounties. a player can earn more with salvage and loot, but that is isk that has been generated previously and is circulating in the economy. i'm assuming the basic time frame for a level 4 mission is 1 hour.as raised before, i assume the average incursionist is earning 100 million an hour, but this is isk generated or ""printed"" by the game. that is a 666% increase in isk printing by the game.to elaborate further i'm going to assume that there are an average 480 incursionists generating 100 million isk an hour in high sec (3 incursions in empire, assume 2 in high sec, 6 systems per constellation, 4 incursions per system, 10 players per incursion, and using vanguards as an average).the extra isk generated is the difference between incursion payouts and level 4 payouts, which is 85 million isk. multiplied out over a day and the number of players involved, that becomes an extra 940 billion isk generated per day.fresh isk generated off of incursions might not be this large but it could easily be half or a third of this amount. back when ccp was contemplating deleting learning skills, they considered reimbursing everyone for the learning skill books. this freaked out their economist because it would have dumped 3 trillion isk into the game in one day. incursions achieve something similar in 3 to 10 days, and it continues."
8/27/2011,"oh hey, could you post a link to that thread? im sure there is much to be gleaned from therevery true.i wasnt aware of that. its kind of like what 'oldbutfeelingyoung' wrote when i tried out this game i never asked myself if there was an option to change names (my fault, i know) only to realize it later on that it was not possible. the very process is vague and now they've altered the rules. this flawed process needs correction"

8/27/2011,"i always thought that they should scale station models, as in, the more traffic through the amrket they get, the bigger the station is, with the biggest being the main trade hub (jita in this case) which would be 3 times the size of a normal station and have its very own unique design, since it obvioulsy gets influence from all 4 races since it is the main trade hub (because of the palyers, yes, but i see alot of minnie and gally players going through). so it would stand that with that many people coming and going everyday it would be a massive station."

8/27/2011,"so back in 2008 we had some talk of changing the bounty system. we are all aware that it is broken. looking at the top bounties in the game reveals that eve online hold em seems to be the most wanted corp in eve. i'm just guessing thats their way of holding collateral for betting. i'm more than certain that these characters with ridiculous bounties will never ever undock again. its a joke, but not a funny one i'm affraid.- why even bother having a bounty office button in stations if the bounties are all for eoh chars or ppl who want fame?- why have concord billboards at every high sec gate showing off the top bounties if the system is broken?- why allow new players to think for a second that by placing a bounty on the guy who just can flipped them or podded them that they will get even an iota of revenge? when infact they are just making their enemy more famous or more rich.hunting legitimate criminals and griefers could be one of the most fun features of our little sandbox, hell it could even draw in new players! why no fix ccp? and if were not getting a fix why not just remove the system? currently this bounty system is being exploited by eoh. and i personally would like to see them come up with another method of holding deposits rather than co-opt the bounty system for their needs.so come on eve community lets get this settled like it should have been back in 2008!i will not offer solutions as i have seen dozens on these forums. to reiterate them all would be pointless.i would however like to see a complete list of bounties available to all pilots, not just the top 50 as this creates a populartiy game."
8/27/2011,"we know, the bounty system has been a joke since it's inception, the lack of a working bounty system is a glaring hole in empire pvp, dozens of suggestions have been made to ccp. they're not interested."
8/27/2011,"this would just create more lag, far more than the minefield plan, which would create a max of 10 objects around a gate, instead of 30-60 objects around a gate. both would add lag, but one more than the other."
8/27/2011,if u add minelayer we need a ship/module to clear mines... oh wait smartbombs.
8/27/2011,"well i remember proteus that could tank up to 750,000 ehp or higher... it could tank the minefield and clear it out... in theory."
8/27/2011,what i suggest is for sum skills like the planetary interaction skills to allow only the maximum number of planets to be used of one character of the account not all 3it will make pl less hectic having to use all characters in order to collect significant amount to make iskand it will allow for others players to collect different material since you cant collect all the kinds by your ownthe prices will adjust depending the need
8/27/2011,"no cause pi will become even more worthless. eventually pi would be almost unprofitable if that happened, your supposed to depend on others to get the other material for your supercomputers and whatnot. a lot of things use pi materials and a price drop here can result in price drops across eve"
8/27/2011,no pi will be more profitable since less material will be available in the market the result product will be more expensive.
8/27/2011,"no, your right, there will be less of the base materials on the market, but they wont become more expensive, they will become worthless, since because everyoen can now saturate the market (if your idea was to come to fruition that is) then people will only buy the end-product and it too will become worthless since everyone and their mother can supply them, meaning pi and anything that uses pi would see a significant drop in price."
8/27/2011,"how everyone will be able to saturate the market when only one of your characters will be controlling the planets that is 6 planets, not like now that one account controls 18 using your alts ?"
8/27/2011,"i support it will boost market prices for pi products ,and you not going to have to use all 3 characters to control planets in order to make considerable profit and more players will get interested"
8/27/2011,"i think everyone is forgetting something. just because you get podded doesn't mean that your portrait changes. think of it like this. let's say you got your passport photo done back in 99' while you had a mullet. ten years down the road, that passport picture will still have a goofy ass mullet, even if you don't. so, unless you change your portrait, you'll still 'have' an uber l33t sick m0nocle. it shouldn't be destroyed (cause it doesn't grant bonuses anyway) and unless you change your portrait manually, it should appear that you always have one. but then again, why does it matter? it doesn't grant bonuses, so its an issue of haters-gonna-hate. not supported."
8/27/2011,so... you keep you're clothes in pod?
8/27/2011,"i didnt forget, but i think of it like this (using your scenario):lets say back in 99 you had this really expensive necklace you wore for your passport photo. ten years down the road that passport photo still has the necklace, but it also has that goofy haircut. you want to change your photo to reflect your improved tastes, but suddenly you remember you lost your prized necklace. guess youll have to buy it again or do without.it matters because it sets a precedent of items being invulnerable in eve -- invulnerability for items goes against lore and logic -- and you are arguing for making items invulnerableit grants a (questionable) aesthetic bonus i agree that you dont wear clothes in the pod -- but i also think that every station having every item for every pilot that owns the item is equally . if you own something, you take it with you or you dont have it at the momentccp needs to htfu and let 'em all burn"
8/27/2011,i beleive male characters should be allowed to wear female dress. it is unfair to place such strict restrictions on clothing for a game that prides itself on being an open sandbox. i spent my noble exchange money in anticipation of becomming the best dressed male player in this game and i was denied! if female pilots can wear suits i dont see why i cannot war a beautiful dress. please take this into consideration.
8/27/2011,"first off, how did you not notice the thread in this forum with almost the exact same name as this one? or did you just want to feel special and start a thread of your own covering almost exactly the same topics?when you refer to 'fixes' for lowsec/faction warfare, exactly what are you referring to? what kind of 'fixes'? thats extremely vague.ship spinning would be nice again, but id much rather see supercap nerfs, or mining becoming worthwhile again, or about 100 other aspects of the game addressed before this is.as for 'better information' or 'commitment to excellence', again those are very vague.if you don't have time to present a specific proposal for any of these, please don't just post a generic complaining thread, as this does absolutely nothing to help things. saying ""fix it"" without saying what about it you want to see fixed is rather idiotic and resembles the beauty pageant women who say they want 'world peace' without presenting even a single intelligent idea about how to accomplish such task."
8/27/2011,"hey, what a coincidence. i *did* notice the thread once someone pointed me in the right direction. next time you criticize, please, use your words - and maybe a bit of punctuation."

8/27/2011,"so then, another 2 months before these minutes see the light of day? this csm has become a joke and is literally almost insignificant. it seems mittens is getting his wish. csm is no longer a relevant entity. ccp will now destroy the game we know and love without anyone to check their moves."
8/27/2011,"told you so!this is getting beyond a joke. who writes the damned things any way? if we wanted to read a press statement from ccp we already have plenty of those.why do you bother? i'll answer that, so that you can influence the course of the game in your favour without the trouble of being accountable to those who elected you."
8/27/2011,"two months for a draft. your comments take 2 or so weeks to get finalized, then sent to ccp who will take another two months to respond to your response to the draft. which will need a response from the csm to the response of ccp to the response of the csm to the draft minutes. we should see some minutes appear march 2013."
8/28/2011,"i could see a couple of changes to warping.mostly graphics changes, not so much mechanics.1) arrival and departure - need to be more abrupt and dramatic.going into warpcoming out of warpboth examples -made by ccp- show ships warping into or out of combat zones. not aligning and accelerating for 2min, or decelerating for 2min on the other end.2) as others have noted, the ability to pass through objects really destroys immersion. not only is it bizarre to warp through a planet, but it's annoying to accidentally warp cloaked through something, and be bumped visible before ""dropping out of warp"".a very simple solution, rather than altering trajectory to make curved routes, is to make the warp tunnel far more opaque.warp tunnelthen your route can take you through whatever, but you don't have to see it. you just see the other ships in your fleet (if you did a gang warp).on a side note for this, not having to process and render the entire trip could potentially make loading the destination quicker, thus having less lag upon arriving on grid."
8/28/2011,"why not tier it somthing like this.high sec. same as now only war targets and negative standings aren't highlighted.low sec- instead of posting player names, only their corp, or alliance, name and info are available. it would only display one corp or alliance in local wether just one of it's members or all of it's members were there.unless they speak. 0.0- only the number of players is posted. and those who speak. augmented by showing which corps or alliances have a presence in the constellation.wh-no one shows up in local unless they speak. same as now.this would keep the ability to know when threats are present without showing everybody's cards."
8/28/2011,"i would go for this as long as people with excellent standing and/or are in your corp/alliance are always shown, because realistically, if you know that a member of your corp is in sytem, you should know who, without having to ask in local ""hey buddy, say something so i can know your here"", would make sense, though anyone not excellent standing or your ally would only appear as their corp name until they talk.null-sec shouldnt have anyone but allies listed in local-chat unless an enemy/neutral talks, then they appear in chat.i say this because, realistically, if someone is your ""ally"" (in your corp/allaince or just blue"" then assuming local is like talking on the radio, then you would know the radio-freqs of all your allies and be able to know whos around you, so long as they are your ally."
8/28/2011,"why do think the original poster is ratter and anomaly runner, probably in a pet alliance, stuffed away under another alliances protection who had probably never had to fight for the space they exploit. who want's everything easy and zero risk. who probably runs and docks up when a red fleet comes down a pipe instead of fighting for the right to be there in the first place.sorry love. there is no 100% safety.- it does not define exploit.- not everyone 'knows' it's a problem. only free riders like you think it is. - nothing is being done because it's perfectly reasonable and people need to deal with stuff like that in your little isk making playground.i think you should stick to hi-sec. or maybe nice cookie cutter mmo where you can't lose anything and pvp is consensual."

8/28/2011,"in addendum, while in cq, i want to be naked! why does ccp fear genitalia?"
8/28/2011,"your image about this is off. too much to tell you why, but all i can say for certainty is your numbers are way off."
8/28/2011,so what you're saying is that a group activity consisting of 10 to 70 players should be earning less than a solo activity in null sec?
8/28/2011,"tl;dr controlling null sec is a group activity in the hundreds and thousands that trumps that argument. the other concern is incursion payouts create too much in game isk and devalue isk and cause inflation.servant's lord, that is half of the issue. yes i do think that incursions in high sec payout disproportionately to activities in null sec, and grossly so. ratting or mining in null sec might be a lucrative solo activity, but establishing, conquering, and defending sov is not. i'm glad some players are finally getting exposure to the fleet experience, but controlling null sec is a group activity that requires hundreds if not thousands of players, and requires communications and intelligence that dwarfs that which is required for incursion fleets. i'm sorry you have missed out on this experience, hopefully you guys can find some commonality, numbers, and the confidence to come out and conquer some space. as the lord, you should know that you all should have the isk to do that by now.my argument is hypothetical, but i have been in incursion systems packed with 100+ players trying to get into high sec incursion fleets, thus i don't think my figure of 480 players across 2 high sec incursion constellations is off; but even half or a third that number, which in my observations is incredibly feasible, has a significant impact. also i have been in a few incursion fleets so i do know the average payout on vanguards is 10 million per player. also vanguards can be efficiently completed so that each player can earn 100 million an hour.my other concern is inflation. as i explained before, i suspect that incursions are generating an extra 300 to 900 billion isk per day over previous or traditional sources of isk generation. another way to express my concern is that the ratio between the total isk created and isk lost in game has been tilted by the incursion payout method and by the strategies of elite players to maximize that source of isk. this is a game economy issue that ultimately only ccp can really answer."
8/28/2011,i'd change my name.i'd keep the beyblade reference.
8/28/2011,"reasonspvp once required skill and an advanced understanding of ships capabilities and game mechanics. these mechanics are very rarely required or used these days due to the mentality of 'lets repair so much none of us die even when we make stupid mistakes'. a small group of people will often in a game with as many people on a single server come up against larger groups of people. i have no issue with this, if you fly in a small group it should require better skill to combat large groups, but it should always be possible (within reason) to take them on. with the use of remote repair a small group of people often end up utterly powerless to kill a single ship because of the large volume of logistics ships. a gang can quite happily go up against your small group safe in the knowledge that the enemy simply cannot do the required dps to break their reps or cause them any meaningful damage. this was a benefit to smaller groups in the past as only the smaller groups tended to really use them, but this has changed and now they are common place in 99% of gangs whether they be small or large.it also goes both ways, you can get a single heavily tanked ship jumping into a massive group of people with several logistics supporting it and beat them. this is not a balanced game. the only way to get kills is to rely on the enemy making mistakes by flying out of rep range or getting caught away from the gang, or failure on part of the logistics pilot. a game where combat is defined solely on the hope that the enemy will make a mistake is a broken game. as important as mistakes are in combat, pilot skill should be equally if not more important. possible proposals:1) introduce a system where by large remote repair modules only work on battleship class and larger, medium on battlecruiser/cruiser sized ships and larger and small on frigate class ships and larger2) give remote reps a stacking penalty meaning the more reps on a single target the less effective repairers become3) have remote reps give off a target painting effect increasing targets sig radius"

8/28/2011,actually a good idea.not supporting this would make me gay...er
8/28/2011,"essentially remote repping mechanics are ****ed up, neutral rr and all that bull****then you add overpowered logistic ships to chain and you got pile of poo.supporting general idea."
8/28/2011,brilliant idea
8/28/2011,"i forgot the neutral empire logistics issue, have added that to the proposal.thanks"
8/28/2011,"there are a few points here that gimp small gangs a lot. first, your pretty much restricting triage to sc blob warfare. a single triage carrier can be the ultimate weapon for a small gang taking on -bigger- gang.second; guardians with med reps makes me cry a little inside. i have worked hard to be able to get into fights using minimal logistics against a bigger gang. reducing the rep amount they can pump out imo will only lead to an increase in logi ship usage. imagine the gangs you see now but with x2 the logi and you see what i think will happen.problem with this game atm is too many fgots thinking blobbing is clever who are too scared to lose isk than actually enjoy what they are paying for with real money."
8/28/2011,i fully support this idea.
8/28/2011,"a small group of battleships could easily punch through medium remote repairer ability unless they field an insane amount of logistics which wont happen.yes what i'm proposing does in some way damage smaller gangs, but if its good on a small scale for a small group it becomes out of hand when applied to a larger group on larger scales.as it should be the defense against larger gangs should be either having a better class of ship than them or using speed to your advantage.large remote reps were never initially designed for use on small/medium sized ships, they cannot be fit on to small ships for the same reason you cannot fit a large armour repairer to a cruiser sized ship, the modules are meant for different classes. what i'm proposing should be natural common sense. as someone said if a 300 man gang is shooting a target that target should die, it should not be able to tank - thats ridiculous."
8/28/2011,if your 300 ships can't alpha a target you're doing something wrong.
8/28/2011,lag often prevents alpha damage with module delay etc. and even 300 people would struggle to alpha down capitals.
8/28/2011,im not bothered about 0.0 quite honestly. but surely there is better ways than what you are proposing. how about restricting capital rr to only repping sub caps? why should a blob of supers be able to tank on that ridiculous scale? why are moms even allowed to rr anyway? surely that is the domain of the carrier and why the triage module was specifically created?imo if you're shooting a target with 300 people and its not dying you are either shooting the wrong target or you need better gunnery skills.
8/28/2011,yay thumbs
8/28/2011,"yes supers could have a lot of armor reps from triage carriers however if a carrier goes into triage it itself cannot receive reps meaning it becomes a vulnerable target.often on the field these days in 0.0 there is only capitals because of how tough they are, you may not care but i and many others do.i understand and appreciate your comments but if you have been in large scale fights you would know that even if a primary bs is called for a 300 man gang it can take several minutes to down them due to module issues and lag."
8/28/2011,/signed
8/28/2011,"so the issue is lag, not remote repair. if there was no lag, the target would get alpha'd. so fix lag, don't nerf rr. it works fine.also, alpha capitals? no. that's why they're capital ships. bring your own capitals if you want to make that happen. how many times do rifter gangs alpha battleships?"
8/28/2011,"fix lag, simple as that? ccp may be trying but its not working there is lag and that currently is not fixable.the problem with bring capitals is that capitals only weakness is more capitals making other ships almost pointless in fights and means that the alliance with the most caps wins - it requires no skill and no tactics... its essentially pvp for dummies.i think an alliance that wants to conquer space and hold things should have to field both classes. regardless of all of that though, the current rr situation is killing small pvp and its not right that small gangs are left powerless to fight other gangs of relative size because they have a lot of logsitics and simply cannot be killed even if they're terrible."
8/28/2011,yes.
8/28/2011,"- you're still suggesting to nerf rr instead of fixing lag properly- you're now also suggesting to nerf rr to fix capital imbalance- you do have to field support. not only just with capitals. every proper gang needs support like logistics, ships with poin"
8/28/2011,"i'm not just now suggesting it, it was in the original post - capitals should be weak and vulnerable to support, and you really don't need support to take space, yes biggest blob wins and yes that is largely due to lag, no i'm not saying dont fix lag, i'm just being a realist, an assembly hall topic asking for ccp to fix lag would be a joke, they're trying but its not happening.more than large scale though i am wanting change because of the affect rr has on small scale pvp, large scale spider tanking capitals are imo a secondary concern, but a concern none the less.this game used to be about more than biggest blob wins because there used to have to be tactics, the introduction and increasing number of capitals has beaten tactics and thrown them out of the window, its now just throwing stuff on to the grid and giving a primary.but as i said above my main concern is with small scale pvp where you get gangs of people who are powerless to do anything against other gangs not because of lack of skill or guts and not because the enemy have skill but because of the increasing number of logistics ships being used and more importantly using large repairers on medium sized ships."
8/28/2011,"this does not fix capital spider tanking because, like you said, capital mods affect capital ships. also, logistics have the less powergrid usage bonus because they have to fulfill their role.the result of this will be that battleship gangs become more powerful and smaller gangs less powerful because the small ship gangs would simply require more logis to have enough reps to keep the gang alive.also, what do you consider a 'small gang'? a 5-man frigate gang does not have logistics in it.even with a medium-against-medium kind of engagement, the bigger gang still wins because they have more guns and more reps. size unrelated. so what's the use of this change? i can say from experience that a well-coordinated small gang does beat a bigger gang where nobody is following orders."
8/28/2011,"gimping ships with a clearly defined role, like a logi, should never be a means to give lazy people a better chance of killing some ships....a 300 man gang is not a small gang so that argument is redundant and bears no relation to your original post about making it easier for small gangs to get the upper hand. in fact, well piloted logi do precisely the opposite for actual small gangs.0.0 is a mess, full of massive alliance blobs intent on blobbing everyone out of existence so that they can rmt their mortgages. make it harder for these napfests and blueblobs to happen and you will get your small gang warfare."
8/28/2011,"this is a very flat view, and please i don't mean to offend i appreciate all constructive comments however i get the impression you don't do much small scale pvp.if you again read my original post, i only agree with capital reps if a capital ships is in triage doing so making themselves vulnerable to attack since a carrier in triage cannot be remote repaired itself or field drones/fighters.with regards to bs's beating smaller ships, yes if its up close and personal, if you match the stats however this is what it was like previously and speed could often counter battleship gangs, smaller ships should rely on fast movement and mobility, larger ships should put out more damage and take more punishment but are slow and clumsy and struggle to hit smaller ships.if you nerf large remote reps on medium sized ships yes people could bring more but it would have to be a lot more to keep a proper full reps to their current extent. what is more likely is the amount of rr would be reduced, still keeping logistics useful in that they can offer reps and prolong a ships life but most importantly they do not make a gang invincible."
8/28/2011,"i agree totally but just like fixing lag that wont happen, csm is supposed to represent the people and most of them like things as they are. i think rr damages large scale pvp and this was in my original post, but as i keep saying its small that needs fixing. if a 10 man gang cannot fight a 15 man gang because 4 of those 15 are in scimitars that is bad for the game. logistics do have a role yes, and im not saying remove them but everyone has gotten far too comfortable not dying, pvp is supposed to be risky, dangerous and exhilarating that has for the most part gone. ships should and need to die, logistics should not be the be all end all, and remote repairers should be only available to the appropriate matching class just like with every other modules in the game. the fact that a single tech 3 ship with a brilliant buffer tank can jump into a gang of 30-40 people while being followed by several logistics and win the fight is a clear demonstration of how remote reps are broken."
8/28/2011,"gimping a ship isnt the only way to take it out of a fight. ecm, sensor damps, the 'overpowered' ecm drone, alpha ships, neuting. and even if all that fails maybe just shooting them until they pop?oversized mods on ships is more and more common and i dont have a problem with that, not that i use them myself."
8/28/2011,"we're talking small scale pvp here, gangs of 5-10-15 people, ecm is unreliable not to mention with eccm very easy to counter itself and neutrilizers are all well and good however how many people are you supposed to bring with you just as a counter for logistics, and where is the dps supposed to come from.oversized modules is not common at all, there are large remote reps and 100mn ab's thats really it. can anyone really say that pvp has improved over the last 2-3 years, i'm sorry but it has not, it has gotten progressively worse, blobs are a big factor but by no means are they the only factor, everyone wants to take the risk out of pvp which is unfortunately making pvp very stagnant and very boring."
8/28/2011,"if people think the capital rr nerf is a step too far however i would be happy to remove that part of the post - it doesn't really affect me but i do believe its a problem. more importantly though i want to have small pvp make a come back, so if you would support the initial point but dont support capital rr nerf let me know and i will adjust it if significant numbers approve."
8/28/2011,"ok, so let's say capital reps only work with a carrier in triage. now the triage is vulnerable. but: you still need 30+ ships to break a triage's local tank. bring the blob!no, small ships don't tank with mobility. that's why even battleship blobs have support like loki's to web stuff down. battleships can have target painters. there you go, battleships now counter cruisers. frigates against battleships is retarted. you'd need dozens of frigates to break a battleship that is being remote repaired. how do you fix that? a battleship can have 200k ehp and a frigate has around 200-250 dps. it takes 10 seconds max for a guardian to finish the first rep cycles on a battleship; you now need 80+ frigates to kill a battleship before a guardian gets repping. your suggestion does not fix this; battleships can get repped by large reps while the frigate gang now has to use smaller reps. conclusion: the frigates are the one suffering from the nerf that is actually supposed to make them stronger.so i'll give you some feedback on your opening post..this is already happening. 50 vs. 50 battleships = everything gets alpha'd, or dies with the correct target switching. learn to fc.a supercarrier has 80 million ehp. you're not going to kill that before a triage gets its reps on it. no way. you'd need to alpha it. again, nothing changes. triages can still fulfill their rr role.again, cruisers against well fit carriers that have their own support like battleships and tacklers is not good. not to mention that a single triage carrier can actually be the deciding factor that gives the small 10-man battleship gang the ability to beat the 40 man gang. why would you nerf this? the 10 man gang now has to bring its own 6-8 guardians. bigger blob created.a single dread can't take out a triage carrier, and multiple dreads would be useless after the carrier is destroyed. now you have a bunch of completely useless 2b-isk capital ships sitting on the field, vulnerable to counterdrop. now, after this nerf, carriers would also be unable to provide further assistance to their smaller friends apart from fielding a couple of drones which can also get popped by sentries. now both capital classes are useless when the hostile caps are off the field. i suggest you fly down to amamake and watch the amarr militia, they fly gangs with battleships + guardians and drop in triage if hostiles are getting too big in numbers. battleships are popular. they kill battlecruisers which is what most other people fly.plenty of ships die already.<U+FFFD>n the end, good fc'ing and a fleet that follows orders is still a deciding factor. small scale pvp is what i do."
8/28/2011,"supporting this as although 2000 man fights look nice in screen shots, there is no exhilaration here like in a 3-10 man roam.i like the idea of signature radius playing a part so logistic ships can still field their large reps, but they are not 100% effective on medium sized or lower ships. logistic ships and triaging caps should have some exceptions (or they'll end up like dreads), but do need some changes. i.e. the modules could also have some optimal/fall off as wellall the same, agreeing completely with the premise that pvp is pretty dumb at the moment and needs to change now the game is truly capital-ships-online."
8/28/2011,"people in arguments tend to speak in extremes, i'm not talking about frigates vs battleships, and yes mobility is a tank, burning out and warping off the field still counts, you have speed you can get away dip in dip out keep transversal if things are bad you bail then come back in, battleships have no such luxury. not many people use frigates on large scale so i do wish you wouldn't keep referring to them. frigates have a use as a tackler but above that are pretty weak, but thats ok because that is their role. battleship fights do happen, but they are not very common, particularly in 0.0. i never said you would kill a supercarrier before it got triage reps, what i said was that when that carrier goes in to triage to rep that supercarrier you could target that carrier in triage, please read my post properly, eventually if they keep throwing in carriers in triage to rep the supercarrier a few things will happen, they will run out of carriers or support will come in and push the hostiles away, my point is that by forcing reps via triage you make that carrier offer a weakness to exploit in smaller ships. again you comment that you need a blob to kill a carrier in triage, thats fine i'm not talking about a 10 man gang killing a carrier, small scale and large scale are two very different ball games.looking at your stats i can see that you are an empire fighter (empire pvp is great some times) you may well have the pleasure of good battleship fights but in 0.0 especially they are far more rare, battleships are slow and clumsy and are far more vulnerable to capitals. they also have bigger signature radius's and lower resists then their smaller counterparts. this results in smaller ships having an advantage over them, a well organized armour hac gang with large volumes of guardians up close and personal can absolutely rip battleships apart.plenty of ships do still die, but not enough, and this is coming from experience of 0.0 fighting.i get the feeling that me and you will have to agree to disagree, but i still stand firmly behind my proposal.yyou've made some valid points but i feel i have countered them appropriately and if we continue i think it will degenerate in to a flame war. i never said good pvp doesn't exist any more, but i absolutely beleive it is far less frequent.regards"
8/28/2011,"we as a corp have good 5 - 10 man roams, but we can not fight what we would like to on a day to day basis, i'm sure there are other small groups out there who feel the same..- mayb nerf the range on the rr ?also- small reps only can rep small class sips, medium to medium, large to large and cap to cap etcc.- supers can't be rep'd at all as there huge ehp and immune to electronic warefare etc...that sounds good to me :d"

8/28/2011,"no idea i don't like here but i think the 1900dps are a bit too much even for a glass canon dromi (drone domi xp )but i'm not sure if you calculated stacking penalty ?maybe with that counted in dps goes down a bit oh yeah and i want to rep myself with my drones too =palso what should be in your post too is that all the effects that increase drone damage as well as ship bonuses should be increasing the effectiveness of all drones (ecm, repair, webefying,target painting, neuting,etc)with that it would finaly make sense to use rep drones on a domi or neut drones and be finally as versatile as it should be without gimping yourself!also web drones need smal and medium sizes so do target painting drones!"
8/28/2011,"i like the underlying principle of the proposal. drones do need quite a bit of love and i am fairly sick of being laughed at by corpies for my drone fetish. that said... i do have a few issues...nahhhh. it seems more reasonable that when their hp reaches 0 from overheating they would blow-up entirely. using nano-paste to repair them is a nice idea though. if you look at other t3 subsystem bonuses you'll notice that they all fall slightly short of the t2 ship bonuses they mimic. given the fact that t3s are modular and can be ""multi-specialized"" it's not unreasonable to assume that their subsystem bonuses were slightly ""nerfed"" to prevent them from totally obsoleting the entire t2 cruiser class.hence, we have the proteus that can be ""ishtar-like"" but not exactly like it and still be able to do other things that the ishtar cannot even convince of doing (i.e. 10% active tank bonus, 10% armor hp bonus, fitting 3 of the largest cruiser guns without sacrificing anything else, etc).so the proteus is fine as is imo.while i would love to be able to field more than 5 drones with the domi and pump out close to 2000 dps, i feel that it would be a ""tad"" overpowered in comparison to other tier 1 battleships.no... in order to balance this i feel that the dominix would have to give up the ability to fit any turrets/launchers (and perhaps give up a high-slot or two). in return, i'd ask that the dominix get a slightly larger drone bay.all in all... i like the idea and give it my support."
8/28/2011,"i like it. the grandeur of a station should be measured by its prosperity, which can only be measured by the volume of trade ( and brokers fees) that are funneled through it. jita should be an expansive station with multiple launch bays and an equally large docking radius."
8/28/2011,"jita was never designed to be the central trading hub, the players just turned it into that over time. i'd much rather ccp focus on fixing bugs or correct balance issues than monitoring the activity level in stations and redesigning them to be more grandiose. there's far bigger fish to fry."
8/28/2011,"if the scale of items would ever be in the focus, the issue would not be limited to only station(s).however there are much more important issues at the moment, which actully affect the gameplay. this is purely cosmetic and has very low priority."
8/28/2011,i always thought the whole mass station undock and trade hub stations were really badly scripted/set up.stations 1) should be bigger in general and 2) should have multiple undocks. it just makes sense from a design aspect :)

8/28/2011,"wow.... just wow. most of this post is incoherent, and the parts that are barely understandable are all old rehashed ideas that have been gone over and dismissed (eliminating local would create no difference between wh space and nullsec... the whole point of nullsec is different layers of risk/reward you can choose, if you dont like local move to wh space) or ideas that already have 20 other threads with the exact same idea you couldve posted in (dreads as supercap killers? gee, what an original idea...)"

8/28/2011,i submitted a draft (for both ccp and csm comment) on friday in response to ccp's draft.my draft was the 5th draft of the minutes.
8/28/2011,who made the other drafts and when ? and how long are you prepared to continue in the back and forth ?
8/28/2011,it seems ccp and the csm are in a huge disagreement on what the tone in the meetings was based on the two months it has already taken to produce the minutes.
8/29/2011,"the electronic attack frigate needs a targeting range boost.for example a max skilled pilot in a kitsune has a maximum targeting range of 52.5km, however the optimal range of any tech 2 jammers fit to the ship is 60 km, plus a 35-50km fall off. to add insult to injury the tech 1 varient of this ship, the griffin, has a raw 60km targeting range; wtf?!"
8/29/2011,"t2 is not simply an improved version, it takes the base hull and specialises it into a specific field/job it does well. in the case of the kitsune, that is close range jamming. it needs a boost for sure, like all eafs, but targeting range isn't a big deal."
8/29/2011,which is a pretty useless role for a tankless eaf. buff lock range.
8/29/2011,"do eafs do their job well? have you done a review of kill mails and fleet combats to gauge their effectiveness? i rarely see these ships used and that's when i'm flying them; and i'm often told i am an idiot when i do.the kitsune receives a boost to the optimal range of its jammers, what's close range about that? also that optimal exceeds it's max targeting range; there in lies the disconnect in the game logic. also, modules like the sensor booster that increase targeting range are itemized under electronics. and, as far as the kitsune is concerned, caldari ship design canon tends to favor long range."
8/29/2011,i would like to purpose that the t2 armor plates have an actual bonus over tungsten plates as it is right now all they do is make the ship heavier there is no benefit every other defensive aspect has a bonus with the t2 version
8/29/2011,"the biggest, most obvious ship balance atrocity committed by ccp is the supercap design.there are so many things wrong with them that to point out several things would be doing injustice to all the other things left unsaid.i try to stay away from all fleet battles in hopes of avoiding them, but with current cyno mechanics still get hot dropped by supercaps even in small 2x2 skirmish fights."

8/29/2011,"seriously 1000 times supported, this really peved me off (amongst other things but another time), the new turrets on ships are really really cool, but the icons are so bad it's impossible to tell what's what.as suggested, don't waste a team of mal-nourished scandinavians spending months designing some bull****e new icon, simply roll back the database, simple, takes you no time at all, everyones happy."
8/29/2011,"ccp said they wanted ideas about sovereignty, or at least about null sec.why sovereignty? let me skip the history of pos spamming and how we got to where we are today. basically sovereignty was a system set into play to determine who controls a station or outpost.ccp worked in a few perks like pos fuel economy, jump bridges, cyno generators and jammers, and super capital production. i think fuel economy is a nice perk but for the sake of this thread i'd like to ditch the sovereignty limitations on pos structures and instead have those structures influence sovereignty.in the current manifestation ccp developed a means by which occupied space could be improved. conceptually i think this was a well received, but ihubs, tcus, and sbus feel forced and gimmicky - almost like capture the flag. i remember some of the first sov fights were not fleet engagements, but who could shoot down the other guys structure first. this became an obstacle to a raw fleet fight, which ccp thought it would inspire. from hence forth i excommunicate any mention of sovereignty structures; any post harboring or in support of discussing such structures shall be met with chiding and ridicule.sov indices provide some possibilities for expansion and reinterpretation. in general this idea attempts to base sov more on player activity than static structures. pos shooting will be involved, but hopefully not so much.industrial indices are based on all industrial activity. volume of ore mined and refined, rarity of moon goo harvested, science and industry (including super cap production), and pi could all contribute and buffer the industrial index of a system. the industrial index should be the prime drive of sovereignty.strategic indices are based on jump bridges, cyno gens, and cyno jams and traffic (use of those structures). this should be a minor driver of sov. with the sov limitations removed from such structures, a hostile force could incap one of these structures and set up their own to challenge or reduce sov and facilitate their own logistics.military indices. instead of being based on how many rats players kill, it could be based on skirmish and fleet fight results. major routes and victories should have a large influence. the data base exists for it, why not use it.i'd also like to suggest the influence of market activity, but wether that should be it's own index or not? i do think it should have a significant impact on such a sov system.high sov influences sov in surrounding systems.as for ""improving"" space npc pirate factions and rogue drones should be attracted to the surrounding space of high industrial activity, and perhaps shy away from war zones. the greater the industrial activity, the more weird stuff shows up on your borders.when sov is won, a station simply capitulates to the management of the winning alliance holding corp.aside from implementation, there are a lot of loop holes in these ideas, but that's what criticism and ridicule is for."
8/29/2011,"some parts yes, some parts noi really enjoyed the idea of pirates showing up to encroach on your high-value systems, maybe make it so that as well as industrial, your alliance's standings come into play, if you have major-negative with amarr for example, you might see some amarr task forces attacking your ****, or the like, would eb interesting to see the established npc sov at least try to interact with the rest of sov, as it is it seems npc and player empires are separate from eachother entirely, compleetly different universes, and the npc's shoudl at least try to ""harass"" systems near them of their ""enemies"", even if it is something as little as making their belts an ass to mine in, null-sec should get that what with abc being moved to them and them only, they could use soemthing to add a little extra risk and put a spin on things."

8/29/2011,"a crazy but very interesting idea was spoken of, have incursions make the area temporary remove concord (so it is like lowsec).in addition to the (supposed) problem of them being too rewarding and safe, it would make things much more dynamic. dangerous space with high rewards suddenly appearing, possibly disrupting a local area of space temporary. how people will react, who knows, but will be chaotic."
8/29/2011,supported for halving the rewards of high sec incursions and doubling low sec rewards.
8/29/2011,i don't know what kind of numbers are you crunching but if people make over 10bil a week from blitzing hi sec incursions that should raise some questions about balance.you don't need to wonder why there's supercaps on every corner.and it's not even best isk around. go figure.
8/29/2011,"i disagree with your suggestion because it is very arbitrary. limiting something with made up rules that are not based in current mechanics (powergrid/cpu/ship role...) is bad design.so i give you a counter proposal that could work well:have repair systems neut the ship they are repairing, at certain strength based on size of module.the neut strength should be tweaked in a way that using large armor reps on a batlleship would not interfere much until too many (6+? 8+?) are on it.that same number of large reps on a medium sized ships would neut it very quickly, and lower the ships mobility and tackling.problem with this version: gives more power to weapon systems that do not require cap to fire.alternative 1: have the repairs increase the mass of the target instead (armor) or sig radius (shield). this will increase damage received from larger ships due to drop in speed or larger target. also the drop/bloom will be much worse for smaller ships.problem with this version: gimps the ahac metagame, which is a nice alternative to bs blobs.any more ideas that do not involve solutions outside of current metrics?"
8/29/2011,how about not ****ing things up for pvp and pveers alike? rr is fine.
8/29/2011,"very interesting ideas and definitely welcome comments. i would say though that going by my rules (ignoring the capital rr) logistics ships would still be playing their role, they could still use large remote reps, just unable to use those reps on medium or small sized ships.for your first suggestion, i would love the idea of the neutralizing affect however as you already pointed out this would put ships less dependent on cap at a massive advantage, not only that i believe it would further damage small scale pvp which is heavily reliant on speed, mwd obviously being a very cap intensive module. your alternative option i believe wouldn't work as the idea that it increases sig radius would almost nullify the point in having reps at all. i do however think that ahac is more of a problem than it is a solution to pvp, i love hacs but they should not be able to stand toe to toe with bigger stronger ships, i don't believe that fits within the role for which they were designed.i'd love to hear more ideas if you have them, i don't pretend to be the know it all of how to fix this problem, but i believe there is definitely a problem and if it gets fixed somehow then i'll be happy regardless of whether or not its my idea that gets us there."
8/29/2011,"i do not see how this trashes anything. it is merely a theorycraft and would apply to everyone, so no side is left with an advantage.also i do not agree that rr needs a change, but i do enjoy debates.actually that is exactly what they were designed for. very specific and narrow situation in which they are superior. and a lot of broad situations where they are not. easy to counter, yet brutal when you are unprepared for them.anyway, basing it on ship class is very arbitrary and breaks the flavour of the world.ok here is another idea: have each rr module a ""scan resolution"" for shield or a ""mass resolution"" for armor. if your target is smaller than your rr modules scan resolution you repair it for a reduced amount. same for the mass resolution.that way larger modules can repair smaller ships, but they repair them for a smaller amount."
8/29/2011,"adapt or die you chose die now you come on here and cry its damn sad seeing eve these days its full of whiny crying carebears that are just too fing lazy to adapt to a given situation so they cry there widdle eyes out on the forums ps. ""pvp once"" im sorry but eve is changing what once worked dosnt anymore the skill in eve is to adapt as you fail miserably at this please just get out save yourself the time and the tears"
8/29/2011,"what tears? i'm still a succesful pvper, what i'm saying is its harder than its ever been, and i can see it continue to get harder.if anyone here seems angry its you, and this 'adapt or die' thing that gets thrown around so much is normally a shield for people too inept to pvp properly and who are scared of change."
8/29/2011,"grazer must be one of the players who happen to enjoy the max fleet blob gangs. it is enjoyable to some to rely on piloting skill and tactics vs lining up or mass warping to some point in space and hitting f1 to engage the enemy pos or counter blob.adapting is what everyone continues to do. pvp is not dead, but larger and larger gangs are forming everyday and most of the time the only way to engage them is to set a trap or pick off the odd ship or two. i've seen countless fc's wait to lead a fleet until they had ""enough"" logi. losing ships is part of the game and if there is no risk of dying then it is not nearly as fun :) wtb good fights.*edit: if pvp was always so perfect then why did ccp ever nerf any ships? sometimes you can not counter things that are too unbalanced."
8/29/2011,"handofsatan yes of course i must be musnt i because i dont agree with this idiotic idea and pvp is getting harder well good lets all enjoy the challenge a self appointed ""good"" pvper like yourself should relish this"
8/29/2011,i never said i was any good at pvp. i do enjoy small gang roams and have joined countless large gangs as well. i've played long enough to notice the difference in pvp is all. eve constantly changes but atm 0.0 is sort of lame and so are small gangs. using more people to counter something im sure is not what ccp intended for pvp.
8/29/2011,"you know, there's one thing the op hasn't mentioned, and none of the replies.this entire issue can be fixed by fielding ecm. and you only need 1/2 to 1/4 the number of ecm ships as they have logistics, and boom. problem solved."
8/29/2011,"ecm is a possible counter yes but it can also be unreliable and is in its own right counter-able with eccm. i'm not saying there aren't ways to counter logistics but its becoming harder to counter due to the sheer volume and while a repper will always be dependable it isn't rare for a jam to miss every now and then, especially if your trying to jam multiple ships, and one missed cycle allows ships to rep back up fully.one example was this evening, there was a 40 man roaming gang, roughly 25 drakes, several hurricanes, some support and twelve scimitars.a drake is a 30m isk ship. i don't have calculations on damage required, but with a drakes already heavy tank + 12 scimitars repping it makes a drake insanely tough meaning that our well equipped expensive gang couldn't even attempt an attack.my point is this sort of invulnerability should not be available, you would need probably 100+ people in decent ships to destroy a 30m isk drake in the above situation. i don't understand why people think this is right?with regards to pvp getting 'harder' by the flamers post, its not getting harder as in requiring more skill, its getting harder as in bring more people, if skill could counter logistics i wouldn't have a problem."
8/29/2011,"outlawed ships(tm) are ships that everyone in the game can attack and engage at their own risk, so no concord involvement if you decide to shoot at ittwo different approaches to achieving this:1. either by creating a new line of ships (perhaps they are ships that are very similar versions of existing ships but with different bonuses) that are banished and outlawed by the goverment, it is illegal to fly em2. all existing ships can become bad guys. tracked by either their 'license plate', insurance, or by a specific fitting or simply because that ship has been involved in a lowsec piracy activity. in any case, whenever a ship is marked as 'bad guy' the pilot will have a choice of quickly and easily swapping out his 'license plate' or he can keep that ship as it is and fly around waiting for somebody to agress you.concord will provide information on map where one can find pilots flying outlawed ships, and perhaps even intel about what kind of fitting the ship has.whatcha think"

8/29/2011,"i would like to be able to play eve from my htpc but, even on the lowest resolution setting, the font is pretty much unreadable from my couch."
8/29/2011,i propose to have access to specific chat channels outside the game through eve gate. channels such as corp and alliance as well as any private or personal channels that a character is using in game. i figure this shouldn't be too hard to implement since the chat is maintained on a separate server from the game itself. (this is why you can lose connection to chat but not to the game) this would be particularly useful for keeping in contact with your alliance and in game friends while away from the game. this would also make eve gate useful as right now it is pretty darned useless.i am sure this is not the first time this has been suggested either.
8/29/2011,"+1 this would be quite helpful for keeping in touch with people if i can't actually load up the game. two things i would suggest though. first, have an icon next to the name of anyone who is chatting through gate instead of the game. second, you should on"
8/29/2011,"yeah i thought about the icon indicating they are not in game but figured it was sort of a given. something they would likely do anyway if this was implemented. yes only chat channels that are currently accessed in game on that character not including region, local and so on. should only be alliance, corp and player made channels that have been joined. channels like ""help"" and whatnot should be fine."
8/29/2011,"first off, the big issue i believe most null sec alliances are having for mining and production is the ""war"" system, right now it has no structure, which is fine but it makes the situation very chaotic and unstable, awesome for offensive actions but not for defensive actions, mining is not needed or wanted because miners are just liabilities. mining you need to be stationary, in 0.0 its not good to be stationary.... i was thinking using a risk style system for wars, except for covops/stealth bomber/black ops. i believe all the gates should all be locked for players who are not part of the alliance and only the outlying system(s) of someones space should be battlegrounds. i think that your space should be your space, you should be able to dictate who goes in and out of your gates....i bet a lot of people will hate this idea because it will limit hulk kills but ehh... it will allow people to mine as much as they want but yet letting covops/stealth bombers/and black ops the ability to go through and do some damage and fit more into their roles and giving a black ops a huge edge in messing with enemy alliances and lastly this will allow alliances to have full level 5 systems for mining and the ability to keep it/them much easier.thank you"
8/29/2011,"how about no?if you cant defend your own miners, then no, you shouldnt have any.deep-striking by sneaking past an enemies outer territories in order to attack where theyre vulnerable is a legitimate strategy, and all blocking off gates will do is make it easier for null-sec alliances that are big to keep getting bigger, as no small alliances can sneak in and cause hell, and the only place anyone can fight i on the ""front lines"" meaning if your not part of a power-bloc that is in that fight, then your dead, it would break null-sec.im sorry if my refusal to accept your idea that was clearly thought out poorly hurts your feelings, but think about rammifications of what your proposing before you waste forum space proposing it, thank you."

8/29/2011,"preamble:there were lots of tears and game-breaking solutions for last years - like negative wallet ballance or even skill removal. but i belive that i've found simly solution that makes everyone happy, almost:when placing a buy order and setting up minimum quantity of buying items, you must invest isk for that quantity in market, regardless of margin trading skill level.this will not affect usual traders and will be much more realistic in compare to rl market. there still will be ability to scam, but it'll be less profitable and more risky like it should be."
8/29/2011,"or you could do nothing since this scam is so easy to spot it is not even funny.well it is funny when people fall for it. in fact, it is hilarious."
8/29/2011,yeah personally i like that scams are as common in eve as in rl. but i belive that when risks vs rewards are equal zero then something is broken.
8/29/2011,"scamming is always a ""0 risk"" endeavor. what exactly do you mean by saying scamming is broken?"
8/29/2011,"you're trying to play with words which i didn't say - it's not worth my time. also scamming isn't always 0 risk endeavor, but again this discussion is not about this topic. there's exploitable game mechanics in the market and this topic is about it's fixing."
8/29/2011,im sorry but scamming is legal in eve wittle pubby so how can you fix something that isnt broken oh and if you are stupid enough to fall for this con you deserve to loose your money as you are two things 1. stupid for falling for something that is way way too good to be true didnt anyone ever tell you if it looks like that it is (no there is no probably)2. greedy you saw how much you could make and without thinking or double checking you took it i dont think about what im buying sometimes and ended up with a 888million isk bestower but you dont see me coming on the forums and crying about it.tipsthis is for you and any other incompetent pubby that wants this removed or gets scammed by it think next time
8/29/2011,"lol, thank you captain obvious! next time try to read before post, this is not that hard. for those who can't tl;dr version is in bold.and no, i wasn't scammed that way."
8/29/2011,sure you wernt poppet please cry some more
8/29/2011,"wouldn't work if you want to legitimately use mt to place a buy order for a single unit of something for a high price.the obvious (but not so easy to implement) fix would be to temporarily remove an order if selling the minimum quantity would fail. this should be done as soon as the buyer's wallet drops below the price of the minimum quantity, not when someone actually tries to fill the order. the order could potentially be listed again automatically when the buyer gets enough isk again."
8/29/2011,why not? in this case you just need to have isk for setting this buy order. in my proposal setting a buy order without actual ability to buy at least its minimum quantity(one item in your example) is impossible. also i don't get why someone will set a buy order just for one item without intention and ability to buy it. and this should not be allowed by game mechanics.your solution is good too.
8/29/2011,"margin trading exists so that you can set up buy orders for numerous items without having the isk to pay for all of them right at that moment.imagine this -- you're setting up buy orders for your next 3 month's stock of lp store tags. you don't need them now, or even soon -- you've got an adequate stock. you just want to be able to grab the steady trickle of people that are too lazy to put their tags up on sell orders.because you don't want to have to set up new market orders every 2 weeks, you put in large orders. if the order is satisfied immediately, cool. if not, whatever. that's why you set the expiration at 90 days.now suppose that you're doing this for a wide variety of tags (or, indeed, any item. ammunition comes to mind). you don't have the money to purchase all of it right now, even at the buy order price -- but you're reasonably certain that at the rate they sell at, you'll have enough to pay for it over time. if not, oh well -- that's why the buy order fails when someone's wallet is empty. they'll get more money later.that is why margin trading is useful. your proposal breaks this.edit: and this is why people want to market orders to query people's wallets to see if there's adequate isk to fill the order. however, this wouldn't even stop the scams -- it'd just mean that the person would have to be at the keyboard to transfer the funds once the sucker swallowed the bait. and to be honest, you don't even need margin trading to accomplish that -- you can just cancel the buy order."
8/29/2011,"but you then run the risk of someone acquiring the items you are ""buying"" from somewhere else (or perhaps having them stockpiled, so ""buy out the entire universe"" doesn't work either), and filling your buy order without buying your stock."
8/29/2011,"a little more realistic is that the amount of isk taken in escrow to fufill minimum margin requirements is either forfeit as a market fine, or used to the maximum available to fulfill the pending order. the fact that the market order simply breaks without any loss in escrow other than a prepaid broker fee is the broken bit.i have yet to meet a real life counterparty using margins for any commodity that would simply allow you to keep the money already in escrow without a series of fees or fines for obviously attempting fraud, if not outright ejection from the counterparty system."
8/29/2011,"to aamrr: certainly i understand how helpfull this skill is, and that's why i don't want to break something with it's fixing. maybe i don't understand your point because of my low english skills but i don't see how my proposal may break your scheme. you're still able to set any number of buy orders you want for any number of items and margin trading skill will work for them as intended. the only change is: if you want to set the minimum amount of items for purchase at once in your buy order then you need at least have isk for that quantity, that's all."

8/29/2011,"before you start calling people ""stupid"" or ""boy"" you need to learn how to used proper spelling, punctuation and grammar in your posts. following which you need to have decent ideas that haven't been hashed out time and time again. posting an idea and then immediately attacking the first (or second) person who does not agree with you is bad form. makes you look like an ass. as for your ideas...none of them are really any good at all and would only serve a select few people such as yourself and your alliance in getting more isk."
8/29/2011,"yea attack my english pro man. not everyone speaks proper english or were born in english speaking country. btw see how did that ****** started his post with what sentance. btw dunno how with nano gangs, removing moongoo and making supercapital killing ship would get big alliances in advantage or gain us more isk. all u write is just a bull**** with no real argument. tbh when i read stupid post liek yours and from ****** above i really hope ccp leaves the game as its now. pls dont touch game dont remove local , pls dont nerf supercaps and dont touch moons. we got all that and noone else does including both of u:)"
8/29/2011,i never said that supercaps didn't need balancing...i also did not say that moongoo issues shouldn't be looked into. all i said was your idea was not a good one and also it was not new. frankly moon mining should be dynamic. make the moongoo change moons every day or week or whatever so it moves around systems and planets. as for caps they are already balancing them all out end of this year so in my opinion there is no need to give more ideas when they already have a plan.you are still insulting and arrogant. stop calling people names just because they don't agree with you.

8/30/2011,"i just said they all need a buff, so obviously i don't think they do their job well...but a simple lock range increase won't change that at all.i did mix up the bonuses though, i thought the kitsune had the higher strength shorter range jammers that all the other t2 jamming ships have.what to do with them? i'd start by giving them an extra slot and match their bonuses after the combat recons (i don't have eft or anything here right now to calculate cpu/grid, but it may need to be adjusted to work with the new slot layouts).kitsune: +1 mid, jam streng bonus increased to 30%/level, optimal range bonus replaced by a 5% missile rof or damage bonusit can now fit a speed mod, mse and a rainbow of jammers. 2 low slots for sdas or damage mods and 3 bonused launchers in the highs. less range, but ~50km is enough for a frigate, brings it in range with its weapons and now has tank+jam strength to survive.sentinel: bonuses already match the curse and it's not too shabby already. +1 low to encourage an armour tank. again, no eft here atm, so depending on its current dps, work the cap recharge bonus into the hull (or not, considering the extra low for a cpr) and add a drone damage bonus.4 lows for armour tank, speed or cap, 4 mids for mwd and point plus tracking disruptors, mse and/or a cap booster. maybe boosted damage depending on what it has now.keres: boost the warp disruptor range bonus to 20%/level like the lachesis, combine the point and damp cap use bonuses into one and add either a hybrid damage/rof bonus or increase the drone bay and bandwidth and add a drone damage bonus. +1 low.4 slots for armor, cap and/or speed, 5 mids for mwd and your choice of ew. for example 1 disruptor, 1 scram and 2 damps would make it a fast tackler that can fly ahead of a gang and hold something until they get thereby pointing it from outside its damped lock range, with a scram for self defense and to slow down fast ships if their lock range is low enough that you can get in range with it. unfortunately damps in general are pretty weak, so that's obviously gonna hurt the keres, but that's a separate issue. atleast it will be a decent tackler with the ability to put out some damage with these changes.hyena: boost the web range bonus to 30%/level, matching the hugginn, and work the sig radius bonus into the hull, replace it with a projectile damage/rof bonus. +1 mid.3 lows for speed and cap, 5 mids for mwd, point, mse and either 2x webs or 1 web and 1 painter. combined with the damage boost it should be fine."

8/30/2011,"this is by far the best idea i've seen to address this issue to date. it's not perfect but its a hellova start. it also adds credence to pirate factions taking interest in these systems and risk / reward increases as a result. this adds to the immersion of the game. certainly a better system than having a module that ""spawns"" more pirates and more sanctums and such non-sense.suddenly ideas like the population of a station in 0.0 looking at the situation during a war and choosing sides with invaders if they see a potential partnership that places them in a more favorable position. or if not a population, how about a despot?suddenly ideas start to flow. work with this some more guys."

8/30/2011,"and tripling 0.0 rewards. that wukld be fare, 0.0 its not for free that **** its verry expsensive."
8/30/2011,"to clarify a few points...1) if it takes you an hour to run a lvl 4 in highsec and you are only making 15mil an hour (15mil per mission 1 mission per hour) pre loot/salvage you are doing it wrong. in a drake i can average 20-25mil an hour.2) for the non uber selective incursion fleet you are maybe running 5-6 vanguards an hour this equates to 45-60 million isk (incursion ninjas always seem to pop in at the last minute) before you factor in ammo spent (which is a lot). the rest comes from selling implants/capital meta items. granted you can get into a shield fleet of nothing but basi's and sleips/machs and roflstomp them but that is a rare occurrence and not the norm for the casual player.3) one of ccp's goals is to reward team work. how does nerfing the one piece of high sec content that can't be done solo or with an alt keep in line with that goal.this is just another one of those whines similar to ""blasters are fine because of brutix"" or ""drake is op because i see them everywhere"" or ""dramial is fine because it costs a lot."" please stop calling for nerfs to things you don't know about!"
8/30/2011,"accommodating for your numbers, tiny mongo, incursion payouts still generate an extra 25-35 million isk an hour per player. let me low ball participation to say 100 players across 2 constellations, that's still 2.5 billion an hour, 57.5 billion a day, 400 billion per week, or 1.725 trillion per month extra isk in game. this extra isk is still 1% of the daily market across the game. what your carebearness is ignoring is that isk is a commodity and that this payout system has increased that source without increasing a sink or a loss mechanism. as more and more isk enters the game and less evaporates, each individual unit of isk becomes less valuable; inflation? if you are so hard for incursion rewards and it's the only carrot ccp has at the moment to get you guys into fleets, ccp could reduce insurance payouts on ship losses to mitigate the extra isk created - perhaps eliminate insurance payouts to ships lost to incursions."
8/30/2011,"if you are worried about inflation in the game you would do well to address botting in eve before you consider nerfing incursions. how much income would you say comes from all the ratting/mining/missioning/sanctum running bots? if the real concern is ideal isk/hour generation:i personally feel that the best solo content should always be worse then the worst group content as far as isk generation (not including lp influenced isk since that fluctuates day to day). the reason being my group content depends on more than my ship and my skills, while your solo mission/site does not. i could end up in an absolutely terrible group and only make 30 or 40 mil an hour before ammo costs are subtracted. sure i could just leave the fleet but if there isn't any other fleet or they are looking for logi instead of dps i don't get to play or a switch to a logi and roll the dice for having that fleet be better than the last. p.s. there can be many other factors inducing plex/gtc prices to spike. one off the top of my head is the global financial downturn. more people are out of work and are buying plexes to keep the accounts up where they used to be selling plexes. what this means is supply is dropping and demand goes up. another factor being its late summer - plex prices tend to rise during the summer and drop during the winter months."
8/30/2011,"as i pointed out before, what you are referring to as ""solo"" content in 0.0 relies on the support of alliances of hundreds if not thousands of players. alliance support un-solos that content. sov is the ultimate group activity in this game and its only reward is access to the rich resources, loot, and bounties that are found there. i find your argument on this point, tiny mongo, myopic. if you think 0.0 is safe, try ratting in hostile space, or try pirate mission running where a friendly alliance is not near by (which, by the way, i find has a terrible risk to reward ratio).bots are every where and spies are in every channel, and on every forum. i don't know the numbers on the bots and you have not provided any. i'd have to do some research and crazy thinking on it before i could splatter these forums with that nonsense. a classic solution for bots, that gets perpetually proposed and rejected, is to get rid of local in null sec.the real cream pie you provided was the global economic down turn. is this community that pathetic? maybe i should just quit."
8/30/2011,"i wholeheartedly and strongly disagree with you. to counter that fleet, i would bring roughly an equivalent number of battlecruisers and/or battleships, 9-10 logis of my own. and just 3-4 falcons/blackbirds. primary the scimitars, suddenly you win. admittedly, it takes some thought and fleet comp awareness to defeat massed logistics, but to call them overpowered is a copout to the fcs failings."
8/30/2011,"bringing similar to what they have is not what i'm talking about, with an increase in the volume of people entering game, there is an increase in the volume of people in fleets. if all large gangs can fly around invulnerable to smaller groups of well skilled pvpers then that is essentially removing small pvp from the game. its bad at the moment but i believe it will continue to get worse.it may not be goons play style, but goons play style is not the same as everyone elses, and there needs to be more than one plays style."

8/30/2011,"first you shouldn't be in that alliance... call about false advertising...second, it's a rough sketch... they are only ideas and to be honest the best mechanics are those thought up of by many people... you should try to help fix the problem rather than be a little prat and just talk smack, you act like a little thug that is getting mad someone wants the game to be more about strategy and less about ""just make everything burn"" which you seem to like. we could always put something in place to make it easier for smaller alliances, but to be honest it will be a bane for larger alliances, did i mention covops/ stealth bombers/ and black ops will be able to bypass locked gates...? right now black ops has no use because there is no need for it to be honest. with this game mechanic at least to some degree there will be a need for the black ops. and to be honest aren't large alliances supposed to be more powerful than a little one system alliance...haha"
8/30/2011,how about gate guns in systems with high industrial indices?
8/30/2011,"that's a cool idea, it would be cool having an index for ""industrialization/different name"" that can add weapon emplacements and maybe even npc's to help you secure your territory, should be expensive as well, it would be interesting to have npc's jump in when someone gets attacked and the higher the level the more ships get sent and the faster their reaction time. this would help smaller alliances as well because you can have one system totally maxed out in this new index and it would be cool if they will send in a cap or two or even more if a large fleet jumps in to help defend your system. this will help all alliances, mostly industry based alliances because they will have some backup without having to deal with a pvp corp or corps to help guard against enemies. these npc's shouldn't be crazy powerful, they should help provide some cover on lower levels but on the top levels it should be crazy expensive but they will be more powerful, almost as powerful as sleepers and in more numbers to provide a solid defense, they should obviously be balanced though so an industry corp can't just stay in one system and be able to hold out against a massive alliance, haha. this does make more sense without having to lock gates yet provide some decent defense against small raids or even full on attacks if its maxed out."
8/30/2011,you made my idea terrible.
8/30/2011,"not supported.set up a defense fleet and/or beef up the bubble camps at ""chokepoint"" systems. this just makes it more difficult for the ""small guy"" to do any appreciable damage to a much larger foe.edit: and hell no to the npc ""helpers"" idea. if you want help, get other players to do it."
8/30/2011,"simple idea for a new pve mechanic/function:same battlefield, different obejctives. people with similar missions are matched up to fight on the same battlefield. so you will be within view and warp range of other pve'ers. from there this idea can go many different directions, i think one way to go would be if somebody tries to interfear with your objectives or steal the bounty you get from your npc's then you will have killrights.this is an important pve change (especially to those darn lvl4 missions) to make it more engaging and dynamic.raising the the stakes. every good story in a movie follows this principle, that things has to escalate, stakes has to be higher and higher. thats what engages people. if eve has boring story telling (lvl4 missions) then thats a problem. so the idea behind this new pve mechanic is also:- escalation: for example you can make it that whenever a person completes his objective (i.e. rescue damsel, or destroy station) then somebody else in a station somewhere will get a mission related to the destruction of that station. so as soon as that station is destroyed, there is going to be a series of new npc spawning, and they will escalate to a higher and higher number, in the end that number is going to be so high that you wont be able to solo it anymore, and thats where the other person comes in (if he decides to show up just as soon as he accepts the mission from the station) this is just as an example of the things you can do with the idea of 'same battlefield, different obejctives'so before we start the good old forum trolling and flaming/whining about the idea. let us take a moment of silence and take a deep breath, and let the concept of 'same battlefield, different objectives(tm)' sink into our hearts and souls"

8/30/2011,"the recent patch notes contain this new feature:this may be 'interesting activity' for a social network site, but most players want to keep track of events related to their internet spaceships. instead of (or in addition to) forum and message activity notifications, i propose this new web app tech is used to display notifications of relevant in-game going ons.some examples:when one of your pos' comes under attack.when a new fleet is available in fleet finder.when your skill queue has run out or is close to running out.when you've learned a skill.when you've finished some manufacturing/invention/etc. task.when a system in fw becomes contested, decontested, or won/lost.when a new incursion hits.when one of your contracts is finished or accepted.when one of your sell or buy orders have been fulfilled.when some important sov-related event happens concerning your alliance.when you have a corp recruitment role and someone sends in an application.naturally, one should be able to toggle any notification category on or off.if ccp does want people to be regularly logged into eve gate when they're not in the client itself, notifications like these would go a long way to keeping players interested in spacebook."
8/30/2011,three days... three months?
8/30/2011,"since i am the one responsible for getting the minutes out i'm the guy that is responsible for the delays. here is the process so far:-i transcribed the initial text and sent to the csm for commenting-having gotten it back relatively quickly i sent it to the ccp people that need to read and comment-sent the re-reviewed back to the csm-the csm objected to many of the reviews done-edits have been going back and forth for a while nowit has always been the aim to release any minutes from ccp/csm meetings with the approval of everyone that participated. sometimes it is easy, sometimes it is not. when the matters of tone and semantics come up the best way is to simply go through it step by step and resolve the differences. and this takes time. i realize that many are waiting for these minutes, but we want to get this right - it is just the question of finding the right 'right' that all parties can agree to. specially when the subject is volatile and sensitive. the main point is that we will release these minutes, but we will only release them when all parties have accepted what is being written in the minutes."
8/30/2011,"if the two involved parties, ccp and the csm have been unable to agree on the minutes in two months how can they ever do so in the future ? once the minutes are out it must be because of one party having agreed to the demands of the other and the way power works it will be the csm who will have made a compromise."
8/30/2011,so in other words ... never. let's be honest - 3 months is more than enough time to get this done if it was a priority (which it's obviously not). you should be fired in my opinion.
8/30/2011,"hopeless, absolutely hopeless. if you cannot or will not abide by the directions laid down in the document setting up the csm that ccp itself commisioned, why would anyone believe what you eventually concoct. as the former secretary responsible for preparing and publishing the minutes of a large and very busy voluntary association if i had dared to delay the issuing of the minutes of an emergency meeting for this length of time i have no doubt that i would have been promptly sacked and admonished for failing in my duty.the meeting was supposed to be an ""emergency"" doesn't seem to much of an emergency if you can't or won't do better than this.as the duke of wellington is reported to have said ""publish and be damned"" or are your egos so fragile that you are only happy publishing what amounts to a press release?"
8/30/2011,"you know what this post says to me? youre trying to get the csm to agree to have you publish minutes that make ccp look like saints, all while throwing csm under the bus. while constant back and forth communication is necessary, stop trying to get the csm to agree to publish meeting minutes that make you look like the innocent bystanders here."
8/30/2011,"methinks it's time to change the op title to reflect ""september"""
8/30/2011,"how about this: since the csm and ccp can't agree on tone and choice of wording or whatever, release two copies of the minutes: one that ccp approves of, and a second one that the csm can live with.let the players weigh the two and judge for themselves."
8/30/2011,"both would be watered down.release the full, unadulterated minutes. then let us decide for ourselves. you dont delay minutes of a pivotal meeting for 3 months unless there is stuff in them that makes your company look like the bunch of asshats they are"
8/30/2011,^^ or that
8/30/2011,"i, for one, welcome an organized attempt by the hi-sec crowd to get a csm representative elected....if only because then they'll stop whining about how the csm isn't listening to them. that, or it'll fail miserably. either way it's democracy in action!"
8/31/2011,definitely needed.
8/31/2011,"good idea. to cut down on overview clutter, only show vectors for selected target/ object instead of everything on a grid, or have it as an option in settings to show vectors for all locked targets + a selected object regardless of weather or not it is locked. possibly a max limit of 15 simultaneous vectors to prevent some shenanigans with automatic targeting systems."

8/31/2011,"i vote no, not being able to cloak and afk ties me down to the game and makes me its b*tch. i shouldnt be forced to go find a station everytime i want/need to go afk. and personally, your not even offering anything, your just whining."
8/31/2011,remove localnerf covert ops cloak
8/31/2011,"this actually a valid point. if there is no local, there has to be a ways to detect presence of cloaked ships in a wide area - not their specific location, just enough to know something is there. basically same as local but without the names.it wouldn't be good to have completely invisible and undetectable players roaming around."
8/31/2011,"everyone keeps mentioning risk - but this risk never seems to fall on the cloaker, always on the ratter. give us a sovereignty structure that allows us to project a single, system-wide instantaneous pulse once per day that will decloak any and all ships in the system. give it significant fuel costs so that the sov holders have to decide whether it's worth using - maybe the cloaker is in a panther, maybe he's in a heron. make it require strategic sov level 4 or 5. now the sov-holder and the cloaker both share equal risks.if you are at your keyboard and playing the game when this pulse happens, you can just recloak and the sov holder just wasted a cooldown and some fuel. you now have 24 hours to afk cloak till your heart's content. you can even use cloaked alts to trick the sov-holder into using their cooldown on a cloaked t1/rookie frig, wasting a significant amount of fuel and leaving their ratting system open to cloaky predation for another 24 hours.i don't think this is unreasonable. this only affects a small functionality of the cloak. it's still a bathroom break when you're ratting in low-sec. it's still the end-all of reconnaissance, scouting and hot-dropping. what it wouldn't be is complete immunity to probing when you decide to take a nap while leaving your ship in hostile territory."

8/31/2011,i support tooi also have a consideration what if the resistant that you have on your ship shields and armor also resists repairs the same way it resists damage it makes total sense
8/31/2011,"no. any time a ship is destroyed, it is an isk faucet. it is a material sink, but new isk is created from the void with every insurance payment. the isk you paid for that ship was not destroyed, merely moved to another player. faucet, not sink.these changes would require a complete rebalancing of the logistics class of vessels, and that's really what you're after. i can't remember the last time i saw an rrbs blob... which is exactly what would be allowed under your changes. so, you cut the balls off the logistics class, which can already be defeated by ecm, damps/webs, or capacitor warfare. yep, totally impossible to kill. if you're in a small gang that wants to fight the blob, bring your own logistics. i've been in this situation once or twice, where a small gang takes on a larger and powers through because of proper support in the form of ecm, neuting, and logistics.as for your capital changes... *sigh*. triage only became viable because of the reduction in timer. whenever i pop triage, i am nervous, because i can't receive any remote aid. that is huge. kill the capacitor, kill the capital. with the capacitor recharge mechanics, once you're neuted out you're helpless until you coast out of triage. this is enough a penalty. now, only allowing capital modules to aid capital vessels/structures.. good god, do you want me to fit large remreps to my capital ship? it is a capital ship; by design it is big and obnoxious and does things that regular ships just can't do. it is difficult, but they will still die. htfu.nope. situation: four carriers are spider tanking. the primed ship receives 3 remreps. now, a fifth carrier jumps in and joins. the primed carrier now receives 9 (3^2) remreps? no, it gets 4 (3+1).i get the distinct feeling that you're trying to recapture the ""good old days"" of rrbs gangs. things have changed, adapt or die. i was honestly expecting more from a darknesss thread."
8/31/2011,"ah, okay, i see where you're going with this now. james arget has it right.. this is the ""go back to the bob days where our 10 would beat your 150 cause we're 'ee-leet pee vee pee'""not that that reflects badly on you, everyone has their preferred style of playing, and their opinions on what the game should be. but just as the ""goonstyle"" of playing is not the same as everyone, neither is yours. so please, refrain from pushing your playstyle as ""needed change"" to game mechanics."
8/31/2011,"i think your suggestion of only allowning medium reps to work on medium ships, and likewise for other sizes is a poor idea. it severely limits fleet types.... as bc's and ahacs can no longer receive large rep support. it makes logies much less effective in sub-bs fleets, and i think this pretty much removes logi pilots from small gang combat. a couple of thoughts: 1.) adding a drawback to rr like neuting the repee is a very interesting idea... potential drawbacks: neuting, webbing, painting, ?damage resistance reductions?... these should be explored! 2.) if your goal is to benefit small scale pvp'ers, then stacking penalties to rr seem like a much better option. that way, once you bring that 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12th scimi to the field, your not improving the overall repping power of the fleet. -- thoughts on rr stacking penalty: to prevent abuse, this would have to be size dependent (that way you can't neutralize enemy logies by using a bunch of small rr modules on your target). it seems implementable, as all rr mods have about the same duration (4.5-5s), and skills and bonus' effect cap usage rather than duration! this will also negate a huge advantage of sc's, as increasing the number of sc's will not increase their ability to sustain damage. finally, an rr penalty will essentially create an optimal number of logistics. should this number be catered to small gang (5-10), medium gang (10-30), large gang (30-50) or fleets (50-100, 100-200, 200+)? this is not a trivial decission! as per the null-sec design goals blog, ccp would like an envirnoment where fc's sub-delegate reponsibilities/goals/targets to wing/squad commanders. as long as game mechanics require full fleet dps to alpha or grind down a target, this will not happen. as such, expect something dramatic to change, probably both to rr and in the application of fleet dps."
8/31/2011,no
8/31/2011,i think its good idea for example - blood raider or sansha vessels its clear that someone would need either to run missions for them to get them or buy it from someone.now same is with drugs and boosters. you have illegal cargo you get attacked by npcs (doesnt matter if you bought it or recieved for free).
8/31/2011,"or shoot them (the npcs that is) and take the bpc as a drop, which isn't a criminal action at all..."
8/31/2011,"it would be more realistic, but what if players want to fly a pirate faction ship for example? they could get it with isk, not only loyalty points. moreover, if they can get such a ship with lp, they surely are outlawed in terms of standings.that would cut most inlaw-players' access to these ships... while ships and other technology in new eden are free to get, excepting jove and rogue/sleeper drones designs (this comes from lore)."
8/31/2011,"good day!i've seen the game is looking more realistic with each new expansion. now turrets are very realistic and it seems background nebulae are going to be even more impressive.i had an idea about making ship wrecks more realistic too. maybe it has already been discussed, but here it is anyway:in some missions we can see environment wrecks, which closely ressemble the ships they once were: they're formed by various ship parts, surrounded by dust and minor parts. so, what about replacing the generic wrecks (which look the same) by these kind of wrecks? as an example, if i destroy or loose a nightmare battleship, i will see an actual nightmare battleship wreck, severed in multiple pieces as those environment ones are. this could be applied to any destroyed artificial entity.i don't know about the technical difficulties this might have, but it would certainly increase the realism of the game as well as the recent changes have done. what is your opinion? have a good day!"

8/31/2011,you mean like this?
8/31/2011,"yes, like this. but this must be information warfare link, not skirmish. ok, tell me then how information warfare links can help a fleet? and why of all four races gallente have most useless warfare links, turrets, and active armor tank? why are they so inferior?"
8/31/2011,"they are secretly controlled by the crab people.seriously though, they are not useless, they are merely useful in a small number of situations. somebody needed to fill that niche, it ended up galente. cross training is like 20 days anyway, just do it."
8/31/2011,fixed that for you.
8/31/2011,"just wanted t put an idea out there to see what the reaction was bt had a thought bout some minor defensive idea for sov'd systems.basically it boils down to: if you have sov 5 you gain the option to turn gate cloak and invulnerability off!yes you heard it right.and no i dont mean gate cloak/invulnerability off for people with bad standing or other random stuff, but gate cloak and invulnerability gets turned off at the source (the gates) for everything and everyone.obviously if sov 5 drops then the gates return to normal operations. but the default state is gate cloak/invulnerability on unless otherwise changed.troll away :p (ohh and i hate the new haribo advert! grr!)"
8/31/2011,"sorry, but this is a terrible idea.the reason that gate cloak/invulnerability is there is to act as a buffer against the real world limitations of eve. you don't load a system instantly. you can't respond to attacks just after jumping. making this change would make people less willing to make jumps, which is on the whole a bad thing for eve."
8/31/2011,this.
8/31/2011,well the thread title says it all.ridiculous...it really wouldn't work out as stated above. i would rather see sov 5 grant the ability to place gate guns instead.

8/31/2011,"channel count should also reflect the numbers. instead of corp (10), we'd need corp (8+2).this would also do wonders for the supposed eve voice oog integration."
8/31/2011,my idea is simple. an implant that can be loaded with drugs to be used when needed. instead of carrying around drugs in your cargo hold allow drugs to be loaded into the implant and used like a cap booster on a ship. this would allow a character to move from one ship to another and still have his boosters with him without having to have a bunch in each ship. allow one type of booster per implant with perhaps a max of 10 boosters at a time to be loaded based on implant level. these implants would take the place of hardwire implants. legality of the implants could be treated just like they are now. drugs are bad...if you are caught the drugs are confiscated but the implant stays.
8/31/2011,seriously...40 reads and not a single comment? somebody other than me must think this is a cool idea.
8/31/2011,nope.avi
8/31/2011,"sounds like a pretty good fix.maybe for t2 ammo, you would be able to select damage type?on a ""real-life physics"" sidenote, this fix actually makes more sense to me.a heavier (more dense) projectile would take slightly longer to accelerate to full firing velocity.therefore, it would take just a fraction of a second longer to reach its target, which would cause it to miss more-often (less tracking).because this projectile is heavier, it would have higher energy and hit with more force (more damage).vice-versa all of that for a lighter projectile."
8/31/2011,maybe gates could have also personal password too

8/31/2011,"^^ kinda what i was thinking when u started going along the npc police thing.i do think defenders should have some additional options bt not stuff that harsh.personally i think if u have strategic index of 5 u should be allowed to have the option of turning on or off gate invuln and cloak, to be applied to all ships, not just ones with bad standings towards the holding alliance."
8/31/2011,"guess what, this mechanic already exists in game. if you want to dictate who goes in and out of your gates, you setup a gate camp!! if you can't be asked to setup a police patrol, then you don't deserve the safety they provide."
8/31/2011,it sounds fairly similar to cosmo missions since they all require objectives from the same area. if you limit it to only allowing people who have that pocket as a mission site in then sure. but right now it is too easy to scan down a mission runner and pop their pve ship - a la a not so stealth nerf to mission griefing. at least if it is just the mission runner and there fleet mates it will be a bit more fair.edit to add thumbs up - i like the concept
8/31/2011,"took a deep breath, some sleep, and more ...well, i'm not convinced.first, group pve is already covered (somehow) and it's called incursion.second, at a point you will need x people to be able to finish a mission but, well, you don't have that many people, so basically you'll force the solo-missions runners to move to ""bad places"" since the good places don't provide ""easy"" missions any longer.third, changing existing content is always difficult ... believe it or not, some people like the way it is now. that does not mean that you can not change it, but some won't want that change."
8/31/2011,"yeah you're right incursions is a good answer to all the things that was missing in lvl4 missions. only there is a very obvious super duper mega big problem with that. which is that most people, especially the new ones, run missions and not incursions. so incursions are not really the answer to the many many problems with mission running, because mission running is and will remain the 'go-to' thing to do for beginners and the majority of eve players. in other words incursions are of no value and completely powerless when it comes to helping fixing the life of a mission runner."
8/31/2011,"maybe because the incursions happen to be in the wrong place (low sec) or because the people are not into group pve ...if it's the last one, implementing your idea would lead to a lot of"

8/31/2011,"hi!i'm not sure if it wasn't already discussed. i made a bug report once it was deployed.situation:- you got personal contract (from your other char for exapmle)- you see message ""you got contract"". funny but you can't do anything with this tooltip.- you go to ""contracts"" window and see link to contract.- you press this link and window switches to ""search"" page.- here you need to re-setup filtering options to see contract made personally for you.i really don't understand this. why contract link leads you to search window instead of just opening selected contract window??? it wasn't usable half-a-year ago. it isn't usable now. my idea: link in first page of ""contracts"" window must lead to open selected contract. and no ""search"" pages instead!"
8/31/2011,"somewhere (search is your friend...) it's stated that even capsuleer ships have some crew. much less than a conventional ship, but still...so i think the concept of crew morale affecting the performance of your ship (firing frequency, reload time, module performance, ship agility, ...) is quite intriguing as it adds another variable to the equation next to your own skills.definitely yes. even to the option to throw some isk (or maybe trade goods like spirits or tobacco or even dancers :) ) at the crew to boost morale if things went haywire."
8/31/2011,csm maybe equally surprised that you can make daytrips and mine in hed-gp.
8/31/2011,how long have you lived in wormhole space sir ?let me explain since obviously you're a bit delusional. low end wh == nullsec close to emire. mining in c3 static highsec == mining in hed-gp or pf-346. mining in c6 == mining in deep 0.0.
8/31/2011,leave abc ores in wormholesremove local in 0.0 so everyone is on even footing for mining
8/31/2011,please use a voice recorder next time and copy the mp3 file to soundcloud ..all should be done in like 10minand i still stand by my decision that csm is a big joke
8/31/2011,"been playing a year and a half, not the time or motivation to leave high sec and really wouldn't want to be forced to vote for what's best for the game as a whole or even who would be best to represent that."
