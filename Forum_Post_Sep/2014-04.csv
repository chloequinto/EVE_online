4/1/2014,"i agree with nikk's views on the matter of pve vrs cloaky, one more thought, cloaked vessels have an little discussed atvantage, intel. while most are concerned about hot drops, and the occasional cloaked vrs pve vessel, one of my concerns is a cloaked vessel relaying what ships im flying and who all comes and goes in a certain system. there are many things that can be reported in a cloaked vessel to help with strategic objectives. right now time and patience are and should always be friends of the the covert pilot, however there should be counters. currently there is not other than gate camping. that realistically can be defeated quite easily."
4/1/2014,"intel is a prickly issue, with so many sides and conflicting perspectives.some believe intel should be free of effort, it should be automatically be reported to you for your consideration.the problem here is that you are giving everyone perfect intel all the time, and the ability to relay this is not challenging for most.(no risk example of a person safely docked in an outpost, able to relay system entries into a channel for intel)the downside, since no competition is possible to learn of presence, the ability to avoid contact need only concern itself with reacting to this provided data.with perfect warnings comes perfect defense potential, and with everyone defended this well we have stalemates.others believe that intel has value in game, the more so if it requires effort to obtain.an effort based system, reasonably, would include at least a toggle that would persist for a time period, or until warp was engaged. the need to ping each and every time would quickly be replaced by popular demand, in my opinion.if you need to toggle on your sensors after coming out of warp, you compete by needing to remember this and repetitively perform this action reliably.those who forget, risk being caught unprepared.it might seem trivial to some, but keep in mind that human nature is very adaptive. players who have not seen recent hostile contact may eventually feel they can skip it if they are only going to be on grid briefly, and this expectation that protection is not needed can eventually be a defensive flaw.i believe that players seeking to place limits and restrictions upon cloaks, but not upon the intel cloaks are the counter for, seem to be guilty of not considering the shift in balance they would inflict.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

4/3/2014,"how do we know if they are afk or not?yes, if they are truly afk, they are no threat, but they aren't going to send us an e-mail telling us they are afk."
4/3/2014,"yeah this is where the ""if they're afk they can't hurt you"" thing falls on its ass. it is exactly this mechanic which hurts you. when i'm afk'ing my bombers i'll usually be doing something on an alt, switching over every now and then to run a scan, for targets.to answer the previous question in your quote regarding which mechanic they're using, its the mechanic which doesn't indicate whether someone is afk or not and the ability to scan without any knowledge of the target after coming back from afk.if there was a mechanic which dimmed the icon in local after a certain period of inactivity or when docked that would be nice imo."
4/3/2014,"are you trying to win at eve, so you can say this part of the game is over by virtue of being resolved in perpetuity?because the more leverage you give to one side of this issue, the more you effectively resolve it moving forward.we already have players with perfect notification of system presence, which has been demonstrated as being enough intel to base certain decisions on.you know they are in your system, and you know if they are flagged as friendly or not.if you add to this, the reliable notification that a player is afk, you further trivialize gameplay in these areas.all that remains is multiboxing enough accounts together so you can plex them for the next month.we already have play, regarding competition against hostiles, dumbed down to seeing a hostile name in local chat, and hitting a button to warp.my smartphone has more challenging games than that. i feel that reacting in a predetermined manner to anything in a specific category is not worth paying a sub for.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/3/2014,"there has to be a balance between the disruption you can cause and the ease of causing it. consideration must also be given to the ability to cause constant disruption even when not actively playing the game. currently because you cannot tell if someone is afk or not all you have to do is put an alt in the system, even better if it has a history of hotdrops, and you logically bring that system to a standstill while your not at the computer. while this is fine, that's entirely what my corporation does, we afk cloak people, it is too powerful in its current form and needs a bit of a nerf, if not by nerfing cyno's then it'd have to be by nerfing cloaking.i'd prefer the former."
4/3/2014,"the threat from a cloaked ship is exactly equal to the number of players supporting that ship at the time.suggesting that a target has a right to know information about a potential ambush, defeats the purpose of the ambush entirely.especially when you consider that the source of this intel would be automatic and flawlessly reliable.local chat is more than intel, in this sense, it acts as an alarm / security alert system.in my opinion, to suggest that a single or small group of players should be warned automatically, in order to prevent a larger number of players from interacting with them, this sounds counter productive for an mmo.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/3/2014,"what you are not considering is the aggressors intel.i can put a cloakie in a system and leave it there indefinitely. during that time i can use the full availability of local to get my intel.i can identify a ship i want to drop. i can warp to it. use look at, determine what weapons, drones it's using. i can relay that information back to my blop's team as well as any pilot information in local. we can look those pilots up, determine what threat they are if any. jump the gang in, kill the pilot and leave all the while denying anyone in local any details of the gang and cloakie ship.you're trying to justify the aweful mechanics of cloaky cynos by using freedom of information but the cloakie cyno is the ultimate in hiding its own info.thats called an imbalance."
4/3/2014,"the problem is local, by your own description.the aggressor uses local to know pilot composition of the system. something the local resident already knows, but as an unknown potentially acts as a deterrent against the aggressor.we know this, since you indicated they would use it to gauge the risk of threat that local pilots represented.with the absence of local's free warnings, many agree it becomes balanced for intel to include the ability to scan for and hunt cloaked ships. this is balanced by the need to make an effort or be effectively blind.with such power to locate cloaked vessels, bears the responsibility to proactively clear systems as needed.a gate camp, while unable to prevent cloaked access in many cases, remains able to often detect them well enough to warn others. such cooperative intel gathering relayed to a hunting group would enable them to chase down and clear out threats.for times when it is suspected a cloaked ship managed entry undetected, periodic sweeps could be used to verify relative safety for mining and ratting, etc.noone can take the time to calmly scout the system, without being burdened by awareness they could be hunted at any time.again, this is null, so whoever has the most players wins in the end.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/3/2014,except you're using the free warnings yourself. it's hypocritical and in no way balanced imo. it's simply a way to get easy kills with no risk. identical to using local to avoid the same risk.
4/3/2014,"removing local from the hunter's use makes perfect sense to me.you should read the links in my sig, if you want a more detailed explanation.whether i play my mining rig or my stealth one, local is more of an obstacle to my fun than an aid to it.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/3/2014,"sod that. he pulls a knife, you pull a gun. he puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue."
4/3/2014,"with the new changes to fb's there is a need for more variety in drone fittings. as it stands the only option for more drone damage is t1, t2 or officer mods which i have never seen for sale. so what i am suggesting is to simply add faction drone damage amplifiers. maybe with 24-25% damage bonuses or more if the non-existent officer ones were buffed.please feel free to criticize or expand this idea."
4/3/2014,this is straightforward.
4/3/2014,"hence asking the csm to look it over, as a bunch of experienced people who have an idea what the devs are thinking because they constantly talk to them, and may have discussed something along these lines and not be able to talk directly about it due to nda.it may have been discounted by the devs, who knows, i don't, but i know the csm will filter."
4/3/2014,"how to make pve more like pvp:1) if the pve pilot shows up in an inadquate ship, they get ganked and mocked in local. this pretty much already happens.2) if the pve pilot shows up in something competitive, they get blobbed by a 2:1 dps:logistics fleet, ganked and mocked in local.3) if the pve pilot shows up in something insurmountable, the rats dock up in a convenient station or warp off, and talk smack in local. optionally, they play undock games."

4/4/2014,i haven't read a single post in this thread but i bet i could guess every point and argument used.
4/4/2014,"threads like this are often more about bringing others up to speed on the philosophy involved.i notice many players get lost in the weeds, and suggest fixes for problems that actually reduce gameplay, and result more often in game-watching.game watching is where you need make little effort, and just end up watching the game effectively play itself.i particularly like the parts where someone claims that afk cloaking represents an attempt to deny game content, by scaring away play.newsflash: play is not the part where you kill npc rats, or mine ore. it is the part where you interact with other players in the game. we can define it this way by pointing at the mmo tag, as well as other details.you can interact by working together with them, or by fighting against them. both should result in two or more people in real life having a good time, which is the whole point of eve's existence.everything else is just preparing for the times when we can do this.i guess it is easy to forget why we came to eve, in order to play with each other in a spaceship game.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/4/2014,"just because it isn't broken for you it doesn't mean it isn't broken for someone else. bugs should be fixed asap, ccp is doing it right."
4/4/2014,you should get upset when ccp stops doing patches and updates!
4/4/2014,"quite some time ago i posted a proposition for a sport in eveonly way to make a real sport for eve is to make it apeal to the braoder number of players:- t1 frigates- 5 v 5 player matches (5 more for each team as substitues)- whole year long league (works like any soccer league)- final four tournament for a rl money prize- divisions (1,2 or more)- iskflow btw the league organizators, teams, players and spectators- arenas with different setups (asteroids, objects) settled all around highsec and lowsecthat is pretty much it. you can read about details in the link.scl and neo are fine but they are nothing different from the main event which is the at. all of those are just daunting fro most of the players, corps and even alliances. every year you see same people.frigates are fun and accessible by skill and isk and there are all kind of them, brawling, attack, kiting, e war, logi etc."

4/5/2014,"the only thing that i wish to convey about tournaments, is that ccp needs a second twitch account for them, so that the automatic sms/email notification when it goes live doesn't wake up people that are not interested in tournaments, yet still allows them to be woken up with something actually worth watching starts."
4/5/2014,"lurking on forumscan't sleep, clown will eat me kinda night (bonus points if you get the reference.)instead of having groups of people gather randomly. why not have a ""space stadium."" in each trade hub, a new station is added. this is where players ""meet up"" form fleets and arrange fights. there's 2 undock buttons, one for regular space, one for tournament space. which would be a separate new system. setup system and station so cheating and anything game breaking isn't doable.make tools available to the players to make and sponsor their own leagues. ccp would have their own aswell. make more types and variations of tournaments. frigates/cruisers/destroyerswhatever only/or below. and, why not have more then pvp tournaments? what about pve tournaments? what fleet can mine the fastest in x time? or who can complete a lvl ""x"" mission in ""y"" ship class the fastest/take the least damage?i'm going to try to go back to sleep now"
4/5/2014,"this idea has been floating around for a while now. my suggestion is simple. pop station, it leaves a wreck. instead of cans spewing where the owner can pick it up, or big loot containers up for grabs. or whatever mechanism that would **** off whoever was living out of said station. all station services are permanently disabled! you can't trade, put things on the market, whatever! basically it turns into a floating wreck, whoever had stuff inside is allowed to dock. regardless of who own the system and if your ""blue"" to them. then you're allowed to toss up a new station in said system. minus ship spinning, you can do **** inside of it."

4/6/2014,then please lets here your comments and suggestions on a balance that would increase interaction.
4/6/2014,"maybe you can add a bump counter and when that counter hits a certain number, that bumper gets a suspect flag or becomes attackable without concord interference. that way people can still bump but have to watch how many times they do it and it gives miners to ability to do something about it when the bumper crosses a certain line..."
4/6/2014,"the biggest problem to player run 'small' tournaments is the inability to ensure your participants safety and enforce some basic rules - alongside the issue of spectators.take any tournament that you want pvp in and you have a problem.- high sec precludes consensual pvp (barring wars and duels (which can work for a 1v1 tournament))- low sec carries a big sec status penalty for the pvp and there is no way to ensure people won't pop in and blow you all up- null sec/wh have no sec status penalty but then you're in someone's space and again, no way to ensure safety.the best solution is to allow group consensual pvp in high sec and i think the best way to do this is to implement a new type of fleet. this new fleet would allow consensual pvp by all members of that fleet, it would have no combat bonuses, it would not allow bridging etc, it may allow warp to member. essentially, it would provide a way for a group of players to meet in high sec and shoot one another. but more importantly, it does not remove all risks, you can still be attacked if people fancy dying to concord after.this is important. the current method of using 'safe' systems does not fit within the ethos of eve (the at can be excused) and the idea of 'safe' arena's is a watered down version of that. tournaments should occur in open space, but with the participants allowed to shoot one another and spectators not - but not prevented from doing so. spectating - do you want everyone to come and watch? how do you livestream when you have one camera view and need to watch what is going on (can't be everywhere at once).solution: camera drones!you can set these up in space, they record and can send their feed to a) streaming sites, b) ccp's new tournament viewer and c) which is now viewable in captains quarters. viewers can move between camera's at will. the feed will label ships and so on. possibility of having commentary and camera control as well, so you can have an 'official' feed. similar deployables as others have mentioned (boundary marker/bubble, container with divisions (so people can only access one bit), beacons etc. all of these should be able to be audited. what we need are some simple tools to allow us to be inventive with the current mechanics. people have posted a lot of ideas in this thread and i think most of them can work in high sec with the new fleet mechanic - you just have to be inventive how you police any other rules. this keeps tournaments within the sandbox and player driven and eve will be better for it. edit: another option is to make an 'event' corp which has some different powers (or ability to create an event within a corp), so you can have a formal signup and this takes money, delivers prizes, allows combat etc."
4/6/2014,"um no. thatll be a just another big things for the power blocs to come through and wreck. most of whats in the station would be destroyed and per looting rules, and the game would probably die from having to figure out how to kill everyone that was docked and send them to new clones. while killing a station may sound like a good idea, itll be like the pocos. besides to place a new station you have to have sov, so not everybody can do it, and to attack the station to begin with you have to make sov drop."
4/6/2014,there is a massive barrier preventing smaller groups from entering 0.0. without changing mechanics or rules of sov i propose a simple structure capable of allowing groups to live on their own in space. click here for fob details____my history: i've done about everything except run 200+ man fleets in eve and fly a super cap. i've pvped for the greater portion of my eve career.

4/7/2014,we need moar ships! because moar!i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
4/7/2014,"there are two approaches i see being suggested.one, where the cloaked ships alone are impacted, with the ultimate result that they must abandon being present, ending the stalemate in the favor of those who felt threatened.i should point out, that sending home one side in a conflict does not increase interaction.to be clear, if the expectation that a cloaked pilot could be afk is removed, then the chances that a pve pilot will undock in a ship which could not fight back are also removed when a presence is noted.(alliances will more easily enforce rules designed to avoid all contact, as many already have in place)two, mostly from my own words, is the suggestion to incentivize pve ships to remain.many of my recent suggestions center around giving them a chance to win, and with preparation and confidence the expectation of winning.i feel this approach has two values:pve pilots can maintain presence and operate with hostiles present, since the hostile is no longer representing an overwhelming threat.andthe pve pilot, assuming they are right about making good preparations, has a fun fight with spaceships, and get's a kill mail with bragging rights.(yo, don't be messin with miners, arrrrrr....)that is my opinion.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/7/2014,"yes that would be the ultimate fix. the issue is not that people don't want to fight in many cases, it's that they know if they do it's very likely to end in disaster.case in point - we had 5 southern fed guys come down to our area to kill us. killed one, the other ran. next day 10 came back so we prepare and i jump my alt into their hub, d-scan, avatar and 20 guys at a moon. while not specifically an afk problem the issue goes hand in hand.if you are a smart player you have to assume worst case scenario. i assume all afks are cyno fit until killed and proven otherwise."
4/7/2014,"as a hobbyist programmer, i echo what's been said elsewhere here: smaller patches are faster to release, easier to download and if (when) something goes 'blooey', they're easier to track and repair.aside from that, they also remove a lot of smaller, less-urgent bug fixes from the list before the big patch goes live, whch has the double (triple?) effect of reducing the possibility of some unresolved bug breaking the patch, and a smaller overall size for the big patch (since they're not cramming so many tiny and semi-relevant bug-fixes in on top of the huge upate)."
4/7/2014,"hello and on very beginning sorry for my bad english. i know that this subject was talked before in some old threads, but i didn't see any good reasons not to change this whole employment history system.now eh is visible to everyone. this is simply not realistic and...stupid.when i see someone walking on the street, i don't know who he is and what is his history right? the same should be in game.now, people are making some decisions regarding to opponent eh which is not good both to new players (oh look! he is a newbie so it is easy target!) or experienced players (hey! this guy probably have some good skills so i will not attack - important for some griefs or just for combat the more your opponent knows about you and your skills before fight, the worse your fight will be).there were some people saying that they need to know who the guy is before he join their corp and this is absolutely true and right.solution is easy, logic and simple. let's make an option to choose, like with kill rights. you can choose to share kr with certain character, with corp, with everybody.the same should be with eh, so when people need chack your background, they can do it when both sides agree.just an idea, but imo it should be like this from the start.please share your thoughts about it.thank you."
4/7/2014,"no, it's like a resume. people can contact your former boss if they wish or see how often you jump corps. hiding it would make an easier job for awox crews which already prey on people that jump multiple corps in a day, other awox teams just look for that 1 <U+FFFD>ber kill usually in an alliance in low or null, the highsec guys don't want to whisk being teamed up against to lose so the have alt logi and keep the ability to run away and dock after they jump a mining team so they can say they don't lose ships in pvp.so no, already not enough trust in eve."
4/7/2014,"anyone with any degree of common sense while handling recruiting does a background check on a character, including api access. turning off access to people's employment history is a small bump in the road as any good recruiter is going to require access to it regardless. why waste the dev resources on something that most people are going to turn around and say ""hey, that's nice...show me or you're not getting in, i don't care if you 'agree' or not."""
4/7/2014,"that is true. but you don't walk with your resume stick on your forehead right? it's yours, it's private and you show it to the people when you want or need to. i don't want to hide in completely. for recruitment process things will probably stay the same - you want to join our corp = we have to see your 'resume'. simple. explanation as abovei think that most of the people just used to the way eh is because it was always like that. but really, please try to imagine that eh from the beginning of eve was like your cv and you show it, when you need it to. suddenly thay make a change and say: ""hey! now your eh will be visible to everyone!"". i bet that lots of people wouldn't agree to that.i don't really see any good sides of the way eh is right now. argument with recruiting process is not good, because for that things will not change at all.regards."
4/7/2014,"clicked on the link in the launcher: ""represent your playstyle, vote now - csm9"" but there's no option on the linked page to actually vote.is not everyone allowed to vote?is the vote already over?hasn't it started yet?this process is not really transparent to me, please clarify. howto: no more tears (solo)"
4/7/2014,"1. i suggest that we should be able to return items bought in the nex exchange back to the store, probably with a penalty like a restocking fee. i buy a stylin' coat for 4500 aur, i should be able to return it and get a partial refund.2. aur cannot be transferred from account to account. we already have an aur token system, i suggest making aur reversible back into tokens, allowing aur to be transferred between players.3. make aur redeemable back into plex."
4/7/2014,"in the latest csm minutes (under 'dev blogs, above), the idea of destructible outposts was discussed fairly extensively; the minutes indicate that: (top of page 21)i took this to mean that while it's certainly possible, there are design issues at hand that may make it less-than-practical."
4/7/2014,"hello,i was wondering about mobile deployables not showing up in the inventory when you created a fit. i use the mobile depot a lot but when ever i save the fitting in eft of evehq it doesn't show up in eve online.wondering if it would be a good idea to have those show up."

4/8/2014,"there are many smart players in eve, probably more than dumb ones, however you hardly ever hear of them. this practice results in a lot of unused space. although i hate to admit it pro god legend made this statement i agree with. full commnets can be found in the csm released minutes"
4/8/2014,"the point of some ships i have interacted with, if not flown directly, is that they almost seem designed for a game that we are not playing.i see the blops, with it's cloak and covert jump capability, and assess a ship intended to bypass gate camps, and stay hidden while creating an underground railroad for covert activity.i see the normal cyno, with it's beacon flashing up on the overview to alert everyone in the system, which is significant almost as much as it could be if local chat had not already broadcast the presence of new arrivals in a manner just as obvious.well, you know they might have arrived by cyno, rather than assuming they either logged in together or came in the gate alone.the only aspect of the game not impaired or bent into a different shape by local is the direct frontal assault.cloaking as well as any form of play relying on a degree of uncertainty by other players is a token detail at best.you are not secret. everyone knows you are in the system, at all times, regardless of whether they can locate you directly.i would like to see an effort based intel system replace local.in exchange for not being prompted when to act, the player would have the opportunity to learn more than the current system allowed, such as enough intel to hunt cloaked shipping.being prompted when to act is a huge detail, that more than anything else impacts gameplay in a manner resulting in stalemate scenarios, which any player can relate to with frustration if they experience it.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/8/2014,"""hey, i'm hiding my cv!""""well, i'm not hiring you unless i see your cv.""""well i'm not going to show it to you.""""okay, you're not hired. next.""again, its pointless to hide a character's employment history on some silly belief that people will ""agree"" that it should be shown. everyone with half a brain cell will require it and therefore it's a complete waste of time."
4/8/2014,"again, no.maybe for you eh is only for recruitement process, so you are right - changing it for this is pointless, because (like i wrote before) nothing will change in that matter.the problem is that eh affects lot of other things in eve. and it affect it in bad way.example.we have to options:1. you are new player - opponents know you are weak = bad for you2. you are old playera) with lots of skills - opponents expect you have big skills and they are right = they are prepared better for combat you = bad for youb) with no skills (you've had some break in playing or whatever) - opponents expect you have big skills. they are wrong but they come prepared better for fight - bad for you.i can't see any good sides of how eh works right know and no one gave any good argument so far to keep it this way.regards."
4/8/2014,"there's absolutely no way we'd be able to use that against people, especially on the 4/4 undock. also, most miners won't do anything. that's kinda the point - they want to play a single-player mmo and interacting with a suspect means they're not playing the game the way they want to."
4/8/2014,"ah, you have a point, didn't think about that..."
4/8/2014,"i've been asking about this for a couple of days over in the main forum. i feel that a couple of posts on what the process was going to be, with some links and examples really wouldn't have gone amiss."
4/8/2014,for me there is no such feature on the launcher... i can't find any sort of link and it's the 8th of april...
4/8/2014,i meant this one:
4/8/2014,from the eveonline.com page go to the eve universe drop down menu and select community. under the community drop down menu go to csm. under the csm there will be a line that says 'vote'. there you will find a list of candidates. you can either double click them or drag and drop them into your ballot. make sure you are signed in.
4/8/2014,i have this same problem with my bank in the us - so i use amazon for my subscription :d

4/9/2014,what about a new prob to combat and core that can locate cloakers but takes abit of time to do that way cloaker can see if he is been probed and the others cn find him win win for both?
4/9/2014,"before we consider details on this, what benefit would you give the cloaker in exchange for now being vulnerable to hunting?upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/9/2014,"in my mind it would be to passively target and scan ships while cloaked, the targeting is lost when switching there would also be a long targeting delay , say double the normal uncloaked targeting time. - in this case if a hi sec freighter pilot would not have to worry anymore about cloaked over non cloaked scanning ships. passive target and scan is already a part of the game. i still insist that we have a better action based local intel system over the passive local chat system. i am in favor of the delayed local, however this should come with more tools. enhanced tools should require at least a little bit of specialization.the idea behind it should to be pilots to work together in small groups instead of solo. at the same time is should discourage use by 500+ groups. say the more pilots in system active in space would give many returns making it progressively more difficult to identify and gather intel about specific pilots. (disclaimer on the following example. this is general knowledge and not classified as far as i know)navy vessels from all countries have two methods of detecting ships, planes, and items. active and passive often these are used together. active gives a ping of range and location but is harder to identify more that general size and direction. passive you can gather more intel about what's there by what sounds it makes and check against known database for ship type, abilities and even down to who is captain and what they had to eat before they left port. however beyond direction it is close to impossible for one ships to detect range, speed and direction. working in a group it is possible to work out who the target is, their range, speed ect. however get to many ships in the area creates noise reducing this significantly."
4/9/2014,"the means of detecting a 'noisy' object using passive data is done by triangulation, where the object being sought is within the confines of a triangle formed by the three points of data collection.(cell towers, navy ships, microphones, whatever the context relates to)by comparing signal strength from each point, and knowing the power of the signal source helps here, you can draw a circle around each of the listening points relative to the strength of the signal they detected.the three circles should intersect over the point or area where the source originated the signal from.our probing uses a similar principle, but since it relates to a three dimensional arrangement, requires more points of reference.(in theory, you would only need a 4th point to form a tetrahedron (pyramid shape)).in practice, the more points of reference you have on an object, the more precise you can be isolating it's location.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/9/2014,"exactly. so what if this tech for hunting cloaked ships, is to much for a prob to handle and now you need several ships fitted with a deep scan listening module, all have to be fleeted and one pilot has a second module that relays information from the other ships. correlates the data and give a broadcastable target location +- 100 km from where actual target may or may not be depending on skill. is just a thought but this could be set up similar to or connected with dscan mechanics for the one while the second works in the probe window or similar. information could vary on skill of the pilots incorporated with 5 being the max effective number while more would ""corrupt"" the data if active. the information relayed could vary from not only location but ship type and pilot."
4/9/2014,"sorry i took so long to reply busy day :(what about a notification to say that they are been scanned down maybe everytime the prober scans and hits there sig it tells them, if they miss the sig no notification comes up that way cloaker's ship lets them know of danger that may or may not be coming and it means that if anyone is afk they will be killed killing afk cloakers but keeping people who are activly cloaked and moving time to shift away"
4/9/2014,"the overlying principles suggest this could work, if we refer to real life examples for context on how the systems would behave.in the game, probes for scanning give every bit as much intel, but do so as a snapshot, and return only the items that they retained after filtering out garbage.(ok, it's a game, and the filtering is really done by never having the garbage present to begin with, same result)whether they do an active ping, or simply use enhanced detection over a limited time frame, either could be used here.we have four different racial sensor types, each operating on a slightly different wavelength, if not entirely unique and pigeon holed by this.amarr, using radar. (if this is actual radio waves, then it has to be some version beyond our awareness, as radio waves don't travel fast enough to give meaningful data beyond a certain point)caldari, using gravimetric. (measuring this is something we have little to compare with, as we have no real world sensors outside of laboratories relating to this)gallente, magnetometric. (it's a big metal detector equivalent. just refined to the point of usefulness here)minmatar, ladar. (laser detection and ranging system, oh yeah, it uses lazors. also sounds like the systems in use by a popular science fiction show, so might be more like that unspecified version)long story short, none of these has real world equivalents with function, so the game versions are whatever the devs say, and they say they are equal to each other.by obvious follow through, cloaking technology beats them all, or else cloaking would be less effective against one or more.by virtue of concealment and it's needs, cloaking therefore either masks it's presence under a larger signal, which is ignored, or it reduces it's own signal beneath the detection threshold.possibly some clever combination of the two.in any case, using real world analogies can stimulate the imagination, but they are only relevant if the devs decide they are.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/9/2014,"so, the cloaked pilot is, at best, being given a heads up that their day is about to become difficult.this might reduce the negative impact, to a degree, in their view, but it is not a positive in itself.what improvement would they have?would local stop alerting their targets, enabling them to hunt? maybe a 30 second delay, possibly more.and what about the aspects where they have the right to be present, for scouting purposes.maybe something that makes them totally undetectable if they have no cyno equipped, not even by local chat.(limited to true covert vessels, not the t1 boats with a slap on model)upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/9/2014,"lets face it its hard to make all parties happy what this threahd for is afk cloakers not general cloakers therefore this does kill then afk effect of cloaking since they are warned but if choose to ignore thats there faultsame aspect of jumping through a gate if you don't scout well thats your fault if they scout and find hostiles then thats there smarts no one will be happy but eliminating the effects used by these is one way and yea we could add a delay if others complain ""why carnt we have notification been scanned down in a mission"" use the ""cloak has a inbuilt detecting device that alerts the ships sensors to scan down and traingulate what that object is giving 60% sensor strengh instead of about 15% or less of ships power"
4/9/2014,"let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.game play does not need to be shifted in favor of pve at the expense of cloaked players here.the often stated reason for afk play, assuming they actually want play rather than play mind games, is to render local's warning into something ignored.they are not invisible, but they are being ignored finally, giving them a chance to actually hunt.if the current system for hunting is left intact, for the most part local alerting residents well enough in advance of a threat to avoid it, then they have no positive.if they can be removed, the stalemate is resolved in favor of the residents, which is a very real advantage for them.it tells them a foreign presence must be active, and therefore is unsafe to ignore.it removes the presence in the event the target fails to respond before being probed down, removing the threat.this, with no doubt, would shift the balance in favor of sov holders.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

4/9/2014,"iv been looking at for a little bit and been thinking is it really a ? to me a is stealthy sneaky and chooses its targets and positioning well but to me atm are mainly for 0.0 to jump in alot of ships to gank 1 ship and arnt that useful for low-sec and high sec, they are paper thin compared to other battleship which is nice as they are meant to be light and manuverable to get in kill and get out, the cloaking ability is nice but abit useless as they will just be sat in 1 spot and seen on scan straight away destroying the stealthy aproach for them.im proposing to give them cov ops cloak which i understand would make them overpowered in all aspects thats why i propose to give this ship and only this ship a handicap with cov ops cloak im not sure if its possible as i don't do any codeing and im looking for feedback on this idea (open to i hate u die and get out) the handicap would be to basicly not alow the ship to recloak or use cloak at all for about 4-5 mins after combat let it be shooting or shot at this way even if it kills or manages to escape it carnt cloak and sit there and hide for hours it has to move giving the enemy chance to find it and finnish it, or give revenge to the .example:a warps into a missioner or a pvper or who ever he is targeting decloaks and opens fire now he carnt cloak for 5 mins meaning he has to kill the guy as fast as possible and then get out to start making timer to drop so he can cloak at this time the pvper or missioner could have friends about wanting pay back and start trying to find him now they know they have 5 mins to find him before he cloaks which is enough time to scan down and catch him if they are skilled and consentrate enough of course the pilot could warp around to avoid this but thats same with any other ship.i know my grammer is bad so id like people to look past this and decide on the matter iv proposed i think it might be overpowered but making the ship more vaible for low-sec and high-sec pvp"
4/9/2014,"here is an idea, make it possible to chop up a plex into 4x pilot week extensionsthis way one plex can either be converted to 3500 aurum or one pilot week extension into 875 aurum.as a bonus it would allow recurring (or new) players more options when to play the game,for example when they get a cta on some social media they can buy a one week pilot extension for that operation"

4/10/2014,"yes. and it's actually the case where abnormalilty of bumping ship owner's behaviour should be obvious to law enforcing authorities. in fact, it should be much less span of a time. like, repeating bumping for 5 to 10 minutes. and if its too quick for you, that amateurish bunch of gangsters you are running obviously needs a proper training program prescribed to them. at least put some effort and soul in the ""job"" you enlisted for, okaaaay?but prosecution by deadly force is too much, indeed just webifiying to zero all those who were bumping and will be trying to bump after for some period of time will be enough. all timers can be tied to the actual sec level of the solar system."
4/10/2014,"is the goal a the election isn't so much as mentioned on the community page, the vote link is not even promoted as a main item on the csm page of the eve online site itself (its a minor link halfway down the sidebar) -- nor is the fact of a csm election happening even mentioned on that page . because this is an eve board, and tearing into particular employees is verboten, i am attempting to moderate my tone.however, this -- combined with:- the promise of a fireworks of impressive promotion for the csm8 election which never came- the minutes delay due to extended time required for review by ccp (and it was clearly pointed to a particular employee being the bottleneck)*- the lack of even a nominal, common sense level of promotion for this csm9 election- the announcement of candidates etc, and winter release of the minutes barely in front of voting start...all lead me to question what ccp dolan's other responsibilities are as a community manager are that so dwarf this that it is seemingly no problem to consistently over-promise and under-deliver on a variety of fronts related to this and not get called on it?i'm hoping i am misreading and the issue isn't (a) an extremely lackadaisical approach to one's job, (b) being woefully over their head in their job or (c) ccp signaling that it really couldn't care less about the csm as a body despite paying lip service. if it is (c) please just come out and say so. if none of the above explanations apply, then what is it?it also seems odd that literally, except for a single commenter on the quickie devblog announcing the election (which has few comments and is buried among many), and xander phoena over at crossing zebras, there seems no one who has a problem with this. and xander is restricted from calling out specific people because he is running for csm and may have to work with them later. i'm not running for csm.hopefully, ccp can take constructive -- if harsh -- criticism and not give me a problem for this post.-------------------post script-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*p.s. regarding the minutes: i appreciate the ""buck stops here"" by people like ali and ripard taking their share of responsibilty for the minutes delay in that they didn't ""poke"" or ""push"" dolan hard enough or often enough. but ultimately, you shouldn't have to arm twist and needle someone that hard to do their job. the devs working on the game have an excuse to not give it their full attention -- but isn't communicating with the players the core of his job? it speaks well of them that as unpaid volunteers they seem to be more invested in the game's success (and by extension ccps success as eve is their sole commercial hit thus far) than a paid community manager whose livelihood theoretically depends on it. or perhaps it is him telling us that its not felt his job doing this kind of community (aka ""customer"") outreach is an important ingredient in eve/ccps success. in that case, what is the purpose of his position?"
4/10/2014,"the problem is how the meta game has spread to the csm and parts of ccp.the elections has been made easy enough for nullsec entities to produce a ""copy/paste press ok"" link. anyone who doesn't have a link and no idea where to look from lack of information and communication from ccps part. will be excluded from the elections.a beautiful example of this is goonswarm *insert grr goons comment here* has members who works in ccp. you can tell this by following their history. not only that but look in reddit and you can find their leaked list. you will see that their #1 choice is someone with no activity. no interviews or information. he just spawned on the list and is failing to run a campaign. another bit of information is that rvbee is being spammed with list of who to vote for and the links. with goonswarm leadership now at the helm of rvbee they were given a list of ""vote for these people in this way!"" which is the exact same as goonswarms list. tie that in with jabber and fleet doctrines becoming mandatory. they're being slowly changed to do goons bidding in highsec because they can't handle both highsec poco wars and nullsec invasions. their membership is just too stupid to realize this."
4/10/2014,"regarding the jump animation:ccp promised a fix for this.the csm promised to follow up on the fix.we're still waiting.why a switch on/off? because the new animation doesn't add anything to gameplay and it's graphically annoying. in other words, it's worse than bad: it's useless. simple as that.<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>_ - kina ayami_"
4/10/2014,"[sarcasm] how intuitive. much better than putting the vote link on the front page, the community page, or even the csm landing page.[/sarcasm]seriously, i noticed the issue with the vote badge being deployed prematurely as a non-functional system as well (resulting in this confusion). now, once the election actually does open, the panel is demoted to one of three sliding banners. thus, if anyone tried to vote based on that original panel, they've probably been discouraged and/or don't realize its not working. if it wasn't for the community effort to gotv, i'm not sure turnout would break out of single digits.what are the explanations?(1) conspiraceeee!(2) a super top-secret set of priorities and duties that are taking all of the community rep team's time, attention and resources and that will wow us all when revealed that mean csm has to be completely backburnered for two years...(3) ccp secretly hopes csm as a concept is neutered as a stakeholder and would like to have the most minimal mandate or community participation possible. the pitiable csm8 gotv effort and the even lower energy version this time would imply this.of course, there's always:(4) negligence born of a carelessly lazy approach to one's job.(5) incompetence born of being hopelessly outmatched by the requirements of your job.i don't believe in elaborate secret conspiracies. i genuinely hope it's number 2. if it's 4 or 5, then let's just say i wouldn't be surprised given csm8, the minute delays for which ali, ripard et. all fell on their swords for not ""pushing ccp dolan"", and this year's even more anemic efforts. p.s. -- why should the csm have to ""push"" someone to do their job, particularly if their job is community rep?"

4/11/2014,"i just held a short brainstorm session with me and a beer attending. here is the result:how about we take some hisec systems and make them player owned? you can have a monthly auction for the rights to control the system. the 'owner' of the system can impose restrictions on pilots, ships, modules etc. via blacklists/whitelists applied to the gates and/or stations and access a set of advanced functions such as camera drones, damage graphs etc.you could also add a tournament beacon, a warp disruption field with 100k radius which will bbq any ships that try to leave it while it's active."
4/11/2014,"the new modifications to the ships such as the gila and assumably the rattlesnake in the near future negatively effect the versitality of these vessles.lasers trade between range and damage, with em and therm damage being traded between as this happens.hybrids trade between damage and capacitor use/range, and always do kin/therm.artillery change damage types and trade range versus damage as well as have alterable tracking.missiles vary their damage types.drones are known for being able to deal with any size threat on the fly as you either want a fast drone, or a high damage drone, so gallente and minmatar will remain the most used even after the update as there are few alternative middle grounds.right now the gila is known for being able to fit many different fits. it takes advantage of a resistance bonus to make it very tough, allowing a tremendous buffer tank in pvp, or many slots are freed up for damage mods that are not required for tank. the drones allow it to defend itself or assault any ship class depending on the fitting, and the utility high slots enable neut/nos play, long range sniper play beyond that of an ishtar, or heavy tank beyond that of an ishtar due to the altered slot layout, more high slots, and 3 instead of 2 rig slots.unfortunately instead of creating more pirate faction battlecruisers to either take the place of the 125mbit bandwidth gila, or creating pirate faction battlecruisers to create new roles of these 'mini small gang ships' that utilize uber tanked and damage medium drones, they are taking the gila and trying to just turn it into another close range missile and med drone brawler.if used in wspace, sleepers eat medium drones first with only heavies getting eaten at a higher rate, and neuts prevent you from fitting the prop mods to effectively fight in a c3 wormhole where in solo or small gang play, passive tanks are a must. as recalling one of your medium drones results in it now removing half your drone dps, it is not practical to use these drones in a wormhole.additionally medium drones lack the capability of other drone classes in pvp.leaving the gila purely a medium drone bonus and ability to only launch 2 drones(this can be assumed will happen on the rattlesnake as well) takes a ship that is a good deadspace complex runner and wormhole explorer with great utility high slot play for neuts and nos, and sequesters it to a tiny corner already filled with many other close range drone and close range weapon brawlers, which is not a new role that we need. it also leaves the entire realm of versitality in dangerous space abandoned.some people have not thought before speaking and said i simply wish for an easier to train ship that works like an ishtar, but they are not the same at all. the ishtar does more damage with sentrys while being fast and manuverable, and i use both ships quite a lot. the gila with the 3rd rig slot and resistance bonus the ishtar lacks, allows it to sacrifice dps for high tanking ability, which also makes it a hard target with some mean kick, and also makes it capable of surviving in deadly complexes or c3 wormhole space in the hands of a very skilled pilot.i would like to propose that the gila maintains the drone bandwidth, and perhaps gets either a bonus to mediums to keep the versitality it has, or perhaps a bonus to both mediums and lights to allow it to deal with varied threats on the smaller end. additionally i would like to propose that instead of 2 drones fighting with 5x hp, we get 5x drones fighting with 2x hp to allow more varied damage distribution if we have to recall a drone instead of half of our drone dps being gimped if we recall one.i am all for the missile bonus change, yes, but i feel that locking the gila to only 20mbit of bandwidth while having the 2 drones do far less than the current gila can with sentrys or heavys does not make sense. the 25% damage mod at level 5 skill for gallente cruiser that i have will only add one effective launcher over the 1 it currently has, while the dps from before was indeed higher.create new ships to meet new roles and tweak existing ships, instead of forcibly adjusting peoples play by removing the only ship that fits in the role of a heavy tanked drone and neut/nos boat or one of the many other fits it can adapt to that survives in very dangerous settings while having teeth in pvp. we have 5 varieties of advanced cruiser, many of frigate, 1 of battlecruiser that has been impinged on by t3's. we have 4 faction battlecruisers and 1 soe battlecruiser, no typical pirate battlecruisers, while there are 8 or more faction cruisers, many faction frigates, many pirate cruisers, and many pirate frigates. we need new ships to fill new roles, without stripping ships out of unique roles that are only filled by this one ship at the moment, or atleast a new ship to replace the current one that doesn't cost 1.6 billion isk in cost."

4/14/2014,"i think that your suggestions for ""fixing"" cloaking tilt things far, far too much against active cloakers. there are times when i *will* spend an hour or more sitting in one place watching a pos or taking note of someone's activity while i try to dig up a fleet.i would like to point out, however, that a pilot who is afk in a station or a pos provides the exact same level of threat as someone who is afk in a cloakie. they can provide intel on who is in the system, can undock and drop a cyno, etc. etc.so why are you not suggesting that people afk in a station or an alt get autologged out? or periodically ejected, or give people a way to eject pilots from a station or pos to make sure they are not afk? :)author of the karen 162 blog."
4/14/2014,"bottom line is afk cloaking is legit and it is used as a form of aggression .bottom line is; give players the option to hunt/probe out cloaked ships (as in submarine hunter, sub chaser, sub killer).... cloaky hunter..cloaky chaser...killer etc etc unless your a troll you get the point.i know i know, people will say then its too hard for active cloakers. the solution to that is to make ""hunting"" a cloaked ship no quick and easy task. make it a challenge, make anti cloak warfare be a team effort too that takes some time. that way us active cloakers can still play and not worry about get probed out like normal combat probing. also, i think it would be more fun if i know as a cloaker i cant just sit 300km off a pos or station , that i need to move around to avoid getting hunted, that just sounds more challenging and fun.the concept is win win and long overdue in evecsm's can you get ontop of this? and either kill it or put something in the works?"
4/14/2014,"exactly my points, thank you for seeing it the way this thread is intended."
4/14/2014,"we have discussed this much on this thread, however afk play as a whole, is a topic for another thread. i only wanted to deal with cloakers, mainly afk cloakers when this thread started., nikk narrel and i have discussed both merits and cons of dealing with afk play. both of us agree as do many i talk too that a new intel system needs to be in place. local is just way too powerful as it is. and this leads to both afk cloak, pos, station ect. there is a delayed local thread that ccp and the current csm are looking at. as to cloaking afk or not. as i have stated i like cloaking myself, i do believe it is not balanced.a concerted effort taken, should result in a reasonable chance to catch a cloaked vessel.currently there is no mechanic to combat it.an active cloaker should also have a reasonable chance to be both not found and not detected.i do believe that long term cloaking is a viable tactic. however i do not believe that afk play should be encouraged or allowed. no matter where the pilot is afk"
4/14/2014,"one of the most ignored aspects of local, yet highly used, is not so much the fact that it tells you who is present in the system.it is that, by reporting them so quickly, it also tells players when to react, as well as if they should react.this is effectively prompting players when to take an action, and by doing this helps to create the too often seen stalemates.i have found many players, who would claim that their fellows are incapable of activating a toggled sensor, or simply pinging as needed. they claim these players who are unable to make an effort to get their own intel would be mass killed by a rampaging horde of cloaked ships.and, surprisingly to some, they also claim that the cloaked players will know exactly where to find these pve targets, and be able to move in on them as described above.i have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation as to how one group will have more intel without local, which would now include pilot presence, location, etc.... while another group known to have exclusive intel channels would somehow have less intel.oh, and of course, players would not adapt to this, ever, and the game would die a horrible empty doom.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/14/2014,"every single one of you are missing the point of this thread.let me explain:""an unbalanced game mechanic or exploit, or glitch, is defined by an action taken in game which has no counter action. and or which gives an unfair advantage do to it's inability to be countered.""1. when you are able to cloak, and have 100% immunity, this is unbalanced and by definition is an exploit, bug, or imbalanced mechanic. so whether the person is afk or not is irrelevant.2. what is relevant, is that the cloak and use of such as it is currently in game by definition is in fact a glitch, or exploit, due to the fact that it gives an unfair advantage since it has absolutely no counter.this is the op's point.3. what is being discussed in this thread is not a debate about afkers or active cloakers, it is about the imbalance of the cloaking mechanism itself.the solution is a simple one. give the cloak a timer, like every other mod, say.. 5 minuet cycle time. after which it deactivates and must be reactivated. these solves every issue expressed by the op and in this thread in general. it also means that if an afker goes afk, his cloak will fail he will be scanned down and killed.everything in eve must have a consequence. cloaking afk must have one as well. this solution is simple, and provides it. this solution also allows cloakers to continue to harass and maim at will, and by no means interferes with their ability to play ""so long as they are active at their computer and not afk""."
4/14/2014,"sorry, but i find your premise unacceptable.this is a game, and the devs are the final decision makers regarding what is an exploit, and what is not.as this is an arbitrary decision on their part, and they have final judgement, any definition which seems to contradict this must be therefore invalid.please respect the nature of the game as intact, and suggest changes from this foundation.we get nowhere assuming the devs cannot be trusted at least this far.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/14/2014,"nice troll post, apparently you couldn't come up with anything logical to refute what i stated, so, like most trolls you resort to nonsensical rhetoric, which only states the obvious.we make these post to assist the devs and speak for the players. if you have an issue with it, make a suggestion desiring the banning of all suggestions. (which in and of itself would make your above post irrelevant, null, and void anyway.....)otherwise stfu and move on."
4/14/2014,"your tactic of declaring me a troll is noted. it is not uncommon for people to see themselves reflected onto the motives of others.i see people trying to have a rational debate, and respond accordingly.you, apparently, see trolls.we have no reason to accept your biased view that cloaking is an unbalanced absolute factor, as it is stereotyped by the blocking of intel, which is specific solely to the exact location of the ship itself.it is balanced by, as agreed to by many others, the exact and specific listing of all pilots in a system, regardless of circumstance such as docked, cloaked, operating in normal space, or behind the shields of a pos.this is also a form of intel, which establishes the opposite side available.many claiming cloaking to be broken and needing a timer, reject seeing an issue with the absolute nature of presence data updating so precisely as to effectively also prompt when to act, as well as if action is needed.if you simply want to rant, i can't help you.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/14/2014,"here's something logical for you champ, being afk in a station has ""no counter either."" so maybe when you are afk in station for longer than an hour, you get automatically ejected into space to be shot at. that's about as much reason as your argument has.the people whining about cloaking (not even just afk cloaking) are the same people that want to sit back and carebear away without a worry in life. sorry, eve is not a theme park game where you get to sit behind hundreds of systems in your little pocket of safe goodness while making isk with little risk.cloaked ships should not show up in local. nobody can whine about afk cloaking and cloakers can actually hunt rather than wait for carebears to leave the station."
4/14/2014,"al i see here is a bunch of meaningless content about your personal view of definitions and absolute viewpoints. it is your opinion that i was speaking in absolutes, so be it. but you still have not responded with a legitimate rebuttal to my reasoning or post. you have however attempted to discredit my idea by simply discrediting my opinion with an unsupported opinion of your own.an opinion is just that an opinion. you have yours and i have mine, and while you are welcome to express yours, since it has 0 to do with what i actually wrote or posted, it is therefore by definition a troll post attempting to sidetrack the thread.move along and let those with actual input have a conversation which actually solves an issue that has been around for years and has even been acknowledged several times by developers ""as"" an issue that needs to be addressed. or keep troll posting ""shrugs"". i've stated what i needed to, continuing this debate with you on semantics is pointless and and off topic of the op, not to mention, a waste of time."
4/14/2014,"it's only been ""recognized as an issue"" by whining carebears that don't understand you consent to pvp the moment you undock your ship."
4/14/2014,"i would actually agree with you on this, if it wasn't for stations being labeled as a ""safe"" area, and one where many of the functions can take up a rather long time (such as managing a corp or market which you are required by game mechanics to be docked for).however, i would think putting an afk kick feature in game might work nicely to fix this, if the person is actually afk and not playing with the market or something."
4/14/2014,"actually being afk (whether cloaked or not) is not part of pvp, to pvp you must be actively engaging in combat against another player.so it is not an issue recognized by care-bears (who simply go out and care-bear mine / rat / whatever anyway in 0.0), it is an issue recognized by pvpers, who want a way to actively hunt and kill these afk individuals.the excuse that only care-bears complain about broken game mechanics is prejudice and irrelevant, especially since in this particular case as i stated above the majority of complaints come from ""pvpers"" who think being able to sit 100% immune to attack, in open space while afk is bs.just saying."
4/14/2014,"perhaps you missed this...vvvi have effectively defined both sides in the absolutes which are counterbalancing each other.local, providing intel with the ability to know if & when to respond.balanced by:cloaking, which blocks intel from knowing specific ship locations.a frequent consensus suggests that being able to hunt cloaked ships is not balanced, if local can tell you if & when you should do the hunting.removing a cloaked presence by virtue of the timer method, in any of it's effective forms, simply resolves the stalemate in favor of the local residents, which many agree shifts the balance in their favor.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/14/2014,"no, it's a terrible idea. sometimes you want the game up while you're doing other things. adding an afk timer for anything would be a bad design. you're basically arguing for a bad game mechanic to be added because you don't know how to deal with a current one.actually being afk cloaky is part of pvp. it works to wear down morale. it frustrates the enemy. it helps destablize a region. you have a very limited understanding of what pvp entitles if you think pvp starts when you lock onto an enemy and ends when one of you is dead.and no actual pvpers have made any whine about cloaky gameplay because the competent ones understand how it works and how to counter act it."
4/14/2014,"i cleaned this up abit since you sumerized it nicely at the end, and this i will respond to:i'll start here:1. local only tells you who is in system, not what they are in, or where they are. they could just as easily be in a station as cloaked up afk. (granted you can look in station to see if that's where they are). so local has nothing to do with determining any information on whether someone is afk, or even if they are a cloaker, or the cloak function itself and therefore is an irrelevant topic or rebuttal.* local also does not tell you which ship a person is in, you need to use the scanner and be in range, or use probes in order to figure this out, which again, makes your comment on local, irrelevant.2. there is no current game mechanic which will allow you to hunt cloaked ships. it is impossible to ""do the hunting"" even if you are aware by use of local that cloakers are in system, if there is no way to hunt said ships.therefore your point here is irrelevant, and simply agrees with my original post.3. i never said ""remove"" the cloak function, i said give it a timer, which the user can re-cloak with continuously if they are at their computer and not ""afk"" to click the button. this function changes nothing in the mechanics other to ensure a cloaker is active at their computer and not afk. it provides no favoritism for or against the local residents, as it takes all of 1 seconds to re-click your cloak function. (unless of course your afk in which case you deserve to be hunted down and killed for your stupidity of afking in 0.0 / lowsec / wormhole space)."
4/14/2014,"your premiss is flawed, because you fail to take into account that the immunity you speak of applies to both sides equally. both are equally immune from each other, when the cloak is active.also you attempt to use the terms exploit, glitch and bug, is rather weak rhetoric and bears no relation to the facts.but cloaks do have counters. they may not be counters you like, or ones that break their role. but they do have counters and to say otherwise is being rather disingenuous.you base this on your flawed premiss. with that in mind, as well as other mechanics at play. it's clear to see your timer idea is ridiculously bad and breaks cloaking.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
4/14/2014,"i do not count psychological warfare as part of pvp. i count it as psychological warfare. which is war on the mind and moral of ones enemies. while yes this is exactly what the afk cloaker is used for, it should have a counter. any method of attack in game regardless of it's source should not be 100% immune to counter. since you are labeling this as a form of attack, their should be some sort of mechanic whcih can be used to defend against it. otherwise in your own words it is the eulas exact definition of an exploit or glitch."
4/14/2014,the counter is you fit your ship properly to deal with pvp threats.or remove local for cloaked ships.
4/14/2014,"i don't think an afk kick feature is a good idea. i think the logical and fairest solution is an afk status indicator. i'll list why this is needed.cloaking by itself is not a bad thing. there are legitimate reasons to cloak. things like operating in deep enemy null and being unable to dock while being camped and scanned. not wanting to alert people to when you are and are not active. a cloaked ship in local is just a cloaked ship. if there is one cloaked ship then you can devise a counter. this disregards cynos which are the reason cloaking is so problematic. it ruins pvp and my ability to find targets as a cloaker since everyone assumes cyno dropper and leaves.the reason a status on afk is needed is 1) seeking out and killing people in wars is horribly frustrating. of all the time wasted in eve the most i have wasted would easily be camping docked and afk targets. 2) the hot drop menace is beyond annoying. we have 4 people going on 6 months permanently cloaked in and around our stations in stain. it's foolish given their history of dropping blop's to use those systems so they effectively are afk (but can become active at any time) denying hundreds of people those systems.a status indicator that turns off on warp activation, after adding those people to contacts, would one, not deny those people the ability to cloak or hot drop but would also not deny others who are actually playing and alert, the ability to use those systems and worry about truly active players. since it would only deactivate on warp they could happily sit there scanning, communicating with allies without giving away their activity status.that's my opinion anyway.i"
4/14/2014,you have a good fit to deal with 100 tengu? that's how many i saw dropped on someone the other day.
4/14/2014,"oh? and what facts are those?well here is some ""facts"" i see:* an afk cloaker is 100% immune to being found or attack?* that according to many afk cloaking is a type of pvp which constitutes as an attack on others to which they have 0 defense against?* that by the eulas definition of a glitch, exploit this is exactly what afk cloaking is?oh really?name 1 way to counter an afk cloaker in your system. (beyond ignoring them, which is not a counter as it does not effect them or their ship in any manner.)you have yet to tell us what my ""flawed premise"" is..... you keep saying this, but saying something is flawed and not explaining in detail how it is flawed is just you blowing smoke.1. you all have been debating this with me for the past 2 hours, yet none of you have yet to give me one example of how to effectively counter an afk cloaker. and thereby show why my premise is flawed.2. you all are debating opinions, and have yet to express actual examples (as i ahve) of why your information or opinion is correct and mine is wrong.1. saying someone is wrong because you think they are, does not make them wrong, it simply means you think they are. showing evidence of a counter currently in game to an afk cloaker, would be proving my desire for one irrelevant since it would already exist.2. just as giving me a valid reason why a player should be allowed to afk in open space with 0 fear of consequence in a game world where every action you take has one, would also be a viable rebuttal.neither of which have been addressed or given by any of you."
4/14/2014,"cloakly gameplay is a way to give the ""small group"" a chance to do anything to a larger group. sorry if you want to sit behind a blob wall and rat your heart away but nobody but other carebears share your opinion."
4/14/2014,an afk indicator on your picture in local would be an awesome idea in general. not just for the afk cloaker reasons but for statistics and player activity throughout the game also.
4/14/2014,"i never said anything was wrong with cloaky game play, in fact i am all for it, my main ship is an sb. (i am not a care-bear by the way and i am a beta player , i do not rat or mine either :) )1. what i stated was that afkers should have consequences for sitting afk in open space.* you find a ship sitting afk in open space your going to kill it right? if your a pvper the answer is yes.* you know a ship is afk in open space but it's cloaked so you can't find it to kill it. = garbage.care-bears are the ones who want to be able to afk cloak, or those too lazy to actually work on their pvp skills.so you my friend are either a care-bear, or too lazy to do any real pvp. which is it? because if you were neither and were a real pvper you wouldn't care if i could somehow hunt down your cloaky ship, because you'd be ready and willing to fight or run from me.obviously however you care a great deal about protecting your ability to sit afk 100% immune to attack with no consequence.and that's really the bottom line. laziness is not part of, and has no place in pvp. laziness is something for care-bears. and if afking isn't the very definition of lazy, i don't know what is."
4/14/2014,"and it's for ccp to decide when something is an exploit or glitch. it's their game and their rules and they apply them as they see fit. so as cloaking has been around since 2004 and afking with cloaks not long after, if it had been deemed an exploit or glitch, then we would know about it already.so no, your claim is not based on, or has any relation to know facts. it matters not how you see it, it matters how ccp see it in this regard.well as you already said yourself that the point of afking is psychological warfare, then the counter is not to let it bother you. after all, that warfare is taking place in your head. hence the term.but it also requires the use of another mechanic to work, one that you seem to have ignored in your attempt to break cloaks.so with that other mechanic in mind, the list is as follows:you can close local.refit your ship for more of a pvp role.form a fleet.set up a trap.but you actually said it wasn't about being afk, it was merely about cloaks. you should at least decide what you are arguing against first. my actual point was that cloaks do have counters, just not ones that break them or that you may like.i already said why your premiss was flawed, in my first post. you could read it again a suppose, but i will tell you again.your premiss is that the cloaker has 100% immunity while cloaked and this makes it unbalanced. well that premiss is flawed because you don't take into account that that immunity goes both ways, therefore actually making it balanced.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
4/14/2014,"i like points.1. i believe many suggestions could be offered, about how to counter so-called afk cloaking.since it apparently needs to meet your approval, however, we can safely assume you will never give it, thus it is not possible to meet this detail currently.2. your premise itself is an opinion, based on your interpretation of game details.fact: an afk cloaked pilot is incapable of inflicting harm or damage to items in game, and is thus pointless to counter further.fact: since you are concerned about active players behavior, as only active players can attack or through hot dropping bring others to attack, your labeling them as afk is not appropriate beyond showing that they have mislead you to believe this.and then:fact: since your genuine interest apparently centers around how you object to being mislead by other players, might i suggest you try different tactics.3. that first part is gold. you should print t-shirts.the counter: in sov null, where this has meaningful context, it is possible to see only the name and the standings in local, to know more than enough to realize you must take an action to protect yourself.as evasion is often the only available means to prevent attack by miners, and some ratters, this is often the choice made.how do you know they are cloaked? you don't. however, you also don't know how they got past your gate camps either, suggesting something sneaky or clever happened.4. outposts, specifically player made ones, are placed in open space. people docked there are safe.by this precedent, players have the ability to re-zone areas in system as being safe. frequently this also occurs with a pos being set up as well.considering that being cloaked only re-zones the immediate area, and can be countered by simply getting within 2,000 meters of the ship, it is hardly as safe or secure as some have implied. it seems to rely quite directly on the fragile secrecy of it's location, to be precise.i suspect these points will not satisfy you, as per my response at point 1.i would further state that i believe you are working backwards from your desired conclusion, cloaked ships becoming more limited, and will refuse to acknowledge any response which does not support this.have a lovely day.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/14/2014,"actually devs have stated on numerous occasion that cloaking is not functioning how they desire it to. so they have told you, i would guess however that it hasn't been delt with because lets be honest, its not game breaking and pretty trivial. and most people just choose to ignore them.ah but your forgetting that a cloaked player can not be seen, while the non cloaked player can easily be seen by one who is cloaked, therefore, this gives the cloaked individual a massive advantage over someone who is not cloaked. hence they are not equals, and it is not balanced. and since a non cloaked individual has 0 defense and no way to hunt down or detect said cloaked individual, it is in fact massively imbalanced, and my premise is thus correct, and not flawed."
4/14/2014,"afk players are able to inflict harm. the term ""afk cloaker"" refers to a person who is afks cloaked for the majority of its time. it does not preclude that player from becoming temporarily active to kill somebody or drop a cyno. attempting to deny afk cloakers being a threat through those sort of semantic tricks damages a persons credibility. i'm an afk cloaker and it's obvious to me that afking for long periods of time so that people begin to relax and become vulnerable is my modus operandi. just because i become active and kill somebody for 10 minutes out of a 24 hour day doesn't mean my afk cloaking is not harmful. it is, very much so, both in that 10 minutes and psychologically at all other times.outposts and pos are not the same thing. the map gives you a good indication of how many are docked. you can watch the outpost and 100% see them undock every time. with cloaking you cannot do that. there is no indication that a cloaker has become active like a docked player indicates. pos is similar, while you can sit safe in pos you can also be scanned and observed. you cannot scan and observe a cloaked player like you can someone in a pos."
4/14/2014,"lol what good is calling corp mates to help you in highsec against a bumper who is not criminally flagged and probably in a ship that would take more then the freighters worth to gank effectively? not to mention the loss of the corps ships for the suicide?also a freighter is so big and has so much mass the bumper could miss 5 times and still have another go at bumping you out of alignment before you warped. on average it takes a freighter 3-5 minuets to align and warp. the bumper is not going to be distracted by your corp mates that long, if at all. unless one of them wants to sacrifice a ship to save you by either scramming and webbing the bumper and even then concord is going to kill him and the bumper is going to continue bumping you before you can warp.really man. you should think more before commenting.just one of the many reason i do not carry more then 500 mil of stuff in my freighter and even then i only carry minerals, and nothing even remotely useful or worth ganking for. and why my freighter is always insured. does it take me more time to do stuff? sure. do gankers leave me alone? yep because i am not worth the time or effort."
4/14/2014,"just give them a suspect flag, trust me they'll be dead in seconds."
4/14/2014,"the should do away with the history altogether, it doesnt fit well with the game's core concepts of take a risk and deal with the consequences. if you want to add someone to your corp / alliance you take a risk but gain a potential reward.also, if some group spends 2 months making a awox group and you take them in, then they put in the time to gank your ships and should be rewarded for their efforts.i know most people see the history as you dealing with the consequences of your actions, but you cannot change names in this game so if they awox you then make a note and dont invite them again.compare this to the market place and i think you might see my point better, i have no idea who screwed me out of a few million the other day because markets dont list anything about who is manipulating them, this fits well with what this game is about.yawn, i'm right as usual. the predictability kinda gets boring really."
4/14/2014,"if 0.0 alliances need their markets seeded and their industry boosted, and if they are so desperate for these industrialists, they know where to find them. the problem is their attitude toward these individuals which without whom they would not have ships to pvp with.if the 0.0 alliances, would change their attitude, or if the sov mechanics required the actual ""use"" of systems to maintain sovereignty (ie mining, ratting, etc).then the larger alliances would have absolutely no issues finding these individuals.1. in an organization, it is the responsibility of those with combat power and prowess to protect those who's job it is to maintain the very weapons and ships used to carry out the alliances will as a whole (industrialists). if they are unwilling to do so, is it really a surprise why none wish to join? 2. would you if you were an industrialist, be willing to join an organization that jeered and made fun of you, when they fail to realize without you they themselves would cease to exist?many capital pilots, and decent pvpers prefer industry, in fact many have 70-100 mil sp indy characters. but the real question you might ask is why don't they use them? well in 0.0 the answer is simple. why take risks, when your reward is being left to fend for yourself, jeered at and made fun of by the very people your are attempting to assist with such?no one wants to work in that type of environment. i have a 70 million sp titan building indy character myself. i also have an 80 million sp double dreadnaught mom character. personally i prefer indy. and i choose to spend my days in highsec these days simply because the 0.0 alliances i have spoken to thus far are well... pricks....so if you all in 0.0 who are interested in these ""rare"" industrialists, really want them, stop calling them carebears, stop insulting them, start actually protecting them, and helping them. do this and i guarantee you, you will never want for ships, minerals or other industrial needs or assets.but i can also understand how it is difficult for a pvper to take that stance, most do not have the desire to protect, only to kill. thus unless you are willing to change yourselves and your policies, you will continue to seek the ever elusive industrialist, who... like me, may (and most likely does) just have a very nasty pvp character tied to them..... in the end you can choose to change and adapt to achieve your goals and wants, or simply hear us say...your loss.i mean after all, were billionaires, why do we need you? on the other hand, you do need us. just some food for thought."
4/14/2014,"[/quote]your post shows a profound lack of understanding! points you seem to not understand: 1.) there is no innate benefit to building in nullsec. it's one-outpost-per-system setup results in much less manufacturing lines available, unless you use a pos (which is vulnerable, wonky, and more expensive to utilize). it is farther from the materials you will need for serious production (minerals, datacores, complex moon materials, pi products, etc). it is harder to offload items when you overproduce (less customers around). so, with all of these drawbacks, on top of the much riskier environment, there is literally no advantage to building in nullsec. 2.) it is not the job of anyone to play sentry for you and yours, especially when you are making isk and they are not. what type of self-entitled bullshit attitude is that? the first rule everyone in nullsec abides by is you are the player primarily responsible for keeping your stuff safe. when people talk about nullsec industrialists, they refer to players that can swap ships, join the response gang, and help defend the space. at the end of the day, if you cannot and/or will not defend your space (which entails bringing out that ""nasty pvp character""), of course they don't want you. it's a dog eat dog world, and pacifists have no place here! 3.) i'm a big proponent of a ""use it or easily lose it"" sov system. for example, if a system is not being utilized, i'd eliminate all rf timers on sov structures in the system, so sov could be lost in a single attack. however, how you define ""using a system"" is important. pi activity, pos operations, mining, plexing, ratting, logistics, marketeering, and pvp are all viable ways to use a system. i think the military and industrial indexes are great barometers that a system is being used, but the system needs to account for much more than mining and ratting activities."
4/14/2014,"i have a rebuttal to your 1. and 2. statements but i agree with your 3rd.like many it seems, you do not understand 0.0 industry as it applies to an industrialist and their ""job"" as part of an alliance or null sec corp. you are confusing someone who mines or builds for sole profit, with an alliance / corp based industrialist. which are 2 entirely different creatures. you also seem to miss the fact that he who controls the market / economy in the region, controls the region. not you the pvper who are reliant on such for your gear and without which, you would wither and die.let me explain the reality to you:1. there's plenty of advantage to building in nullsec, in fact i prefer it. but i am not going to explain why to you. call it a trade secret. most of those issues you listed are simply logistical issues, which in no way apply to anyone who is an actual industrialist, especially if their alliance actually supports them (as they should).2. so your telling me you would not protect and support the individuals building your ships, which by the way you need for pvp, your ammo, and your modules? or are at least if not building them, getting them to your 0.0 market at a decent price, so you can use them... affordably?if this is what you truly think, then i feel sorry for you and your alliance if it thinks the same way.it's people with this opinion that belong to alliances which eventually die by attrition, or happened to **** one of us off, who controls the market in your region and we decide we do not want you there anymore, and make sure you can not buy or purchase anything and have to go an entire region over to get a single tech 2 mod or decent ship, while simultaneously ensuring the people fighting you are well supplied with low prices in their region.the game the real industrialist play involves creating and destroying alliances across vast regions simply because we want to, and without ever firing a single shot. the thing you need to understand is that all empires, all people and everything in eve like in real life, is based on money. he who controls the ebb and flow of goods, controls the empire and dictates the rules.* an industrialist (or multiple industrialists) which belong to an alliance does this for the alliance. they ensure your market stays full, has what your alliance needs, and ensures your enemy does not. we are the one type of people in eve that will make or break an alliance. compared to an industrialists ability to manipulate the economy and market across multiple regions, as a single pvper, you are insignificant in value, unless you are useful or make yourself useful to us at which point you will find yourself with plenty of ships, ammo, mods, companants, and even isk. we are the ones who you want as friends and allies, and the ones who your enemies truly fear.anyone can fly a ship and shoot things. very few people can bring an alliance to it's knees simply by manipulating the flow of goods and the market itself, as well as the management of super capitals and capitals and their various needs and logistics.you don't want to protect us? fine. good luck fending off the next alliance that comes trundling through your territory when you have no ships and no ammo and when your convoys mysteriously get ganked and hot dropped in rout, and do not be surprised when the enemy never seems to run out of ships.a true industrialist is the real power in eve, and these are the industrialists alliances seek. not helping them and protecting them, while they are trying to help you. is a very stupid idea.like i said:we don't need you, for anything. you need us. and our price ""for helping you"" is your protection, which is a small one at that. because why would we help you, if we need to protect ourselves (since legitimately that's the only real thing we need from anyone, or rather which anyone can actually offer us in payment)? no, if we are required to protect ourselves (which we can) were simply going to help ourselves and tell you to gtof.3. i agree with you on this."
4/14/2014,"hello all,i play the market a bit, mostly selling rat droppings, but there's one feature i think should be in this game. when selling an item, there should be a box on the advanced screen that says ""add to existing sell order"". if you have a sell order in that given station, and more items of the same type, you should be able to add the items to the previously existing sell order without having to open up another sell order entirely.this would make sale orders much easier to handle, and it could have the same cost as modifying an order in any other way (100 isk) in addition to the taxes and such. i humbly seek your support on this topic.- bunyip"

4/14/2014,"couldn't find this in search, so in case it has not been proposed yet.lots of industry folks out there. some really do not care about getting credit for work they do, they just want isk. other players really want more immersion in their chosen play in eve.eve has always been about immersion and building up more of it in pve, pvp, lore etc, so here is the idea.when you build a module or ship, the game puts a date and time stamp of when it was created and by whom. i think this is done in other mmo's (ducks from the wow troll comments) i thought it might be an interesting concept in eve for a couple reasons.1. those who enjoy building things may like this feature.2. would be fun to buy a ship that was built....10 years ago, just for example.3. if eve ever introduces more variation in industry products such as better quality products from more experienced builders, then name stamps could help in buying more product from that builder etc. could open up a whole new level of industry in eve.anyways i though it was an interesting idea.go, have fun, deus vult!"

4/15/2014,total crap. often cited and proposed but still total crap. a cloaked player doesn't have to even decloak to kill someone. all they need to do is sit near the uncloaked player. done it many times myself to kill someone.
4/15/2014,"oh dear lord. this does not mean that the cloak was at fault, it simply means the person who died wasn't watching local or was a part of any intel channels.but hey, let's move the posts some more before they settle in. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

4/15/2014,"lol its called posting on an alt. you never post with your main on these forums, it's paramount to suicide. you should know this. just makes you an easy target."
4/15/2014,really? because that sounds like bullshit. i'm here. who wants to target me?
4/15/2014,"just to add to the silliness, i have alts that i post on forums for certain things that i do not want to reveal who i am. however i know seraph and he is quite well known, this is also the same for nikk narrel.in this instance we all believe strongly in our views to express on our mains. however this is off topic.the only thing on the last few pages that has made any sense to me in regards to the original topic has been the afk notifier. is an interesting option. would this apply equally to all players i think i could see its advantages.however it would still give intel much too easily.the idea of station kick out, cloak timers and such has been discussed on this thread and others. i was a fan at one time of having a timer on cloaks, however i have since changed my mind having seen the horrible cons and possibilities. as to cloaking in general. ccpfozzy has stated that the afk cloaking mechanics do serve a purpose as a valid tactic for smaller entities against larger ones. that is the psych warfare. it is and has been since it came out in 2004 been admitted by devs and the community as needing work. however ultimately it is very low on the priority list for obvious reasons and many members of the eve community are very polarized on how to improve it. the original point of this thread was just one aspect of using cloaks, to be fair to that end all aspects of using cloaks, defence and offence has been offered.please consider these points1. once a cloak capable pilot has successfully entered a system and cloaked up- there is no viable mechanic to interact with that pilot as long as that pilot remains cloaked.2. once point one is achieve there is no mechanic to effectively tell if the cloaked pilot is afk or not3. the threat of force projection is there regardless of whether the pilot is afk or not4. current pve mechanics encourage maximization of profit leaving most pve ships incapable of meaningful pvp 5. the threat of force projection limits targets for cloaked pilots and encourages afk game play.it is my opinion that a. non cloaked or cloaked pilots should have a reasonable chance through diligent effort to find and interact with a cloaked ship.b. a cloaked pilot should have a reasonable chance to avoid detection and or interaction. c. no mechanic should encourage afk play."
4/15/2014,"it is my view, that the two absolutes imposed on intel both need to be changed, in order for either to be changed.(both or none, if balance is to be maintained)local must stop giving out actionable intel, this is a chat channel being used as a substitute for player effort. obviously tools need to exist, and players need time to adapt over into their usage.cloaks must stop granting absolute protection, based off of the above being in place. it would destroy a key game element should local tell players when to hunt cloaked ships, in addition to being able to hunt cloaked ships.there is a third element, which i feel should also be respected. leave the wormholes alone. they don't want changes, they are not a part of this environment being disputed. they like not having local, and being unable to find each other while cloaked.let's not spoil their game to fix ours.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/15/2014,"they're both related, as you well know."
4/15/2014,"cyno dropping is also related to local's intel ability, every bit as much as afk cloaking is, and for the exact same reason.the need for cyno dropping, only exists since it offers the only means to deliver forces to a target before that target has more than enough free warning time to evade the threat.it is common knowledge, that if a player can reliably avoid another player, then they are effectively immune to the threat that hostile player could bring.eliminate the predictable and overly effective warning, and hot dropping will cease to be needed, or used.in fact, you can add a spool up mechanic to force it out of existence, so long as balance is kept in exchange.the key factor, i see too often being glossed over, is that the devs have declared this to be currently in balance, regardless of whether it is the ideal solution they would prefer.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/15/2014,"completely disagree with you. cyno dropping is related to risk aversion and the desire to get kills without having to pvp. cloaking and cyno's are not themselves bad but put together they create a stupidly imbalanced mechanic.a cyno turns a newb ship into a super carrier, capable of carrying in its hold 36 trillion m3 of ships and pilots while cloaking the pilots from local. a newb ship should be a newb ship, not a ship capable of destroying a large fleet with a single module that takes 5 days to train.the same goes for cloaky ships. they're imbalanced, they're constantly used and they're an i win button that prevents pvp, not encourages it. i have never seen a dev post saying they think cyno dropping is balanced. some of the developers though say stupid things. one of them was that the're happy with the way sov is and they have no immediate plans to change it. sov is complete shite. just because they're a dev doesn't mean they know what they're talking about. very likely they say stupid things like the sov thing because they have limited experience actually in the game playing against players.i'd also like to say, if you don't like local, and its intel, why did you join eve? i joined in 2003 and there was local then. we don't need risk averse people who cannot figure out how to kill people without cynos. there are fps type games where you can camp spawn points and get teleported around killing people. you are also more than free to go to wormhole space and pvp. why aren't you there if you hate local so much. because you love local for yourself, you just don't like people using it to avoid you ganking them.edit: case in point - in a small gang moments ago, cloaky legion comes up the pipe, known cyno dropper flys around and tries to get engaged, while his alliance sits around a titan 10 jumps away. did we try to engage him, no, because we'd get dropped by 20, 30 or more ships with capital support. that player has effectively made himself immune from non-consentual pvp and immune to all small to mid sized gangs in the area. and you think we're the carebears trying to avoid pvp?"
4/15/2014,"in point of fact, you misrepresent the larger context of the pvp experience with what you say.getting kills without having to pvp? did they tickle the pve ship to death, perhaps?no.the simple fact, is that the pve ship, in this context, relied exclusively on evasion as a defense.whether it was because they were anti-social, or simply because they could not gather others to help them with defense, they chose to play in numbers too small to resist the attacking force.they chose to rely exclusively on evasion, simply because they had a near perfect warning device that gave them the ability to do this. only by ignoring it to some degree does a hot dropping hostile have any chance of reaching their target.why, pray tell, would hot dropping be needed in this environment?because no other options are available with any meaningful chance to catch the targets before they reach safety.if you want to stop hot dropping, your only real option is to remove the reason it is used.without it, pve ships have a near perfect defense in sov null, with only the limited fighting ability ships able to slip past gate camps to reach them at all.accept and repeat this all important truth:we want encounters to happen. while obtaining a direct benefit such as transport or direct income from mining or other npc interaction, no ship is to be exempt from encounters for any reason.docked, cloaked, logged off, or sitting behind pos shields cuts off the ship from direct benefit, so is exempt while under these conditions.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/15/2014,"rubbish. you want to avoid risk in pvp. you want to sit in local cloaked and completely immune from combat, unable to be scanned or probed while you warp around, scanning and probing, looking for an easy kill on someone that hasn't decided to be completely immune from non-consentual pvp.you're the risk averse person, not the person that is ratting. you're the one that's hiding waiting for your chance to get an easy kill against a ship that for whatever reason ccp devs decided, is not able to be fit for pvp and pve at the same time.now before you get all upset and stuff, i have done this too. but i'm not going to pretend its because of the uber intel of local, its because i wanted kills and didn't want to get killed.lets be honest. if you want to fight its easy to get a fight in eve. its easy to catch a ratter or missioner. its just not uber easy as cloaking up and killing people when they're vulnerable. wormholes are great, you can sit your gang in the entrance to a null and send one ship out as bait. when its engaged you jump your gang in. no cloaking in local required. but people want it easier than many vs 1. they want to teleport entire fleets onto one target these days. because they're risk averse carebears. and that's where i think the game is broken. there should be risk to both sides."
4/15/2014,"lol, it is so easy to assume these details, as you have clearly done. for starters, i have enormous risk control in pvp. i am a miner.while i have the skills and hardware to afk cloak, i don't bother with it at all.it's just not my play style.i find it too boring to sit endless hours, waiting for someone to assume i am not there when i am. if they assumed i was not there, when i really wasn't there, it means nothing to me.i don't care about causing resource deprivation reactions in others.you want to be honest? good, let's do that.1. i want exhumers and ratting ships able to fight effectively against cloaking oriented ships.2. as part of this, i would add a spool up effect to hot dropping. being on grid with your target, and lighting a cyno, should be a death sentence to the cyno boat every time. that pve ship should melt the locked down cyno boat like butter on a stove.3. i would add in enough to the venture in order to make it practical to use in hostile areas, so play could happen in more places.i want to play both sides of this conflict, pve vs stealthed guerrilla assault, because this is the clever side of eve, where the game doesn't win or lose based on simple dps or sheer numbers. being clever carries more weight, and fooling your opponent is a victory unto itself.by contrast, it sounds to me like you just want the so-called afk cloaked pilots to leave.how am i supposed to play with other players if they leave?upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/15/2014,"so basically you don't afk, you're a miner. well i am an afk cloaking pilot which is why my corp is called cloakers. one of us knows what they're talking about and one of us doesn't."
4/15/2014,"no that's not specifically true. they want to be able to play their game in what is supposed to be a safe area, without being griefed or extorted. they pay to play the game, just like we pay to play the game. it is not unimaginable that like us they may want to play their game their way.after all i see plenty of threads with griefers bitching about being given suspect flags / criminal flags, for committing pirate activities in highsec space. they are no different then a carebear bitching about them not getting flags for committing what is in fact a suspect / criminal action with the intent to harass and or annoy.it goes both ways.the solution is to simply make the game like perpetuum, :1.) .8 to 1.0 will be the new ""alpha"" security space. in which no wardecs can be made against anyone, and pvp tageting and damage is disabled, save for mutually agreed duals / wardecs.2.) .5 to .7 will be ""alpha 2"" security space. in which wardecs can occur, but where all pvp except concord sanctioned pvp (wardecs), or mutually agreed pvp (duals), is disabled. 3.) 0.1 to 0.4 will be beta security space, in which the same rules which now apply to lowsec will continue to apply with no changes.4.) 0.0 will remain unchanged as well.this will fix your issues. after all highsec is intended to be a safe place for new players to learn the game without interference from griefers. and some people prefer to play the game in an area like this.this also allows for those that wish to gank and grief and otherwise cause mischief to have their area which they can do it in. whilst being unable to harass those who do not want to deal with them or be harassed by them.eve's one downside, and one of the major issues with retaining subscribers and new players is well, ""greifers"". give pepople the above and your subscriber base will grow exponentially.are you going to lose subscribers as well? sure. but i mean losing the contaminated , unstable and toxic part of your community isn't really a bad thing is it? no i view it as a good thing, pvp is one thing, war is one thing. pointless griefing just to feed on the tears frustration and anger of another human being is a psychopathic, parasitical action and like any cancer, and the patient (or game in this case) would do a lot better once it is removed.i should also point out that 80% of the eve population stays in highsec anyway, the griefers and gankers, and 0.0 bears, are the minority in the new eden universe. this is a clear signal that the vast majority of people who play eve do not want to deal with the ""psychopathic"" mentality of many of the minority population in the game.also ccp is a business. a businesses job is to make money. in eve subscribers make ccp their money. and increaseing their subscriber base, means that ccp makes more money. and i guarantee you if this system was put in place, all those subers who left because of continual griefing, would flock back to eve online.you can post whatever you like and flame this as hard as you want. but statistics, and math, do not lie. it is what it is."
4/15/2014,"i would agree with your point 1 if people could not mission or mine in those systems.also as ccp stated many times, high sec is meant to be safer, not safe.the fact that eve is gaining not loosing players tells a different story about ""omg people are leaving"". stop it.on another note you mentioned statistics and math do not lie yet you presented none. which tells me you do not have this info and decided that trolling the assembly forums is something you would like to do.edit: also reading your previous post i see that you are full of shyte and won't listen to anybody but yourself."
4/15/2014,"i'd like to start out by saying that i'm one of those soloist players who enjoys mining in peace. however, that's not the game of eve. undocking is permission to pvp.maybe you want to play a different game. i won't judge - eve isn't for everybody. you're viewing this game as a polished star trek universe - it's not. this game is closer to a rough firefly universe.the game works as it is. sure, some people may get griefed and ragequit. however, those that calm down and redouble their efforts will find this game to be a very in-depth topic where griefing may occur, but is very rare. this is a thinking person's game, and if you use your head for more than a place to store your hat, you'll find this game to be a near utopia.sorry, but not supported."
4/15/2014,i don't get why this needed a new thread.
4/15/2014,"actually, this game is more like perpetuum. then any other game, with the exception that perpetuum uses robots instead of spaceships, and that the areas are set up exactly as i described, it is eve online.1.) the only difference between the 2 games is: perpetuum due to it's current obscurity, does not have the member base of eve, and that the bs one must deal with in eve on a daily basis (even if your a pvper and yes even if your a griefer) does not exist in the perpetuum universe due simply to the set up i have suggested above.2.) i did not say remove pvp from highsec. nor did i suggest any real or major change. what i did suggest simply removes a griefers ability to harass and grief a newer player, or a highsec resident without themselves putting some investment into it (ie wardec / dual etc).you can still dec people and grief to your hearts content, you simply have to work for it. you can still bumb people and annoy the **** out of them, no change there, and you can still extort people through clever use of the wardec system. ""what this does do however is ensure that in some systems people can avoid you if they desire and play their game how they wish to play, while allowing you to play yours how you want to play it.""3.) for the record, i am not a carebear. i am a beta player, and a pvper, marketer, and builder, industrialist, this is an alt, one of many, which i made for posting because lets face it, my views are controversial to the scum of eve and their desires, and personally even though i love killing them, i'm really not interested in taking on the entire scum of the universe by myself. 4. on memberships, i do not know if you have read it but the 2013 preliminary financial report for ccp put them around 118,000$ (or something ) in the hole last quarter, this is public information and you can find it simply by googleing it. so whether or not eve has more accounts, does not actually mean they have a larger member base. and in fact in that document it clearly states ""eve online has seen a decline in active member subscriptions"". in black and white.so you are in fact wrong on this. as ccp themselves made this statement in their own report."
4/15/2014,"so, what you're asking for is highsec to literally become truesec where ganking and griefing wouldn't be allowed?i'm so sorry, but that's literally the stupidest thing i've heard! you do make a compelling argument for your carebear ways. but, it will never happen and you would instantly break the sandbox. congratulations!!!lowsec and nullsec would remain the same, but highsec would become carebear heaven. highsec is meant to be slightly safer then lowsec, risk is involved everywhere in the game! that's what makes eve so unique! if you really want risk free pve, literally go play another mmo! not to be a **** or anything, but eve has been like this forever, it will not change!"
4/15/2014,my point still stands.i will agree with you if your so called safe area does not allow people to mission or mine in it. you are affectively creating an area in highsec that is voided of any combat. which is complete against what eve is. you also realize that new players won't be the only ones that flock to those areas. come to think of it i actually think you will to.you mentioned finances as well. you do realize that ccp has sunk a lot of money into other developments right? don't tell people to google things. if you want to provide facts then provide don't come here with airy fairy remarks about things.for somebody that has been around since beta as you want us to believe. you seem to know very little. (edit: i just realized i said that realizing that other people have said it as well in your other threads.)perpetuum has been around for a while now. if their way of doing things is so good i am sure we would have heard a lot more about it by now as the eve killer. we have not.i am not wrong since you have not even proven your own point yet. i know ccp was in a hole but if you actually understand how corporate finances work you would not have made that statement.i am however are off the opinion arguing you with valid points is going to be pointless since you have proven in your other threads you are not interested what others think. so i will say this good luck and hopefully good riddance. this will never happen.. never.edit: the more i read your other responses the more it seems you are just trolling. good catch.
4/15/2014,"lilly naariplease stop making threads. you don't seem very knowledgeable about the game and your ideas about how the game works (or should work) are pretty bad at this point. 1.) highsec is not safe. it is safer than lowsec or nullsec, but it is not safe. 2.) highsec should not be safe. this game has succeeded for 10 years without the need for a completely secure area of space. why does it need one now or ever? 3.) concord is not there to save your ship. concord exists to destroy the ship of any law-breaker. you are the only one responsible for saving your ship, so always keep that in mind when you undock. 4.) suicide ganking, extorting miners and missioners, scamming, and being underhanded or heavyhanded is a legitimate part of this game. it is generally very easy to avoid these types of players, especially if you move to remote highsec, lowsec, or nullsec space. 5.) this is a ""survival of the fittest"", ""dog eat dog"" mmo. make friends, because the only safety you'll ever have is safety in numbers. even then, there is always a ""bigger fish"". finally, you can play the game anyway you want. however, you must account for the fact other players may interfere with your playstyle. you are not guaranteed to be left alone, no matter how much you may desire it."
4/15/2014,"*sigh* this one again*points to ultima online and ""trammel server""*while what you are proposing is not necessarily a ""second server"" the idea behind it is still the same and the effects of it would be too.- it will initially create a huge influx of new subs.- everyone who is smart will move their money making activities to the ""safer area"" - which will then distort and imbalance the in-game economy because everything is based more or less upon ship destruction and production and the safe area provides a place for production and use without the destruction part.- there will be less of a reason to work together with other people. people in ""safe zones"" have little reason to cooperate with others.- ""less secure"" places will become more depopulated as more and more people migrated to where most of the other players were (i.e. the ""safer server"").- you'll start cutting into one of the biggest draws for many dedicated players; the ruthlessness of it.now here is one of my favorite posts of all time on the forum"
4/15/2014,"i actually agree with that post. still isn't going to stop me presenting debates for solutions to others issues. i enjoy a good debate. even if in the end it's pointless, however since changes come from the forums all the time ""who knows""?"
4/15/2014,"it should be obvious that i'm in an npc corp on my main. to say that noobs are in npc corps is no more true than saying goonswarm or nc have noobs. npc corp is a place where players come to learn the game with a helpful (even if sometimes a little coarse) group of players who enjoys nurturing the new generation to this wonderful game.actually, eve is not a pvp game. it's a game where pvp is integral to the gameplay, but it's not focused on pvp. in fact, it'd be roughly accurate to say pve has as big of a role in eve online as pvp.eve online is a market simulator game. pvp creates the demand, pve creates the supply. without either side, the game would disintegrate in it's current form. in addition, eve is the best market simulator game out there - college people have graduated thanks to papers written on the topic of eve online.well, now we have a self-admitted troll. that's the first step in finding a cure for your problem. who knows, maybe you'll eventually become a warm-blooded, breathing person. until then, tho, gb2wow."
4/15/2014,"eve online is 80% industry (i consider pve as part of industry), 15% exploration, and 5% pvp. if you remove the industry from eve online, you remove the ability to play the game, as without such you would have no ships, no ammo, no mods, no nothing except for rookie ships and civilian mods. pvp simply perpetuates the cycle of economic decline or growth, as well as enforces the necessity of a continuous industrial backbone for corporations and alliances. no matter how much they choose to deny it, those care-bears they make fun of, are the reason they have ships to pvp with and gank them with, if the care-bears left eve, a single round of ammunition would cost billions of isk or more. 90% of all goods on the market are made in highsec, by carebear industrial corporations or players. just look at ccp's production track chart.i agree with the post because it has some merits, but like all things doesn't mean i 100% agree with it all, as you can see from my above post."
4/15/2014,"please note that i (and a few others) are using the term ""pvp"" in a more general sense not just ship on ship violence.when you mine asteroids you are denying others the ability to also mine asteroids.when you run missions and use lp to buy faction items you are increasing the supply of those items and devaluing it for everyone else.when you build ships, mods, and ammo you are increasing the supply of those items and devaluing it for everyone else.when you buy stuff you are denying someone else the sale and use of that item.when you supply someone with ships, mods, ammo you may be indirectly supporting others' actions against others (or even against yourself).when you do not supply someone with ships, mods, ammo you may be hampering the efforts of others to do what they want.when you put a pos or poco up you are affecting the efforts of others for better or worse in their activities.pvp is, in its purest sense, player versus player. conflict against others in some form or another because everyone is in competition with one another. this is the design of eve. this is why ""safe zones"" of any kind would not work in eve.you cannot take out the ability to wage certain types of conflict (in this case, ship on ship) because people do not like it but then allow people to wage other types of conflict with impunity (i.e. economic conflict). it's hypocritical.how is the warlord supposed to take out the economic base of his adversaries if war is not allowed in those areas? how can you stop a more massive force from becoming more massive if you cannot cut the supply lines?two more things1. a miner, industrialist, hualer, bp researcher, pos operator, etc. are not necessarily ""carebears."" that term is specifically reserved for people who do whatever they can to avoid anyone else in the game from interacting with them in a way they do not like (which they complain about).""true"" miners, industrialists, haulers, bp researchers, and pos operators understand that they are targets like everyone else because they affect everyone else in the game and they adapt accordingly.example:a freighter pilot is hauling goods from one place to another. his/her ship is filled with cargo equaling his/her ship's value. already this is pretty risky. he/she jumped into a system and then finds him/herself being bumped by a stabber and is eventually ganked.the carebear will fume about this and complain about how defenseless he/she is that his/her billion isk ship should not be dying to disposable million isk destroyers. the carebear will not change his/her mode of operation and carry on as usual because that's the way he/she wants to play and ""to hell with everyone else."" the carebear is ganked again at a later date using the same tactic.on the other hand, a good hauler pilot will first fume but then wonder how he/she was killed and if there is a way to defend him/herself. after some research and politely talking with the gankers themselves the ""good hauler"" finds out that avoidance is the best way to get around a gank. so the good hauler begins to carry cargo values much lower than the cost to gank him/her and/or carries items that would be too troublesome for the gankers to snatch and/or loads up his/her cargo with lots of low volume crap to confuse the cargo scanners of ganker scouts. and for those high-value hauls that simply cannot be avoided no problem. the good hauler pays or asks for a favor from a friend (or corpie) to hop in a hyena with two webs, challenge him/her to a duel (for limited engagement timer), and to web the freighter at each gate making the freighter warp less than 5 seconds after decloaking at each gate.the gankers never get a chance to bump or kill the ""good hauler.""2. one of the ""dirty little secrets"" about every combat pilot out there is that we all have industrial alts and/or know someone with one. most of us make, haul, or research our own stuff. we have to earn isk somehow, right?however most people don't exactly advertise this as it would just invite people to come over and complicate our lives.edit:from ccp's own ""new player guide""section 5.3: ""in eve online, any player may attack any other player if they choose to, no matter where they happen to be. this is because eve online is essentially a pvp (player versus player) game at its core."""
4/15/2014,"corp history has everything to do with consequences for your actions. if you awox, steal, or act like a jackass, the corp history allows your potentially new corp to ask your old corp what type of fuckup you are! also, you can see who you bought an item from after you made a purchase. i'm also a fan of making financial analysis agents (think locator agents to follow isk movement between players)."
4/15/2014,"employment history is used to identify alts, it is used to estimate a character's historical activities, and is used to identify their associates. sure, this may be bad for you, but so what. also, a high-sp character doesn't equate to a competent player. and a low sp character can beat a high sp character when they know what they are doing!"
4/15/2014,"so much this.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
4/15/2014,"while there are some space communes in the game, most groups pve to supplement their own wallet. i myself build ships, modules, and ammo for my nullsec corp, and put them on the market at near-jita prices. we have several members in my corp that regularly stock the market with reasonably priced goods (some as resellers, and others and producers like myself), making us far more relient on logistics than industrialists. i do not build locally, as i have yet have a reason to do so. i realize this is different than a large sov alliance which have many members that may mine the local roids providing access to cheaper minerals, as well as those that may experience lower pos operating costs, but these costs savings often aren't worth the risks which only exist at the graces of others. perhaps i'm too small time with my indy toons, but i know what my industrial needs are and i get them met more efficiently in highsec than in nullsec. also, if someone is calling you a carebear, it is not simply because you are risk adverse: carebear is more than just risk adverse. everyone in this game limits the risks to their assets, because they will lose them if they don't. no, carebear is much more than that: for example, running missions in highsec doesn't make you a carebear. a carebear will run missions while not only ingoring the reality that other players can still attack you in highsec, but then raging if/when it happens with claims that ccp/concord should prevent it. for example, mining in highsec doesn't make you a carebear. a carebear mines roids believing they have a fundamental right to do so without interference, and then flips out when someone stops them from mining until they pay a protection racket fee. for example, hauling goods from point a to point b through highsec doesn't make you a carebear. a carebearl hauls valuable goods expecting undisruptable movement across highsec, only to cry on the forums that someone destroyed their ship to steal/loot their valuable cargo. for example, buying goods and reselling them for profit doesn't make you a carebear. a carebear trader incorrectly assumes all buy orders are guaranteed, and flips out when they find incompleteable buy orders exist specifically to lure them into buying overpriced, slow moving assets they can't make a profit on. for example, manufacturing goods in this game doesn't make you a carebear. a carebear expects everything they build to be profitable, and complains about how unfair it is others have cheaper sources of materials or rare limited edition blueprints. for example, being in a noob corp doesn't make you a carebear. a carebear refuses to leave the noobcorp because they can't cope with the knowledge that in player run corps your corpmates may attack you without concord intervention. fundamentally, a carebear is someone that believes they deserve to operate in a risk-free, immune to non-consensual pvp environment."
4/15/2014,"you are grossly mistaken here. a.) a logistics player can bring items in at an affordable rate, and the only protection they need is recon prior to lighting a noobship cyno. there is no way in hell i'd sit around a belt for 4 hours watching hulks mine. i fully expect those hulks to get safe, swap to combat vessels, and help fend off any gangs in the area. b.) in this day and age, major sov wars are won and lost by attrition of wills, not attrition of resources. smaller scale sov wars are won by overwhelming force, not by attrition of resources. if logistics was nerfed into the ground, making it much harder to supply a region from empire, your day may come. until then, your contribution will be classified as ""a nice size"". c.) please, buy my market out... i'll just restock the market again and enjoy the profits. your economic threat has little meaning to most nullsec entities. d.) perhaps i'm not a ""real industrialist"". i generally have <20b in non-ship sell orders, i generally have only two toons producing, i vary my production between items rather than producing at max efficiency, and i typically don't harvest resources myself (other than pi). at the same time, i'm ceo of a decent sized nullsec pvp corp and i can tell you that in the current environment we need players to move items from highsec to our local market. we need players to stock the markets and contracts. having in-house industrialists to produce items ""cheaper"" is one of those nice-to-have power window options that aren't nearly as important as you seem to think. from my experience, the health of a alliance is almost entirely measured in how much content does your alliance generate for your members. a strong industrial wing is not essential to the majority of playstyles."
4/15/2014,"1. a logistics player can yes, and the industrialist can simply buy them and stockpile forcing the price up repeatedly until the logistics player can't cope with it.orif i'm feeling frisky, i would just make everything dirt cheap, it would be a loss to me in the short run, but in the long run he would have to match my prices at the lower rate or fail to make money at which point i would continually buy his now cheap stuff and list it higher. then when the time was right, strip the market and force your alliance to pay top dollar or risk loosing your jf's to the invading alliances patrols and hot drops doing ferry runs.as you can see your logistical pilot, having limited income and resources, would eventually cave one way or another. thus forcing an alliance to do and pay what i desire anyway.the key here is industrialist think and play eve like chess, thinking several moves ahead of you and your alliance and planing for alternate outcomes of events and situations. whereas most pvp pilots and alliance leaders think days and weeks ahead and on occasion a month or 2, industrialist think months and years ahead, and have multiple redundancies to their plans and setups. we think about the bigger picture, and how to control the fate of all involved.2. on attrition of wills. you may want to ask yourself what causes this, because in the end the answer is always individual wealth. an alliance generally does not pay for 100% of the members incomes and ships and fittings. at some point in time the member has to fend for themselves in this regard. and it is the members unwillingness to continue to lose isk and fork over ship after ship in losses, that causes the loss of will, as you put it.an industrialist that is good at his job can usually (but not always) extend this life and desire by simply supplying the alliance with inexpensive materials, and ships and ammo.2b. on the other hand for smaller alliances the industrialist can make it exceedingly expensive for an enemy alliance larger or not to take their space. while yes you are correct the smaller alliance will be overwhelmed and ran out. they will generally have become rich during the process and simply move to a better area, as the enemy was most likely buying from the smaller alliances market and paying the exorbitant prices in their region to replace their lost ships. meaning that while yes the smaller alliance lost their current space, they became wealthy doing it.war can make even the poorest popper wealthy, and even the smallest entity a giant, with proper economic manipulation. who cares about space ownership? if your alliance becomes rich beyond its dreams while losing space, do you really care about some rinky dink system? not to mention with the prices your enemy is paying in your region, they are weakening themselves financially. so as they become weaker, you become stronger. and a strong financial backing is the first key to success.continued in next post:"
4/15/2014,"2c. it's not about buying your market out. it's about forcing you to make inconvenient decisions, at the right moment which in turn causes catastrophic failure for your alliance on multiple fronts. buying your market out is something i would do only once i knew you did not have the resources to replace it. you can have all the isk in the world, but it does you no good if your logi pilots don't make it up to restock, or if the enemy attacking you is depleting your ships and weapons faster then you can replace them. let me give you an example:an enemy fleet is attacking your home system, they already have their sov blockers up and you are fighting to stop them, but for whatever reason the battle is going badly and you;ve lost a lot of ships. your not particularly worried because you know your home station has everything you need to continue and win the fight on the market, and youve made sure of it.but.... suddenly you notice when your pilots start coming out in crappy ships something is wrong.. you check the market only to realize too late that every single worthwhile ship needed to continue the fight is gone. you immediately tell your entire fleet to come to the station so you can hand out the back up ships you have stored in your corporate hangers, but this extra time has allowed the enemy to blockade your sov.you manage to push them out, but just barely and you take heavy losses doing it.* the next day they are back, this time they strike during your downtime, but your secure in the knowledge that you reseeded your market, and replaced the losses from the day before. however once again you look at the market and everything you just did is gone, this time due to the lack of resources, your alliance fails to mobilize and the system is lost.you see, i know exactly what i am doing. and in this example, i just killed your alliances home system. i don;t care if you made billions from it. your alliance is crippled, and your enemy just bought from me, everything i bought from you. they are now well supplied, in shiny new ships fully weaponized, while your alliance in deep 0.0 is struggling to mobilize and retain any type of force as your supplies are gone, and you have few if any surviving ships.you see you can have trillions of isk, and tons of pilots, but all things are based on time, and if you do not have the right resources at the right time, you die. and trillions of isk and tons of pilots do you no good if those pilots do not have ships with which to fight. and your isk is useless if you do not have a market in range with which to buy from.....as i said, the true industrialist is the real terror of eve, or the savior. in this example i could have just as easily saved your alliance, as crippled it. and nothing you can do can stop an industrialist from doing either, should they so chose. everyone is at the mercy of the economy save those who control it. the real trick is to know how to use your enemies strength and turn it into a weapon against them. yours is your self sufficiency. your weakness is your belief that it can't be touched. i just took your strength and made it your enemies. and took your weakness and exploited it.the end result was the loss of your home system. and while yes there are many things you could have done to counter such, as i said before it's all about timing, and what actions are taken in response to such.3. 20 billion average is not a bad number honestly, there's quite a bit you can do with that. assets are what you really want though rather then liquid currency.* assets are for supply and defense and you should only ever have 25% of your assets on the market when playing this ""war"" game. the rest you should hold in reserve. but even that is not a guarantee of success, it just means you might last longer, which that in itself might guarantee you success. just remember things not sold on the market to ""your"" alliance count as a loss, not a gain, even if sold. as those are resources a possible enemy now holds and can use against you.* currency is for attack"
4/15/2014,"or, you have your logi bro's sell fitted ships via alliance/corp only contracts, thus ensuring no market fuckwittery. this thread says otherwise.""in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" - d. adams."
4/15/2014,"that would only work for a small alliance based in a very small area. due to limitation of # of alliance contracts allowed. the market is 10's of 1000's of orders across an entire region. and there are ways in which i could deal with that as well. so no, there would still be market fuckwittery as you put it, and an ""alliance"" industrialist is still necessary to combat such effectively.prove it. the point is, is that every alliance needs at least one industrialist (and possibly their crew if they have one), preferably more then one, the issue your going to find is as i said, one that actually wants to join you."
4/15/2014,"my expereince in 0.0 says otherwise. with jf's runs (usually done in corp) and alliance level contracts i have very, very rarely used the market. burden of proof. you are making the claim that you know what you are doing, i disagree. its up to you to prove it, not me.""in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" - d. adams."
4/15/2014,"fair enough, i can't argue with your personal experiences other then to point out this is just you on a small scale with your corp mainly (at least i gather from your statement). and again like i said depending on your alliance it may work just fine, this method is excellent for smaller alliances, doesn't work so well with larger ones though, unfortunately.[/quote]well, honestly that could go both ways, i am not actually making any claims here, save that i from my own experiences know what i am talking about, the individual i originally quoted said null alliances were looking for industrialists. i was originally simply pointing out why we were so hard to find and recruit. being an industrialist myself, (though honestly i left 0.0 behind a while back), i know from experience why i choose not to join or help any of the null bear alliances, and that's basically what i stated from my experiences and perspective.in the end everyone has their own experiences to rely on, and each individuals perception of the cause of something, is probably different."
4/15/2014,"your ignorance is overwhelming here! the jf pilot that stocks the market gets paid when you buy out their items. you do it regularly, the simply increase the costs to make it worth their time. you also cannot touch corp contracts, which adequately supply many moderately sized corps. and if we are referring to sov nullsec, where you cannot dock in the enemy station, what are you going to do with your billions and billions in stockpiled goods you cannot access other than remote sell / contracts? you will run out of isk far more quickly than that jf runs out of energy, especially since you are paying him every time you buy out the market. to top it off, players can simply ask on coms, does anyone have xyz in their hangar, and have it sold to them via station trading (which is also something i often do). now your just trolling. you cannot compete with someone if you cannot get your goods into their station. do you know what the staging system of your enemy is a year in advance, before they conquer it, while it is accessible? i think not. with your self-entitled, i'm-so-important-to-the-game mentality, protect-me-so-i-can-mine-in-peace mentality, do you really wonder why you get ridiculed? in then end, it is not ""individual wealth"" that causes the attrition of wills. fyi: most people in this game aren't terrible concerned with wealth. people want enough for fun toys to use and lose, but that doesn't require enormous wealth as making isk in this game is trivial. attrition of wills happens through cockblocking, structure bashing, and being on the wrong side of a slaughter. why would the conquering alliance by overpriced goods? they can bring in their own materials at at a decent price. and anything left behind is stuck where you can only remotely access it. the conquered alliance usually takes a loss when they lose their space, not profits. have you ever been to nullsec or partaken in sov warfare?"
4/15/2014,"i assume that was rhetorical, we all can make an educated guess based on the contents of this very thread.""in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" - d. adams."
4/15/2014,"1.) actually on number i miss typed heit wasn't supposed to say that i simply forgot to edit it. my point with that is you can make his trips worthless, by placing your own items of the same type on the market lower in price then his, ensuring that his do not sell, and yours do. thus he loses money, in addition you can also hike up the price of jump fuel in his home departure region making his jumps more expensive and his profits less. sure he can spend another couple of hours running 40 jumps to jita for fuel, but time is money and that's a waste of time i'll make good use of. * i know when an enemy is encroaching on space yes, and i can make assumptions based on their movements, or if need be i can pay someone for information on their plans, well ahead of when they are actually going to happen and be ready for it. so yes. i can. everyone has their price.* you miss the point, when i can build everything in the game my goods are always at the station. in addition i can use services like redfrog for example, to get me whatever i desire there. i never even have to undock. and the frog services are generally always blue with the vast majority of nullsec alliances. i simply take advantage of your own transport services and use them against you. if need be i'll stick an alt account in your alliance and use your own logi pilot to bring me my stuff.* i don't mine. you seem to have missed that part. most industrialists simply buy the minerals off market at cheaper prices then their intrinsic values. non of those things would matter if an individual simply had the time and resources to replace them though. so yes it is a matter of personal wealth. granted being overwhelmed is discouraging and seeing your **** constantly blown up is also. but then again, if you had the resources pilots and ships to form a proper defense, your **** wouldn't be getting blown up now would it? [/quote]who said ""they"" were over priced? i didn't i simply stated that they bought from me what i bought from you. maybe i raised the price a tad say 5% to make me a little profit, that's not over priced though. if you mean a smaller alliance being overwhelmed selling them that at those prices, well the answer is simple. people buy for convenience. it's a lot easier to pay that extra 10 mil for a bc now, then to wait a day or so to bring one up from highsec or your home system. people are lazy, and people with money are willing to pay for what they want, when they want it, at whatever price it's available at. that's just basic consumer marketing.* yes i was in razor during the bob tri wars. and remained in that coalition (though i joined morsis mihi and later hydra afterwords). so yes, i lived in 0.0 for over 5 years, never even came to highsec. and i lived in a c4 for 2 years after they were released. and only left it twice, maybe 3 times during those 2 years (i love wormholes, not sure why ""shrugs""). i only recently moved to highsec within the last 2-3 years, and mainly because i got bored with null and the politics. so you could say i guess, that i retired to highsec.i remember when pos's controlled sov. and when you had to meticulously destroy the enemies and anchor your own and maintain them, and protect them to maintain your hold on space.do you?"
4/15/2014,"redfrog only delivers to highsec. blackfrog is not blue to the majority of nullsec (the found of blackfrog is in my corp). and i'd like to point out, that you just implied you'd need logistics pilots to move your stuff to the frontlines. that is why nullsec generally needs logistics pilots, while industrialists are simply ""nice to have"". furthermore, the s.o.p. for sov nullsec is to deny docking rights to neutrals and hostiles. this makes it very hard to move goods into a station, making it very hard for your to produce **** in an ""enemy"" station. and finally, the station owners can block your access to the science and industry services within a station, which further gimps what you can do to compete wtih the locals, even if you do have the supplies in station to build your stuff. your hole argument is so full of holes it makes swiss cheese look solid."
4/15/2014,"lol, you might be surprised at how many alliances do not restrict services, thinking restricting docking rights is sufficient.* you seem to miss the part where i clearly stated:""if need be i'll simply put an alt account in your alliance"". i have not been unknown in the past to train an alt up on a clean account for 6 months before joining my target alliance. so yea. you will never know its me. hell i'll even join fleets and pvp with you all and be a ""good"" supportive member. on that character anyway....with that, i'll have full access to everything any for your alliance members do, including and not limited to, docking rights, factory, refinery, etc. as an added bonus, i'll know all of your pos location, your shield pw's, your convoy routs, and much much more. you think for a second i wouldn't use those against you to further the needs of my actual alliance (which is probably the one attacking you in that example i gave you).? and when it is all said and done you will never know it was me. for throughout the entire thing i will remain supportive on that character, and will eventually leave in good standings. even though it was that character that allowed your enemy to destroy you.welcome to eve online.also i can place buy orders on the market, and purchase items from the market, whether you have restricted services or not. i do it all the time."
4/15/2014,"so now, to be effective as an industrial superstar:  you need knowledge of your enemies movements prior to them setting up their staging systems.  you need alts in your enemy alliances, so you can smuggle resources in.  you need logistics to make your industrial superstar plays possible.  you need massive resources to buy out your enemy's market.  you need sentries to protect your mining ships.... and for this, you provide cheap/free ships, eliminate the needs of logistics (oh wait, maybe not), and undermine their enemies by market manipulation. all we need is an attitude change to appreciate your superhero abilities. sorry if we don't jump on the loony bus with you. your response has been noted, now we'll let the thread die."
4/15/2014,"um.. no.all you need is the ability to supply your alliance with needed goods and manage their market / protect it from other enemy industrialists / marketers, and provide inexpensive affordable ships and goods on it.the rest of that stuff was just rp, and which if you can do in certain circumstances, great. most people can't, and admittedly i delved a bit into the bo area of eve as i have a lot of experience with that as well.on the needs, yes you have needs, do you need someone else to do them for you? not really. you can buy and sell on the market whether you have access to station services or not. you can always place buy orders and work with that from scratch. but if your enterprising you'll find a way to make an area work for you, and whatever alliance happens to be in said area.if your in an alliance great. if not, great, doesn't really matter.the whole point here was simply to point out that there is a reason alliances have a difficult time finding industrialists who are willing to help them. i simply pointed out the reasons why they do not wish to join you all. if you want to change that then change it if not, stop whining about how you can't recruit them."
4/15/2014,i actually read that in angry sean connery voice (tm)
4/15/2014,"do you mean that he (and the terribad attention-craving blogger) are both entitled to attend all the csm summits as they placed 1st and 2nd in the last election? if so, working as intended."
4/15/2014,"no i mean permanent as in even if they are not voted in they still retain their postions on the council, as is obvious by the huge bold letter that say say ""permanent attendee / csm"" next to their names on the list.being a ""current"" member because you won an election, is not the same as being a ""permanent member"".granted goonswarm will never lose the election as they basically own ccp these days, but still, listing it publicly even if you do rig the election is just ********."
4/15/2014,"welcome to eve!the csm is literally one sided with ccp and it always will be!i'm very impressed that mynnna is even running a campaign! might as well say ""i'm getting in regardless of what anyone says, don't bother."""
4/15/2014,"you keep using that word, i do not think it means what you think it means. mynna is a permanent attendee, not a permanent member. if they were a permanent member, do you really think we'd have a ballot option to vote for them? all csm members are elected to the csm. there are no permanent player positions on the csm. members with a large fan base (like prominent cfc members with 25,000 players supporting them), will routinely get voted onto the csm. that's how a democracy works."
4/15/2014,"and? whats the difference? if he or she has a permanent spot there, then she is free while there to sew her or his sides influence among the other csm. so no, there is no difference between an attendee and a member. beyond words. the result is the same. someone who was not voted into the csm is still present and able to influence the csm.if she is always voted in great, i could give a rats ass less, but the day she isn't and for whatever reason shows up to the council like she was, that's wrong, and that's really my point."
4/15/2014,"i'm trying to be civil, and not make fun of you. please read the following, and become educated. in the future, please do a little research on the topics you are posting on so you have an informed opinion, rather than perpetuating rumors and unsubstantiated bullshit.  all members of the csm must be voted onto the csm every election cycle.  there are 14 members of the csm, determined by the stv voting system.  there are 2 of the 14 members designated as permanent attendees, again determined by the stv voting system. from the csm whitepaper: now, apologize for making such an ill informed post and request the thread be locked as to not perpetuate your misinformed statements."
4/15/2014,"you just basically proved exactly what i was saying is correct. those 2 are permanent attendees at every summit and meeting or gathering. while the others are not. why even have a full csm councile if only 2 people are going to be able to express their opinions in totality? also there should be a limit to how many consecutive terms an ""alliance, or organization"" can serve on the council. in order to maintain a fair representation of all of the individuals, corporations, and alliances in eve."
4/15/2014,"are you for real?all csm members are elected. the highest rankings of the elected (most votes) csm members must always be present at both summit meetings. once again if it has not sunk in yet. the 2 highest ranking members of the elected csm must be permanent fixtures at both summits. you do know how they choose the highest ranking members right? i am sure you do since as you mentioned, you have been around since the beta.if you wanti can go buy some crayons and it for you if it will help make you understand.are you just picking the part you want to be true and ignoring everything else? it is not that hard to understand.and with your last statement... now you suddenly move the goal post as other have mentioned before. what game are you playing at?"
4/15/2014,"how unfair is it that the two most popular candidates among all voters are welcome at all meetings. should we shun the majority of eve players and put the not-so-popular minority at the all meetings? and qq some more about csm members not getting enough of a voice: gee... if only the other csm members could attend these meetings by remote video. gee... if only the other csm members could present their viewpoints directly to ccp in the csm forum section, or im channels. gee... if only the other csm members were invited to attend the meetings based on job performance and experience relative to the topics. and as for term limits: why? so the capable, competent, and active members of the csm have to step down? i could see implementing this suggestion if pisspoor csm members kept getting reelected, but the truth is the csm is doing a pretty good job, and they have regular new blood. so your term limits really will do more harm than good."
4/15/2014,gizznitt...there is no point. every time somebody points out the obvious they add another ridiculous statement in the hopes it makes their point valid. he is not interested in what others thinks or has to say not to mention his knowledge for somebody that has been around since beta seems extremely limited.at this point and though all the other threads he started it is evident he is just trolling.
4/15/2014,pretty much.../thread
4/15/2014,"um.. you just repeated what i said.i simply added that i think there needs to be a limit on consecutive terms, and a limit on lifetime terms, for each alliance, and or corporation or organization."
4/15/2014,there you do it again. you were focusing on a single person who is always elected making it sound like she is a permanent member. just because she gets elected as grizznitt pointed out does not mean she is permanent. the day people decide not to vote for she wont be. but that is not what you said. you were under the false idea that she was a permanent member of the csm regardless of votes.now suddenly you have forgotten that trivial detail after you were proven wrong in your original thread and now suddenly have a problem with the two most popular members being selected to always be at the summit. move post much? can't you stick to you original assertion?
4/15/2014,"ccp disagrees, which is why they removed term limits back around the time of csm 4 or 5."
4/15/2014,"just because i realize i misunderstood something, and once figuring it out, noticed another issue, does not mean i am going to not post about it. i despise politics, because honestly their pointless. as those in power will always be those with the most money and members. and therefore any movement political or otherwise will always be biased toward the most powerful entities desires. the same problem that exists in capitalism, exist in every democratic system.power corrupts.absolute power, corrupts absolutelynot a single one of the csm members do not have their own wants and desires in mind, of which will better their alliances and or corps in their own way regardless of the outcome to others.change effects everyone, what is good for one, is bad for another, and vice versa. the only time this is false is when a decision can resolutely have a positive effect on everyone involved, which is an impossibility. this being the case individuals delude themselves into believing that what is good for them is good fro everyone. much like religion does. when in fact the very opposite is generally the truth.many people on these forums have made excellent suggestions for in game additions. but the major powers that be if deciding they personally would be damaged by such, even if the game as a whole would be improved, strike them down with majority vote coming form their singular source."
4/15/2014,"oh you wan't an fight system. ok here my 2 cents.so eve is futuristic game so we can make an virtual realy sim on stationfor capsuleer it's no diffeence it is in ship or in vr we can simulate anything from mine colony defence , gate assaults to camps even large scale fleet battles ships to this system however should be scanned from ships in your inventoryyou can make que's 5 v 5 10 v 10 etc all is up to you .but biggest problem i see that eve hasn't collision or los so you can't outmanuver enemyall you can is to play with it's tracking and spider tank"

4/16/2014,"griefing is against the rules. if you have any information in this regard and can show that griefing is in fact taking place, then please contact ccp with your concerns.the forum is not the place for this.you should also do well, by replying to any posts in their original thread. also having a modicum of knowledge on the subject at hand, will help before posting.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
4/16/2014,"excellent start to a new thread, ignorance in the first line! you clearly have no clue about what eve is. high sec is not safe, its not supposed to be safe and it is in no way, shape or form meant to somehow magically shield you from other players. if this is what you expect from eve then you are playing the wrong game.then go play perpetuum and stop trying to make eve into another game. eve is meant to be harsh, you are supposed to take responsibility for your own actions and choices and deal with the consequences accordingly. not whine at ccp to change game mechanics to protect you like some kind of petulant child.indeed, statistics and maths do not lie. eve has grown, year on year for 10 years with its current <U+FFFD>harsh<U+FFFD> mechanics. statistical proof that ccp have made the right choice in keep eve hash and unforgiving. unless you have actual subscriber statistics to prove your point then all you have is opinion and conjecture.

4/16/2014,"<3it is more true. npc corps are literally where new players are put, and it requires a concious choice and action to leave one. it physically cannot happen that a new player joins the game and magically finds themself in a player corp at the losing end of a wardec.there may be as many pve activities as there are pvp activities, but the game is focused on pvp. that is why pvp in some can occur essentially anywhere, whether a pve player wants it or not.market is pvp too."

4/16/2014,"which is, inherently, the core reason why corruption exists because of politics: when an uninformed and uninterested electorate does not actively participate in the political process or disdains the political process due to negative exposure. the only way to prevent the ""pointlessness"" of politics is actual, active participation in the system, not burying your head in the sand and walking away. which is also, hilariously enough, the same reason capitalism is viewed as being corruptible by those who disdain it or only passively participate in its course."
4/16/2014,"just remind me again who was the biggest advocate for the tech nerf?i really am starting to think that this ""person"" is in fact a doomsdale alt.""in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."" - d. adams."
4/16/2014,except that that is not what it means. mynnna has to be voted in the same as anyone else. there is no such thing as an unelected csm member.mynnna was first elected on to csm8. he hasn't served on any previous csms.
4/16/2014,"the problem with this is that it's simply not true. it's a prime example of ""truthiness"" - something that sounds as if it should be true, but is in fact complete rubbish with no factual basis whatsoever.""truthiness is a quality characterizing a ""truth"" that a person making an argument or assertion claims to know intuitively ""from the gut"" or because it ""feels right"" without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts.[1]"""

4/17/2014,"launch space is limited to 500m3 now, and the time between launches (1 hr now?) limits the total amount that can be exported this way. i see it more of a check on pocos that seek to close a planet off completely by setting an ridiculous tax rate, but it would definitely serve new players who have relatively low volume per day. in our area lately, i'm seeing pocos with a 55% tax rate - we are not even going to bother with planets like that (unless it is to destroy the poco and cost the tax gouging bastages some cash)."

4/17/2014,"me, i type goodbye in fleet and then click my own name as it appears in fleet chat-->leave fleetm"
4/17/2014,"ok, i love answering a decent troll because sometimes there are some truthiness bits mixed in that others may accidentally mistake for truth itself.1) politics is pointless because it is a 'fixed game' i honestly think (sometimes) that this little gem is encouraged by the people with money and power so they can disenfranchise the masses through learned apathy. why vote, let us just run things for you.bull. if you want to run, run. if someone you think is the right person for the job then support them, instead. if there is power in a democratic system then it is there for the taking. but it is easier to complain that the race is fixed and the decisions already made than to step in and get your hands dirty. i challenge anybody to tell me what power block or 'big money' got me onto the csm8 council.2) power corrupts. so if the game wasn't rigged then the people we elected will soon be so crooked that it will not make a difference how they got there in the first place. that would eb a telling point except for the wee little detail of the csm being an advisory council and representation of the players with no true power. so with no power we cannot be corrupt, right? wrong, i love logic and the fallacies there in. we are as corrupt or clean as we are when we started. no more, no less. which leads me to my favourite.3) somebody gets hurt if there is change. well, somebody often gets hurt without the change. in ancient times surgeons were not doctors because of the 'do no harm' clause. we got over that one realizing that a long term beneficial game may involve some pain and sacrifice up front. few changes can be made to the game that will be 'good for everyone'. so we try to advise ccp to the find the better good. not the perfect move but good ones. we look at changes from all the different viewpoints that we can bring to the table. from mynnna with his expertise in hi-finance in low places to mine in casual play and just faking it as you play a game.game . . . you know, this hobby/obsession of ours? supposed to be fun. for me, it is. hope the same goes for you and i have been and am still trying to keep it that way.m"
4/17/2014,"i think the confusion is the choice of the term ""permanent"" inferring never ending member. a more accurate title should be ""priority member"" as this member has priority in attendance over the rest on the csm."

4/18/2014,"lolwe as in those of us that fly sb's:we all know that flying an sb is cake.we all know that an sb puts out as much dps as a battleship (relitively speaking) at 50km range, doing 4kmpswe all know that it doesn't take days to find someone to kill. ( 5 minuets really)we all also know that 0.0 for the most part is empty space with very few gate camps and ""bubbles"" as you put it.we all also know that you can go from highsec to an enemy home system in 0.0 in about 10-20 minuets.we all also know that flying a defenseless hulk which costs around 300+ million, in a 0.0 system with 50 people in it, which is defenseless and dies like kindling on a roaring flame, is a lot more of a risk, then an sb pilot in a 50 mil (max) ship, who can cloak aproach target volley, bomb, and warp out all in 5-6 seconds and kill things.so no. the sb / cloaker pilot is not even remotely taking a risk. in fact your target is a free kill. i should know, i have plenty of them. and most were in 0.0 systems that had 25-50+ people in them.if your taking days to find people to kill or worried about gate camps... well... i'd advise you find another profession, because being an sb pilot isn't the right one for you, and it means you know nothing about them, or how to fly them."
4/18/2014,"your scenario is improbable, and to expect this as a common occurance i believe goes too far.you found a fool mining unprotected, in most likely an npc null system, and you think this defines the entire experience in null?do you seriously believe the rest of us have no experience with which to compare these claims, and see them for the novelty event it really is?or maybe you expect us to think you reliably find that many fools in exhumers operating without a clue... anything is possible, but shooting fish in a barrel sounds more challenging than beating someone in a defenseless ship.how your alleged target got the isk together, and moved into null, and then promptly forgot how to not get killed in eve... that's the real mystery.expecting this as a normal play experience is not sustainable, precisely because your target's existence the way you described it is not self sustaining.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

4/19/2014,"to this end i can say this. i have on two separate occasions been caught in a belt in null in my hulk. the sb solo could not break my tank, nor could i his as his first bomb took my drones. first timesecond time he was able to take range from my drones but still unable to break my tank. every other occasion a cyno was lit.in both occurrences neither party had a reasonable chance of success. i have (not on this toon) caught a bs ratting in my sb and soloed him into structure, his friends showed and saved him. however they did not catch me either. while the exchange was fun in reality neither of us had a reasonable chance of success. that is all i have to say about that. seraph you know as well as i that sb are effective in pvp in a group. solo and with threat of force projection that current mechanics allow for a cloaked vessel, can be and is abused. i realize there is no possible outcome that will make everyone happy, i am seeking solutions that help encourage active game play and allow a balance that will be better for both sides, encouraging an engagement with a fruitful outcome"
4/19/2014,"hey i want to chime in with two cents here.regardless of whether you're on one side and feel you shouldn't have to worry about whether someone is actually at the keyboard or not, or on the other side and feel that people who don't come out when there's a neutral in system are cowards, or any of the positions that are similar or fall somewhere in between, here's the facts.when someone is afk cloaking, they're probably off playing another game. by nature, they're encouraged to do so, since just sitting in a system waiting for someone to maybe come out is rather boring.when someone is afk cloaking in a system, the natural reaction of the inhabitants is to treat him with caution and never assume he really is afk. that, in turn, causes the player or players living there to be more likely to log off and go do something else. whether this is a reasonable choice or the choice of a coward or whatever is utterly irrelevant, as it is a fact.in other words, what we have with all the mechanics surrounding afk cloaking is a game system that, regardless of design intent, is causing people to log out of eve and go play other games.now how ****ing stupid is that?so. i believe there should absolutely be a way to harass ratters, miners, people out doing pve in space, and ways to catch and kill the unwary. conversely, i believe that those who are wary and vigilant should be difficult to catch. i believe that means should be available to simultaneously encourage a pve pilot to stay on field and fight instead of flee and reward them for choosing to do so/punish them for fleeing... the ess is a pretty decent example of this. unfortunately, as it stands, the definition of ""wary"" is far too low thanks to how local works (note: simply removing it is not the solution), there's little in the way to encourage someone to choose to stand and fight, and even if they do, the nature of eve pve tends to require specialized fits that do not hold up well in pvp, making that choice a death sentence. address those things with a revamp to local & intel gathering, more reasons to stand and fight, and a pve revamp to bring pvp and pve closer together and you're most of the way there. finish it off by adding some means of hunting down cloaked ships, balanced such that those that are active and wary (the same requirement we're imposing on ratters) can evade detection but the unwary or afk die in a fire, and we've got a solved problem.simple, right?"
4/19/2014,"you have grasped the exact premise of this thread. it makes me happy that an active member of the csm has chimed in and recognized the issue. any changes that will encourage active game play over afk or logging out is a must. in this thread various contributors have put forth several various solutions, all three of the main contributors have in their own ways, brought to the point that no one single change will help or balance the issue. some of the proposed changes found in the last published csm minutes go along way towards this. the only thing i personally have found lacking is the addition of an alternative action based intel gathering system. even with delayed local both sides need better intel of who is in what ship where or if there is even a ship. thank you for listening and i hope that you will continue to input here.ps: the above statement in no way intends to or changes how i feel about goons as a whole. in keeping tabs on the csm i believe that mynnna has put the needs of the game before the needs of the goons .... at least i hope so :)"
4/19/2014,"simple....if only this was the case.we actually have a significant number voicing the opinion that the blue donut's very existence should preclude any need to do more than man a gate camp, and possibly anchor a cyno jammer.once these are done, they seem to effectively want very dull pve play, where mining and ratting are immune from sustained threat short of a massive sov claiming fleet.i understand many players view pve as the necessary evil to be overcome, so they can do other things in eve that are not self sustaining with isk for them.but i find their desire to keep their perceived timesink to a minimum is actually dumbing down what i want to enjoy about the game, clever play in ships not requiring massive hordes to operate with.mining, and equally ratting, are valid primary play interests, and deserve interesting interaction mechanics.this game can be the anti-wow, and make the perceived grinding of other games into so much more than somnolent drudgery.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/19/2014,"yes! this is a miner i can support. this mechanic must work both ways though, just to be fair."

4/20/2014,"stealth bombers are tech 2 frigate size ships, therefore should have a specialized role.a) they already have very good torpedo bonuses, that can deal with battleships and battlecruisers (4 ! bonuses: torpedo explosion velocity, flight time, torpedo velocity and damage).why do they need an extra weapon to kill battleships/cruisers; bombs with an explosion radius of 400 and 3000 velocityb) bombs should not be a weapon to clear of drones (incl fighters / fighter bombers) of the grid because this makes stealth bombers overspecialized, they also have the ability to fit covert ops (with 100% targeting delay after decloaking) and can use covert ops cyno's.i propose that stealth bombers should be re-balanced asap and that bombs should be used to counter capital ship hulls only,and have the stats on bombs reversed; 3000 explosion radius and 400 velocity (with covert ops level bonus to velocity and damage)"

4/21/2014,"i had another suggestion brought to me in game. i think there are both pros and cons to it. anchorable module - similar mechanics to i hub it can be upgraded with different modules. lore: module is similar to concord technology used to monitor criminal activity by capsuleers. 1.0 - 0.8 owned by empire faction and would be at max level.0.7-0.6 owned by empire faction but not fully maxed - ship types, cloaked vessels excluded.(concord can already see cloaked vessels) 0.5 - 0.1 owned by empire faction but upgradeable by capsulers, destructible with faction standing loss0.0 - -1.0 anchorable by capsuleer organization with sov only, destructible.npc null space by npc faction and is upgradable. destructible, with faction standing lossui - works with auto scan, d scan and probe scan in addition to what's already in place. could be an additional tab.this module opens a system scan depending on upgrades from instant scans to 5 min delayed scan of pilot beacons in system.upgraded to include ship types dependent on level of sov and upgrade affect accuracy and update timeupgrade to include cloaked vessel type only dependant on level of sov and upgrade affect accuracy and update time upgrade to include boost to combat scan probe of a faction variant that will allow location of cloaked vessels within 100 km - 15 kmaccuracy affected by level of upgrade and level of sovthis is the general idea, i think it has merit but i know it also has drawbacks. so far it is the most balanced idea i have been presented with. i ask you all for your opinions."
4/21/2014,"null, to me is about pure effort.because null has two very distinct sides to play, i would split the intel along these lines as well.basing intel off of one side, and letting the other be unable to respond with it's own level, ends up favoring one direction in a manner which hurts gameplay, i feel.you could call one side strategic, and have it relate to massive fleet actions.you could call the other side tactical, and have it relate to small group operations.both need to be vulnerable to their level of activity, effectively meaning tactical would be vulnerable to everything, but also be the easiest to establish or restore once lost.i made a system like this already, which i am happy to repost here if desired. it's not too long compared to many others.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/21/2014,"agreed, i think the intention was that once in place the system would work for all pilots regardless of if they lived there or not. nikk i like you idea as well, please repost and give comparisons. they are similar in goal but use different methods to get there."
4/21/2014,"i would be happy to do so.have local operate in degrees of quality.give it two dimensions for this as well.dimension one, quantity of intel.dimension two, quality of intel.dimension one, would give ship numbers, then types, finally pilot names.dimension two, would give presence of neutrals, reduce delay to zero, then give presence of cloaked vessels.dimension one structures, which would be harder targets, would be pos add ons.dimension two structures, which would be easier targets meant for roams or smaller gangs, would be only in open space away from overview beacon items. these would need to be scanned down.examples:dimension 1: level 3dimension 2: level 3full list of pilot names, with faction tag visible.ship type listed next to name, highlighted if cloaking active.dimension 1: level 3dimension 2: level 0full list of pilot names, with ship type next to name.no faction standings listed, not defining cloak status.all updates delayed by 30 to 60 seconds, (balance adjusting by devs)dimension 1: level 1dimension 2: level 3no pilot names.4 numbers listed. 1st number is how many friendly pilots (2nd is how many are cloaked)3rd number is how many neutral or hostile (4th is how many are cloaked)and for the curious, here is the actual for the 0-3 combo.(this tactical setup could be anchored on relatively short notice, and has no strategic side as the above do)dimension 1: level 0dimension 2: level 3a single light indicatornot lit if no other pilots presentgreen light lit if all friendlyyellow light lit if hostiles presentred light lit if hostile cloaked presenti figure this eliminates any need for hunting cloaked ships specifically, although that can be sorted into if the devs see balanced opportunity.if done carefully, it can actually be effective, and a good support for everyone having a great game play experience.the two dimensional system has one side for sov level support, only truly threatened by massive blob warfare, which only offers mass level intel.the other side is for pilot level, whether operating solo or in small groups. the intel is more detailed, as well as quicker to install or destroy, depending on your perspective.both benefit strongly when the other side is present.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/21/2014,"no offense but your word means literally nothing to me because:1. you're using an alt name. i can claim i fly titans using an alt even though i haven't ever touched one.2. you talk about ""50 km range"" which means you efted up a poorly skilled bomber or you're using rage torps for something other than structures which again shows your inexperience flying bombers.3. mining ships are actually pretty sturdy and don't die like ""kindling on a roaring flame"" to solo bombers.i'm sorry but there's zero credibility here, neither are your arguments good in and by themselves. finding a target is one thing, finding a proper target is entirely different. and what about the 0.0 systems that are 20-30 jumps in from empire? you want to limit the range of access to bombers too because if people can't leave their bombers out in space, they'll need to make a trip back as well. you simply want to have your little theme park corner and are using fake credentials to talk about how you want pvp to ""be more challenging.""obligatory ""post with your main.""no.mynna, while you have experience in eve, it seems to be limited more so to the industrial/economic side of things. and that's great, we need those things. but you proposed things in the past that limit the ""little guy"" when fighting the bigger enemy, for obvious reasons imo. your last notable that i remember proposal was concerning the siphon units and oh how terrible it is that now people that own poses sucking billions out of moons might have to undock a ship and pop a siphon or two.in any case, you base your argument off of two weak assumptions:1. the ""cloaky afker"" is off playing another video game. you have no way of knowing that, this is just opinion.2. likewise the cloaky afker makes other people go afk and play other games.in this manner you frame the argument as if cloaking in its current form is bad for the game as a whole. and this might work into scaring ccp to do something but i'm not sure we're as inclined to follow through with the fallacy. all you did was propose a weak and vague ""something needs to be done."" there is a solution but the ratters here seem bothered by it which exposes their line of argument better than anything else. that solution is to remove the cloaked ship from local. no more dreaded ""are they there, are they not"" scenario. you don't know and that's that. ah! but that's a problem isn't it? because now you have to actually fit your pve ship as a pvp ship. well there you go mynna, this also ""brings pvp and pve more in line with one another."" and it's all done via a simple patch."

4/21/2014,"thank you for your answer malcanis, much appreciated to hear it.stealth bombers remains a ship that can do a lot for its tech 2 level and size.and for bombs, i am curious what ccp will do to make bc/bs medium size fleets possibility i roamed in interceptors (before the latest vamp) for 6 months in null, because of bombs and bubbles.and i used to fly specially fitted ships to drain the capacitor of caps, because of the docking games in losec.still my proposal is my personal view ans sb and bombs, and i hope it will looked at by ccp before the summer."
4/21/2014,"i quite like the idea of a slow, extra-high explosion radius, high damage bomb that would be basically ineffective vs subcaps (say 30-60 second flight time before exploding, 2000m explosion radius so only 20-25% damage against even bs if they're not mwding)"

4/22/2014,"you had any respect for him in the first place? seriously though, his is the kind of shallow, uselessly flippant answer that you see all over this discussion, every bit as bad as ""i should be able to instantly decloak the cloaker"" or ""make cloaks use fuel"" or some such garbage, just from the opposite direction."
4/22/2014,"yes i respect him, i think that he writes very good articles on en24 and have told him so.i certainly do not agree with the use of fuel nor do i think that there should be an easy way to decloak the camper, i just hope that ccp has more d/c's for ahem cloaky afk campers, which may actually be what is happening.i have hunted cloaky campers a lot since i started playing, i have also been camped quite a lot, my first sov 0.0 alliance was sas and when i arrived in b-7 there was some very effective stealth bombers run by test in the system, it was me who setup a group of people who went after them in covert ops. ever since that time i have hunted campers and pushed people to operate regardless of them, in fact my latest kill on my second account is a fail afk cloaky camper which i manipulated over a period of time so that he had a vulnerability so that i could kill him. seraph's suggestion would prevent me from having any chance of getting them, its difficult enough as it is, especially in terms of those that just do area denial, this loser i killed was in fact doing area denial and smack and the smack part was his failure.you can interact with cloaky campers with the current mechanics, its basically a case of forcing them to interact with you by using your system regardless, then you may lose a ship but you will then get intel and if you are clever you can also get a kill or two.i don't like the way that they actually force people not to play eve, but apart from that i like it as it is.i have some suggestions, forced d/c after a period of inactivity or the very specialised probes requiring max skills and implants to get a fix within 20 km, but even that one i don't like as a cloaked ship should be cloaked, another alternative is to have the cloak ship blinded by reduced d-scan abilities. but the current system enables a certain amount of cat and mouse play, if you are dealing with someone who really is a hunter.i understand that ccp is looking at alternatives to local, ccp has to understand that space needs to be vast, so all this other intel like npc's killed, people in system, etc. will have to go too if local is removed, i could live without local if the hunters had to really hunt instead of opening up the map and saying ooooh npc kills in system xyz goes there and wham bang gets a easy kill.anyway i get the feeling that you have a balanced view of the issues which i like, so good luck in working out the right balance on this issue, from what you said its good to see that ccp see the issue around people not playing because of it, though in reality if people do not have alternatives then they have failed in terms of strategic thinking, for example the most stupid thing a renter can do is rent a single very high truespace sov system, that has to be the most crass decision anyone can make... blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
4/22/2014,"i mean if people are going to complain about ""seeing the enemy in local"" there you go, remove them from local. i have no issue with the current mechanic but you have individuals that simply want a theme park adventure version of eve. cloaky warfare, more than anything, allows small groups to affect bigger groups and limiting that gameplay lends eve to be an even more grotesque version of itself where if you are in 0.0 you have the choice to be aligned with the cfc or n3/pl. the individuals that espouse a way to nerf cloaking are people that value their own personal ratting, industry and moon mining rather than pvp gameplay.cloaked ships are balanced by their gank vs tank capabilities. (no tank all gank) and most of the criticisms leveled against cov ops can be leveled more broadly over cyno gameplay over all. eve is not a game where you can dive 15 jumps into 0.0 in a non cloaky ship and ""watch"" for the time to strike. it's a game that requires patience, proper planning and some form of instinct. some are incapable to comprehend that hence threads like this.i suppose it's easier to insult me rather than address the fact that your argument is terrible."
4/22/2014,"no, bears have already gotten standings to disappear from public view. employment history is here to stay."
4/22/2014,"the fundamental purpose of the rebalance program is to address imbalances within the current ship classes. you're ""hurry up and do it now"" tone implies they in desperate need of attention. however, this is not something i've experienced. i've taken on sb fleets in frigates and had lots of fun. i've fc large roams of frigate and dessie gangs, having to fight around hostile bombers trying to wipe out my fleets. i've used bomber groups to destroy ships in groups. at the end of the day, they are not easy to coordinate, have a limited blast potential, and really are a unique playstyle. i think they are in a great place, and am curious why you feel they are in desperate need of rebalance."

4/23/2014,"people are not complaining about seeing an enemy in local, they are complaining about not being able to interact with them, of course that depends on the intentions of the camper, i have an area denial and a smack talker at the moment, smack being more important to him because he was in a t1 frigate with only a cloak fitted, so when we ignored him and operated in the system to make a point he put up mobile depots with his smack on, this enabled me to interact with him, so i started reinforcing his mobile depots and he would pick them up and put them down again, i was out there watching him with two toons cloaked up, i timed his movements as well and he had a pattern, so it was a simple matter to exploit that, one dead t1 frigate.now imagine that being a toon linked to pl, there would be no chance of interaction until they dropped on something and their level of escalation is way above anything that i could apply against them, i cannot interact with that person until he drops a large blops fleet on me. you say planning, those pl players may have multiple accounts and have blanketed an area with their cyno toons, so in reality its not planning or skill or anything like that, its just waiting until someone wants to play the game then bang, one dead player.a stealth bomber is as you say, gank and no tank, in the past i have exploited that, those excellent test sb's that were in b-7 in late 2010, they were killing ratters, there was three of them, so i got a corp mate to go out in a apoc and had 3 covert ops cloaked up around him, we got two of them, the fun part is that they escalated by bringing in a cloaked vagabond to stop us doing that so we killed the vaga, it was fun, they were playing the game and they had my respect.where i am now, we have a large number of russian players who just leave a arazu or a legion in a system hoping that someone would think them afk and then drop a load of blops on them, so people like me move systems, it does not work on me and the people that listen to our advice, having local means i can see them come in system to afk cloak camp me so i wait a bit then go to another system, after about an hour or two they come in system and its rinse and repeat.don't fall down to the level of the gank bears in terms of flippant comments, i have the same contempt for whining idiots that put all their ratting eggs in one basket just as much as i have contempt for those doing blanket area denial afk cloaky camping in the hope that someone thinks them afk. with the current level of force projection removal of local would be a disaster for eve.in the majority of cases eve pvp is simply getting the drop on the enemy, to be blunt the cloaky afk camping is the most lazy way of doing it.one of my corp mates was operating in bombers bar fleets, sadly he has now left eve for good, but i noticed one thing about most of the kills he was on, they were in providence, doesn't that say something about where bombers bar had to operate to get people who were operating in such a way that they were actually in space doing stuff, a lot of people slag off providence residents, but they were playing the game and they were being camped to hell because of it.fact is that the only thing that ccp should do is have a automatic log off for people being inactive for more than say 4 hours, to be honest just recently i seem to get a lot more d/c's then i used to and i have been wondering if this is deliberate policy by ccp, if so i welcome it. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
4/23/2014,"but to extent that choice of the cloaky ship of not interacting, or rather when to interact is its advantage vs the locals who often out number the new comer and have a variety of options on what ships they can fly. that pl or whoever can drop 50 redeemers on a single target is an issue all together separate from the one being discussed."

4/23/2014,"seraphagreed, however you do seem to miss the main point of this thread. i nor my compatriots are looking for a theme park eve. if i wanted that i would be playing wow, dota ii or some other stupid, whimsical theme park game. we also believe that the little guy should have mechanics to affect larger ones. i know you are a blops pilot and run fleets, for that value and desire your input on the ideas being brought forth to ensure that what is suggested does not limit or is not adaptable to pilots such as yourself. i have already listed several facts that solo covert ops do not have sufficient gank to do really shite against someone who is prepared and alert. if the miner \ ratter is afk by all means gank him. i just believe the same should be true of the cloaked pilot. i believe the cloaky camper should be active in game with his patience, planning, and cunning instead of playing candy crush while he waits for someone to be stupid. while it is not your game play, it does affect a lot of others and does cause many individuals to log out and play other stuff. that brings the part of force projection and yes that is covered in this thread as well. i have repeated myself many times reiterating the basis of this thread. let me spell it out one more time. as i realize you are very busy. this thread is not!!! about nerfing active cloaked pilots!!!!!can you read that? please give meaningful explanations of pros and cons of the ideas suggested. thank you."
4/23/2014,"at the moment i am interacting with the tard who is camping my base system, i manipulated him into giving himself a vulnerability which i exploited to get a kill and now i am ignoring both him and his mobile depots, i know when he is active and when he is not, now he is losing the will to log in his camping toon, aaaah the shame of it. this guy is easy, but not southern federation who are now back in the area, they however are fail because they use known to me campers, but part of their game is really area denial, i can move and set traps for them on gates and will do that, i make them have to be active to impact me. but what do i do if swamped in all 12 systems i can use by multiple cloaky campers, that i cannot work out their active times and i know are backed up by an escalation capacity beyond what i can do, simple, i head back to hisec or go to another npc region.renting to me is a fools game, and the most foolish thing you can do is rent a system which is very good truesec and not have alternatives, so at that point they are in trouble. while i have some sympathy that such lame tactics are used against them, they are the creators of their own downfall by their strategic failure. at this point it seems that every man and his dog can do blops. so while in b-7 in 2010/11 we were camped it was not all the time, now the best systems get camped nearly if not all the time...now the people who i had discussions on this subject before went on about having to do it because they could not catch anything, well if they cannot catch anything with the interceptors how lame are they now as players, its not about catching anything its about doing something that has no effort.for a long time now i have thought that the only answer has to be d/c'ing toons that have no activity for a certain period of time, at least that will make people have to be active, i think 4 hours is a good number personally, but other will disagree. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
4/23/2014,"dracvlad i do value your input.there has been, earlier in this thread, discussion about dcing non active pilots, this is the same as kicking no active players. the valid argument is you should do the same to those in a pos shield, those who are docked. also the mouse wiggler macro was introduced to by pass such a mechanic. in all fairness and i have to admit as i once was a strong promoter of this idea, this would not be fair or in the best interest of ccp. the way the game works and the fact that many many subscribers and plexers use multiple accounts for things beyond the scope in this thread, from markets to building, shipping and intel gathering to market scraping. would be affected by this. the two alternatives are to start allowing macros and bots (never a good idea for game stability) improvement and release of the crest api tools. still there are many negative impacts this would have on the game. how to tell if someone is at keyboard working another toon or notis that ship being piloted or is it just a random direction changes.what timeframe is the definition of afk.in a recent discussion via a support ticket a gm who brought in a dev to comment stated. thank you, we do not kick people of the server for being suspected of botting. if a person is suspected of botting the person will simply get a temporary ban pending an investigation. immediately up on loging back in the person would receive the message that the account had been banned. you can find more information on this in the dev blog linked below."
4/23/2014,"very simple, the extreme safe nature of nullsec space, with its stations and poses, require us to be able to ""afk cloak"" because any time we enter in local, most players dock up or hit a pos and then they go play candycrush. i don't afk cloak because i want to go afk. i do it because local gives too much intel for the defenders. nobody gets a bomber and says ""you know what would be fun? going afk in space for 72 hours. yeah i'd love to do that."" it's something that we need to do in order to hit our target which has most of the advantages of the ""home team.""the issue with you and dracvlad likewise bring up is the issue of numbers. no you can't do anything about 15 deemers dropping on your hulk. but the way that cov ops ship scale vs t1 counter parts is a risk equation which balances the entire interaction.a 1 mil t1 frig will wreck a bomber. likewise a t1 battleship will destroy its blops counter part at a fraction of the cost. so here you have the cloaky ships which have freedom of mobility but at a high cost, and the defensive force that has the home field advantage and can fight, ""lose the battle"" but still ""win the war."""
4/23/2014,"on this part we are in agreement as to local. however removing local without some kind of intel would be too one sided. i firmly believe that you should not have to go afk to get results. i think you should be able to slip into a system and have a reasonable chance to catch and defeat and equal counter. i do believe that a fight between a tii frigate and a tii exhumer or t1 bs should come down to skill set, fit, and tactics. i also believe your intended target should also have the same reasonable chance to escape or win a fight. please do not lump in with dracvlad on the numbers game he and i have two different viewpoints on that front. i am in agreement with you on the subject of numbers in the context you put in the above quote. agreed, however you and everyone else knows the only place you get an exact match is in high sec with a dual. as i stated above it should come down to skill, fit (a skill in itself) and tactics. to me this includes knowing your area, living somewhere should give you some advantage, not total advantage as it is now.1. there should be a reasonable chance for both sides for success.2. all mechanics should encourage active gameplay. current cloaking mechanics do not meet the above parameters. what would you suggest to make it work within them?"
4/23/2014,"well an industrial ship shouldn't have pvp capabilities to any reasonable extent. if the presence of someone in local causes the defender to dock up prompting the attacker to ""afk cloak"" to try to get that interaction, it's pretty simple to see that local is an issue. you can't limit the afk cloaker's ability to remain in system either though. killing in a bomber takes patience. maybe i get in system on monday, i have to go on a trip tuesday, i get home wednesday and i'd like not to have to jump 30 jumps back and forth for that when the defender can simply dock up.really i think the defender has the issue that they somehow simply expect to be able to be out in space in mining ships and that should be enough effort to keep themselves safe. in essence the suggestion would be ""defend yourself."" get pvp ships to protect you. however this isn't a ""fun activity"" for the defender. if we don't want afk cloakers to cause the defenders to log off we have to remove local. however defenders don't like this as they get no intel.well how about this. when you cloak up, you don't show up on local, but at the same time, you (the cloaky ship) doesn't see anyone else in local either. just like a submarine descending, your knowledge is limited to particular instruments as well."
4/23/2014,"the only real solution, from my perspective straddling both sides, is to remove the incentive to flee.the only way to do this, is to offer survival, and possible reward, to those who would otherwise run away.we are not talking about pvp focused ships on either side. those hostile pvp ships were stopped by the friendly pvp ships already, and are out of the picture.we are talking about the ships which have discretion over their detection, just like the current pve ships effectively have.hot drops, take those off the table for now, as something resolved and no longer involved. this presumes a degree of expectation needed on both sides which hot dropping betrays.each side makes itself pretty for the other, by not appearing as an overwhelming target. whether that means having similar numbers, everyone is in a positive frame of mind concerning who will win a fight.this means the mining / pve ships must be able to fight on the same level as the expected covert craft.they can pay for this, and avoid being used in regular combat service, by being horrible at traveling. but we have no realistic expectation of encounters so long as one side tries to always avoid it.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/23/2014,"seraph, in terms of the blops, i was working out a plan to go after what could be between 2 to 7 blops, so i picked the brain of a ex-burn eden player who laid out to me just how tough well fitted blops are, while not everyone is as fanatical or as skilled as burn eden, i would say that stain empire, one of my targets is not far off of them. the ehp he detailed to me was just to heavy for what i thought we could have on field at the notice required, of course these were extreme fits with specific implant sets, but you have to plan for that level. so i don't really agree with your point on a t1 bs killing a blops easily, it depends on a number of factors, who is using them... home field advantage, every single blops drop i have seen ended very quickly and all the attackers off field before anyone could muster a reaction, home field advantage is meaningless in terms of a well executed blops drop.when pl was dropping fleets of blops into goon areas the goons really struggled to catch them, that they did in the end is testement to the organisation of the goons, however the goon fc who i spoke to was for an extended period very frustrated over the inability to catch even one, but your right here as once they caught them pl stopped doing it...the stain empire group i was looking at actually drop a fair number of widows and that really does cause issues in getting hold of them in terms of the reaction forces, its easy when you have a mass of interceptors, but one or two will get jammed out, simple as. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

4/23/2014,"well of course fittings matter. but line up 10 blops battleships vs 10 t1 battleships with similar fittings, and the latter group should win. even if they don't hold the field, exchanging 1 for 1 losses or even 2 for 1 will make it costly for the attacker. in the end, as you yourself stated, you need to make it costly for the attacker and they will stop. so you have an equivalent to local that is that exact, up to date and convenient? i don't think so."
4/23/2014,"but they won't be similar fittings and implants, and in any case its very difficult to get the bs on top of them, very difficult.it does not need to be, now if you said that the claoked ships d-scanner and theri probe scanner did not work either then you might be getting there, which is something i mentioned earlier in this thread. but would you have a delay on these systems coming on-line after de-cloaking, after all with the map info they will know that someone is active wouldn't they.on balance when i went through this sort of thing before i thought the better option was to leave as it is, it would start having massive impacts in terms of lag as it was another test that the server had to process, so in the end not possible. and when i say that you do know why they removed the secondary affect of active shield and armour modules when they were neuted out, it was because they had to check the status of the cap before applying damage. now work that back, checking each ship have they got a cloak and if so are they cloaked, people can change their fits with mobile depots or next to a carrier fleet. you have to cater for this sort of thing. nah its too messy... blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
4/23/2014,"well you are right, it won't be similar fittings. the t1 bs fits will be more dps and tank oriented.using dotlan is no where similar to using local as an intel tool. they just don't compare. the point is moot."
4/23/2014,"i see your point on their behaviour towards botters, they do not kick them from the server, so that kills that then, the mouse wiggle thing i disagree with, its passing active commands which could have been the test, but in effect if that is their policy for botters they will not do that for suspected afk'rs. interesting post on the socket closed, its amusing but i have noticed quite a few campers losing connections recently, blind luck then, oh well... blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"

4/24/2014,"i propose that tracking disruptors have an effect on missile launchers.in the isis section, the ""weapon disruption"" trait on a ship does say that it effects both turrets and missiles.suggestion 1:add new properties for the currently existing scripts.tracking speed disruption-> explosion velocity or explosion radius -> or half effect on bothoptimal range disruption -> missile flight time or missile velocity -> or half effect on bothsuggestion 2:introduce new scripts for tracking disruptors that will not work on turrets but only on missiles.guidance disruption -> explosion velocity or explosion radius -> or half effect on bothfuel cache disruption -> missile flight time or missile velocity -> or half effect on bothsuggestion 3:introduce new scripts for tracking disruptors that will not work on turrets but only on missiles. do not include the ability to reduce the effective range of missiles, but only the efficiency of the impact.guidance disruption -> explosion radiusnavigation disruption -> explosion velocityedit:sensor damps have sensor boosters, ecm have eccm, so to keep tracking disruptors in line i also suggest that any new scripts may also be fitted on tracking computers to increase the stats that the disruptors decrease."
4/24/2014,i agree with this (mostly suggestion 1 or 3) on the condition that missiles also gain similar benefits from tracking enhancers and tracking computers.

4/24/2014,it would allow corps/alliances to provide goods to their members at a lower cost than to the public. when i first started playing i was a member of an industrial ship building corp. the hassle of selling your ore to the corp and buying ships from the corp at lower prices was a right pita.fully support this idea!jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

4/24/2014,"the medium intensive refinery is being turned into a compression array. these will be deployable at all pos's, and provides a highsec means to compress ore. your suggestion, a personal deployable compressor will eliminate the entire purpose of the above module. -- it is deployable anywhere, like directly in trade hubs. -- it doesn't require fuel. -- it doesn't require being in a player corp with pos roles. essentially, it has all of the benefits without the drawbacks. this is unacceptable, and i'd ask what drawbacks could we find to give your personal compressor to balance it? perhaps the combination of the below will bring it into balance:  compression time is lengthy. perhaps unlimited compression jobs, but each job takes 2 hrs to complete.  freely engageable by anyone (like the mobile tractor unit).  limited bay size, to limit how many jobs it may run."

4/25/2014,"no kill id found, the few i did find did not have what i consider a decent tank, in fact most did not have many tank modules at all or what they did have was not sufficient. as such deserved what they got. ok cat out of the bag, while i cannot go into details, i am former usn and a sonar tech who did anti sub warfare, yes i could find and pinpoint location of subs and did so on a regular basis, since it was not war at the time we did not blow any up. however there exists many tools besides mines and depth charges to do so and my knowledge is from over 20 years ago. however this is a game where the technology is very advanced past what we have in the real world, so i am confident it would not be too hard to find and achieve a missile lock on passive emissions from a cloaked ship. difficult yes impossible no, shooting in the dark would be nice too if we could passively see a distortion in the star field. current mechanics do not allow for that. as to your first statement, i agree that getting up to go to the head or to go fix a sandwich should not be worried about as far as afk or not. however someone who is able to log on whilst doing something else becomes a non active participant. a non active participant should not be able to affect the gameplay of an active participant.so in this you and i have a large difference in opinion."

4/25/2014,"while there could be an interesting niche for a deployable like what you're talking about, it should be to fill a niche, not replace the pos module. the compression array is perfectly serviceable and actually downright good as far as things you do with a pos go and it doesn't really need to be replaced. in fact depending on the reason you're compressing in the first place it's arguably better than a rorqual, given the size of its cargo bay."

4/26/2014,"subs could definitely be pinpointed quite easily. passive and active sonar are very effective against submarines and have been since about 1941-42. that would be why such a large number of naval vessels and aircraft, as well as lines of underwater listening stations are part of most large countries anti-submarine warfare doctrines.there are also mad which are devices usually on airborne assets that can detect submerged metallic anamolies. they've been around since ww2 afaik."

4/26/2014,"and what will you tell the wormhole players? that's the really funny part about most of these suggestions, is that they would basically ruin life in wormholes. but that doesn't matter, because a red in local gives you the badfeelz."
4/26/2014,"you are assuming that afk play is either unintended, or not balanced.maybe you would not word it this way, but the result of your change would reflect this view more than any other.i must point out, that holding sov grants limited but significant leverage, not ownership of the space itself.1. you have the ability to control access to all the outposts. this is huge, since players cannot mount combat operations without a staging area to launch them from.2. you have already defined the ability to remove non friendly pos locations, denying even their limited staging ability.these two points force hostile players to travel from their staging areas, or carry everything with them with risk of exposure.when they need to travel to where you are, you have the leverage to place combat forces at the bottlenecks needed by the majority of fighting craft, blocking them convenient access.your alliance is never relieved of duty, in needing to prevent access by those who would shoot at you.the entire existence of jump drives, as well as stealth cloaking, is to bypass the gate camp bottlenecks, so noone can be safe if someone is willing to make the extra effort.it's a game, we don't want winners, or the game ends.summary: blocking afk play as you suggested would result in the balance shifting towards sov holders, by making access to their space harder to maintain by hostiles.we don't want blob or gtfo game play, and i feel this would push null in that direction.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

4/26/2014,"industrials and freighters invariably get bumped at stargates and then suicide ganked because they have loaded their holds with an inappropriate amount of valuable cargo. unless you are unlucky it will be victims fault that they have been targeted. the pilots that get involved in these activities are largely doing it to generate isk and will not gank you if you have not knowlingly turned yourself into a loot pi<U+FFFD>ata. regarding bumping of miners it is a legitimate activity to use in roleplay scenarios, to extort or ransom to obtain isk, or to protect business interests. introducing suspect status as a punishment for bumping mining ships is not required as miners are protected enough. if suspect status was introduced i reckon there is a more than fair chance it would not bring the result you think would happen."
4/26/2014,"i'm not sure 'carebears' asked for pilots standings with npc corps to be invisible. personally i always found it interesting and useful for many reasons to be able to read other pilots standings with npc corporations. i have a feeling ccp want to get rid of standings entirely and npc corporations as well. i think it might be a good idea for capsuleers to only be able to be members of npc corporations for a limited time and not to be able to rejoin them afterwards. but i wouldn't want to see that part of new eden (npc corporations.) eliminated from the game entirely. i'm afraid it's a case of dumbing down of the game again.

4/26/2014,"i think your proposals numbered one and two are probably not good ideas as this would no doubt be exploited by the null sec entities that have taken over many of the poco in high sec. regarding your third proposal i think there is something there that is interesting and i believe it would bring 'content' for all parties although it would be a slow way of retrieving pi material from the planet/s. so the benefit to yourself and others who wish to do planetary interaction in highsec would be minimal. there is a seed of a great idea within your third proposal to add an additional method of pi material retrieval from planets. an idea that would or could really link dust 514 with eve online and provide an industrial element to dust 514. it would take some thought but i think it would possibly form a full crossover expansion. it would almost be a martin luther king moment. not wishing to insult his achievements there or anything. i nearly got excited then. shortly after the introduction of pocos into high sec and after a dabble in poco ownership i got sick of the hassle and it caused corporation arguments. we haven't bothered with planetary interaction since then and i suspect many haven't bothered with it again either. we don't sadly have access to dr eyjo's qens anymore so there is no concrete way for us assess the economy and in this case high sec pi usage so it's hard to guage the situation. we may go back to doing pi at some point but it would involve a lot of work to restart it now.

4/26/2014,miner bumping is one of the few remaining methods to disrupt miners or regulate and control mining levels in systems nowadays. when mining vessels were given their first iteration a while back ehp levels were increased drastically so it is much harder to suicide gank them now. the current changes to mining vessels being proposed and likely to be introduced with give increased drone damage capability to some mining vessels. to my mind it is starting to go too far the other way and miners are maybe being protected too much. a good idea may be to not allow pilots to leave corporations once a wardec has been announced. then maybe we can get a little more control back. mining of asteroids need to be done on a sustainable basis you know.
4/26/2014,"i'm not sure you have read the dev blog fully. if the current proposal goes through ccp plans to get rid of blueprints. there will be a new pos array that can compress ore in high sec systems, or rather a recycling of another current pos array into the new one. providing you have the anchoring skill you will be able to anchor a small pos anywhere in high sec and do compression while in a player run corp. this is virtually like having a personal deployable structure. actually i think personal deployable structures are littering space everywhere atm notably at jita and the trade routes leading out from there. hopefully ccp can use the personal deployable structure computer coding to develop a new pos system soon. then the current pos system can be trashed and the ability to just plonk personal deployables , particularly mtu's, can be limited or brought under some kind of control. a two hour time limit on personal deployables would be best.

4/27/2014,"interesting, i would suggest you go back a few pages and read what nikk has been posting. he merely suggests that your idea would create more imbalanced play than it would correct. i agree with nikk in that. you will find on those pages several suggestions that include a way to find cloaked vessels. however i think we all wish for it to be balanced so that both sides have a reasonable chance to succeed in what they want to do. this is of course should follow the rules laid out in one of my post in respect to afk game play. please read up, then make informed suggestions, please keep in mind that we need balanced game play for all, regardless of if we like how the other side plays."
4/27/2014,"nice i wish there were more interaction like this, also the other way as i was referring to exhumer kills. agreedthis is a delicate matter, as you stated there are many aspects of the game that allows for interaction while not at the computer. on this i totally agree with you. i think the problem lies in defining what is active game play. communication and notifications out of game is a standard set by ccp, (eve gate for example) however how much should a person not in game be allowed to affect someone who is in game. for instance i get a notification that someone is hitting one of my towers. im at work i cant leave but i can text a corp mate and have them go defend the pos, while this communication allows me to defend my pos, it does take time and eventually requires someone in game to react to the threat. this is different than if i was in game when the pos was first attacked.using the above example, both the out of game and ingame players have a means to interact with each other. however if i am away from the game, logged in, afk, cloaked and just sitting while i go to the store or in your case a three day trip, i may not be able to attack anyone but i am still affecting the gameplay of active players as they have no way to tell if i am there or not.in that respect i believe the active players should have a way to interact with me. current mechanics do not allow that. this is different than be getting into a system, cloaking up then logging off for a few days and coming back logging in and then active camping. that sort of thing i expect and i am ok with."

4/28/2014,everything you just said is wrong.an afk cloaked player cannot harm anyone. a player at his keyboard is hunting you 100% legitimately.either way there is no problem. and it certainly is not a problem if some cowards can't bring themselves to undock with a neutral in local.
4/28/2014,"while i agree with you what he said is wrong. however what you said is just as wrong, there is a problem. if you are cloaked there is no way possible to tell if you are at keyboard or away from keyboard. that is why most do not undock with a neut in local. and it is not just because that one neut is in local, that one can become many instantly. herein lies one aspect of the problem. instead of spouting ""you cowards!"" why do you not suggest viable solutions to the issue that would encourage people to undock?if you care to read many previous post we have many arguments good and bad on both sides of the issue with several propositions that would have merit. you sir give appearance that you want easily defeated ships to undock under your guns so you can get easy kills, if that is so you are looking for the theme park version of eve. i hope it never comes to that. most of us that have been regular posters to this thread are seeking more interaction and more challenge.if i wanted easy kills i would be sitting off the undock in jita or many other gank places and pop red pods all day.i like the challenge of the fight, win or lose. i believe that both sides should have a reasonable chance of success."
4/28/2014,"the key element of an mmo is player interaction.this fact stands alone, as it is the defining element itself. the secondary aspect would be lots, as in lots of players.(massively multiplayer online game)i want more interaction with mining, and as this is a game we are all paying to play, i want it to be chosen willingly by both sides.that means no forced evasion mechanic, such as knowing you have no realistic expectation to survive an encounter with another player.expecting to die in a fire is a strong incentive to avoid interaction, so should be re-examined as contrary to good play.cloaked craft expect this from pure pvp ships, so avoid interacting with them if possible.pve craft expect this of cloaked and pure pvp ships, so avoid interacting with either if possible.here is the key: pure pvp ships at gate camps and friendly allies are able to effectively block other pure pvp ships which have hostile intent. (assuming alliance being competent, of course)that leaves just the cloaked ships, effectively.block hot dropping, and raise the pve ships to the same level of fighting ability, and encounters will happen much more often.neither of these changes is demonstrated as gamebreaking, so i see a real opportunity to improve play here.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/28/2014,"pve ships can all fit a decent tank and tackle. then they call their pvp friends (or mains) to finish the job.if pve ships could fit tank, tackle and guns, they would be pvp ships.make space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"
4/28/2014,"don't need tackle, and certainly don't need to be on the same level as pure pvp ships.you are oversimplifying the comparison, which leads to suggesting a false equivalency.mining ships, for starters, are pvp ships. just not combat ones, for two reasons.1. they lack fighting ability at a practical level2. they lack speed to avoid being too slow for patrols or roams.if they had conveniently available ""pvp friends"", no issue would exist.guarding miners is a novelty event, for obvious reasons.i would like to see mining ships elevated in fighting ability to match the level of covert shipping. i would like to see cynos require a spool up period during which no beacon would be active.put these details in, and encounters between mining ships and the relatively present stealth hostiles will become interesting to both sides.not the ""run or diaf"" scenario we currently have.this will make it more fun for both sides as well. we are playing eve so we can fly space ships with and against each other, after all is said and done.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/28/2014,"i see what you mean, but... mining ships able to take on a t3 cruiser??? seems too much...i admit not being familiar with blops dropping miners, but couldn't the miners just have a noobship with a cyno standing by? wouldn't a single carrier jumping in within 30 seconds or so be enough to keep them alive enough time for some other friends to join the party?make space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"
4/28/2014,"a t3 cruiser has no real comparison short of a battleship, in many cases. i would suggest this type of ship raises the effort to a special level, which should not be taken lightly.that said, it effectively needed the covert package to reach the miner, in this context.that makes it interesting enough to consider, although i wonder if a stealthy covert t3 would feel safe against a combat rigged skiff, assuming the skiff was competent to handle stealth shipping of other t2 varieties that could get past a gate camp.as to having a miner with a cyno handy? if only it were that simple.keeping players on standby long enough to coordinate a hot drop, with the expectation of action after a reasonable time period, that is one thing entirely.keeping the equivalent number of players handy, for a drop that is conditional on someone else effectively attacking under the right conditions, has no real expectation that action will happen, only that it might happen.that puts the second group of players in the same category as those who are present and watching over the pve players. nice to imagine, but too dull and boring for real players to waste time with normally.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."

4/29/2014,"as to the subject of t3 cruisers. if you fly one you know that putting a cloak on it nerfs not only the damage and lock time but also the fit,and it is a cruiser after all, a well fit cloaked t3 and a well fit skiff should be interesting."
4/29/2014,"also, wouldn't a couple of falcon alts be enough to nullify or at least greatly reduce the damage that a blops gang can do to a mining op?doesn't even have to be your own alt, just pay a corpmate or alliance mate 10mil/hour or so to park his falcon next to you while he's out doing other stuff on his main.or couldn't you just mine with throwaway ships? if they explode who cares?maybe there's something i just don't get (i live in lowsec) but it seems that some people are overestimating both the actual threat level of a covert hotdrop and the effort needed to minimize losses. maybe you should have at least a small bit of pvp knowledge even if you just want to pve in null?make space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"
4/29/2014,"here is the part you are not getting:null miners in many alliances, are not allowed to fight back.specifically, the concern is that the players harassing the miners will have a good time, and come back for more.the call was made from an excel sheet, not a fun to play perspective.my view, is that if we make mining something where evasion is not the only option, we can stay mining, as well as draw in more miners just for the fights themselves.make anything fun, and more people want to do it.if harassing becomes fun, it happens more often.but, if mining becomes more fun, as well as more rugged against opposing forces, mining then happens more often.people have fun, everyone wins.isn't that what we want out of a game?upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/29/2014,"now i see what you mean!yeah, in lowsec everybody's pretty much 1) a pvp-er 2) a 'free man' the few guys i know that mine in lowsec are pvp-ers that mine on their alts to avoid having to jump in massive amounts of minerals (that they need to build stuff).so they usually fit tank & tackle to their mining ships and bring in their main + call friends if someone tries to gank them.and yeah, they tend to have at least the same amount of fun as the gankers!make space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"
4/29/2014,"i wise man once told me that unless you know without doubt, do not assume anything.do not limit the scope of what you think just by what you think you see. behind that tree is a large forest.it is good to see that you are expanding your horizions"
4/29/2014,"and now that you have the perspective, you may grasp that i want to bring the style of gameplay more like your experience to other areas, like null.but, i can't fight emergent gameplay, so i have to instead determine how to channel that so we get the fun we want.alliances are admitting that fun is a driving force in behavior. that is why they want to avoid cloaked gank attempts from finding targets. successful ones will keep coming back, and that drops the numbers they feel they need for other things.like pvp fleets, or upgrades, or even improvements for the alliance itself.i fully respect these are good things, and should be worked towards.so, i think to myself: people want to do fun things, and alliances need mining to happen with few interruptions.solution: make mining fun, so it happens more often and draws in more to participate.that's where i propose the ideas i do. i am connecting where we are now to where i think we find this desired game.at least, i am trying to do so.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/29/2014,"demonstrably untrue. ccp's own disclosures on that show that the destruction of ships in nullsec vastly outnumbers highsec.if it weren't for those special people who use autopilot, highsec would be even lower."
4/29/2014,very helpful for npc null and low sec groups that want to set up a cheap market for allies but don't want hostiles buying it.i am not saying it is a good idea or that i would support it but i know my alliance would benefit greatly.money at its root is a form of rationing. when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion (50% of humanity) it is clear where the source of poverty is.
4/29/2014,the above is a quote from the mittani you might find helpful.i live in npc nullsec and our logi bros do a great job of importing doctrine ships as well as our personal ships.we have alliance rules about mark up over jita (fuel costs included).we seed the local market with very little as our foes could buy it at any time.i like many of my fellows have an industry alt.some of my friends mine to make isk.if they asked for people to guard them doing it they would be laughed at.if they didn't pvp with us they would be kicked (1-2 exceptions for some very important jobs).only pvpers are useful to us. everyone in eve has a method of making isk and so we all have alts that perform useful support functions. pure industrialists /marketeers can do what they want but they are not welcome in our space without permission.money at its root is a form of rationing. when the richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion (50% of humanity) it is clear where the source of poverty is.

4/30/2014,"null miners in many alliances are told not to fight back...right. they are told not to be stupid, as that brings back more of them. being stupid as in not watching local, intel channels, setting a scout etc etc. in which most of your jewbears out there do not do any of that, thus they get popped. because they are stupid. if gankers can't find targets they will move on, especially if they find a ""smart"" jewbear"". because after a few times they will just move on to something else. because for every one ""smart"" jewbear, there are 100 dumb ones."
4/30/2014,"the exact wording may vary, and it would be an odd coincidence if it were the same in each case.the point is, miners are often told not to give the hostiles a reason to come back.for some alliances, this means a strict non interaction policy. not smart, dumb, or anything else, but total lack of contact.from your own experience, it seems they gave you some wiggle room, and made you responsible i would expect.on a purely emergent level, these decisions are being made partly from an accounting perspective. the alliance needs income in order to function.if they feel comfortable that they have more than enough, then they can be more relaxed about maintaining the source.i don't feel this justifies a poor game play experience, and i am not naive enough to go against proven game play styles being present.so, we work with what we have, and try to make smarter changes.upgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed, hunting the cloaked..."
4/30/2014,"the reason miners are told to not interact is because they are truly miners/jews. and the simple fact that most of these guys are so risk averse, they will lose a tengu to an ares. then they cry in allinace chat that no one came and helped them because they were tackled in a belt. and normally that is what you get ""halp i am tackled in a belt"" and most of the time you spend stupid time trying to figure out where is your little noob. they are good at building stuff, digging in the dirt, shooting rats...but absolutely no common sense when it comes to deal with hostiles. most of them just think that they pay for a game, joined an alliance so now they should receive all the protection and no one should ruin ""their"" game. so the leadership decided the no interaction / aggression to save themselves a little sanity. this game has been dumbed down so much, it has lost a lot of it's original flavor and it makes me a sad panda. the game is based on the premise that you use common sense and some form of cognitive skills to out smart and kill your opponent. but unfortunately you have a chunk of the eve population think they are playing an arcade game, have no social skills what so ever and can not grasp how some one killed their tengu with an ares....edit: also, as far as alliance isk/ minerals, yeah normally their logistics jewcrew takes care of that or has some minerals program for the pubbies."
4/30/2014,"well if these are the avg cloaky camper victims: nikk narrel, are you sure you wanna give them guns???they'd probably get confused, shoot at the roids and try to mine the hostiles!make space glamorous! is eve dying or not? ask the eve-o death-o-meter!"
