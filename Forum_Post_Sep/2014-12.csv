12/1/2014,i wonder how third party devs would do without you steve good luck for csm x!
12/1/2014,"hooray for hats :) but all the other points sound quite good too. i've read your suggestions on mining and the whole claim based approach, and really like the idea. also, pos changes would be great. good luck! o/"
12/1/2014,"grrr, turning eve into tf2, grr, grr.=pfounder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/1/2014,ganking is an essential park of the game-play experience. i try not to look at things as right or wrong as they relate to the development of eve online. attaching morality to a sandbox is very problematic if not toxic. at the player level you can believe whatever you want and act on those ideologies.
12/1/2014,"definitely support more highsec pve player on the csm. good luck!as far as wardeccs, consider the following. marmite collective recently wardecced my 1 man corp. is there any conceivable game mechanic that will get me to fight them at 90-1 odds and given that all they do is train and practice pvp? absolutely not. it's either dec dodge, npc corp, or dock up and play on alts. the fact that they are even able to dec me is the problem, and shows why the wardecc system is fundamentally broken. hopelessly one sided wars with no chance of a defender victory do not lead to interesting gameplay, they just lead to boredom. i would hope that if you are elected csm you would examine whether wars serve any purpose in highsec (in fact there is some crazy statistic out there than 90%+ of the losses are incurred by one side of the war, on average. these are turkey shoots, not wars.)"
12/1/2014,"dear mr belvar,thank you for taking an interest in my campaign. i hope that you will use your votes correctly come voting day... i had a conversation including someone on my corps that seemed to think that not voting was also sending a message. might i ask what you use your 1 man corps for? does being in a 1 man corps bring any advantages for you, as a player, over being in an npc corps (other than taxes)?this also comes to what people have been saying about looking that the corporation system as a whole?you know that stuff about ""social"" corporations with no gameplay relevance... vs. corporations that want to build structures, do things and have gameplay relevance.if your 1 man corporation is an entity that excerpts some direct influence on the game (eg dropping secure containers with messages) then there has to be a mechanism for someone to attack/stop you. this is eve after all.but if this one man corporations exists solely so that all your alts fly under the same banner... then that is a different matter, i think.but why would someone want to stay in a one man corporation? wouldn't joining a group of others enable more interaction and involvement? maybe once the awox removal hits, that will reduce the one men corporations..?war is not necessarily always about having a ""fair fight"", but i agree that the mechanism as it is, is hopelessly broken. almost as bad as the bounty system. tora bushido is also running for the csm, and if you read his thread... and the linked interview... well you will see that he-who-is-probably-high-secs-prime-war-deccer has some ideas on making things more balanced. i read his interview, and i find some of his ideas good... but i will give him time to write his long post and present them before i steal them."
12/1/2014,"i use a one man corp to evade the 11% npc tax rate. when running incursions/l4s the 11% is an irritating tax that serves to reduce your rewards. by joining a 1 man corp and just folding and reforming when you get wardecced, you avoid the 11% in taxes.joining multimember corps in highsec is pretty terrible right now. awoxxing/wardeccs/theft make them basically useless. you can essentially capture all the benefits just by fleeting up and chatting, so all the corp does is give you donwsides.fundamentally the problem with highsec wars is you can't force people to fight. if necessary i will make 6 incursion/l4 alts, just dock up whoever gets wardecced, and play on one of the other ones. since there is no way to punish docking up and playing on alts, wars themselves become a joke. personally i think that highsec would be better off if we just got rid of non-mutual wars.as far as tora's ideas his main suggestion was to make it more expensive to dec smaller corps and cheaper to dec larger ones. any analysis of his ideas must take into account that most of his income comes from deccing larger groups, so he has a pretty major conflict of interest."
12/1/2014,"greetings capsuleers,my name is tora bushido (@blowfish70) and i am running for csm x. my main focus will be on a new high-sec for all of new eden<U+FFFD>s citizens. not just for the <U+FFFD>good<U+FFFD> or <U+FFFD>bad<U+FFFD> guys, but a new fun high-sec for all of us! and yes, i know there are many more capsuleers outside of high-sec, who want their voice to be heard too. but i don<U+FFFD>t want to be one of those csm<U+FFFD>s, who hasn't been in a certain part of space for ages and still thinks he knows everything about it. eve changes fast and your knowledge gets outdated quickly if you don<U+FFFD>t keep up. so, i would rather focus on the area i<U+FFFD>ve been living in the last few years. if you want to read what i<U+FFFD>ve done so far in eve, read the fun written player profile by feyd. besides my wh background and current high-sec experience, i am also still active in null-sec on my alts. been active 24/7 in eve since 2010. i know it<U+FFFD>s just a game, but it<U+FFFD>s also my passion. i care about the game and want to see it going on for at least another 10 years. it<U+FFFD>s easy to complain about <U+FFFD>bad<U+FFFD> things from the sideline, but i rather be active myself and try to find solutions for problems. do i know it all, hell no! but i am the kind of guy who really listens to players and finds common grounds to build upon. i can analyze problems very fast and can break things down to the base of it. simple is often the best solution.most of you probably know me as the alliance leader of the marmite collective, a group of like minded guys who just enjoy shooting things. in marmites we don<U+FFFD>t do politics. if you want to have a good time and you<U+FFFD>ve got what it takes, you<U+FFFD>re welcome. because of this policy we<U+FFFD>ve got good relations with a lot of alliances, corps and players all over eve. most of us don<U+FFFD>t take things to personal and just enjoy the game as we see fit. if it is needed for the game, i will also accept things that might not be in the best interest of my own alliance. we<U+FFFD>re just a small part of a greater eve.each area of space has its own challenges. the ideas below are not the basis for my campaign, but to act as a spark plug for getting to the down and dirty of these kind of issues. while this approach might turn the stomachs of many<U+FFFD> if one can<U+FFFD>t identify the down and dirty from the player base, then what good is the csm. i<U+FFFD>m here to listen and i want more of your ideas! so let<U+FFFD>s get down to business.ganking in high-sec i think ganking is a part of eve and i want it to stay, but we need to add something new. right now it<U+FFFD>s to easy to warp out of a station, gank something, warp your pod back to station and wait till the timer runs out. the hideout <U+FFFD> a mobile deployable unit that shadows criminal targets from concord. while of course criminals will lose their ships, and they can<U+FFFD>t undock in another ship, they could still undock in a pod and warp to this 15km area to hide in new ships. the hideout will also tick down the timer twice as fast while they are in range and in a ship. what this does is provide opportunities for anti ganker movements to hunt gankers who may find this unit useful to quicken their return to another gank.afk, while in space, on the same grid (high-sec)if you<U+FFFD>re logged in and undocked, i think you should also be active behind the keyboard. players should press a notification button every x minutes if they are still on the same grid in space. one of the reasons i think people go afk while mining, is because it<U+FFFD>s boring to watch the screen while doing so. i want to add a mini game for the miners. what kind, you tell me. i want this only for high-sec, as in the other parts of eve you've got a way higher risk of dieing because of it.war decsthe war dec system needs to change. to many new corps in high-sec are destroyed by war decs, which is bad for keeping people motivated to stay in high-sec or even in eve itself. once they are a bit bigger (25+), they at least have a chance fighting. high-sec isn<U+FFFD>t for pussies, so let<U+FFFD>s not do more then really needed or we will nerf the game to death. i would suggest, double the war dec costs for the first group (up to 50 players). and let the rest as it is. making the costs go from 50m to 100m might not seem much, but i can tell you from experience it<U+FFFD>s a lot when you have so many wars running as we have or when you are a small griefer corp. i would be ok if this raise is only for corps more then for example 50 players. this way the smaller, less rich, doing less damage corps, can still do their thing.social corp/ npcyou shouldn't be able to stay longer then 2-3 months in a npc corp. players should be able to create small social corps with max 10 players in it, which can<U+FFFD>t be war decced (can still be ganked). but they also can<U+FFFD>t own a pos, poco or future structure and they can<U+FFFD>t war dec someone else. this might look bad, as they can freely do anything they want, but if you look at it more closely, they can still do the same things as they could do in an npc corp. only this way they have the chance to build up a corp. see it as a stage between npc and a corp. the social corps do need to pay an x amount of tax or it will just become another tax/war avoiding corp. incursionsnot sure if there are current issues. if so, mail me.remember, changes are made by taking small steps. don't start running before you can walk or you will drop on the floor,tora bushidocampaign banner campaign banner 2 nerfes, you shall not pass!"
12/1/2014,"industryincrease the agility of t2 freighters, so it<U+FFFD>s easier to haul cargo and harder for gankers to keep them bumped. create a multi sell option (select what you want, see the total and decide to buy or not). create a multi contract option, so it's easier for example to contract bpc's (got 100 bpc's, select them all, create contract for public per x bpc's for price y).the last few patches have already improved industry a lot i think.dont nerf eve to deathsometimes nerfs are needed, but let's not kill eve with to many. if i think eve is getting to nerfed, i will bring in more darkness. if it's to dark, shine more light. and to keep this fun for the entire community, i talk and listen to people. even to people i personally do not like.dreadsi want dreads back in high-sec for more large pos fights and it will create a better market for them.contactsi want an export and import contact lists function. or even better, make something similar as the overview. drag contacts to link, other character clicks it and has the same contacts (standings, etc).graphical user interfacei want to create a better gui for you capsuleers. i am not happy with the new gui colors, icons, etc. we need more import/export options and long time bugs should be fixed!implants from corpsesan autopsy skill that gives you a chance of recovering implants from corpses.faction policei wouldn<U+FFFD>t be against removing the faction police, so we would see more players with -5 or lower in high-sec. interaction between high-sec and any other part of eve can only be good. it also shows players from high-sec that there is more then just high-sec (where most start in). there are enough players in high-sec to still shoot them, so i don<U+FFFD>t really see the need for the police.unaccessible high-sec stations for piratesmaking high-sec stations unaccessible for pirates is not something i would support right now, unless someone could convince me why it<U+FFFD>s really good idea. concord officesi want a concord office in every low-sec system. i hope this will attract more high-sec players to low-sec, as it's easier to buy your security status back this way.making decisions as a csm should not be about feelings, but facts.for people who think i will turn high-sec in to a nerfed wow disneyland, never ! the following players i would endorse for csm x (random order) :* bobmon* xander phoena* corebloodbrothers* corbexx* sabriz* manfred sideous* sion kumitomo* steve ronuken* migui x<U+FFFD>hyrrn* endie von posts"

12/1/2014,"if i wasn't running this year myself, you would get my vote like last year. you did a great job so far in the csm."
12/1/2014,+1 you got my vote. corbexx did a lot of work this year and i am super glad he is running again. burn the land and boil the sea you can't take the sky from me
12/1/2014,"prior to knowing your position on intra-corp aggression i had intended to have you on my list of recommended candidates.however, if you are successful in achieving a major increase in safety for career empire pveers (the targets of highsec corp infiltrators), you'll simply accelerate the trend toward nullsec and wormhole players carrying out their wealth generation activities in highsec instead of fighting to assert their ability to generate wealth in dangerous space.you'll also remove one of the best ways for rookie players to get their first pvp experiences. awox ransoming is something i have seen several people do as their first step into the sandbox, and the thing that broke me from my initial eve path of 'level up my dominix' was a mercenary infiltrating my first corp and blowing someone up to fill a contract.i don't live in wormholes, and even i've noticed the number of people migrating out of them over the last couple of years, as people move their isk generating activities to highsec and grind incursions in relative safety. i hear the wormholer complaints 'there's too many predators, not enough prey' and as a wh outsider i'm concerned that w-space may end up looking even more like non-fw lowsec if there's many more buffs to highsec safety.newer players should be given firm warnings that joining a corporation opens them up to intra-corp pvp (a dismissable warning that's the reverse of the one you are given when you join a fleet), but it's not new players in their battlecruisers and ventures that get shot in infiltration/awox incidents, it is career pveers and miners in their orcas and pirate faction battleships. the first unplanned pvp most new players encounter is a gatecamp when they derp and buy a skillbook in a dangerous lowsec system, not an awoxer."
12/1/2014,you have my vote.
12/1/2014,"while sion kumitomo is running again for a csm position, mynnna, the second member that goonswarm elected, has decided to stand down after a great couple of years. through the rigorously democratic constitutional processes of goonswarm (a <U+FFFD>one man, one vote<U+FFFD> structure where the man who has the vote is the mittani), i have been asked to stand for the csm.in eve, it is notorious that many senior leaders log into the actual game itself less and less as the years go by, choosing to play jabber online. that is not the case for me: i play eve very regularly, both in large fleets and small gangs, and what keeps me tied to eve are the roams with my corp, bat country, many of which i fc. badly fc. i<U+FFFD>ve also experienced a range of eve playstyles: i<U+FFFD>ve lived in wormholes, both solo and as part of a group; bat country regularly deploys as a corp to lowsec for weeks at a time in order to pvp and to lose titans; and when i started the corp we lived as an empire-space wardeccing group of newbies getting very excited at being paid ransoms of a hundred million isk to leave people alone.in addition, many people know of my corp, bat country, as the creators of miniluv and the home of warr bakini. this should give you a good idea of my views on highsec, suicide ganking and more.on the political side of eve, i have been head of the goonfleet intelligence agency for almost half a decade, as well as serving as chief diplomat for goonswarm in the year after we accidentally slightly lost delve due to being differently good at eve. that period <U+FFFD> one of scrambling and recovery and of being the underdog <U+FFFD> still stands out for me as some of the best fun i have had in eve and has shaped my attitudes to the game, to its problems, and to how ccp can shape the game universe to help the players to solve those problems.i<U+FFFD>m terrifyingly aware that the csm is a great deal of work: last year, i declined the chance to stand as i was not in a position to commit sufficient time and effort to the role of csm to justify my inclusion. this year is different, and i am very keen to help ccp to continue the exciting and radical changes that they have revealed in recent months, whilst hopefully encouraging them to throw in a little more carrot amidst the gleeful stickery that has been going on.for those who are interested in my vision for eve, i wrote a short series of fairly controversial blog posts in the summer in which i called for the system to favour smaller groups and a more fractured, balkanised eve online:"
12/1/2014,finaly someone i can stand behind and might get me to vote for csm again
12/1/2014,"endie, posts we can believe in, and changes we can stand behind."
12/1/2014,"i read the blog posts. how do these principles hold up in the context of the pheobe changes?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/1/2014,"i believe that they were not only compatible with it but that something like them was necessary for the balkanised eve i'd like to see. i posted at the time (i think that the article was called ""fifty scales of gray"") to say that i welcomed them. i disagreed with a few details but those were changed anyway before it went live.edit: it is also important to stress that the csm are not game designers: all they can really do is help provide feedback and input: ccp will not try to implement something some random blogger dreams up in his capacity as amateur game designer!"
12/1/2014,"i'm sad to see mynnna standing down, but it's his call. of all of the nullsec bloc-aligned representatives since i've followed the csm i've thought highest of him. i see you share several of his views on null sov but with some additional thoughts of your own.i will read up closely on your campaign platform as you release it."

12/2/2014,"because the current share system is too vulnerable to being taken advantage of. shares can be too easily bought up when released, resulting in corp theft."
12/2/2014,"the problem is ccp is well known to fire shots without checking the target first. i wonder what the ban count on this change is actually going to be for people that actually alt-tab between accounts like you and me. to some people, when they mine in same clusters as i do, they think the lasers firing up is simultaneous on all accounts even if there's that small time between clicking each eve window in the bottom bar and pressing f1-f3 on all of them at the same time.personally, i was never bothered by isboxer or keystroke multiplication/sending. it didn't bother anyone for years. until isboxer controlled bomber wings started wreaking havoc upon the dogs of war. or massive fleets mining the shiznit in high-sec space.up until that became a widespread common thing, nobody gave a rats ass about multiboxers using isboxer or logitech g7 keyboards or keyclone utility software."

12/2/2014,you know that comment could be interpreted in several ways and not all of them particularly positive. the csm is still valid yes but what do you want to turn it into? it's just a player elected body to represent players. where the csm has problems is some of them think they're game designers and they've been elected to promote their ideas. the only reform really need is the people putting themselves up for election who fail to realise what the csm actually is: players representing other players and nothing more. in fact their are other ways of doing what the csm does without actually having some elected body of self important players who constantly like to tell everyone else how important they are.

12/2/2014,"my support for you would have been for the work you did in encouraging pve in dangerous space, particularly the sleeper loot changes. i still regard that as excellent work and would support changes to make other forms of wealth generation activities (such as mining) more viable in wh space. eve needs more incentive to be undocked and active in dangerous space, whether that activity is fighting rats, mining, running exploration sites or whatever, and the more those activities reward risking valuable assets the better the game.back to the point of contention, starting with the question of newbies.people awox ransoming as newbies - i only have anecdotes, no hard numbers. it's a rare occurence (despite my efforts to advise people in the forum newbie areas of the option) and most people that do it as newbies are people that lose a ship to highsec predators, then ask questions like 'how did you do that?' and get the necessary tips. most newbies never realise it's an option. but where else can a 500k skillpoint character without external isk injection win a decisive pvp victory solo in eve through their own cunning, preparation and initiative?you claim new players leave over intracorp aggression. what do you define as a new player? i've been in and out of the main channel where these sorts of attacks are organised, and as a result i know the people involved in these shenanigans target corps with orcas, pirate faction battleships, marauders and empire navy battleships. expensive ships. they watch traffic in level 4 mission hubs. if their targets were new players, they'd be going after places like simela (level 2-3 soe mission hub) and the newbie cruisers there.the main people that are hit hard by highsec intracorp aggression are people settling into a career of highsec mission running or highsec mining. eve will not hold 90% of those people once they finish the process of levelling up from a dominix to an ishtar to a proteus to a vindicator to a kronos (or their retriever into a mackinaw) unless they are brought into the sandbox somehow. those people aren't newbies, they are usually closer to 3-6 months old."
12/2/2014,"i am not so sure about this. if highsec awox removal allows the formation of large, organized and stable ""incursion corporations"", many players may choose to move back to highsec and join them permanently. right now, the inherent social element of corporations is hampered by the aggression mechanics which prevent incursion corps, so many players just have an npc-corp alt doing incursions and still consider their main eve identity as a defined by the wormhole, low, or null corp they are part of. if they can now join a permanent incursion corp and find a social identity, they may just pack up and leave more risky space completely. now, although this would suck more life out of the more risky space and make for a less vibrant universe, some would argue that increased social contact would be better for player retention. in fact, i support the proposed form of ""corp-lite"" which would allow the social benefits of, but none of the game rewards of a player corporation. therefore the problem comes back to the failure of implementing ""risk vs. reward"" properly in highsec - incursion are just far, far too rewarding for the level of risk. corbexx, what do you think is the best way to fix this without completely alienating players who love incursion gameplay?but back to the question of removal intracorp agression in highsec, my main problem with it is that it will lower the bar of formation of a corporation even more than it is. already, any one-month old player can form a corp, and spam invites to other new players. these new players will join, learn nothing, get frustrated and possibly quit the game. there are ""natural hurdles"" for running a corp in low/null/whs as if you are clueless and don't understand game mechanics your corp, or at least its assets, will not last long. but in highsec, the threat of awoxing is one of the few ways to ""test"" corps and to weed out the ""fail-corps"" that have no business existing. in any case, competent highsec corps have several mechanisms to protect themselves (security checks, dedicated training corps, etc.), so all this change does is protect the lazy and clueless ceo, and will encourage low quality corps to spam invites even more to new players as there is now zero risk to them. new players deserve recruitment into better corps than many of the ones plaguing highsec today that are run by players who do not understand game mechanics, or who are actively looking to exploit newbies with high taxes, and low ore buyback prices. if you are going to remove highsec awoxing, at least put some mechanism in the game to help get new players into the larger, competent highsec corps who care about training new players, or better yet, directly into a low/null/wh corp."
12/2/2014,"really? one of the main reasons stopping incursion corps is war decs not awoxing lets be honest here, not running wide with rumours and speculation.incursions need looking at everyone knows that its in the minutes. what really needs to happen is the incrusions that are over paid need it scaling back its pretty simple. so your issue here is you don't think newbies should be allowed to form there own corps since they don't know much? who should decide they have no business exsisting? you? your code mates? you sound really anti newbie, if they want to form a corp let them, if it fails it fails. if it succeds we might have the next brave newbie alliance. your arguement for awoxing needs to stay is that you feel the need to have some mechanic to grief newbie corps that might, just might not be up to some standard that you set? wtf!ok so you being able to awox people is fine, but people setting high tax rates isn't. i will let ccp know right now black pedro feels corps setting tax high in hisec is bad for newbies along with low ore buy back. yes last part would be useful and as you can see some stuff is happening to help like"
12/2/2014,"i agree. my comment was all speculation. i have no evidence for my view and cannot predict the future, but however neither can you. i was just pointing out that such a change may have more consequences on the distribution of the eve population than apparent at first glance. wardecs come with notification and can be dodged. highsec awoxing cannot and this is the biggest problem preventing incursion corps currently. i saw that in the minutes, and your comments there. that went a long way earning my support for your csm run (which you have). i agree by the way. i just wonder why this hasn't happened yet as it is so obvious. i can only assume ccp is concerned that the drastic changes that are necessary will upset a portion of the player base and personally, i am not sure the best way to implement them.nope. i think players should not be provided with free protection of their corp, yet given all the rewards of corp. i agree, if a corp is to fail it should fail - it should not be allowed to exist if it cannot manage the basic level of competence to protect its operations from outsiders. awoxing for all player corps is not some standard that ""i set"", but is a competitive standard that all corps are subject to. surviving/defending against awoxing is another proof of competency for a new corp (something brave managed to do, by the way). as i said i support a ""corp-lite"" mechanism where players can form a corp that is free from wardecs (and awoxing) but has none of the advantages of a player corp. but a proper player corp? it has to take responsibility for its own protection if it wants to reap the rewards of a player corp.it's just simple risk vs. reward.no, i think that removing awoxing will increase the number of exploitative (as well as just terrible) highsec corps. i would appreciate it if you relayed my concerns to ccp, and encourage them to continue to develop tools to give newbies a chance to avoid them. awoxing (as it is) only harms established players (with the assets that make awoxing worthwhile) who should know better, while high tax rates exploit new players who have just joined their first player corp and don't know better.but i will agree to disagree with you on this issue. the risk vs. reward problems with the income distribution in this game are much more important to me than awoxing, and your views on this match mine. and honestly, removing awoxing isn't going to change much at all - there will be no beneficial effect on newbie retention and players relying on awoxing to disrupt highsec corps will find other ways."
12/2/2014,"it's no coincidence that corbexx is not only a wormholer but the only csm to ever mention fashion to me.as we all know, wormholes are the supreme apex of any pilot's career in eve. it's the endgame, where everyone must wear their sunday best, dying like gentlemen (or ladies). corbexx understands this and has worked tirelessly in it's pursuit, consistently delivering results - he understands what wormhole space involves, what's important to daily life for it's residents and that we need to look good while living it. i even heard corbexx will push hard for the catsuit to finally move from sisi to tranquility.i'm voting #1 corbexx and so should you.good luck sir! part-time wormhole pirate <U+30C4> full-time supermodel <U+25B7> wor<U+043C><U+043D>ole d<U+03B9>ary + c<U+043D>aracer <U+03B9>o <U+25B7> sss"
12/2/2014,"corbexx: that just got you my first vote, sir!moving onto a question i have, space has become littered with abandoned pos structures. what is your position on getting rid of them? i'd like to see, perhaps, a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone. this, then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them. the current mechanic, of course, involves wardec-ing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures. i think something better is quite possible.-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/2/2014,"re: the whole in-corp aggression thing (it's not awoxing), can we agree that the root problem is the disastrous state of corporations and corporation management in eve, and that no fix short of a complete overhaul will be satisfying?the change to prevent in-corp aggression is an experiment, whose success ccp is (or should damn well be) monitoring. when ccp has the numbers to determine how well the change worked, they have the option to revert it if it was a wash or worse. the new rapid-fire release cycle makes that easy for them to do.the best thing csm can do, imo, is ask them to define success in terms of the impact of the change, keep on them to stick to that (and to rolling it back if it fails), and source and offer suggestions about how corporations should function in eve, and even (hat tip to mangala solaris) if corporations should be the only social organizations eve offers.as an aside, true newbies don't have to be ganked to leave. seeing it happen to their social group might be enough. i'm not going to speculate on whether or how often that happens, but if corporations are the glue that keeps people in eve, then the shattering of a corporation may well be enough to drive them away.oh, and +1 to corbexx, even if he did stand us up when we invited him to chat with us the first time."
12/2/2014,"here are the details about the issues i want to further if i get elected:- csm representatives can only be elected once. this is important to make sure the csm seats truly represent all players each year and does not become a stagnant pool of power players.- make sure new features that encourage small groups actions, like the siphons for example, do not get nerfed to uselessness before they are introduced by the established power groups- make sure api data availability does not provide too much out of game information, and allow some kind of in-game data privacy option.- encourage new features that would truly allow for a nomadic life style in new eden.- make some of the carrier paths that are advertised to bring new people in the game to become realistic, like bounty hunter.- request that all players link all their alts publicly, with a slight change in the eula - participate to the new upcoming sovereignty changes to give a chance to smaller groups to truly own something without having to rent it.- develop the new player resources and first experiences in a more integrated way within the game."
12/2/2014,"voici les details des sujets que je souhaite soutenir si je suis <U+FFFD>lu:- les repr<U+FFFD>sentants du csm ne peuvent <U+FFFD>tre <U+FFFD>lus qu'une seule fois. c'est important pour s'assurer que les si<U+FFFD>ges du csm repr<U+FFFD>sentent vraiment les joueurs et ne devienne pas une repr<U+FFFD>sentation stagnante de politicards.- s'assurer que les nouvelles fonctionnalit<U+FFFD>s introduites dans le jeu pour encourager les actions de petits groupes, comme les siphons par exemple, ne soient pas r<U+FFFD>duits a <U+FFFD>tre inutilisables a cause du lobbying des grandes puissances existantes.- s'assurer que les donn<U+FFFD>es fournies par les api ne donnent pas trop d'information en dehors du jeu, et permettre aux jouers de garder leurs donn<U+FFFD>es de jeu priv<U+FFFD>e, s'ils le souhaitent.- encourager de nouvelles fonctionnalit<U+FFFD>s qui autoriseraient un style de jeu nomade dans new eden.- s'assurer que certains chemins de carri<U+FFFD>res mis en avant pour faire venir de nouveaux joueurs soient vraiment r<U+FFFD>alistes, comme les chasseurs de primes.- forcer tous les joueurs a lier tous leurs personnages secondaires (alts) publiquement, par un changement des termes et conditions (eula)- participer aux d<U+FFFD>cisions sur les changements qui vont arriver au sujet des contr<U+FFFD>les de souverainet<U+FFFD>, pour s'assurer que les petits groupes aient une chance de poss<U+FFFD>der un coin d'espace sans avoir <U+FFFD> le louer.- d<U+FFFD>velopper les resources et les premi<U+FFFD>res exp<U+FFFD>riences pour les nouveaux joueurs, en les int<U+FFFD>grant mieux dans le jeu."

12/2/2014,"i was sending you an evemail when you sent that. i definitely intend to schedule an interview with you, and will try to run an 'ask me anything' session sometime too.i do, however, need to buy a better mic before doing so, as any of the people that have had the misfortune of being fleeted with me lately can attest to."
12/2/2014,may i recommend this:
12/2/2014,"always been a headset person rather than a separate mic person, because i've seen just how embarassing sounds from the rest of the world can be over comms.whether the mic is set off by someone's partner telling them 'get off that game and get into bed', or someone's mother yelling 'hurry up and do the dishes now', or a tornado siren, i've heard too many ridiculous noises transmitted to ever use anything but a headset."
12/2/2014,"woah woah woah! first, i think you need a campaign manager. (so i am assuming my take is 10%, this stuff has money involved right? oh what am i saying clearly it does, it's politics!) but more importantly, we need to discuss the set up at the green room for my newly found client. there need to be a jar. in said jar needs to be 184 blue m&ms. next to the jar needs to be a scented candle (lit) two warm bottles of water, a cold milk (1%) three moist towelettes, a copy of time from 6 quarters ago, and three fedos. i am sure there are reasonable requests for such an event. (clearly the post is meant to fall into the genera of humor. i mean how else during his ama section can i question him about the would you rather *redacted* to *direct family member's name* or *generic horrible things* involving *tender body parts* with a potato peeler.) i look forward to the date and hopefully can participate. the terminal end of the digestive system."
12/2/2014,"when i said 'ama', that was not intended to include any of mr. canal's questions."
12/2/2014,had one time when we missed target calls because a train was driving past someones house and they had their mic set to voice activation. no one on coms could hear anything except the train.
12/2/2014,"my name is corebloodbrothers, i was elected as a member of the ninth council of stellar management (csm), in order to represent you, the players of eve online. i am also one of the leaders of the volition cult alliance, a providence sovereignty holder and member of the providence bloc, which i function as one of their main fleet commanders. little did i know of what was ahead.i am 42 years of age, dutch (bad english spelling), father of 4 daughters, and i freaking love eve. csm 9 election was my first seat. i ran before, but for 9 i focused on just my own list, my , providence and other entities i have come to know over the years, such as rnk for example, who voted for me. i stayed away from all the backroom dealing that went on with the previous csm elections. so i had no crossvoting on my list, nor did i appear on other lists. and didnt need those either, i got voted in big.being honest and loyal to the people i fly with against. independent voters do exist, in fact, and i have had a lot of chats and eve mails with various people since i ran for csm, many of which i have never met before. also running fleets daily with on fixed hours and shared coms help, i a, a csm who plays the game daily, while giving respect to the new players and the casual pvpers, for 3 years now in the providence bloc. being a part of building the current providence, a region which sees medium sized skirmishes on a daily basis. upholding nrds, and turning the volition cult from 400 into ite current 1500 + sizehave no mistake, here in providence, we see ourselves as the last bastion of the <U+FFFD>not red don<U+FFFD>t shoot<U+FFFD> (nrds) policy in null, as well as a truly neutral zone. so for me, and my voters, this election alone was unique for provi. as the year progressed, so did we, under attack by hero we dominated the news even, which was scary for the state of null actually. and we saw ccp change, and eve with it. i like too think that if the whole null sec was divided into 20 groups, with 10 border wars, null sec would be saved.so, just elected, and i didn<U+FFFD>t even have time to let it sink in as the work just piles up: twitter account, google docsdrive, skype, hundreds of emails, not to mention the non disclosure agreement (nda)<U+FFFD>it is a bit overwhelming, even if was on cloud nine, as my wife even kind of congratulated me (since this will have impact on my real life) and my kids think i am the greatest, even telling everyone at school. a csm team where most are red to me ingame is funny to begin with.communication is key, so i set up twitter: @corebloodbro. which i use frequently, i am active on forums and other means of communication. within my regio through open sessions on mumble, eve email explodes sometimes, internal csm forums, all highly addictive for a eve junky with a rl and a job.in my evesterdam speech"
12/2/2014,got my vote again his year core good luck
12/2/2014,what have you done on csm9
12/2/2014,he is my true bloodbrother! i really hope we get the chance to work together on the csm 10
12/2/2014,if i remember right there was some crying from him on the jump drive/jump bridge changesi guess that counts as doing something
12/2/2014,i will be voting for core again this year. :)
12/2/2014,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
12/2/2014,"i think the most important thing is;endie, how do you feel about a compliant and subjugated scotland continuing as a card carrying member of the glorious united kingdom?"
12/2/2014,i can't hear you over the sound of my shackles rattling.
12/2/2014,"endie, what is the single biggest threat to eve being placed on the game history junk pile. let me direct your response a little so you get my mean. is it perhaps the never ending 'how to fix null sec' debate, or is it simply new players not resubbing after their trial because they weren't handled correctly."
12/2/2014,45%
12/2/2014,"the ""csm are not game designers"" thing needs to be qualified with ""but they need to be very interested, informed and articulate about the design of the game"".ccp have a pretty good track record of implementing things that some random blogger (or poster) dreamed up, but they do tend to be resistant to csms pushing what ccp see as their ""pet projects"". that's far from the same thing as ccp being unwilling to listen to csms who have something to say about game issues though. for instance i invested considerable effort in making the case of a pp nerf, and while ccp weren't much interested in my ideas on exact game design to solve the problem, it was absolutely within our remit to highlight the issue, explain in detail the secondary and tertiary effects and provide a quick response to the initial objections, eg:""power projection allows massive events like the battle of b-r to take place, and that was amazingly successful in recruiting new players. why would we want to disable such a powerful marketing tool?""played right, a ccp seat can allow you to have considerable influence on the future design of the game."
12/2/2014,"anyway im gonna vote for you because i like your ideas on game design, and i am confident you'll be an effective advocate for them, and with the talents i know you have, i'm equally confident that you'll also be a very valuable asset for the csm as a whole. endorsed."
12/2/2014,endie is a good man and will be on my list. seriously vote for this man he is the good stuff.
12/2/2014,"you are spot on with the new players element. we delayed our latest newbie drive because retention is absolutely vital to success as an alliance, and that is no less true of the game as a whole: we get jobs, move into new houses, get married, have kids, get promoted and more and gradually more and more of us drift away each year. eve has a strong newbie hose but it it could retain customers like wow did it would be huge.in games like wow, there are designed timelines for new players and the first hour or so is all about feeding rewards to get people hooked: the first level takes a few minutes then ding you get to advance; you get your first new spell, new items, new abilities, new zones and so on all carefull shaped around you as you progress.eve doesn't do that as well yet, for all that it is getting better with time, and that doesn't even bring into consideration how key it is to get new players talking to and joining up with others: a real core part of bni's success in retaining and motivating people, and something that most highsec (non-pvp) corps just don't do.it's a sandbox, though: ccp can give us tools (and we have been and should be pushing for better ones) but it is also up to us. i think that goons, reddit, bni and a few others do that really well, and that the next big growth for eve will come when we can turn every b-r into thousands more retained players."
12/2/2014,what are your goals for the csm?
12/2/2014,"i have removed some rule breaking posts.the rules:4. personal attacks are prohibited. commonly known as flaming, personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user. posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated.5. trolling is prohibited. trolling is a defined as a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting other players in an attempt to incite retaliation or an emotional response. posts of this nature are disruptive, often abusive and do not contribute to the sense of community that ccp promote.7. discussion of real life religion and politics is prohibited.discussion of real life religion and politics is strictly prohibited on the eve online forums. discussions of this nature often creates animosity between forum users due to real life political or military conflicts. ccp promotes the growth of a gaming community where equality is at the forefront. nationalist, religious or political afiliations are not part of eve online, and should not be part of discussion on the eve online forums.isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
12/2/2014,"my hope is to be able to influence ccp in the direction i have talked about on my blog: an eve of smaller groups, more frequent and more numerous wars fought between more localised actors. i want to log into tmc or en24 or crossing zebras and see reports from a dozen wars spread across eve.this may seem counter-intuitive for someone who has helped build goonswarm into the dominant actor in one of the two largest blocs the game has ever seen, but i feel passionately that an eve of smaller groups offers greater chances for more leaders, more new fcs and more content creators. that will be good for us, for the rest of eve and for the game as a whole.for this reason i would like to try and influence ccp towards denser populations; towards an eve that can see smaller groups stand alone and does not drive them into vast webs of neo-feudal relationships.i think that most players would love to be part of something more human-sized in an eve where a bunch of plucky new players can decide to take the plunge and grab a piece of nullsec to call their own without renting, without having to get the permission of one bloc and without bowing the knee to the other bloc.most importantly, i want to see it be extremely hard to remove an alliance from space as long as they keep turning up and defending it (not just using it, mind!) if someone doesn't defend their space, however then it should not require multiple fleets and masses of supers to swiftly take it from them."
12/2/2014,how do you think a smaller eve would work with currently existing entities like bni and the cfc
12/2/2014,will vote for you if you promise to post my music links into the csmccp skype channel
12/2/2014,"i hope that there is no need for the cfc at some point. i think that a lot of alliances in the cfc and n3 huddle together because they know that by themselves, under the current sov mechanics, they are just targets to allow the big boys to have a merrie weeke of low-risk entertainment.that's why i think, counter to received wisdom, that the new system should not make it easier to take sov. people are risk averse and if you make it easier to take sov then you just get even bigger groups. make it harder to take defended sov and the need for huge blocs reduces. i don't think you'd have mass resets the next week (although pl showed the way on that with phoebe, and are profitting by it) , but i think that without fear, you lose the major centripetal force that holds together otherwise-unstable blocs.hell, in most mmos you can't hold a 50-person guild together for a few months without drama and schism. i want eve to return to that default state of human turmoil and drama.if you make it easier to take undefended sov, but extremely hard to take defended sov, then the pls and the bls get content : because people think it is worth keeping showing up for fights, and that they are safe if they do so, even if they lose; but they also know that if they blueball or punt timers then they will swiftly lose what they have built up.edit: i just remembered you asked about bni. i thin that they are in a huge group for two other reasons: the first is that they actually want to be together because they have fun, much like with red and blue. the sandbox being what it is, i think that is great and to be encouraged, not artifically nerfed.the second is that kicking inactives on a grand scale is horrendous: bni are not as vast as they look on paper, huge as they are. that is something for the csm to keep raising with ccp."
12/2/2014,this man literally changed my life with his exquisite musical taste.
12/2/2014,will you be using the philosophy and tactics you currently empower in the 'goon intelligence agency' to the csm if elected?
12/2/2014,"hello friends,my name is bobmon, you might know me from being the ceo of evenews24.com. i started playing eve online actively in 2010. i got into the game through a couple of friends at the time who ran their own (dutch) corp. this corp was a member of a highsec alliance which at the time had an active wardec going on. i had no chance fighting, and so i got into spying and i'm proud to say that my first official task in eve was to spy upon my enemies!!between these beginning days and now i did many things such as: focusi think the most important job of being a csm member is to be a bridge between ccp and players as most as possible. players are the one playing, and their issues are the ones that need to be solved. if i would have to list them it would probably come down toof course these are just some of my personal topics that i want to address but i am open to whatever comes at me to discuss.why do you wanna become a csm memberover this past year, i have had a ton of eve-related discussions with devs, csm members and players, and it made me realise that we as a community have a lot of great ideas. i would love to focus these great ideas into actual small pieces for devs to take into account when working on projects. i have also worked together with a lot of different types of players making me able to understand differences in how groups respond to ''ideas'', also i want to make sure that the player doesnt get forgotten in the whole development of eve. change is foccused from top to button but through this mentality you forgot who actually play this game, the players. i want to make sure i represent those, the players and nobody else!ways to get to know me better?1) feel free to ask me questions in this forum thread2) check out my twitter3) check out my past articles 4) check out bob's corner where i talk about stuff that interests me5) feel free to mail me at: bobmon.eve@gmail.com if you want to talkendorsement:1) sion kumitomo2) tora bushido3) corebloodbrothers4) xander phoena5) endie6) manfred sideous"
12/2/2014,"the bellow concepts are just idea's based on either ccp idea's or player feedback! concept #1 ''hardcore player mode'' ccp rise talked about this a few weeks back and it got me interested. i did some thinking, and i liked the idea to have a ''special alt'' who is badass at doing pvp related stuff. hardcore player mode in my opinion should be based on the pirate faction lines, this would work because it would back up the fact that your char can always be shot, even in highsec by all other players. this char is special because once you ''unlock'' it you get a certain amount of sp that you can use on almost all pvp related skills.. with ''almost all'' i mean that i want to exclude every skill that doesn't require you to actually pvp in your ship such as:- no cloak and cloak related ships (bombers, probers)- no station skills- no poss related skills (only anchor maybe)these pirate faction chars would only have the capability to fly their own pirate race ships (maybe all pirate ships, haven't decided yet) because they created these themselves to fight off their enemies. the effect of them self designing their ships might result in a small extra bonus but again, not sure on this yet.pirate chars won't have access to wh space because their focus is to fight their true enemy, the big four factions. fleet wise i want these chars to basically be solo ''roaming'' <U+FFFD>cross new eden but i do think that they should be able to group up with other pirates of their faction but this might result in them getting some drawbacks at forming fleets or whatever. pirate chars should basically force a player to be on top of their game or they get killedpirates can maybe even make isk through killing people that do militia related stuff, and i would love them to be these little pricks who cause a lot of chaos everywhere their go.let me know what you guys think!#2 fix cyno ''turn pos shield on'' exploitthis is a exploit so lets thread it as one. fix would be easy by simply adding cyno rules to anchored and onlining posses(cyno rules can be found here"

12/2/2014,"i work for en24 and am not especially loyal to any organization so take this as you will. i noticed bobmon has a lot of energy when it comes to eve. he's loves this game of ours. i think he is secretly in love with ccp guard but i'm not sure. don't fire me but - one day we noticed themittani site was not updating news often enough and someone said it was because mittani had fired a lot of staff for, i don't know, for not towing the line or something embarrassing like that (not saying it is true, i don't know). some of the guys suggested we write about that and on en24 because it is a real story. bobmon refused. it was a non-starter to him. that showed a lot of character and integrity. the work environment at en24 is really good. there is no pressure to choose a side or tow a line. no hints dropped, no performance pressure at all. it's pretty cool. he pays well and on time.he obviously loves evelots of energy towards the communitygood relationships with ccpintegrityis a pretty cool boss"

12/2/2014,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:

12/2/2014,"to your first question, nah lets focus on spaceships shall we and im open to discuss things with whoever wants"
12/2/2014,"i have met bobmon in evesterdam, and we talk alot on skype, he s very dedicated, honest and a general nice guy. in game as pl he s probably a awsome **** spy, as any eve pkayer can pick his attitude.bob has the ability too listen and ask, good qualities for a representive. bob is enthousiatic when it comes to engaging players and runs eve24 almost solo on his dedicationi will ask my voters too put bobmon somewhere on their list, and looking forward too work with him in csm10 hopefully"
12/2/2014,"thanks core! you have my vote too, and i hope we indeed get to work together one day!"
12/2/2014,bobmon owns
12/2/2014,i've dealt with bobmon in the context of eve down under and always found him to be a dedicated and upstanding kind of guy. +1eve down under - a community for players in the autz
12/2/2014,i can live with this.........
12/2/2014,vote yes on a pro rainbow csm candidate!
12/2/2014,oww zeon
12/2/2014,inb4 ccp bobmon
12/2/2014,"good morning eve pilots,i can confirm that bobmon will be getting one of my votes. this is because the guy is very passionate about eve and certain areas in particular which coincide with my own feelings and areas that i also feel strongly about.having worked with bobmon over the last few months i can confirm that he has a great sense of right and wrong and is a good overall bloke who devotes a lot of his time to eve and en24. never afraid to help new writers or content creators. bobmon is an organisational mastermind (as shown by en24 being a great portal for all your eve news) and coercing writers and editors to do their jobs is like herding cats, and i can only imagine what dealing with those psychotic pl dudes is like! bobmon would make a great csm and i believe he has all the qualities to do a great job for the eve players and will not be afraid of asking the ccp devs the hard questions, as a reporter is want to do.i just hope he gets one of his en24 editors to check his statements before going to print, as regular readers of en24 can probably can tell you... his grasp of the english written language is tenuous at times!good luck bob!fly dangerous eve pilots o/mail liteen24 writer/editor, bl. line member, cfc spy.... oh wait forget that last one...."
12/2/2014,"what are your policies when you are in csm10, what are your plans for lowsec?"
12/2/2014,"i have always worked with the policy of: if you say you will look into something then you better do it. with this policy in mind i will focus on tasks handed to me until they are accomplished. lowsec should be a place for people to develop how to pvp as a pilot and as a collective group. the phoebe patch has been great because it now allowed smaller groups of pilots to harass the bigger guys. i'm very happy with this because it means that lowsec groups get their hands on lowsec assets and over time this will result in lowsec vs. losses instead of lowsec vs. a blob of nullsec. i do think we should look into how newer pilots/corps/alliance get into lowsec and make it more attractive for them to do so. in my opinion it should be possible for these newer pilots/corps/alliances to basically open the map, pick a system, move there and make it their homes (like you have in 0.0). in these new home, they can make their isk, grow as a group, think of ways to protect ''your system'' and possibly expand system wise. this will lead to conflicts that will result in an more active lowsec. the ways of making isk should of course not be too easy and should have a sense of pvp attached so maybe the new burner missions are a great base to work out off. now when a group gets ''too big in lowsec'' it should be in their interest to try and move to npc null or even try and poke at owned sov.td; lr = basically make lowsec a good breeding place for pvp pilots/corps/alliances without making lowsec easierps: i have probobly forgotten some things and i will add these over time in the reserved section"
12/2/2014,how do you expect to do what needs to be done on the csm if you can't even edit a blog site properly?
12/2/2014,"why should npc nullsec and lowsec lead to the ""endgame"" of sov nullwhy shouldn't they be separate entities for people who don't want to be in the sov game"
12/2/2014,"i don't usually reply to threads like this, but i feel like i need give my personal endorsement.i have cooperated with bobmon for a while as a guest writer on en24 and always found him available, hard working, and a willing listener to my opinions and ideas. the fact that he puts up with my tardiness is reason enough for me to give him my support."
12/2/2014,a very hard worker.bobmon would make a great csm member.
12/2/2014,lowsec/npc and such will all stay the same but it should purely be a optional grow path for an alliance to take. more alliances will provide content and content is good
12/2/2014,"setting aside the tired high -> low -> null theme park design, i'm going to focus on this:this is true, and it is a high sec concern because that's where new players wind up. so, do you have some ideas? what are the pain points here? how much of this is on the game's tutorial offerings? how much on official ccp helpers? how much on other players? how do corps and roles and poses help this? hinder it?also, you leave out step 1, which is currently a matter of urgent concern to ccp: how do new players find and join a corp in the first place?"
12/2/2014,"''first steps, roles and responsibilities aren't clear'' was a summery of the tuckman theory to answer your questions though: ccp is working on new and better tutorials and i think these will be great! it will still remain very hard to let new players understand eve, but it will help. i dont have any problems with how highsec works because its safe and yet not too safe. i would like to see though that highsec pushes more people in to pvp activities!in my opinion players find corporations as soon as they figure out that eve is way more fun while playing with others. i think its good that they sorta get thrown into the deep because it forces them to decide how their future looks! my main concerns are related to how changes happen within this game. usually, they fix one issue but create 20 more (jump fatigue for instance), and i think that we need to look a bit more in-depth to how things affect our game. another issue i have is that ccp devs fix issues that they have never experienced themselves, and this is really strange to me. ccp devs should be allowed to play eve themselves in order to find really out what is wrong."
12/2/2014,"i've known bob for a while now and his strong work ethic, dedication and personality all speak to the quality of person he is. he'll be a great csm."
12/2/2014,"fight a war, vote for president, drive a car, have kids, pay taxes....can't be on csm....what kind of ******** program are ppl running in that frozen tundra of a country??d1 out+1 bob for csm. this message brought to you by the people for bobmon for csm 2015!"
12/2/2014,ccp devs do play eve. they are just limited as to what role they can take in alliance thanks to t20
12/2/2014,this is true but not in areas that experience a lot off problems like capital warfare and such
12/2/2014,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
12/2/2014,good to hear that you have decided to run again.as you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10.here is our announcement:
12/2/2014,"can you elaborate on your reasons for this proposal? it seems to me that there are no advantages to this change in game mechanics, only complications. ""true"" newbies aren't affected by awoxing (they don't even know what it is nor have any assets of note to lose), so they are unlikely to change their behaviour. it only serves to protect highsec corporations by removing one of the few remaining risks to them. good highsec corps interested in training new players already have systems (background checks, dedicated training corps, etc.) to protect themselves, so all this does is encourage lazy and clueless ceos to spam invites at new players risk-free, and may result in more new players ending up in small, low-quality corps run by equally clueless players. this will make their first eve experience more frustrating than if they were recruited into a corp that demonstrated an understanding of game mechanics demanded to protect itself from awoxers, who could teach them about the game and support them properly.more practically, removing awoxing also makes highsec corp training and intra-corp events more difficult, and removes one of the few remaining tools that can drive conflict between highsec corporations. in my view, corporations should be meaningful and have value so players want to defend them - they should not be glorified chat channels. with that value should come the responsibility of defending those corporations from threats both external (wardecs) and from within (awoxing). do you agree that a better solution might be to create a lower-tier corp (that is a glorified chat channel), that is immune to wardecs and awoxing, but that does not get the current benefits (taxes, poses, etc.) of a player corp? new players and risk-adverse carebears can play there, while players who want the increased rewards and challenges of running a full player corp can still do so.in short, what do you think a player corporation should be in eve?"
12/2/2014,"a few things to chew on. i'm not going to pretend to offer answers, frankly; these are the sort of questions i'm happy to throw at space politicians. tl;dr: the problem isn't that there is risk--without risk, there is hardly any gameplay at all to logistics, it's just overhead--but that the gameplay options created by the current risks are lacking.that fearsome blaster catalyst is useless in any kind of engagement with a pvp fleet. it's a highly specialized fit with myopic guns (blasters), no prop and no tank, which is where it reliably gets ~600 dps--essentially, it's the shooty analog of the all-cargo-expanded industrial. if you see a pvp catalyst in, say, fw lowsec, the odds are that it will have rail guns, a prop mod, and at the very least a damage control. the reason this fit is at all attractive is the same reason the all-expanded-cargohold-ii nereus is attractive: the odds that anyone will shoot at you before your ship has done its job are essentially nil. tanking a ship that you intend to lose to concord is, obviously, stupid. but it's possible to fit a ship that way because it's not at all easy to engage one of those ships before it's pumping antimatter charge s into a freighter that's been bumped 250km off gate. one reason? if you shoot the cat before it shoots anything, concord comes for you.the other big problem with logistics is that the reason most freighter pilots afk their ships is not only safety, but... well... any... person... who's... atk... piloted... zzzz... a... freigajgdklakfafasdmwhere was i? oh, right. boring. not only that, but if you're caught, you're helpless--i think that, as much as any real or perceived risk, is what generates so much rage. if you jump through a gate and land on grid with a bumping mach... oh, well. you're not burning back to gate. you're not mjding away. you're not pulsing your mwd to evade the bump. you're just sitting there, indulging in what amounts to afk gameplay: watching as control of your billion-isk box is taken away from you, just like that.the generally proffered solution--alts--are a) something of a plague already; b) only substituted by real people at a much higher scheduling difficulty and risk; c) about to become more of a hassle with freighter pilots having to duel-request their webbing alts. (i wonder which will be the first ganker to duel-request an obvious webbing pilot at just the right time to trick them into accepting the wrong duel? can you even be in two duels at once?)now, i have heard of alert freighter pilots realizing that they were incidentally aligning with a celestial, and insta-warping away. it is possible for a freighter to get away from a bumper, if the bumper accidentally points the freighter at a celestial or a safe and the pilot reacts in time. but this is a bit like winning the lottery.(incidentally, it's possible to afk bump: turn on shiny mwd; select freighter; approach. this does not produce anything like the results of an experienced atk bumper, but it is possible, especially once you have the freighter off grid from the gate and pointed far off the ecliptic.)outside of high sec, bumping usually precedes o hai pandemic legion, freighters are even more hapless at gates when they're bubbled (so, afaik, they're bridged? only slowboated through maximally locked-down space? i don't know sov nullsec so well), and of course the idea of a convoy defending a freighter, like so many other great ideas, dies ignominiously in the face of fleet alpha and the lack of any line-of-sight mechanics. and outside of high sec, you can bring much more expensive alpha if you choose to."

12/3/2014,+ 10 interwebz
12/3/2014,"so are you telling us, that china can have it, but we can't?"
12/3/2014,"that's the change (talked about in csm minutes) that's being discussed in this thread.from my experience, it's because they're stupid anyway. so they don't have the correct information to give to the newbies, and then the newbie either quits or leaves corp and spreads bad information, causing a ripple effect. of course, there are some who learn otherwise. but i don't see that much."
12/3/2014,which is why wardec nerfs are clearly up and coming.i would much prefer ccp just introduce social only corps instead though. trying to have the same unit(corporations) as both a social community and a pvp group is the route of the issue.
12/3/2014,"you obviously don't understand the concept of awoxing. the entire reason to join a highsec corp for the express purpose of awoxing is members is so you can do so, this is the important part here, without concord intervention. making intra-corp combat cause concord to respond is, in fact, removing and prohibiting highsec awoxing, turning it into another form of suicide ganking. sure you could still gank the miners in a mining corp with a single character in the corp, but ganking anything bigger would require getting multiple characters into the corp, an unreasonable task for the ability to gank one or two mission runners."
12/3/2014,just like a cap ship (before they could use gates) getting stuck in a system with no station..... so too will sub cap ships get stuck on hi-sec gates with no fuel and no station to help.war targets rejoice!+1
12/3/2014,"ehh. -1afaik, capacitor is our fuel and we have infinite energy producing machines."
12/3/2014,that idea is already in the game. it's called a jump portal generator.
12/3/2014,"no, it's not. try reading again."
12/3/2014,"the removal of the corp on corp aggression 'hole' in concord responses is something we'd been talking to ccp about for a few months before the summit. just to give you a little context, and explain why there wasn't as much discussion on it as you might have expected for such a 'big' change.i'm, in general, comfortable with the removal. i'd prefer it to be able to be toggled; with a delay (maybe 12 hours + up to downtime), and clear notification to current, new and potential members) but if that's not an option, then i can live with it being removed.getting people into a corporation shouldn't have to be a pain in the ass. a newbie being invited into a corporation isn't going to have spent time reading up on corp mechanics. expecting them to have done it is naive. a group of newbies running a corp (because, for example, they came in as a group, and want a flag of their own) can be expected to have read up a bit more, but the 'concord won't protect you' isn't particularly clear anywhere.long term, i'm wanting to see fairly extensive changes to the social grouping systems of eve. not just 'corp and alliance', or the addition of corp lite. but the ability to join cross corp social groups (along with full discoverability for them. one of the biggest problems at the moment). being able to find spectre fleet, for example, and join it, getting into a channel, a mailing list, bulletins, fleet adverts (and restrictions) and possibly even having a small kitty for donations, would be good. sure, it's possible to do it with out of game tools, but those /suck/ for discoverability."
12/3/2014,"steve is a rad dude. he doesn<U+FFFD>t indulge in the drama of the csm, he works hard, and he has great ideas. he walks faster than anyone i<U+FFFD>ve ever met, and is preternaturally calm. i<U+FFFD>ve enjoyed this past year of working with him immensely, and i encourage you to vote for him this year to return him to the council. i<U+FFFD>m pretty sure he<U+FFFD>s a scottish ninja too."
12/3/2014,"another one i'm delighted to see running again! good luck, and you'll definitely be on my ballot :-d"
12/3/2014,all reps on fuzzy!+1
12/3/2014,"to be fair, the same could be said for any elected body. unfortunately, those who run for almost any type of election (unless appointed to do so by others, and most times, even then) tend to be of the extremely self-important variety.fortunately, the really important (albeit rare) qualifications for being a strong csm candidate are fairly simple.-the ability to listen and comprehend.-the ability to effectively communicate the thoughts of one's constituents in a comprehensible and cohesive manner.-the free time and desire to do the above.-the work ethic to follow through on the aforementioned desire.so far, i see 25% of that here."
12/3/2014,if only csm was what i pay my subs for i would vote for you. but fortunately enough it isn't.
12/3/2014,thank you for your help!
12/3/2014,edit : i used your idea and added some changes. see main post.
12/3/2014,"well, several of these are just straight up nerfs to ganking - something that is already pretty much unprofitable in all case except for overloaded haulers or bling-fit missioner/miners - i would like to ask more about this station lockout. while i don't think it is feasible (or fair) as there is no precedent for a game mechanic where players are auto-ejected into space, i am curious about your intentions here. in your view would such a lockout/eject system replace the 15 minute criminal timer, or be in addition? if i were an industrious ganker and had a bowhead full of gank ships in a safe spot, could i keep ganking?otherwise, a 30 minute lockout where i all i can do is just sit in space in a pod is not very compelling gameplay. i can think of several ideas that would actually make ganking more risky, but all these suggestions do is make ganking less profitable and more tedious, while doing nothing to give players a chance to actually ""get revenge"" on a ganker other than repeatedly blowing up an empty pod (which come rhea pod-loss will have no penalty).finally, ganking is at an all time low yet suppose to be in the game. do you really, really think that more nerfs are in order?"
12/3/2014,"i'd say that the problem is that it's too easy to mitigate risk with insta-warps, tacs, docking, and concord manipulation. right now, anyone who goes to the (admittedly not insignificant) trouble of prepping their active area and staying in fast-aligning ships is essentially uncatchable. oh, sure, a dedicated camp will catch them, but not the randoms warping around in pve ships and indies, nor (generally) the targets.sorry, this is terrible. five minutes after this comes out, anyone who cares will have a script running that detects that thing and triggers a keypress to dismiss it. yeah, that's a eula violation, but that just means that you're encouraging people to violate the eula. carrots, not sticks. how would you feel if you had to go afk because one of your kids acted up/got hurt/whatever, and you came back to find yourself under attack, tried to defend yourself/warp off, only to die because your keystroke(s) were consumed by a stupid modal dialog? it would actually be better to do what some other games do, and either publicly flag people as afk (star trek online) or just warn them a few minutes before logging them off (elder scrolls online).also, if you go afk in high sec for 20 minutes in your barge, you're going to come back to a barge sitting idly in a belt doing nothing--if you're lucky. the sort of huge rocks you can chew on for 20 minutes tend to be in lower security space.i'd strongly suggest finding and talking to miners before making assumptions about how they must want to play the game.yeah, there are issues, like the entire ancient rat ai system that's tangled up in the pos and drone code, and the lack of any toolset for creating pve content (which i understand is being fixed). talk to sugar and mike if you want to get a better idea.re: different ways of supporting social communities in eve, have you read any of mangala solaris' suggestions along those lines? e.g.,"
12/3/2014,"yes, they are. but that's much better then no ganking at all in high-sec you need to see this not only from a ganker point, but also from the ganked player. it doesn't really matter how you call the timer, as long as you are killable without the easy dockup option. 30 minutes might be a bit to much. 15-20min or so might be better. you should have docked up and ban the people who script. i dont agree. flagging is something different then what i want. i want people to be behind their pc when they are logged in. a notification a few minutes before you return to the login screen, of course that should be there.i haven't, but will do."
12/3/2014,"tora has been my business partner as a merc for almost a year.he never screw me over ""fine print"", despite hundreds of billions changed hands and trillions went boom. whatever he promises you, he'll deliver."
12/3/2014,"wow. ok.sorry, but if my kid's in trouble, i'm not going to do a damn thing in the game first, and i'm not going to limit myself to those systems with stations, either. the issue isn't that omg i might lose space pixels. the issue is that if i go afk i generally have a reason to, and i have accepted that going afk in a pvp game means that i might well come back to a fresh clone in my medical station, and i don't want to be nannied and babysat by some stupid modal dialog. i would rather be logged out.people go afk because a rational cost/benefit analysis makes it a sensible choice.if you want it, what incentive do you provide to encourage them to do that? i mean, if you did an honest assessment of exactly how much afk gameplay there is all over new eden, it would be staggering, and that's largely because of assumptions built into the core of the game. you want people to be at their keyboards while sitting on a titan waiting for a bridge? you want someone to atk pilot a freighter when the cost of sitting there glassy-eyed for 45 minutes watching glacial aligns and slow-motion warp tunnels is not worth the smidgen of time saved and a tiny bit of extra safety?if you wanted to, you could get rid of most afk gameplay easily: remove autopilot, the ""aggressive"" option for drones, and module auto-repeat. remove orbit and keep at range, and have approach turn off when your ship comes within 1km of the destination. done.do you want to play that game?"
12/3/2014,"same here, but then again, i wouldn't cry about a lose or any game mechanic when i get shot when that happens. you already have the same 'problem' now in eve. some click-able button won't make a difference. yes. to long afk while logged on in eve is bad. we all have our interruptions while we play eve (bio, wife agro, need a beer, door bell, phone, etc), but if they take to much time >>> auto log off."
12/3/2014,a couple of years ago i wrote a post urging a new perspective on the way we look at hi-sec here - i'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on how this meshes with your own ideas.fakeedite: huh that was actually almost 3 years ago. sic transit gloria mundi...
12/3/2014,"nah, i actually don't. there is no reason why game play that has been designed into the game (that is highsec ganking) should be made unplayable for no apparent reason. gankers are suppose to exist. the whole crimewatch/security status/concord mechanism is designed so highsec criminals can operate there.untanked, overloaded and unprotected ships are suppose to explode. that is part of the risk vs. reward design of the game (see ccp falcon's comments).if you have some suggestions that make this game play more interesting - that is more challenging for gankers or more interesting (in terms of revenge or whatever) for gank targets, i am more than eager to hear them. or if you have some specific type of ganking you think is overpowered - perhaps you think freighters are too weak still and need a buff - then i will consider your arguments. but if you are just going to say ganking = bad so we need less of it, then at least propose a more ""fun"" mechanism than 30 minute lockouts. something like turning off offensive modules in highsec so gankers can at least do something else then float helpless in a pod for 30 minutes. aim higer tora! try to make the game better! i want to believe!"
12/3/2014,"you do realize that this doesn't increase pvp in any way as the gankers can't dock up to get new ships. all this does is cut the number of ships that a single gank fleet can kill in half, or require them to use extensive orca/bowhead support. i'll send you a similar suggestion that i have for increasing conflict between gankers and anti-gankers. we have already targeted gankers pocket books (insurance changes) and increased safety for miners/travelers (barge/freighter ehp buffs) in high sec enough. further steps need to be taken to increase the interaction with those that oppose ganking.for the record, i want anti-gankers to be more sucessful. currently their job is exceedingly difficult but but making high sec safer is not a good option. edit: i just realized that i misread that, your proposed penalties are only for people in npc corps. that is fine, but i don't understand why you want a reduction on loot drops. blue loot should be the primary profit margin for anti-gankers, and gankers already have to deal with the fact that they get no insurance on ships. keep loot the same. why don't you send these suggestions to james and see what he says.founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/3/2014,"first i was like ""who da frakk iz dat tora hisec scrub?"" and then i was like ""ooooh, marmite's ceo"" and then i +1."
12/3/2014,"anything that will increase the interaction between gankers and anti-gankers is something i will support. blue loot would be ok too. i mainly have an issue with freighter ganking right now. it's way to hard to protect yourself from it. even if a freighter hires marmites to camp the entire system, escort if from a to b, it's still easy to gank it. mining barges can at least be pvp fitted as bait, align, etc."
12/3/2014,"then maybe the randoms should set up dedicated camps instead of having ppl undock forcibly? i think this has about zero chance of ever making it into the game though, i just can't see ccp forcing players to undock. afk'ing: ppl can afk what they want as far as i'm concerned, it should be the players providing consequences to others being afk, not the game. undeccable corporations and remove npc? meh, that's substituting one crappy mechanic with another crappy mechanic. ""don't nerf eve to death"". well, it seems to me that is pretty much what you are advocating sir tora."
12/3/2014,"dedicated camps against npc gankers, good luck. ccp can do anything, even if they have to make you walk your fedo every day. i am against things as afk mining or afk cloaking in nulsec. good luck doing something about afk cloakers. the biggest diff between npc and 'my' way, is that people can start to learn how corps work and group up. the community thing is what makes eve such a great game."
12/3/2014,"remember, i am not going to run for csm x for just the tora ideas. i want to listen to all sides and find common grounds. if i would just listen to one side, the game would be unbalanced and people will leave this great game. i want content in eve, fun interaction, tears and profit, keep all old players, get more new players, etc."
12/3/2014,"you had my vote until i read this. you're viewing ganking like a carebear; as if the ganker is ""bad"" and the gankee and/or whiteknight is ""good"" or some such nonsense. it has nothing to do with who's bad and who's good, it's simply a play-style. furthermore, why punish those who enjoy ganking, again? the buff to barge/exhumer hp wasn't enough? the countless concord buffs? removal of insurance fraud? the buff to freighters? the removal of blood jumping? the ""rebalance"" to the bowhead? the gankee literally having everything needed at their fingertips to avoid being ganked, yet is too lazy to even f10. have you forgotten f10? star map > stars > statistics > ships destroyed in the last 1hr/24hr? do you really believe that highsec needs another buff? as much as i agree with this (and i do), it's just not going to happen. going afk doesn't break any rules posed by ccp. needless to say this would also effect everybody, even those who dock in station to go afk making docking to go afk for a quick irl thing pointless; might as well log off in space and maybe not won't log back in. who-knows? for those that have multiple accounts this would get old fast. logging into a game shouldn't be a chore. i am a little surprised to see you wanting a nerf to highsec wardec mechanics. regardless, i tend to agree that many new player corps get decc'ed to death. however, as it's been said several times before, owning a corp is a privilege and not something that every player should jump right into without learning more about the game... and thus the wardec mechanic helps, as you put it, delete the weak; ceos and players who shouldn't be anywhere near owning a corp.i made a corp a while back and was never decc'ed. i personally believe this comes back to the overall mentality of the corp, the ceo and the players he/she invites. or, in other words, if a corp gets decc'ed, they did something wrong. and, hey it's not like they can't drop/reform the corp. for better or worse npc corps/agents will never be removed; at least not anytime soon.i fully support this idea."
12/3/2014,"definitely gonna support tora for csm, excellent!"
12/3/2014,your thoughts about a 1 minute timer for people who steal loot ? so they cant dock up right away.
12/3/2014,i can fully support tora as an intelligent alternative for the csm. i would hope that he can help bring balance - everything does not need to be equal but a better balance would be awesome. in particular - loot thieves need to have some delay posed on them before they can re-dock after going suspect.when it come to high sec merc wars and the like he gets it and i benefit from all of his labors . . tora tora tora
12/3/2014,"so let's review your idea of 'auto-undocking'. as a ganker, i would have an orca or bowhead in a safespot, boarding ships from there. if you think carebears or 'anti-gankers' are gonna form up to scan down my pod warping from safe to safe and setting up you are sadly mistaken. they don't camp stations now, they don't set up traps in the belts now, they don't figure out where my insta-undocks are. which are real easy only a couple of 100km from station in general, sometimes even still on grid and in plain view for anyone to see. if that may seem a bit sloppy to you (it is), it's only because of there is no need for me to do any better atm. so, currently they don't hunt me despite knowing where i undock and dock, knowing where i am going to strike (ice field/belt with the poorly tanked miner). that's how simple they have it atm, if they're not doing it now, expecting that they will go through even more trouble scanning down a pod and hunting it while it warps between several safes is, let's stay polite, 'a bit naive' at best.... it will only make catching a ganker harder and more tedious (dunno about you but if i was hunting a ganker i'd be quite worn out the 10th time i scanned him down just to have him warp to his next safe the moment you land on grid), and it will make ganking more tedious too. so a lose-lose situation there.but let's say the do manage to catch me (fat chance but in theory it is possible), i get popped, wake up in clone vat, get ejected. oh boy! they're gonna get some double revenge now ey??? \o/ erm, no, at that point, my pod will be empty. that's a zero isk kill if they get me the second time. ""haha, but your clone cost, haha!!!"". well, that 'problem' will be gone in 6 days come rhea, but maybe you missed the upcoming clone changes. in short: clones will be free come rhea, zero isk paid. so, at that point, i could not care less how many times i am podded and will be doing something else on my alts, being afk till the timer wears off or simply logging off, while getting ejected out of station every 40 seconds or so into the arms of an angry mob for 30 minutes. although i think that mob will very soon get bored once they realize they are not ammounting to anything and will be ridiculed throughout the chat channels and forums. shooting repetively at something that doesn't gain you anything will just make you look silly. so this is what we will end up with: gankers getting autoejected repeatedly out of station with just the odd passer by caring enough to lock and fire at them out of boredom or daftness. gameplay: none, for neither of the parties involved and ridicule all around for ccp for implementing such a meaningless feature and the ppl shooting the pods claiming they are achieving something. as for non-deccable corps, they will come with non-deccable pos-es, which will be filling up the entire space of high sec in a few months time with the deccable pos slowly dying out as it gets replaced by non-deccables. they will also be a great place to hide for gankers, who will most likely be exchanging passwords to hide in each others bases. you could argue no setting up posses for the small corps, but that's just pushing them further towards npc status again. you would also be pissing off plenty of small corporations that currently run their own pos. i've been in one that was under 10, we had our own pos, taken from another small corp even and we were quite pleased with it. not only will your highsec be filled with undeccable posses, it will also be filled with undeccable bear corporations, above 15 member bear corpos will simply disolve into several smaller ones and share a chat channel. becuz of ""i just want to mine/mission/run sites/whatever in peace to relax!""-argument. your view on highsec is so aimed at making it a themepark with eve graphics that i seriously consider the possibility that you, the ceo of one of the largest highsec pvp groups, are trolling... ps. if trolling then all i can say is: well played sir!"
12/3/2014,"hell, why not let them have 15 minute auto-eject from station timer too?"
12/3/2014,"ok then, what changes would make an escort more useful to protect a freighter? any ideas that could make even a small escort completely protect a freighter from a gank? there are already some strategies you can use like ecm, repping or webbing a freighter into warp, but maybe there is something else that would be more useful?i agree people who go to the trouble of hiring an escort/bringing friends should be much safer from a gank. what additional game mechanics could we add to the game to make this happen?"
12/3/2014,"maybe you should stop crying about how bad things are in eve and start coming with solutions ? it easy to shout from the sideline, much harder to be constructive. as i said before, being a csm isnt about having all the answers to eve problems. it's listening to good idea's from the community, finding common grounds, filtering the ""ohhh everything is so badddd"" cries, ignoring the trolls and trying to make things better in eve for all of us.tldr : stop whining, start being constructive."
12/3/2014,a self destruct module that is guaranteed to destroy all cargo and fittings? if not afk... then no profit for gankers!
12/3/2014,"the funny thing is, somehow you've come around (mostly) to my position. auto log off is vastly preferable to stupid modal dialog boxes.and i realize that i'm not voting for you to get your exact current ideas implemented; i'm asking questions to see how you think, because that matters.i'm not sure about no-autorepeat-ever, though. maybe only some things can auto-repeat? i know that one of the attractions that this game has for me, at my age and with my complete lack of experience in high-adrenaline videogames, is that it doesn't require twitch play. its rts quality is appealing. i'd want to find some middle ground between mashing f1 all the time because of the fast rof on small blasters, and the set-and-forget rr sentry dominix.re: ganking, i posted a thing in radu lupescu's csm thread. the relevant bit is:all this is a way of asking whether the problem is actually the fact of (high sec) violence, or the fact that it frequently breaks down to an actor absolutely controlling a target to the point where the target is effectively just an observer--which is not compelling gameplay, right? this isn't just about putting high slots on freighters (i'm not suggesting that!), it's about looking at ways to take away that completely helpless feeling where possible."
12/3/2014,"1. check route (f10 is great at this and so is dotlan).2. don't carry over 500m/isk worth of space stuff; 1b/isk tops.3. fit tank, i hear reinforced bulkheads work wonders.4. use a web; despite what you say about the dueling issue... you only need to duel request once if you do it right. as an active bumping mach pilot there are 2 ways to make me avoid you and both of those are listed above. stop being lazy."
12/3/2014,"i was expecting tora to be a voice for competitive gameplay in highsec.instead we have self-interest disguised as protecting newbies (increased wardec fees are something marmites can afford but their smaller competition cannot, so it will make them more hegemonic in predatory wardecs). we have some of the most extreme suggestions for nerfing ganking that have been made by anyone not named veers belvar, and we have no suggestions to teach newbies how to defend themselves from predators.i retract my previous endorsement and apologize to the eve community for my poor judgement in having made it."
12/3/2014,does loyalanon know that?
12/3/2014,"i will agree. the intracorp aggression mechanics (which can be used for awoxing) are probably the least of the problems facing highsec corporations. the real question is what do you view a corporation as? is it just a ""clubhouse"" where friends can join up to form a social entity, or are they game entity designed to compete with each other in all areas of space including highsec? the game doesn't really know seem to know either as although there are some advantages to being in a player corp, they are not persistent or unique at all (all corps are the same) so there is no real reason to defend them in the case of a wardec.forgive this, but here is an outline a better designed corporation system that respects risk vs. reward:have two ""tiers"" of corporations, a ""protected corporation"" and a full corporation, and a series of persistent deployables that can be reinforced and have to be defended (like pocos). the ""protected corporation"" enjoys full concord protection from wardecs and awoxing, but has only minimal advantages (chat channel, corp contracts, a few others). the full corporation is as now, with the ability to set up poses and these new deployables which will provided a distinct bonus to pve activities like mining and missioning. this will allow players to tune their risk to match their capabilities and interest in defending their corp.let me illustrate how it would work with a story.1) let's say a relatively new player recruits some of his real-life friends and they want to make a go at starting a new mining corporation. the set up a ""protected corp"" and start the business of setting up their mining operations, recruiting, and getting to know one another and their only risk is the odd suicide ganker. after a month they decide to upgrade their corp to ""full"" status so they can deploy a compression array at a pos to make more profit on their activities.2) a week later, a rival corp in the system notices the asteroids are being depleted, some words are exchanged, and the rivals hire some mercenaries to wardec our new corp. after a few losses, the new corp realizes that they aren't quite ready to defend their corp and decide to pull down their pos and surrender for a small isk cost, and now immediately return to a ""protected corp"" status for an enforced minimum period of time (two weeks?). they can carry on mining as before, just without the advantages of the full corp.3) a month later, they have recovered and grown. they are much larger, have recruited some players with pvp experience, and decide that to go to ""full"" corp again. they set up a pos, and decide to invest in some large, permanent deployables to increase their mining yield in the system (or cluster?). these cost several hundred million isk but provided a few percent bonus on their yield so they pay off in the medium term and therefore are a valuable (and vulnerable) corp asset. now when some trash-talking leads to a wardec, the corporation has a strong incentive to fight, or hire mercenaries, to defend these deployables or lose their investment.something like this could make wardecs meaningful and restore some risk vs. reward to highsec.since this is your csm thread corbexx and highsec corporation mechanics aren't in your primary wheelhouse as a wormholer i will stop here with this discussion of wardecs. but i would encourage to extend your view of risk vs. reward to highsec wardec mechanics if they come up for discussion on the csm. as i just posted in sion kumitomo's thread, there is suppose to be risk in highsec, and awoxing, wardecs are a large part of that."
12/3/2014,"hehe , i ll post a bigger post soon, for now wintersummit yet even to come. on the jb i guess i was vocal as i felt that interregional jb use versus intraregional makes a big diff, where as the one is used to travel the null sec powrr projection highway, and the other is used for your day to day null sec operations. having said that i know wh, low sec and npc null never had the luxury at all of having them. the question if fatique and cooldown are where we want them as a evaluation i did send in indeed for the summit which i been invited too in jan"

12/3/2014,"i am sugar kyle and i will be running for reelection to csm x.during the last year i have worked to repay the trust that you showed when you elected me and i believe that i have been successful.i promised to communicate. i have. i have written my weekly posts where i list what i am involved in and give my opinions and thoughts. i have been running open q&a<U+FFFD>s where anyone who would like to come talk to me on neutral ground can do so. i am available almost every day in my chatroom in game and i spend most evenings talking about eve in game, through both eve-mail and e-mail, as well as twitter, skype, the forums, and comms. i attend eve events, both local meets and larger gatherings such as eve vegas.i promised to work. i have. i<U+FFFD>ve been an active member participating in meetings, forum posts, and skype chats with ccp. i heavily participated in writing the minutes which we released to the public six weeks after the summer summit. i have focused on quality of life improvements generated around pve. some broken level v missions have been fixed. suggestions like like warping your fleet to an escalation have been added. i was also the push behind rebalancing escalations so that sites escalate through high sec, low sec, and null sec. i have been active in the community collecting the feedback of the playerbase and taking that to ccp as major changes have been released one after another.i promised to listen. i have. my time on the csm is about listening to the players and bringing that to the table. many issues have multiple sides. i may have my own opinion and those that i represent have another. i will bring both of them with me. there is no one way to look at eve and i believe that the voice of the players creates the soul of the game. this position is as much about listening as it is about speaking. i have been willing to listen to opinions and ideas that are contradictory to my own and been willing to accept and represent gameplay different from my own.i came to csm9 on a platform to bring attention, awareness, and improvement with my focus on low sec. i believe that has happened. csm9 has taught me how to fight the good fight and bring things to ccp. low sec is in a better place but that does not mean that it is perfect. as ccp moves towards changes to null sec, low sec will be affected and that effect must be accounted for. the changes to power projection have changed the dynamic of low sec and we have to make sure that low sec remains the uniquely interesting place that it is. my time on the csm has encouraged me to expand my knowledge of eve. i may live in one area but i represent players from all over the game. to me, this position is about improving eve for all of us. it is about preserving the unique things that the players make. it is about bringing to ccp what eve means to its players and bridging the gap between development and what players have created. npc null sec needs love as well. sov null may be a major topic on the table but that does not mean other things cannot be improved along the way.we have challenges coming in 2015.corporations, alliances, and starbases are on the table. these are all areas close to my heart. they are also areas where i have spent time and effort this last term collecting player input and opinion to give back to ccp as they revamp these important game mechanics.there are so many things to do. war decs need to be discussed and looked at against the future changes for corporations and structures. markets and contracts need attention. i<U+FFFD>d love for boosters to get a serious rebalance as well. pve has received attention and this needs to continue. the entire pve experience needs to be improved and expanded in all sectors of space. i<U+FFFD>d love for there to be more dynamic and active ways to mine for those who wish to do industry in more dangerous areas of space.i am asking you to elect me again.the csm has made me appreciate and love this game more. i have the time, dedication, and experience to help improve eve. eve is what we make of it and i am here to, with your help, make it the fantastic place that we all want it to be.my csm9 candidacy thread."

12/3/2014,"i don't see how intra-corp aggression mechanics are any more counter-intuitive than the rest of the game mechanics, especially in highsec. it may have been implemented as a byproduct of the coding which allowed corp-on-corp interactions, but has grown to serve a very real role in the training and culture (intracorp sparring) of many highsec corps. removing it will be a headache, especially for larger highsec entities who use it routinely.what is next, removing wardecs because it is ""unintuitive"" that when you join a new corporation (that is in a war) you might become a war target to someone else? or remove suicide ganking because it is ""unintuitive"" that concord may not be able to save you all the time?these risks are what make the game interesting to play (otherwise everyone will just fit max yield/cargo), and are honestly the only significant non-consensual risks to players in highsec (although to be clear, dying unexpectedly to a corpmate is probably at least an order of magnitude less frequent than the other two). i agree there is no ""right way"" to play, but there is a ""right way"" to design a sandbox game - and that is to implement at least some measure of risk vs. reward balance across all activities. if you want a 100% safe space for new players then just make one (as part of a npe revamp?) with the appropriate levels of rewards, but highsec is suppose to be a place with risk as ccp falcon has recently reminded us. best of luck on your csm campaign."
12/3/2014,"i'm not worried about the impacts on culture or training. rvb's use case is entirely valid, and while i share your concern there, it also comes down to a comparative harms argument. to that end, mangala of rvb and i have gone over this extensively, and we're both confident that ccp's planned implementation will be solid. could that change? sure, it's possible, and time will tell.as for the rest, i don't own a set of skis so i try to stay off of the slippery slopes."
12/3/2014,"hey everyone,my name is ambar khardula and i am running for a spot on csm x. i'm currently a sophomore in eve university and i own evecast.net which is an up and coming blog network. i am a semi-newb, having joined back in july of this year. i found eve online through my best friend and partner and i immediately fell in love with it. this is my first time doing something this big in the mmo world, but not my first time in life. i am running for csm x on the platform of accessibility, open communication, and the new player experience.focus issue #1 - accessibilityfocus issue #2 - new player experiencewith all of this in mind, i am asking for your support and assistance so i can become a member of csm x and represent new eden's best interests. if you would like to talk, please send me an eve mail or email me at ambarkhardula@gmail.comthanks,ambar khardulayou can also find this information on my blog: the khardula chronicles"
12/3/2014,what other acessablity issues are there besides vision and how would you address them?how would you change the new player experience without losing the established base of players?have you discussed any of these issues with csm 9?
12/3/2014,"hi dradis,in response to your questions:in my experience, other accessibility issues vary from vision to hearing and speaking. i've read some threads on other forums about how mumble & teamspeak aren't very accessible to those who having a hearing disability. in the same way, both platforms aren't very open for those who have speech issues. to address this, i would suggest that when an fc gives commands over voice, that someone in the fleet/group is delegated to type the commands into the fleet/group chat.as far as changing the new player experience i wouldn't actually change the in game mechanics. i would be interested in setting up an automatic eve mail/email to be sent to the new player when he/she/zey join the game. in the message, i would have a welcome, list of resources, list of new player friendly corporations and a link to the in game help chat channel. in my opinion, the in game mechanics are doing fine, but it tends to be a bit difficult to know what do as you start out. i've spoken to some new players who joined when they watched the recent ""this is eve"" advertisement and several had not played mmo's before and others had only do so casually.i have not discussed these issues with csm 9. i submitted a support ticket and was told about the chat and in space menu settings but nothing else seems to have come of that.i hope this has answered your questions dradis. thanks for asking!"
12/3/2014,"this seems impractical for large scale battles, where time is an issue. i would suggest a speech to text system ccp can adopt or for ccp to allow a 3rd party to make one available for eve integration. not perfect but a step up."
12/3/2014,"in my experience, text to speech isn't reliable. with all of the different accents, talking speeds, and background noise, tts isn't the way to go. i use text to speech with my smartphone all the time and i'm able to get what i want about 80% of the time. but with this being brought up, there can be discussions on how to address the issue."
12/3/2014,"i appreciate that someone is keeping in mind accessibilty issues in eve. that said, what in game experiences do you have to draw on, and what areas of eve do you feel qualified to talk about during csm discussions?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/3/2014,"hi!are there any particular aspects that you would like to see accentuated in the new player experience, in order to prepare the new players for the reality of eve?you have any thoughts on the pve that eve offers at the moment?"
12/3/2014,"i've played a different mmo (a cooperative gear grind type game, one in which voice communication was universal among even casual endgame players) alongside a person that was deaf. accessibility issues are too often invisible in gaming, but they are extremely important to community cohesion.the thing is, despite wanting to make hearing or visually impaired people more welcome in games, i simply don't know enough about the exact barriers these players face, let alone appropriate solutions. in the event that i am elected and you are not, i will certainly solicit feedback from you on accessibility issues and take it to the csm."

12/4/2014,it's possible to deal with this if only a part of all shares can be bought.
12/4/2014,i'd rather stay private.
12/4/2014,ccp seagull is correct about recruitment. i disagree with the arguments that new players in high-sec need to experience the risk of awox. i also disagree though with being able to run highly profitable industrial corps in highsec without the same risk people outside highsec face. for this reason i think corps should stay able to be wardecced and awoxed.the solution is as tear jar states to allow easier formation of groups and communities outside of the corporation mechanic while providing more incentives to be in a corp in order to keep them viable.

12/4/2014,"my closing statement.this is an interview. look at the different people that are applying for this job.all you need to ask yourself is this: will this person try and help ccp in their efforts to make the game more balanced and think outside of the box for new and innovative ways to play?if you vote for someone based on their alliance, whether you like them personally or on some reputation as a player, you will be doing eve a disservice and shooting yourself in the foot.that is the essential problem with democracy. incompetent people are winning elections based upon charisma and social connections.you deserve the csm group that you vote in to the jobs.blah blah stuff followssimply put, two over riding goals: more good fights and less easy kills proportional representation on the csmthe mechanics are in favour of the attackers. for example, i suspect there has been no play testing to check the reactions of gate campers and miners when they stare at one object for a few hours.null sec is far and away over represented due to having voting bloc. people vote to represent their groups and personal interests. i suggest we have one negative and one positive vote or alternative you can abstain. one coalition can not down vote all the candidates that they do not like, while the whole of eve can knock one candidate down.whether ideas are good or bad they can still generate new game concepts:- orca and rorqual mini-bubble-pos shields- absorb modules - auto d-scan (slower than manually clicking but saves your mouse and fingers, worm hole love)- further consolidate null sec- anti-afk cloaking sov structure- force recons become cloaky hunters.- getting veterans to break away and maybe take newbies with them from npc corps.- missions, npc protection & contracts (bounties and escorts)- mining discussion- sov alternative - blobs and system performance.so on and so forth.miscas for how i handle things, i do try to add a bit of humour to my stance. probably fail a lot and if people are laughing it is probably at me but hey ... laugher is still good for us all.my eve storyi have a dream!jenshae chiroptera wrote:it seems you guys think i am shooting eve down, being negative about it, how about looking at it from this perspective: i think eve is a fantastic game the fixes, improvements and such that i am campaiging for are relatively small things in order to take what i feel is excellent toward perfection! reaver glitterstim wrote:jenshae chiroptera wrote:i am not so much trying to stop ganking, as i am trying to push for ways that the victims can counter ambush or stand up against the gankers instead of running. add another layer to this aspect of game play.see now this is an idea i can get behind. it has always bothered me that mining ships are so one-sided. they should be given the tools to fight back, even if fitting for combat reduces their mining output. that's a choice to let the player make, not one that should be forced upon them.you know what i'd like to see on mining ships? utility highs with unbonused missiles, instead of or along with drones! ... and the beauty of unbonused launcher hardpoints is how easily you can instead fit a cloaking device, probe launcher, or capacitor mod in them. ...i just feel that a big part of why miners feel powerless is because their ships are powerless.proc now + 2x missile launchers, possibly? i need you.if you do think that i or any other candidate will do a good job then it is your responsibility to inform people in your local, corps and friend lists.there is nothing more effective at spreading an idea than word of mouth."
12/4/2014,i agreed with most of what you say:miners need a way to fight back if they are not afk and you have some good ideas on that.i don't not like you cloak solutionsthe purpose of any recon and stealth is to get info on your enemies. there should be a counter but fuel and timers aren't the best solution i think to this problem. i do think that cyno should be removed from everything smaller than a cruiser. sb should not have that capability.your close to getting my vote.
12/4/2014,"if you do not want to vote for me, please consider one or more of the following:new candidates:lorelei ierenditrinkets friend had to withdraw. ambar khardula withdrew - raises valid concern of impairment compatibility.marlona sky - biomassed. eve? wth?! current csm recurring candidates:mike azariahsugar kylecorebloodbrotherscorbexxsion kumitomo yes, ""grrr goons,"" but i like how he says what is on his mind in a straight forward way.there have been a lot of questions regarding me and core, whether somehow we are gaming the system or not. it is purely coincidental. i just set out to try and prove this .... but apparently, the first time i had any involvement in csm matters, i had already heard of volt.so, all i can say is that if you look at what we write about, i am not some sort of ghost writter trying to gather more voters to support him.i am surprised and really disappointed in people that this could reach this point:"
12/4/2014,"i think if there were a negative vote, you would have one and again one positive vote.

12/4/2014,"jenshae:as an old boss of mine used to quote to me many times, ""democracy is the worst form of government...except for all the others.""yes, democracy and the csm are far from perfect, i agree. history has shown, however, that the csm has been effective in stopping the abuses that spawn it, so that can be seen as a win.i've been through some of the earlier posts that you referenced and find problems there as well. you don't seem to offer any reasonable alternative to the csm, and a few of your ideas, such as making sure someone is ""qualified"" to be on the csm either don't work on the face of it, or need to be far more developed.you may be right that large voting blocks control the csm, but i am not convinced. if, however, that is the case, i think a reasonable stab at the situation might be to improve the apathy and misconceptions that the player base has about the csm.what do you think?-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/4/2014,"freedom of speech matters but ffs, u are in my alliance lol, your voice is your own ofc, not mine nor provi blocgoodluck"
12/4/2014,"if you can actually make that happen, you have a heretofore undiscovered talent."
12/4/2014,"that's the problem.i would actually like to see a possibility of actively voting for ""no one"", so people can show that they are interested, but can't/don't/won't support any current candidate."
12/4/2014,edit: due to your decision to no longer run on the platform of abolishing the csm i'm forced to pull my support.
12/4/2014,"while steve may still have some terrible ideas about afk cloakers lurking in his brain, he has proved to punch way above his weight in value, as expected. based on some level of reading between the lines, i don't think ccp would have gotten as far with crest this year as they have without steve there to provide the voice of the customer - in this case the data customer.steve strikes me as a solid, rational guy and his value to both the csm and ccp is pretty obvious after watching him for a year. i already know he'll be getting an endorsement from me when i get around to writing that post.steve deserves to get back on csm; make sure he's on your list!author of interstellar privateer shattered planets, wormholes and game commentary"
12/4/2014,"thanks to fill in a little detail about the first comment:i don't like afk cloaking. so i think there should be some counter gameplay to it. (not fuel, or having to rehit the button. that's dull and uninteresting). something so that, with time and effort, you can 'hunt' the cloaker. an active one is safe enough, as they can move, and force people to restart."
12/4/2014,"steve:to be honest, i don't know too much about your work on csm9 beyond your review of the first post here, but knowing what has happened in the last six months (since i've been a player) indicates to me that you've been a solid advocate of things both in and out of just actual gameplay. some of your ideas on pos and industry remain intriguing.so, i'd like to ask you some question (which i know you've now seen) that i'm asking of folks i'm seriously considering.space has become littered with abandoned pos structures. what is your position on getting rid of them? i'd like to see, perhaps, a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone. this, then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them. the current mechanic, of course, involves wardec-ing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures. i think something better is quite possible.eve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game, perhaps moving into the hobby realm. i'm aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual play-style option into eve. would you advocate this? if so, how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game? would it?it seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term. beyond that, from a gameplay perspective, what would you advocate as the next priority?eve players seem to be quite passionate about the game, yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms. does this diminish the validity of the csm? what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively do?finally, and most importantly, do you like cats? :-)by the way, your response to that last question in sugar's thread: well played, sir. well played! :)thanks so much!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/4/2014,"if internal audit wouldn't object, loudly, then one could guess that ccp socksfour would have registered a cloud of characters (or hacked the db) just to vote for uncle stevie ...ccp has shown support for 3:rd party support from very early on, but in a bit of a backhand way.it has changed lately.with our 3:rd party ninja on csm we can be sure that it's not slipping back to that without a fight."
12/4/2014,"some way to remove abandoned structures is certainly needed. i suspect we won't see anything with the current system, as it should be leaving relatively soon, with teams working on a replacement. if that timescale is too long, i'll certainly be advocating for something. probably hacking related, as that's an existing mechanic, but with delays built in, so it's not 'forget to fuel my pos, and it's gone an hour later'. that's the kind of caveat that makes this more complicated to deal with. for more casual players, i do want to see better ways to draw them into the community. things such as social groups (like corps, but across corps, and not owning anything) would help here. it's already possible to play eve casually, but the bigger corporations tend to require activity levels. other groups should help.next things up (publicly), are corporations, sov/null and structures. they're the big pain points for existing players. however, also on the go is the new player experience. and that's very important. having been spending time in rookie help, i keep seeing the same questions coming up (we have a list). that suggests discoverability issues (one of eve's big problems if you ask me.) so the ui needs more work. more hints. and making things more obvious. one example: the links in pi aren't immediately obvious how full they are. adding a throb to them based on the capacity used, makes it more obvious.combating voter apathy is a difficult thing to do. we've been talking to ccp about it. as for the validity, that's a difficult thing to answer. the people who vote tend to be the people most hooked into the community, either personally, or because they're part of a group that told them it was a good idea. so it does represent that kind of person. i'd prefer bigger numbers, which means a bigger mandate. but ccp still find us useful yes, i like cats. grew up with a couple of them. they're gone now and my apartment doesn't allow for pets."
12/4/2014,"such community dedication. got my vote. kitchen sink? seriousy, get your ship together - fleet-up.com"
12/4/2014,"i think you aren't looking close enough. i meet all those criteria and then some. i am not an ""important player"" the whole point of eve is that anybody can potentially be anything. the chaotic viscosity of eve as a sandbox allows for a ""nobody"" to rise to a higher purpose and then vanish into obscurity just as quickly."
12/4/2014,"hi lorelei:while doing other things, and evolving as time goes on, at this point i consider myself a ""hisec carebear."" as such your campaign is of interest to me. i don't like ganking, although i don't think it should be removed completely, and i very much don't care for the ""content"" that organizations like code say they provide.having said all of that, i do have some questions i'd like to ask.space has become littered with abandoned pos structures. what is your position on getting rid of them? i'd like to see, perhaps, a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone. this, then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them. the current mechanic, of course, involves wardec-ing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures. i think something better is quite possible.eve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game, perhaps moving into the hobby realm. i'm aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual play-style option into eve. would you advocate this? if so, how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game? would it?it seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term. beyond that, from a gameplay perspective, what would you advocate as the next priority?eve players seem to be quite passionate about the game, yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms. does this diminish the validity of the csm? what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively do?finally, and most importantly, do you like cats? :-)thanks much!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/4/2014,yep.
12/4/2014,"i'm more interested in what tora has to say about wardeccs than about ganking. right now my impression is that wardeccs are close to useless. smart defenders just roll corp, or stick to npc corps. the only ones who actually fight are the ones run by egocentric ceos exploiting new players. there is no punishment for just docking up and playing on alts for a week. this makes wars effectively worthless in highsec. do you have any proposals other than making it more expensive to wardecc small corps, which is easily exploitable and doesn't really deal with how fundamentally useless wars are right now?"
12/4/2014,"stop being lazy and picking assumptions out of thin air just because they favor your argument.i know all of this (oh, and i don't even fly freighters myself; i just know people who do). but all you've done here is dodge the question. first of all, there are no guarantees, even if you do everything right. second, you ignored where i said that alts are a plague. any solution that relies on alts is lazy. third, what the hell use is a freighter that can't carry more than 500m isk? and it doesn't matter anyway, because empty freighters get blown up.if you're ~not supposed~ to even fill them with ore, they've become useless, and they should be removed from the game.the risk/reward is still off--despite your confident assertions, afk freightering is still worth considering, which if you're a csm candidate looking to reduce afk gameplay is not a good thing; and the gameplay when things go wrong is still terrible."
12/4/2014,"i had a productive conversation with tora today about ganking, and it sounds like he is willing to consider counter points on this. that said, i am still trying to decide if i would vote for him or not. please keep in mind that he specified that those restrictions would only apply to gankers in npc corps, but it is obvious that he is not particularly familiar with ganking mechanics as they pertain to negative sec status gankers. founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/4/2014,"if he changes his platform to something more agreeable, i will reassess my position.at present, i feel his proposals are worse than the status quo, and also heavily favor one specific style of highsec predatory prey (the marmite model of a large coalition using wardecs to extort protection money and to harass nullbears that visit highsec) at the expense of crippling others (small wardec organisations, for-profit ganking, extortion-based ganking)."
12/4/2014,"this.contrary to what someone else has said, anybody that supports the idea of content generation and competetive gameplay in hs should not vote for tora."
12/4/2014,"i don't think being afk is a problem in itself, as long as players can mop up those who aren't being careful."
12/4/2014,"no, out of principle."
12/4/2014,"honestly, i believe it would be a serious blow to the csm and the future of eve if somebody like tora were to secure a place.i see that already you are suggesting serious nerfs to ganking and a token change to wardecs (in the hope that no further changes will be made no doubt), when in reality one of the biggest problems with wardecs is that it's paying to gank without losses, and groups like marmite are easily able to wardec hundreds of groups at a time, devaluing the entire mechanic."
12/4/2014,"+1not too sure about your solutions but at least you acknowledge there is a problem with the interaction between gankees and the gankers. passively tanking ships in order to prevent ganks is as dull as dishwater and places all the power with the gankers, "
12/4/2014,"i've ragged on marmite before, but i do have a lot of respect for tora and as such he'll be getting vote."
12/4/2014,"i'm not the one complaining about 'how bad things are in eve' sir, that seems to be your department. in fact, i think eve is in the best state in years currently. but for your pleasure, a less sarcastic reply on your idea of having a 1 minute (or any lenght of time) non-dock timer for 'stealing':as with your non-dock timer for gankers, the effect will be the same. hiding in safespots but even easier, as the looter will still be in his ship which will most probably be fitted with a cloak now. warp to safe spot, cloak, scratch your nut sack 2 times and dock up. even easier than sitting out the 1 minute timer after a gank (which you can't do cloaked). it will not add any opportunity to catch thieves that isn't already there. it will not motivate ppl who aren't willing to hunt thieves now to do so after your proposed change. so again: no gameplay added, just made it a bit more tedious (again) for hi sec pirates/thieves/gankers/whatever you want to call them, one step closer again to 'nerfing eve to death'.not only will no gameplay be added by this idea, it will raise the threshhold for newer players to get into stuff like piracy. to noobs that not yet have any understanding of safe spots, insta-undocks and docks, a one minute no docking timer can look pretty off putting i can imagine. your ideas on high sec criminal offenses fit nicely into the ""one more nerf""-category. you say ""i want there to be ganking, i want there to be stealing, but it's just to easy now so let's nerf it (again)."" after your ideas are implemented, there will still be ganking and thieving and surprised by that, the carebear community will once again ask for ""one more nerf"", continuing this cycle until hi sec criminal behavior is scrapped from the game mechanics or becomes so tedious hardly anyone bothers with it anymore, effectively scrapping it from the game. after that will come the whining about someone else mining 'your' asteroid (seriously, i've seen miners complain about that numerous times in the chat channels), shooting 'your' mission rats, running 'your' site (again, complained about frequently in chats) etc etc. as for being a csm. i don't expect any csm to have perfect ideas and answers to every (percieved) 'problem'. but if you're positioning yourself as ""hi sec candidate"" i do expect you to be in touch with the hi sec playerbase (that includes hi sec criminals) and have some vision on how ideas work out in practice. which you seem to lack completely.. that's not me trying to insult you or defending my own ganking interests, i'm just telling you how your ideas will affect the game, not in a good manner....as for freighter ganking, how on earth is that 'too easy'? even with antitanked freighters you still need a sizeable fleet to take one out. you can't just undock on your own saying ""think i'm gonna gank me a freighter to kill some time all by myself with just my 2 alts!"". if it was that easy, we'd be seeing a lot more of it. loot nerf so ppl won't gank for profit anymore? well, it might surprise you but contrary to popular carebear beliefs most ganks are not carried out for profit, any profit is just gravy for most.on ganking nerfs in general: every time you make it harder to gank something the reaction from the ganking community will be the same: more organized ganking (the irony) and more attention paid to weaker targets. nerf freighter ganking, more attention will go to smaller targets like mission runners, miners, industrials, shuttles, pods etc etc. in general, it will be more targeted at noobs too. i myself have little problem with ganking noobs (gank 'm while they are young so they learn early what eve is about and decreasing the chance they will become theme park minded carebears), but you will be increasing the gap between older players (who can fly tanked fast freighters and t2 tanked blockade runners and transports) and the young who have little knowledge of damage mechanics and tanking and aren't able to fly and fit stuff that will reduce their chance of being killed yet. i think eve can do without anything else that will give more advantages to older players and will shaft the younger players. in a nutshell, i think your ideas are bad and not well thought out. not bad as in ""well, the core principle is good but we need to tweak the numbers a bit to keep it balanced"", no, i think the core principle are bad, for reasons i have stated."
12/4/2014,"i vote no to all of the initial plans outlined on this platform.ganking in high-secsuicide ganking has been repeatedly nerfed again and again, there is no need for further 'balancing' as you suggest. if people aren't prepared to take simple steps to avoid being ganked, or choose to auto pilot, they have chosen to accept the risk to their assets. i'm not sure what you think your suggested changes would accomplish. what difference does it make whether a ganker is in an npc corp or not? it's not exactly difficult to make or join one. not being able to dock or log off for 30 mins and being auto-ejected is also completely dumb. they will not be in an expensive pod, and they will not lose skill points soon so they couldn't care less. they will simply minimise their client and die repeatedly until they can dock up.also how would you suggest they make ganked ships drop no more than 25% loot, which by the way is not reducing ganking-for-profit, but removing it entirely? why should any pilot in eve be able to reduce the loot he drops by simple refusing to engage back, such as those caught in gate camps or pipe bombs.this section just comes across as a knee jerk grr gankers reaction.afk for long timewhether someone is active when logged into the game or not is nothing to do with you. if someone wants to afk mine that is their choice to make and they take the risks associated. if someone is afk while cloaking they are not affecting you, deal with it. a slot machine mining game with a weekly lottery? seriously?war decsthe size of a corporation has nothing to do with it's competency, not sure why you think 50+ members suddenly makes a difference. war dec costs do not need to change, not as long as it is so trivial to dodge a dec.social corp / npcno. an undeccable corp is not something i would even entertain thinking about, this undermines the whole concept of eve.incursions and pveif you have been playing since 2010 then you should at least have some knowledge of the current issues with these topics. this shows a lack of research to me, i would expect a candidate to have some sort of grasp or plan no matter how vague rather than ""mail me.""industrygrr gankers.dreadswhy should dreads suddenly be exempt from the capital ban in high sec? this won't generate more pos fights, if a corp is going to defend their tower they will do so regardless of a dread being on field.no offense but all of your suggestions comes across like the half thought out crap that you would expect to find in the features & ideas forum. you don't seem to have any kind of solid understanding about any of the topics you want to change, it comes off as more of a wish list rather than trying to make high sec better."
12/4/2014,i am not sure if the industrials in high-sec or any sec would agree with you. it seems its mainly code not willing to meet half way. you know there are csm's that want to completely remove ganking high-sec ? take your pick which one you want. 100% gone or nerfed.
12/4/2014,"as i stated before, your core principles are bad (for reasons stated), it's not a matter of tweaking them a bit and suddenly they will provide vibrant gameplay to all and be (fairly) balanced. there are also csm members that want buffs to piracy in hi sec, safe high sec candidates like yourself are also hardly new, they've been around since the start of the csm."
12/4/2014,"not every csm candidate wants ganking gone or nerfed. have you totally forgotten about the masses of people that just so happen to derive their daily content from the very activities that you wish to nerf, or are you just ignorant towards them? code. lords of midnight. countless individual miners that mine afk. dozens upon dozens of small wardec corps that don't have the ability to bankroll 80+ decs at a time. need i go on? in the best case scenario your ideas are bad. in the worst case scenario, the implementation of these ideas could lead to a scenario where the rich get richer, so-to-speak, and the little guys continue to get sh*t on. i see nothing wrong with the marmite business model, as long as that model does not remain the only viable option for hs predation, and it seems very clear that you wish it to become so. in implementing these changes, you could be taking away content from a lot of hs players, effectively squashing a lot of your competition as the head of marmite.you may say that you want these changes made out of a genuine concern for the well-being of hs, but as long as you're:a. proposing changes that could work to your own personal advantage,b. head of the largest merc corp in the game,then you wont get my vote simply out of principal. not that i would have backed these ideas anyway. so i restate my previous post: anyone genuinely concerned in retaining a competitive, dynamic hs should look elsewhere for csm because the changes proposed here largely benefit only one group of people: large wardec corps that can easily afford an increase in dec fees, who could easily field dreads in hs, and who would benefit greatly from reduced competition."
12/4/2014,"half-way to what? you want to make criminal gameplay worse (i.e. unfun) for the purpose of reducing the number of people doing it. this is not good game design. if you want less ganking/more protection for industrialists, you should argue for making ganking actually harder, not just more tedious - something like buffing ehp, reducing concord spawn time by half or something. then at least criminals can still actually play the game as it was designed.trying to reduce players from participating in an activity that has been explicitly designed and built into the game from the beginning by making it undoable/painful is not particularly inspired. your ideas should increase conflict and/or player interaction, not make it more boring for both the locked out ganker and the afk hauler. they should make the game more fun, ideally for everyone, not punish people for following a career path that is there to make highsec more interesting, and force game decisions. of course industrialists don't like getting ganked, but you should ask yourself if there was something that they can do to reasonably prevent it? if there was not, then you have a situation where a balance tweak might be needed or a new game mechanic implement. if they die because they did nothing to protect their ship (whether because they were new and didn't know how, or were taking a calculated risk overloading a hauler, going afk, or whatever) then that loss is working as intended. now, some carebears will go on about how ganking is ""too easy"" or ""no risk"". this of course isn't true, and ultimately doesn't matter as the risk is suppose to be on the person pursuing the isk-making activity, but i will give you some ideas to make ganking more risky you can throw a bone to the carebear demographic you seem to be trying to court. i don't necessary think they are at all good ideas but here they are:1) implement a ""pirate hideout"" deployable that gankers can use as their base (perhaps a small criminal timer reduction is the carrot to get them to use it) that can be attacked2) vary concord response time so gankers are less able to judge when they have enough firepower for a successful gank3) add some uncertainty to the cargo scanner (like there is for the ship scanner)4) allow a mechanism where industrial ships can feed false information to gankers scanners (at a fitting cost)5) similarly, allow a mechanism where an industrialist can increase concord response time by a small amount unknown to the ganker (perhaps a module that looks like a mining yield enhancer to a scanner but doesn't do that - it actually decreases concord response time by 10%). changes like these actually make the game more interesting while still allowing the criminal gameplay that is suppose to exist in highsec. punishing criminals with longer lockouts or less loot does not. however ultimately ganking is going to always appear to be in the advantage of the ganker as you normally only see/hear from the gank victims, not the 99% who the ganker passed over because they were properly tanked, or were never seen in the first place because they used scouts/intel/dscan/bookmarks to stay out of the crosshairs. this of course is the role of the ganker in the design of eve - to incentivize players to spend the time and effort to protect themselves - which really is a key part of this game. eve without suicide ganking would be much less interesting - everyone in highsec would use the same max yield/cargo fits and afk everywhere. tora, be a voice to make the game better, and don't pander to those who would make the game less interesting in the pursuit of their self-interest."
12/4/2014,tora what is your opinion on the different proposals that have been floated over time that have suggested incentives for the defender in war decs to mount an actual defense? it seems a common complaint is that defenders in war decs don't have any reason to really defend leading to a decrease in overall pvp. what would be your take on an incentive if in favor?
12/4/2014,"the problem with this line of logic is that it doesn't apply consistently enough to matter. remember that guy who'd been ganked running a purple-fit raven navy issue in a soe system, and he was so furious because he'd been doing it without issue for five years?he'd been doing it ""wrong"" pretty much every day for five years, without interruption. you have to agree that, in terms of consequences, this kind of wrong is hard to distinguish from doing it right. once in five years, flying a blingmobile in a gank beacon of a system consistently, would lead you to believe that he was incredibly careful. but he wasn't. he was oblivious, and five years of successfully being oblivious had led him to believe, by induction, that he was doing it right. can you blame him?this is also most of the freighter pilots in the game. i knew guys--not newbies by any stretch of the imagination, but guys who'd been in atlas back in the day--who would set freighters to afk autopilot through high sec and then go to bed. nothing ever happened. so can you really say, in terms of the lessons the game actually teaches, that afk autopiloting a freighter is wrong? is it actually smart to invest money in an alt, and time in training, and extra attention to flinging your hauler sideways through systems with a dubious mechanical side effect, for what amounts to a marginal increase in safety? is it smarter than setting autopilot on the thing, figuring that it's nbd if it gets there 10 minutes later, and going off to fly a ship that's actually fun to fly? or just going to bed?in effect, and regardless of the intentions of the gankers, ganks are generally processed by freighter pilots and mission runners as player-precipitated lightning strikes, and they're right, because the true safety in high sec is in numbers."
12/4/2014,vegas mirage should be back pretty soon. im sure he will vote for you bro. :)
12/4/2014,"everything in eve, as in life, is a calculated risk. rl research has shown that people have an ""accepted"" level of risk that they're subconsciously willing to take on a day-to-day basis. it's why people drive without their seatbelts on, text while they're driving, don't put winter tires on their vehicle or partake in any number of other activities with an associated risk without taking every possible precaution to ensure their total safety while doing so. to say that an experienced, afk'ing freighter pilot chooses to afk because he genuinely think's that he's safe, is wrong. rather, he know's that there's a risk, however small that risk may be, but that he's choosing to take the calculated risk of afk'ing with the knowledge that while he may be ganked, the odds are in his favor that he won't be.he's entitled to take that calculated risk just as the gankers are entitled to take advantage of any oversights he may make. just like anybody else that gets in an accident after rolling through an intersection due to not having winter tires on their car, he'll be pissed off that he lost his ship but that doesn't change the fact that he took a knowing, calculated risk. he could have taken steps to avoid the loss, but he didn't. i've done a lot of freighter hauling in my time and the only time i've ever lost a hauler (a t1 hauler at that,) was the day i was awoxed bringing fuel to my pos. since then i've stopped autopiloting my haulers and you wouldn't believe the difference that makes if someone isn't going to spend the time to make sure that their ship arrives safely at the destination, then i have no problem separating him from his ship as it's clearly not worth his time anyway."
12/4/2014,"while its clear that only code members oppose tora, let me explain why the eject from station feature would be great, despite being rationally useless (empty pod, no clone costs).most ganks are done for tears. if everyone would just shrug and replace the losses, code would be disbanded in a week. but we know that eve is full of people who cry a river for losing a $0.5 retriever. they do so in impotency: they don't know anything of pvp and have no idea how could they defend themselves. all they experience that some ""veteran"" just came out of the blue and destroyed something that was theirs and they have no clue how did it happen. this is why i linked a why was i ganked guide to every target i ganked and surprise! i barely got tears, despite i popped 124+140b of miners in two months before i got bored.the eject feature would give them the chance to ""fight back"". they could fly to the station and shoot the big bad ganker. sure, it would make no sense. but hey, ganking a venture makes no sense and code had a competition for it. the guy would get ""revenge"", the thrill of winning in pvp. he might even try again, against a ship and before he'd notice, he'd be flying in lowsec looking for fights.the point isn't to remove ganking. it's to remove the ""i can't do anything against these gankers"" feeling from the carebears, give them a symbolic chance to hit back.edit: there is a way to improve it. instead of making the gcc longer, keep it just 15 mins, but reset it to 15 mins whenever the ganker is podded. so anti-gankers could stop a ganker by repeatedly podding him. so they could fight back meaningfully and force the ""bad criminal"" to run and hide."
12/4/2014,"yes, my point exactly: i used the mission runner as an example of how you can do this for so long that you don't even know there are risks. the point of establishing that the freighter pilots were nullsec veterans is that they knew exactly what the risks were, and they still did it, and their calculations were accurate enough that they had no incentive to change their behavior.i personally have railed against autopilot. i hate it and i don't use it. but then, i don't fly freighters either. if afk autopiloting freighters is the norm, then it's what makes sense to most people, and i know enough veterans who do it to believe that it's the result of a rational risk/reward calculation (combined with the fact that, if the freighter is attacked, oh, well--no benefit to being atk for that, either). so the obvious conclusion is that high sec freighter logistics naturally and rationally gravitates toward afk gameplay, and if you're concerned about that, that's the place to look. ganking has just about nothing to do with it."
12/4/2014,"you couldn't be more wrong here tora. we just don't see nerfs to ganking as providing any productive solution. make life easier and more exciting for white knights, ganking will suffer slightly, but in ways that make everything more exciting for everyone involved. take a look at the proposal put forward by bebop and know that i think it's a wonderful idea that would provide a better chance for players to fight back against ganking, make ganking more interesting and exciting, and make eve a more dangerous place, instead of your proposal to make it safer. sabriz for csmx! a vote for tora is a vote for theme park high sec."
12/4/2014,"i've been part of code. for two weeks, i haven't ganked a single ship in my life and if i was gone tomorrow, bad ideas would still be bad ideas. it has nothing to do with bias or politics. i live in hs because i enjoy the target/player-rich environment. tora wants to bring safety to hs and i oppose it. it contradicts everything that eve stands for."
12/4/2014,"killing an implantless clone that the ganker pays nothing for doesn't really count as 'revenge.' pod killing is about to become laughably irrelevant and anyone who will brag about killing someones pod will be made fun of incessantly. the loot drop change would not 'reduce' ganking for profit, it will remove it from the game except in the most extreme circumstances like a jf full of plex.i don't see how this would increase player interactions or make eve a better game for anyone. currently the only thing that can be ganked for profit (with any kind of reliability) is freighters and jf's being flown by people so are so sure of their safety that they pack them full of more isk than they should by any stretch of the imagination, all this change will do is protect fools from the foolishness of their actions. if you think freighters and jf's are too easy to gank, well that's a different issue, but hitting ganking as a whole square in the jaw with a nerf bat is a pretty terrible way of dealing with it. the popup idea is one of the worst i've ever seen. the slot machine game while mining... weird, but i think i see where you're trying to go with it and maybe something different can achieve the same goals (increase player interactivity while mining) without coming across as arbitrary 'features.' personally i hate slot machines and slot machine style games and would ignore such a feature altogether. i'm sorry tora but this comes across as a thinly veiled attempt to destroy your competition in the war dec aspect of eve. i don't know why you think this is a good idea but maybe if you can explain i'll change my mind. this is especially terrible while it remains so stupidly simple to simple ignore a war dec by closing corp and reforming. how many of these corps that you are claiming are 'killed by war decs' are reformed minutes or hours later under a new name? this fixes nothing and wrecks a lot of things. i'm not entirely against this as it does encourage player interaction which is always positive (even when it's destructive). npc corps will never completely go away as mechanically you need a place for players to go when they leave a player corp. you say this and yet it seems to be the direction your suggestions lead.sorry tora, but if your position on some of these topics remains as it currently seems to be, i do not want you representing me on the csm. i love you, but i cannot vote for you in good conscience. whatever happened to delete the weak? you may need to change your signature to protect the weak.sabriz for csmx! a vote for tora is a vote for theme park high sec."
12/4/2014,"i'm not a code member (i in fact have an incredible dislike for code) and i oppose tora. by the way, literally anything that comes from your mouth will be detrimental to tora's campaign.except they wouldn't go to the station and fight. for starters, they would have just been ganked and potentially podded. by the time a non-pvp pilot kits up a pvp ship and heads out to the ganker, the ganker would be long gone.secondly, the ganker, once podded, could be anywhere. the gankee would need to track them down in order to ""fight back"" which would take longer than they would be on a timer.thirdly, killing them would be pointless. they would undoubtedly be in an empty clone, so you could pod them over and over again, and they wouldn't care (bear in mind that by the time this were implemented, clone upgrades would be long gone, so they wouldn't even lose sp).except a ganker would only need to escape once then you'd never catch the pod. even if he was terrible and couldn't escape, he could just log on different character and continue to gank."
12/4/2014,"well almost, the ganking is really the only threat facing the afk pilot. if ganking freighters is made more difficult, this choice will be made even more obvious, every single freighter in hs would be afk all the time. this isn't good for anyone. rather than attacking ganking, i would say find ways to encourage players to be at their keyboards in ways that would protect them if a gank attempt were to occur.sabriz for csmx! a vote for tora is a vote for theme park high sec."
12/4/2014,"i'm sure industrialists in high sec are more likely to push against wardecs from people like you, who farm non-combat targets for killboard efficiency, than gankers who they have a fraction of a chance of being ganked by if they happen to carry too much in the wrong place.you're really running the wrong group if you're trying to win over the highsec non-pvp vote."
12/4/2014,"i have removed a rule breaking post and those quoting it. as always i let some edge cases stay.please people, keep it on topic and above all civil!the rules:4. personal attacks are prohibited. commonly known as flaming, personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user. posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated.isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
12/4/2014,"i believe we're in violent agreement. and it's not enough of a threat to keep people from gravitating toward the direction that the intrinsic gameplay of freighter piloting encourages, which is to set, forget, and go do something else. some people even remember to keep the value of their cargo down. i don't have a strong opinion about people being afk for whatever reason, but it seems to me like the intrinsic gameplay shouldn't encourage it, especially when there's real-time, on-grid conflict between players.i also think that a lot of the problem goes way deeper, to the fact that there's very little incidental socialization in eve. except for local and (lol) constellation, all chat channels and certainly all voice comms are little walled gardens. even the public chat channels are almost impossible to find until someone tells you about them, and then you have to remember the name. so we're at a point now where there are two camps, and each has a contemptuous opinion of the other, and each one doubles down on their position in response to any criticism. there are exceptions, of course, but not enough of them. if there is any medium of communication between strangers, it's text, which is famously bad at communicating tone and intent.i mean, think about it: wouldn't it be the most obvious thing to be able to easily communicate with other ships on grid? and we can, clumsily, with technology that dates back to the 1970s. doesn't that seem odd? (he says, in a csm candidacy thread )."
12/4/2014,so should ganking become even more common then?
12/4/2014,yeah i agree with everything you've said here. unfortunately i'm not sure how you could make freight hauling more interesting without inadvertently giving freighters a massive unfair buff.
12/4/2014,"i just spoke with tora regarding this pressing issue, he should be along any minute now to explain how a random popup every 30-60 seconds will both keep people's attention at the keyboard while also increasing the fun factor, lest the autopiloting ships engines shut off should you fail to press the button before the timer expires..."
12/4/2014,"really?just to pick one tiny little incremental example: ccp could do to freighters exactly what they just did to sov structures: less raw hp, more resists, except that the ""resists"" would come in the optional form of enough cpu to fit a basic damage control and some kind of hull tank or resist plating.just like that, afk freighter piloting becomes more perilous, and active freighter piloting--albeit, for a de minimus and inadequate definition of ""active""--is rewarded, but the ehp of a max tanked freighter hasn't changed substantially.now, i'm not saying that that in itself is a good change. ""you get to activate a module every few minutes to avoid painting a huge target on your back!"" is not compelling gameplay in and of itself. it's just an off-the-cuff example of the sort of change you could make without turning freighters into indestructible fortresses. a package of similarly balanced changes could redefine the class.with that said, if the poster back a few pages is right and the ceiling above which a freighter gank is profitable has dropped to only 500m isk, maybe a slight buff is appropriate. you should, at the very least, be able to fill a freighter with common high sec ore without drawing too much attention to yourself. otherwise, what are they for?"
12/4/2014,"assumptions out of thin air? these carebear tested, ganker approved tactics that work; coming from an active ganker, sir. just because your commenting on something you obviously know nothing about doesn't mean you're right; it actually makes you look a bit silly. if you, or any other player wants to ignore these helpful tactics, that significantly increases your risk of losing that shiny freighter you seem to love oh so much and then it's your fault for losing the freighter to begin with.the generally rule is don't carry anything worth more than your hull. this more of pertains to freighters, or ships that are terrible with alignment and can't covops. if you want to carry 2b/isk over what your freighter costs, great; you'll be a target. if you want to be smart about it and not carry cargo worth more than your hull, then obviously your chance of becoming a gank target decreases. i shouldn't have to spell this out for you... i don't know what game you've been playing the past year, but it wasn't eve online.omg an empty frieghter died that means all empty freighters die! that's some nice logic you have there too bad it's wrong. an empty freighter only becomes a target if and when there are no other targets. they are never primary.you had a question? seemed like a statement to me. i'll go ahead and answer your ""questions"" for you now.1. no guarantees? welcome to eve.2. who said anything about alts? oh, you did. i don't know why you're hellbent on some alts, they come in handy. if someone doesn't have an alt, then ask a friend/corpmate.3. see above.anything else?"
12/4/2014,"as so often, you are wrong. i do not gank for 'tears', i gank simply for the kill. it's the hunt that motivates me. can i be stealthy enough to scan him, get a warp in on him and land on top of him before he suspects any trouble? in general, tears bore me, as most of the time they are just 'waaaah waaah, y u keel mi?!?! go suuk dik!"". as for your ""improvement"", the work around i would use for that: train up more alts. mostly trading/industrial alts that aren't doing anything outside of stations anyway atm. log out your first ganker, have it auto-eject till hell freezes over, log back into another alt, gank on that, rinse repeat. other work arounds: set you medical clone to a low sec station, no bear will dare venture there, have a jump clone in hi sec. i'd most likely be combining the two. end result: no gameplay added for gankers, no gameplay added for anti-gankers. the fact that you think repeatedly shooting auto-ejecting pods is 'gameplay' kinda surpises me tbh. it sounds like a chore more than it sounds like gameplay. i'm sure that anyone who has been doing it for more than 20 minutes will agree. you'll get chats like this:""hey guys, i won't be going on mining ops/missioning/roaming/incursions/whatever cuz i got 'ganker podding'-duty today, have fun without me while i am out here making sure that just 1 ganker gets locked down while he is logging in on one of his 10 other gank chars and continues to gank."". sounds really appealing to all parties involved yeah.... you wrote your guide on anti-ganking, which is pretty decent (i still link it to ppl sometimes if they really seem to have no clue) so you know how easy it is to avoid ganks yet here you are advocating ""one more nerf"". i am disappoint gobbles, i am disappoint..."
12/4/2014,"i am against it, as a small corp or alliance would never ever be able to defend against a large null-sec alliance any more. and if you do it, then you need to do it in low and null too, where you also have npc stations."
12/4/2014,"still no, we need a content creator, not a merc blue donut maker.we need someone has pvp experience, not t3 blob gang with neutral logi alts.we don't need a mermaid/coward for csm."
12/4/2014,"my personal opinion is to have some form of hacking that can be used to unanchor offline towers. varying in difficulty on two things. 1) size, easy for small towers hard for large towers. 2) type of tower, easy for a basic amarr tower, hard for a true sansha towerthis could use the hacking skill or a new one but would allow for people to go out and find and remove these towers."
12/4/2014,"i would be happier with locking mechanisms that used grid and cpu, so that if you wanted to have a seriously locked-down small tower you could, as long as you paid the cost for it."
12/4/2014,"corbexx:thanks so much!i'll take this opportunity to ask the other things i'll be asking candidates i'm taking seriously.eve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game, perhaps moving into the hobby realm. i'm aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual play-style option into eve. would you advocate this? if so, how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game? would it?it seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term. beyond that, from a gameplay perspective, what would you advocate as the next priority?eve players seem to be quite passionate about the game, yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms. does this diminish the validity of the csm? what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively do?finally, and most importantly, do you like cats? :-)-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/4/2014,"yes i would. i'm all in favour of a corp lite/ social groups. exactly what it would get or have not sure.we don't really get a say in priority, but i will say i'll be carrying on working on stuff i think would help w-space. being proactive going out finding issues getting info on it and passing it on to ccp, allows you to potentially get alot sorted,. even if it is just little quality of life stuff. obviously if i had my say it would be w-space. but to be honest w-space is doing pretty well with small iterations (there is still stuff to do but its not like null that needs a huge revamp). alot is knowing just who to go to.it was down, there is probably alot of reasons not enough advertising. the fact that csm 8 was fairly quite with no huge rage monsters for people to go emo about. i don't think it diminishes the validity of the csm, its not ideal i'll give you that. but i'd like to think most of us have justified our spots. how to improve this i think needs both the csm and ccp pushing it to people.yes."
12/4/2014,"ccp has come out and stated that they want dotlan-style functionality for the gorgeous new map, which is awesome for k-space.what's your stance on their building in mapper-style functionality for w-space?"
12/4/2014,"i want to add one more thing i think i can bring to csm.i'm the sort of person that is always looking for loopholes through which you can scam people. when retribution was being discussed, i found two exploits that could be used to abuse the new bounty system. i reported both to gms without using them, and as a result one was fixed immediately (the other ccp had already discovered and had included code that prevented it working).with the forthcoming rhea release, i've been speaking up about some of the potential issues with the corporation recruitment changes, and i've been one of the people responsible for getting the '6 invites per minute' restriction added. there are still loopholes in this system but they likely fit the limits of 'acceptable scam' not 'exploit' and so i'm seeking clarification on this now.as a csm member, i'd be in a better position to detect possible exploitable holes in new systems before they go live and clarify with ccp whether they are bugs, features or unintended but acceptable loopholes."

12/4/2014,you're welcome to your opinion. we aren't roleplayers. noone on code. teamspeak during freighter suppression operations talks 'in character' at all.if you've got questions related to my vision of what highsec should be and how it should interact with the rest of the eve universe - even hostile ones - feel free to ask them in this thread. my support for james 315 is limited to (generally) agreeing with his views on these questions - i don't know him irl at all.

12/4/2014,"walls of text that i didn't bother to read, for this i will not endorse you"
12/4/2014,"starting off a csm campaign with a philosophy that is fundamentally wrong and undermines the fact that a variety of people play for a variety of reasons is not really a good start. while you refuse to accept them as players, there are many players who do simply play without engaging others, who are quite happy scanning down and running sites with no interaction with other players. while i'm a strong believer in player interaction being a core focus of eve, i'd not consider players who do not enjoy that part of the game to be irrelevant in any way. if someone wants to log on and run missions all day long not talking to or interacting with any other players, they are welcome to do so.and i'd generally avoid voting for a member of a group which either by design or through ineptitude supports botters. the csm infected by new order ideals is certainly not the future vision of eve.i'd question what changes it is you'd actually strive for in ganking and wardecs, since it's implied that you'd be looking to make both easier, which is pretty much the opposite of being newbie friendly. it's also interesting how you refer to the ""carebears"", while you are part of a group which engages in low cost, minimal risk ""pvp"" (and no, the fact that you lose a cheap ships is not a risk, it's a cost) against targets which you pick specifically for their lack of ability to retaliate. it's even going to become even lower risk, with clone upgrade costs not being required you'll now be able to use higher sp characters without needing to warp them out and not even worry about paying to upgrade the clone.personally, i don't trust you to put the needs of the playerbase before your own personal agenda."
12/4/2014,"~words~ are scary things. thanks for bumping the thread, though."
12/4/2014,"you claim that eve is all about conflict but selflessly give your time and knowledge to new players.please explain this obvious incoherency.do you agree that high-sec ganking is an almost risk-free activity? (given that being concorded is simply a game mechanic, it is about as risky as clicking 'trash it' on a menu choice). if not, please describe the risks faced by a ganker.you state that reward should be aligned to risk. do you feel that the rewards of ganking are at an appropriate level given the risks that you discussed above?"
12/4/2014,"to expand on my previous postas a fellow regular in the ncqa subforum, i can attest that sabriz is a very smart individual with a grasp on the game that extends far beyond code. she's very honest about her playstyle and always gives out good advice to new players on how to avoid becoming prey to gankers. i wouldn't touch her with a ten foot pole in-game, but i'm convinced she's actually interested its well-being. code is just one of the many facets to sabriz.i have no special love for code, but i will be voting for sabriz as an individual who appreciates the freedom of expression we have in new eden, and who i believe will protect that essential element of gameplay.want to talk? join my channel in game: house forelli"
12/4/2014,"great, a player who knows eve and helps newbies. that alone does not make a good candidate for the csm. a csm member you have to trust to put the needs to the overall playerbase before their own agenda. i don't trust sabriz to do that."
12/4/2014,"i won't muck up her thread with an argument, but i would encourage you to read through her posting history - particularly in ncqa and market discussions - before you write her off as a simple ganker. i feel her expertise in market economics and deep understanding of ship stat balancing are great traits for a csm candidate. you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion.want to talk? join my channel in game: house forelli"
12/4/2014,"i'm not writing her off as a simple ganker. i'm writing her off as someone with knowledge of the game, who is willing to help out new players, but who i wouldn't trust with the responsibility of taking the needs of other player groups seriously. already in her campaign outline she's decided that nobody plays without expressly wanting conflict, which is obviously false and puts across the impression that players who seek to play without conflict are irrelevant. from what i've read in the past, i'd be very surprised if any players who did not confirm to her ideas of how to play would be considered relevant. a csm members has a duty to put that aside. while they should have their own thoughts and opinions derived from their own experiences, we should be able to trust them to look beyond that and consider the whole playerbase.i wouldn't trust her to do that. is her membership of code part of that? sure, it takes a certain type of person to support code, a type of person who i wouldn't trust to make selfless decisions or consider other people feelings, but that's not the only, or even the majority factor. i'm not a newbie here and i've seen enough sabriz posts to have a fairly idea of her thoughts on the direction of eve."
12/4/2014,"sabriz:i'll start this off on the wrong foot, but please read it through. :)i hate code. i think they're extortionist griefers and it is only because eve is the sandbox that it is that i don't think they should be banned entirely. they say they produce content, and in fairness they certainly do, but it is not the kind of content that i care to participate in.having said that, despite much of my heart railing against this, your thread here has shown you to be a thoughtful person, i think, with some very intriguing ideas, complex and nuanced enough so that my heart's argument of, ""she's just a code griefer! ignore her!"" just isn't fair and won't wash.. so, despite your background, i find myself following you and seriously considering you.how's that for a ringing endorsement? :)as such, i'd like to post to you some questions i'm asking the candidates that i'm seriously considering.space has become littered with abandoned pos structures. what is your position on getting rid of them? i'd like to see, perhaps, a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone. this, then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them. the current mechanic, of course, involves wardec-ing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures. i think something better is quite possible.eve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game, perhaps moving into the hobby realm. i'm aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual play-style option into eve. would you advocate this? if so, how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game? would it?it seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term. beyond that, from a gameplay perspective, what would you advocate as the next priority?eve players seem to be quite passionate about the game, yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms. does this diminish the validity of the csm? what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively do?finally, and most importantly, do you like cats? :-)thanks so much!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/4/2014,"golly gosh mr lucas krell, an excellent post.i am one of those who believes that as long as players do not break the rules laid down by ccp, any playstyle solo, in groups of whatever size, for whatever purpose is as valid as any other playstyle.you pays your money, you makes your choice."
12/4/2014,"personally that says a lot about both sabriz and yourself. about sabriz it correctly identifies that sabriz is intelligent and thoughful, and genuinely wants to see eve succeed even more than it already has and be a continuing success in the future. about you, it identifies you as an open minded and intelligent individual who is willing to put your personal dislike for sabriz' play style aside and recognize that it's important to have representation from all sides of a debate. *tips hat*personally i'd love to see them either become effectively suspect, or be hackable, maybe not right away (forgot to fuel your tower last night before bed? too bad gone now) but after some amout of inactive time (even on the order of months would be fine with me). either way i think clearing them should be a task left for playersand not be some passive event."
12/4/2014,"post #1 of 2 responding to this (quote limit...)thank you for seeing past your dislike of my ingame actions to engage seriously.basically every eve character (pretty much) is a horrible person. even mission runners, who spend their days massacring serpentis conscripts for crimes that, irl, would generally only result in a couple of years imprisonment even for active participants.gankers (and predatory wardeccers like me) are just more honest about it.first, i'm assuming you are referring to highsec and c1 to c4 wormholes, as the existence of dreadnoughts somewhat solves this issue in other categories of space. i'm generally of the opinion that a player's bigger marks on the sandbox (like a pos) should remain unless another player exercises effort in erasing it. i do, however, endorse changes that make it take less time and less resources to destroy long-inactive pos structures, and also changes that provide more options for pos bashing in highsec and c1 to c4 wormholes. a large pos with no defenses requires about 800 battleship minutes to destroy, which is simply too long (although it's under 100 dreadnought minutes).i haven't thought extensively about this, but my initial thoughts are that after 3 months of inactivity, the structure would no longer be protected by concord and this would be made apparent by a suspect flag. i would also support the introduction of a tech 2 battleship that is capable of entering something akin to siege mode, in which it is a glass cannon.the term 'casual player' is used to mean a lot of different things. if you mean 'should eve change to appeal to players that want short term entertainment, not a hobby?' i answer no. ccp should not sabotage eve's appeal with present customers in order to chase a currently oversaturated market.ccp can market other products to that demographic, like valkyrie or (if it ever becomes worth marketing) dust/project legion."
12/4/2014,"2 of 2big question. here's a few things that are *very big* things first.1) look at aspects of the game that are presently widely botted - mining, anomoly ratting, agent missions - and try to make these more interactive and entertaining. i have no tolerance for cheating, but i think you can learn a lot from what activities cheaters automate and why they do it.2) redesign the new player experience to get people interacting with other players early on. i'd definitely want to add a mission in the training systems where you had to retrieve an item from a rat's wreck but that had only minor consequences for failure, and then later i'd add an optional mission to probe down someone doing that mission and cause them to fail it. similarly, a 'courier this package through lowsec' mission which does not hurt to fail, and later a 'steal the parcel' mission.smaller things:1) introduce more warnings to newer players of some of the player-created dangers they face in new eden2) provide new players with evidence of how effective they can be in numbers, if they pick fights carefully and are led. (we do this in the new order a lot; but it applies outside gank situations too).i'd be a bit more concerned if more people cared who a game company used to consult with that who runs their country. priorities. rl is more important than a game, even an obsessive hobby like eve.most people don't vote because they don't think the csm is important enough to invest the time needed to make a thought out decision on who to support. outside of big controversies this will continue.i *loathe* the creatures with a passion that borders on inarticulate rage."
12/4/2014,"the first question is an excellent one.i'm not hypercompetitive in the way that some people are. this is the reason that i don't have a trillion isk in the bank yet. every interaction in eve is competitive, but sometimes i will make a 'suboptimal' choice for outside-of-eve reasons.re the second question. if you look at my killboard and go back a while (to when i was ganking more often), you'll see i have a significant number of failed gank attempts. in addition there's all the failed attempts that don't leave a killboard mark, because i aborted before initiating combat.some of these failed attempts were caused by the target's pre-gank dilligence. others were caused by third party interference. some were the result of my failed attempt to judge the damage needed to pop someone. and finally some were caused by the target actively defending themself.i also at one point lost an ishtar and a hyperion (and several chepaer ships) to killright activations.the costs of ganking are widely underestimated too. a standard code. catalyst is about 7.3 million isk right now. assuming you are running a 20 pilot freighter gank fleet that kills one freighter every 21 minutes (which is our best fc at his most efficient and doesn't allow for failed ganks), it may seem we are only expending 146m isk per freighter. this is an underestimate.there's an investment of 7 hours of player time per freighter gank. for medium sp players, that's an opportunity cost of 420 million isk (spread over the fleet). for high sp players, it's closer to 700m isk. (those are figures for what you'd make doing low risk, highly efficient pve content in highsec).finally there's a few market related risks gankers face - i was holding a lot of light neutron blaster iis when crius hit and crashed their prices. i personally lost nearly a billion isk on the 3000 i had and a further quarter billion on magstabs, and i expect the alliance was holding more than i was. then there's hauling risk - several of us have orca or freighter alts that are blue to code. but certainly are not blue to any other highsec predators.re ganking risk vs reward.the only reason ganking is presently profitable is the total and utter lack of concern most freighter pilots in highsec have for their own safety. if freighter pilots become more dilligent we simply will not be able to kill them profitably."
12/4/2014,"i don't claim there aren't people who play without wanting conflict.the thing is, those people *do* get involved in conflict without realising it.let's go back to the period of the goonswarm v test war for an example. consider a level 4 mission runner running missions in dodixie against serpentis rats, looting every wreck and deliberately not engaging with the occasional ninja that enters their mission.whether they intend to or not, that player is objectively helping the goonswarm side of the war, by increasing supply of phased muon sensor disruptor i on the market, which was one of their alliance's main supply bottlenecks in the war. here a 'highsec carebear' is helping the goons win fleet fights in nullsec.or consider an incursion fleet commander that operates purely in highsec. by the simple act of deciding to change from a nightmare fleet doctrine to a paladin fleet doctrine, they reduce the value of nullsec rental systems that have sansha anomolies or that produce deadspace shield modules.this might be a more damaging to an alliance that controls that space than losing an entire 250 person ishtar fleet to bombers - all caused by someone who wanted to avoid conflict.anyone who interacts with eve's market in any way, shape of form is involved in real loss pvp."
12/4/2014,"hi sabriz,how high of a priority do place a reworking of the currently badly outdated corporation mechanics and interface?in follow up questions:1) do you feel that an improved mechanic and interface could be used to create incentive for players to join a player corporation thereby increasing player interaction?3) do you feel that an improvement to corp mechanics could be an incentive for people to remain in their corporation in the face of a war dec rather than simply dissolving their corp?4) do you feel that such a rework would do anything either way for new player retention or veteran retention?there is no question 2."
12/4/2014,"i would like to add to that that over filled freighters are the only targets that can be chosen for any reliable ganking profits. while mission boats full of purples certainly exist, they are far too rare and difficult to track down to qualify as a source of income. incursion boats are likewise difficult to gank due to having logi and friends nearby nearly always, unless they make really poor decisions or really bad mistakes.those last two conditions are still true for freighters, but people making those poor decisions and mistakes happens frequently enough that they can be killed for profit by highly organized and well supplied individuals."
12/4/2014,you will have my vote. i think you do a wonderful job and take the csm job seriously.

12/4/2014,"this was asked yet no response yet,but i have to say that i am very curious to this as well. as far as i can see:- you werent at the summit meetings at all- you didn't do any of the summit minutes- hardly seen you on the forums or communicating to your playerbasei realize that the normal players don't hear about all that the csm members do, however obviously other csm members do know this. i see a lot of endorsements from one csm member to another yet none of the csm9 have put in a good word for you here... this makes me wonder.the summit is one of the most important meetings of the csm. why did you not even show up? are you just resting on your provi bloc to vote you in again and do nothing? why are they putting up with a candidate that seems to do very little (in my opinion not even the minimum).so, my question to you is: what have you done? and why should we vote for you again? you were high up my ballot last year as the comparison website showed my ideas were similar to yours, however i am starting to feel my vote was wasted."
12/4/2014,"plz read the post on page 1, i wrote much more there now, also watch eveamsterdam where i tell an hour on stage about csm, and yes i wasnt elected for first summit, i am on the list of the 6 csm for wintersummit in jan, and the 6 for fanfest in march. i hope the presentation and the post show u more insight"
12/4/2014,you do know its 7 go to the summit and 7 go to fanfest?
12/4/2014,"thanks for responding so quickly, i appreciate it. making me re-read your post and try and find the differences is not really answering my questions clearly. could you please provide a list of what you have done as csm 9? why should i vote for you again? it also doesn't explain why you are not endorsed by any of your fellow csm members...from what i understood, 7 people are going to the summit, not 6. not being invited for the previous summit is perhaps not your fault (although you can influence this perhaps). however, from what i understood, you guys get the possibility to be there via video chat and get recordings from the summit afterwards? meaning, you still could have been present remotely and still could have made minutes. my compliments by the way for your presentation at evesterdam: you do this well. however, i still have no clue what you have done as a csm9 member..."
12/4/2014,"i can't help but notice that i haven't seen any endorsements from current csm members for you. do you think your fellow csm 9 members were happy with your performance this time around? what will you be doing differently (clearly not taking some time to write up a proper campaign announcement post, this one seems just as rushed as last time)?csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate @two_step_eve on twitter my blog"
12/4/2014,"core, you are the master pos basher"
12/4/2014,"i think we had that debate last time as well, you shoudl ask my fellow csm members that question. i know i am happy and judging but the 2 invites from ccp for both summit and fanfest they not unhappy either. i am not here to be voted in by my fellow csm members, the voting last time showed i can stand on my own, i understand the rushed , its my style and it worked last round, highest solo numbers. i even specifally stayed away from other csm members, and crossvoting stuff. this time i might change that though, and team up with several frends and enemies, as i got votes too spare.i am happy with small stuff like pi for everyone in null, which is awsome for null and especially provi.the occupancy xhanges, power projection. the cloning changes i made the internal post for, and isboxing i campaigned hard against, along with others. i am one of the guys that pushed hard on the null sec change, and i stood behind it bigtime, as also clear in eve 24 interview about that. for 3 years i oreach isk shoudl flow upwards, not down. in evesterdam i explained alot on stage, on which i got alot of positive feedback. i hopefully get the change too repeat that in fanfest.for next year there s occupancy, for me persoanl i like to add retaining higher sp players, i am glad we got the cloning thorugh, but i feel players shoudl for example get extra ccp lp points for a new shop as they grow old nd pay as loyal customers. i also like to push for newcomers too get more sp quicker , closing the sp gap i named that post internalyi know my posts as dutch arent the best, kinda even my trademark by now, and i dont mind, alot of people like it even, especcially when people bash it i get supporters.i hope it answers your questions a bit and gives u a btter insight but i asume more will follow"
12/4/2014,"i will follow this campaign with interest.your work improving pve in dangerous space is a good thing. level 5 mission hubs aren't proving themselves a resource worth fighting over at the moment, but they have the potential to become one if there's further work done on them, and so there's definitely elements of your work i support.i particularly endorse the decision to add more low-sp oriented pve to lowsec, making it more of an option to move there permanently as a rookie player fresh out of the tutorials, and i think you are to credit for this (correct me if i am wrong). going to throw you a question. when i was a rookie pilot, i was *terrified* of lowsec, after i made the usual mistake of buying a skillbook in lowsec and nearly getting killed collecting it. now that i know it better, i know that lowsec is fairly safe if you take precautions and fly agile ships.how would you communicate the basics of lowsec safety to new players?"

12/4/2014,"i am looking for granularity inside of corporation management. a clear, understandable, customizable, flexible interface that gives a corporation choices. i would like to see along side them the implementation of social groups or clubs to support a greater network of player connections."
12/4/2014,"only one?i<U+FFFD>d work some aspects aura<U+FFFD>s tutorials into the first mission of each agent line with the ability to see if they have already done it with another agent. that way they could learn to use stargates, activate acceleration gates, and open containers while diving into game activities. it would also take away the current process of undocking in a pod and going to get their ship. people get confused here and lost. i think that is bad and it doesn<U+FFFD>t make any sense to teach new players to randomly find ships in space. start them in their ship be it in space or in station. the pod step is needless and they get shot and warp off in a pod anyway in the combat missions.some of the csm have been keeping track, internally, of a lot of common questions that we are hearing. i think these are very low hanging fruit. questions that we see half a dozen times an hour can be included or explained.but, we need to restructure the entire thing. we need to use adult learning principles to create something more engaging. something that leads people into the understanding of our open world where the player, not the game, makes choices. discovering what you want to do in eve is very hard. bringing information to the surface will let people make their decision as they dive deeper into the game."
12/4/2014,"the best part of this is that if for some reason you quit before undocking to pick up your ship, then log back in, you get a notification from pend insurance offering condolences for the loss of your ship(!), and offering you... a rookie ship, ready and waiting in your hangar.the worst thing about the npe is that it only really flows if you do everything the way it's intended to be done, and of course new players are going to do everything except what's intended."
12/4/2014,"yes, i was the advocate for bringing low level exploration to low sec when the static ded complexes were removed in december of 2012.i don<U+FFFD>t teach safety i teach awareness. awareness gives you the ability to react and make choices that will hopefully keep you alive. and that making all the right choices can still not end well due to the unpredictable nature of low sec. i teach it by flying with them, sharing my game day with them, and showing them what i do and why i do it."

12/4/2014,"hi alan ahh derelict pos towers! i participated in a crowd sourced idea thread at the start of the year. there is a link to my blog post in the topic as well as some comments. i would like to steal peoples abandoned towers. hacking, decreased shields, decay mechanics. i don<U+FFFD>t believe you should be able to just have abandoned expensive structures hanging around in space with twenty four hour warnings for you to online them.giving people tools to play their game instead of trying to build the exact game play that you want them to have will allow each person to create their version of casual, medium, or heavy gameplay. i cannot tell you what is casual. you may consider my casual gameplay to not be casual. then we are off telling each other how to play eve and there is no need for that. an example would be if missions became more dynamic where if a player were offered better missions if they headed across space but kept the same rewards if they were content doing the work they were currently doing. instead of forcing them to travel across the game which may eat into the hour they have set aside for a game play session they can now make the choice of what to do with their free time that best suites their personal game.fortunately, ccp does several things at once. while sov will be the major topic for csmx we also have corps and alliances and pos that are happening at the same time. they are just as large. these things are all intertwined. plus we will have complex topics inside of sov such as structures and how they work in the game. many of these structures such as poco and pos are shared outside of null sec and changes to their usage have to be looked at globally.voter apathy is hard to combat. it is hard to combat in eve and it is hard to combat irl. i do not think that it diminishes the csm. i think that it gives more responsibility to the csm to make sure that they are looking outside of the csm active player base to see how changes will affect those who do not tune into the metagame. i am not a marketing person and i do not have a marketing strategy to give you. we can only put the information and ourselves out there in as many formats as possible and try to raise awareness by doing.i do like cats. qwinn is currently sleeping on the heated pet bed i purchased because he turns fourteen this winter and getting arthritic. he also greets me at the door and sleeps by my pillow at night. my husband brought sabrina and sebastian to our marriage. they are siblings and turning fifteen. that is why we have more than one heated pet bed."

12/4/2014,"please don't humor dirk, he has bad taste in music and should be hanged (in-game of course) for it.if elected to the csm, will you host a weekly podcast discussing eve with people across all party lines? you could call it **** on csm (you don't have to break nda)."
12/4/2014,"i am a huge fan of s*&^ on zulu and doink has been kind enough to host it early - sometimes as early as 2pm est when jeffraider has barely finished his second bottle - in order to let me join in from my filthy european ruritania.but doink is also an unreliable shirker who hasn't arranged a podcast in weeks and who only serves to remind people how awful sa goons are these days by inviting terrible star trek online people on to make 2006-era jokes about gamers with a blithe lack of self-awareness.to expand upon my earlier comments about friends across the game, doink is a pandemic legion member who also has a character in my corp, bat country, where he could spy on us if he wants: i trust him to behave. we like to talk to our friends and eve online is just a silly game which isn't worth getting rawr rawr angry about over. we also have a very senior bni leader in corp for the same reason, and a couple of others from the red side of eve. contrary to other peoples' fear and paranoia about eve i've never been let down by any of the hostiles i've had in corp and i've made friends i wouldn't have otherwise, as a result."
12/4/2014,"from your ideas list:the answer to that was identified as the hyper travel. teleportation as i like to call it. going from one side of the game to the other in 7 minutes with a carrier while even the fastest interceptor taking gates would take an hour.any new alliance that did not immediately snuggle up and become part of an existing coalition never stood a chance because they would be the latest content addition to null in which content starved coalitions would dog pile on top of in just minutes. there was zero incentive to not go and feast on them when the coalitions territory is completely safe from anyone who is not part of the enemy coalition. timers would last for days and crossing the map was just a few minutes. young budding alliances had no choice but to join a coalition if they wanted to be in null and so much as take a single system. and at that point, are they even a separate entity or just another cog in the coalition machine? you know the answer.the only solution was to drop a nuclear bomb on the mechanics that involve hyper travel.jump fatigue is arguably the greatest change in eve online. it started working before phoebe hit as you saw some alliances remove themselves from renters and after phoebe coalitions are showing, in dramatic form i might add, that they can not concentrate their forces in one spot without losing territory in others. for the first time in who knows how long, the small guy can actually take a small piece of null for themselves. they can actually field a capital ship without worries of supers from all four corners of the map cynoing in on top of them 'just because' there was nothing else going on.now groups have to make strategic decisions on where to place capitals. where and when they should take that jump bridge. is dropping ten carriers on that single battlecruiser worth it? do i join in on this black ops hot drop and then miss the opportunity to cyno in with some of my alliance mates for a cta in an hour? again, strategic decisions are back in play. which brings me to your opinion on black ops:behold! you are now having to make a strategic decision and because of this, you are not able to power project all over anything that moves 'just because'. which of course means good news for that young alliance that is just now taking hold of a single system in null. it means that you are having to decide which is more important. the alliance cta to do 'important stuff' or go black ops hot drop all over that new guy because you are bored.what i despise is some people who, because they can't take a cyno, feel like they are not able to join their mates in glorious combat. take a gate. capital ship via gates will take too long? well ship down a bit into something that will travel faster. guess what? now because you want to project power at a distance with relative speed, balance enters the scene and you have to sacrifice firepower for speed.you are a great guy, but i will not send any votes your way if you are going to lobby to have power projection reverted back and the game falls back into the ultra stagnant boring state it was in. there is growing pains to these big changes ccp are doing, but i assure you they are for what is best for the game.i wish there was a way i could explain it better for you to see all the good jump fatigue is doing, but if i can't do it after all this time, then i suppose there is no changing your mind. this doesn't mean i disagree with you on the rest of your platform, but i don't want to see eve put back on its knees again. i hope you understand."

12/4/2014,"thanks for your comments! i 100% agree that the pre-phoebe state was very bad, but i think that this state change because of a lot of reasons and not purely the jump fatigue itself. often fear and diplomatic contracts are much worse then actual ingame tools. b0tlord is a prime example, pl has always done think for certain period, look at the hbc, pl was involved but after a few month they sorta left and that created a lot of content. same pretty much goes for botlord, we do it for a while and then cut it all off and have fun somewhere else. was the patch crucial? i would say no, the nullsec is something that we are more nervous for. jump fatigue had increadable effects but it ruins a lot of fun for the individual pilot. i hate this, i find it very strange that me as a individual pilot im forced to basicly not use a certain ship because it will stop me later on in joining up fleets. i think the future would be much better if we created a so called: jump button. this would work as followed:right click modle -> select system (current menu) -> click system, jump -> wait certain time (10mins) and continue. you can even add a activation timer when clicking the module and maybe everytime you use it it would take longer (like current fatigue). this would allow a pilot to both join his ops and have fun doing blackops and such. bare in mind, my ideas are just ideas and it is something that i would love to work on... then again you can pretty much forget that if any csm gets into office that his/.her ideas will be immidiatly implemented."

12/4/2014,i still don't understand what is stopping you from taking gates to join up with your fleet? what is preventing you from choosing a faster ship to meet up with them if they are far away?
12/4/2014,"the ''join in a frigate and take gates'' approach is indeed an option, but not one that i like. this is because it simply doesnt work in actual in day-to-day fleet concepts. frigates are important but if you have a pilot who can fly the main ship then they should. also let's not forget that pilots join fleets because they know they get kills, that's what gets them excited, and i don't want this excitement to be hurt by being forced into frigate. sure with jump fatigue you fixes the problem off alliances being able to jump all over the map but you are forgetting that those fleets all have members in them, who do things in eve on their own as well. compare it to when you break your arm, you go to the docter and he fully wraps you in with plaster because he then has fixed the problem, right? yeah, he did fix your problem, but meanwhile he created a lot more because you are fully wrapped up..."
12/4/2014,throwing my support to bobmon for being an active eve player in many parts of the game and being a very active community member. he is legitimately concerned with what's going on in eve and will make an excellent csm member.

12/4/2014,"joke question: will you be stealing csm ships to sell to anti-csm teams during a tournament? if so, can i get a good deal on said ships?serious questions: as you were, sadly, not in the initial 14 delegates properly elected and came into your current csm 9 seat due to csm 9 members stepping down, what do you feel are the best examples of the work you've done during your, currently, brief time as a delegate?what do you feel csm 9 has failed at as a group in serving their role this past year?what do you feel was your biggest failure as a csm 9 delegate during your time on council?can you please link ccp members this song in the csm 9 channel?"
12/4/2014,as for the first question: i was kicked from pl because shamis thought i wasn't safe enough to have around the alliance tournament team and therefore not safe to have in pl. the reason penif didn't protect me was because i never really flew with pl at all. i only joined because i know lelob and i only stayed because i liked the community (that i still have access to). and for real who needs spies to beat dual tanked vagabonds and beam zealots...when i came on the csm halfway through many of the major things in rhea and phoebe was already decided so i had nothing to contribute to that. what i did suggest was the removal of anchorable bubbles in thera. i also supported the removal of clones fully because i think its a mechanic that currently offers no actual gameplay. nobody ever chooses not to update their clone and the game itself flashes the cloning thing when you die to make sure you remember. it is just an arbitrary fee attached to pvp. i have not been involved with the csm for the full term so they probably made some failures during the start of the term. there might have been some failures of communication etc that i missed. but for the part where i have been on the csm it has been really great. there are ofc people who are going to work way harder or way less then others but as a group i think we really manage to give good feedback on the things ccp shares with us.my biggest failure in the csm so far is that i wont link that song in the csm skype channel ;p for real though i think my biggest failure is that i have missed some meeting because of my real life work schedule. it is a good thing they are recorded.

12/4/2014,"i'll admit i was pretty skeptical of sion last year, but as top of the goon ballot he was getting in regardless. i've watched the summit minutes, twitter and various other public outlets closely for his contributions this year and have been pleasantly surprised with what i've seen. sion came in looking like a ""typical meta-only goon director"" but has shown a solid breadth of capability and knowledge, not just an axe to grind for what can help the cfc. he is clearly thinking about what is good for the game as well.i'm going to be sorry to see mynnna's expertise in the financials go away, but sion will be getting an endorsement from me in my endorsement post this year, despite that it is irrelevant to his election.my only advice? more posts please, either on a blog or tmdc, whatever. your writeup of the monument thing was fantastic. i'd love to see you post thoughts at that level of depth on more in-game topics.the key question is: will you or endie be top of ballot for the cfc?thanks for your service and proving my concerns wrong this term, sion.author of interstellar privateer shattered planets, wormholes and game commentary"
12/4/2014,"according to official goonswarm documents and wikis, the only group of players that the cfc are not allowed to scam are people in the cfc or who are blue to them. the same documents used for legitimate recruitment of new members from sa into goonwaffe also provide links to guides on how to scam newer or less experienced players out of their space cash. goonswarm even has several dummy sites hosted for the sole purpose of convincing people to provide 500million isk collateral and a full api key in exchange for membership in goonswarm. in fact the only time when it was against goonswarm policy to scam or otherwise exploit newbies (or any player for that matter) it was also long before members were allowed to post on the eve forums. at present there exists no official rule or policy prohibiting candidates or members of the csm from lying to their constituents. if i am elected i hope to change that."
12/4/2014,"as mentioned earlier in this thread, the ganker game has become highly organized activity where a group of predators select their hauler prey and then executes it swiftly and without remorse. often the chosen victim is taken unawares.a main avenue of defense is for haulers to attempt to look less appealing in the hopes that some other victim will be chosen.things like increasing tank and decreasing cargo value are the primary mechanisms used.however, the information flow tends to be one way from victim to ganker. would you support changes to give the hauler some control over information flow that potentially could make a prey look more appealing than it is.for example, perhaps have a 'fake' plex item that on a passive cargo scan looks exactly like a real plex (but on an active scan it shows as being a fake). this could complicate the ganker decision process (and also, alas, give scammers a boost where they have contracts selling 'fake' plexes for the price of real plex.)alternatively, create a variation of reinforced bulkheads that gives slightly less tank, but reports itself as an expanded cargohold on a passive scan.these changes could make the 'head game' a bit more complicated (and perhaps more fun)"

12/5/2014,"calm yourself, its not as bad as you think."
12/5/2014,"i absolutely love logistical style things like this in my single player games.just not in eve.my first reason for disliking this involves your ""realism"" point. it's not realistic to consider that a space fairing group as advanced as the eve humans haven't perfected some form of reactors on their ships that require very little fuel already anyway. the comment about the bussard ramjet pretty much sums this up. there shouldn't be a need for fuel for day to day operations.the second reason involves the recent removal of the skill queue 24 hour limit, and the upcoming clone cost removal. ccp is in the process of removing these ""busy work"" mechanics that require you to do something before you actually get to play the game. your fuel mechanic is the very definition of this: i must purchase this fuel before i can actually go and enjoy the aspect of the game i way to be doing. it would just add another thing to list of things you need to remember to do.what if i want to go on a roam from the top of the map to the bottom? would i be forced to stop along the way at ""fuel stations"" just so i can go and find someone to shoot? what about the miners who just sit there in front of rocks with lasers cycling? do they use fuel for that too or are they exempt because they aren't moving? what happens if some ""otec"" style agreement is made between large alliances and coalitions with the fuel only available in 0.0, similar to what happened with technetium? does that mean no one else can fly caps because those guys are hording all the fuel for caps?it just doesn't work in eve in my opinion. it's just more busy work for the average pilot, and the last thing eve needs is more busy work."
12/5/2014,"one thing to fix would be these #$%@ing forums! i just wrote three full replies and it threw them away because it throught there was some html in it somewhere, rather than just leaving it there and maybe high lighting what it does not like. i am still in the process of writing a book on how to take societies forward into a technocratic meritocracy with socialistic tendencies. how could technocratic structures be applied to eve?ccp are fantastic at analysing the data that we produce, market trends, ship usage, some really bizarre stuff too. it wouldn't be beyond possible to analyse who are the most active and in what types of space. there are aspects to it, how many lead fleets, how many do it without having roles, how many corp or alliance leaders are out there ratting, mining and such with their teams. the scope is boundless. thus, it would be possible to seek people out and approach them to run for csm.""those that seek power are often the worst to hold it."" (yes, i know csm doesn't really have all that much, relatively speaking and yes that is more of a rl thing)additionally, to misquote the poet, ""some are born to represent, some strive to represent, and some have the role thrust upon them."" give me more of the third upon the first and curb the second.ccp could send out messages in all local chats. a pop up much like the down time message could come up three times a day for three days leading up to the final vote.i doubt that i shall garner more than a few votes tossed at me; as nothing more than a lark. as i said in your thread, you have my vote. i probably won't get past this stage but hopefully there will be some discussion toward maybe getting ccp to stop serving up victims that don't have a chance against a little gang of thugs. we need more ability to fight back and save ships!that is exactly one aspect that i strive for with this. thank you."

12/5/2014,"unfortunately i could not support this platform based on these two sections. it comes across very much as grr gankers, it is not for you to say 'i don't want your content' and make yourself immune from it.i'd be interested to hear your version of 'balance' that you say is missing, despite the constant nerfs to ganking over time. how far do things need to go before they are 'balanced'? what is your vision of that state?"
12/5/2014,"hi alan!i know what you mean. as i write, one of my alts is sitting in his typhoon firing torpedoes at a poco that i am sure is no longer needed by the one-man corps that put it there... a long time ago. that is really tedious!i would not be against having some form of decay that requires a corporation that owns structures to be active*, and interact with them. or how about removing the ""reinforced"" timer from some things that get shot at... if they are from an ""inactive*"" corporation... so there is no 24 hour timer to be active.*inactive could be defined in several ways, but for example either refuelling... or not having a director logging in for a specific amount of time...?all play styles should be possible... but i thought that that was the point of eve. there are already casual players here, and playing, so i don't think per se that the game needs to be fundamentally changed! what we have seen is that social interaction increases the chance of player retention. (this is where i probably say that thing again, that i have said earlier in my thread about ""social corporations"" that have no real ability to impact anything in the game).the new player experience.providing new players with the tools to learn to play and have fun. for example: there are many out there that have seen the latest ""this is eve"" trailer, and want to be a part of that... we need to take that starting enthusiasm and somehow keep it going... before people get fed up whilst running against the learning cliff.the csm is what it is. if the eve players are not interested in it, then that is their own fault. everyone has a chance to vote.firstly, i would love to see an option for the players that are actively interested in the game, or are actively interested in the csm but not any of the candidates to have a ""none of the above"" option when voting. then we could get reliable statistics on the apathy of the eve players. and stealing an idea from another candidate, maybe ccp could implement a popup (like the downtime popups) so that everyone on log in gets a pop up saying ""don't forget to vote for the csm"" during the last week of the campaigns?and as to your question about cats:i like cats as much as the next person, but where i live, domestic-cats-gone-feral are a real problem for all manner of wildlife.i would advocate responsible cat ownership!"

12/5/2014,"i can agree about the fact small corps are destroyed by a bigger fish, it's happened to me, and i've done to other corps. but this shouldn't be a reason to help the defending corp. defending corps are broken because the people inside the corp are not willing to help each other. i've run with small gang wardecing corps my entire time in eve (no more than 20 people) asides from one small time, when deadly fingertips became rather large and join ikr for a brief moment. i would like to say i know a fair bit on wardecs, and how they function from at least a meta standpoint. the reason most corps loose to a aggressing corp. is because for the most part, a wardeccing corp has more teamwork, shares a common goal, and in general has a better atmosphere than a 20 to 5 ""we do everything"" corp. the ""we do everything"" corp basically means, from what i've seen, here go mine, mission or whatever, here are some people to talk to while you do it. we don't have a goal in mind and so whatever. there is no comradery, no strive for a goal. no team just i. that is why most corps in high-sec break, because when push comes to shove. no one in this ""we do everything"" corp is willing to stick up for each other and fight together. that is why a merc corp, or wardecing corp does by far better than they do. because a wardeccing corp has set themselves to have a goal, to work together and everyone in the merc corp is ready for it. basically what i'm saying is, a ""social"" corp will always no matter how much the isk paid, no matter how many people are in it. will break to a focused corp with a goal and interest in mind. so you can raise the wardec cost. raise to the moon all you want it won't make highsec any better, it'll probably make even more stagnant. because the one drive force in eve is emotion, greed, angry whatever. if you get mad, you get focused. and then the magic happens. also i currently run a solo wardeccing corp. why should i be singled out? i'm but a single pilot verse many. currently i'm dec with corp that is around 50 members. there is no amount of sp that will save me from 20 or so moa's blasting my proteus to oblivion. a solo wardeccer is by far the most balanced part in the wardeccing mechanics. because he is very vulnerable. were as a alliance like fa, can easily counter and defend attacks on them. so why should i not be allowed to take that risk and work alone and have a challenge and know that i don't have (no offence to fa) 5 dps proteus with rook ecm on standby when i camp a gate? thats the best way i can word this so hope you understand. #deletetheweak"
12/5/2014,"the best idea i have is to start talking to people who feel this way. why would i make up solutions, if i haven't even talked to the players who see it as a problem. this answer you will get from me for a lot of issues in eve. a csm should talk to people, listen to them, get things back to basics, see how the rest of eve things about it and if not, why not, communicate this with the players who see curtain things as an issue and then find common grounds we can all agree upon.tldr : a good csm talks to people.@valkin mordirc : you dont have to create a social club, just because of the numbers in corp. its a choice you make. just as you can make a choice now to be in an npc corp. and i think they wont break down, because they will have no wars, just as the current npc players. so there is almost no difference between them. biggest plus here is, you can start forming a corp, get used to corp mechanisms, etc, without worrying about war decs. these will probably be the same players who are in a npc corp now."

12/5/2014,"i agree that this is an issue. ganking has been ""balanced"" over the years to the point it is uncommon (at least nowhere near a daily or weekly occurrence) for any player, even those in higher risk professions, to ever see one. that means the estimation of risk by a player, especially a new one, might be inaccurate, and a player can over time risk more and more thinking it is safe before a ganker/pirate catches up with them and relieves them of their assets in a catastrophic fashion. the obvious solution is to buff ganking to make it more common, something that players have to deal with more frequently, but i won't suggest that as first, i don't want to be accused of lobbying for game changes for self-interest (as i have been known to gank on occasion), and second, judging from the comments of the csm and even the current developers at ccp, the prevailing winds seem to still be blowing in the direction of making highsec safer for various reasons. therefore i will make an alternative proposal to slightly increase the level of risk in the game, and am curious what your thoughts are on it tora.players afk because there is very little risk. since also players seem to really not like losing their stuff to another player, i suggest a new rare npc-based mechanism for risk be added to the game. these will be new sleeper npcs that appear very infrequently across known space, spawning on gates, stations and belts/anomalies at a frequency that is low enough that players will run into them only rarely (1/100 hours in space?) but not never. the first spawn will just be a frigate that double webs the nearest ship and begins to apply a very small amount of damage. a few minutes later (time can be tuned as desired), it will call in a sleeper cruiser, and a few minutes after that a battleship that will be able to apply enough damage to destroy any ship within minutes. the main effect of this will be deter prolonged afk behaviour in space. any player that is at the keyboard during a spawn, or returning to the keyboard after hearing the alarms can just warp away. any player that is really afk will lose their ship. you can also make them drop cool stuff if players choose to engage them as they will be too rare and random to farm efficiently.this rare encounter will train players that space is dangerous (as it was designed to be) and that unattended/autopiloting ships can really be destroyed (by npcs or other players), and this will deter them from routine/extended use of autopiloting/afk (and come to think of it, make bot programers life a little more difficult). if you want to be clever, you could even make it so these sleepers can spawn anywhere in space where a player is and decloak them as a game mechanism to counter afk cloaking. i am not sure that is a good idea (although i really have no opinion), but i think it would be a good counter to make new eden more like ccp falcon's vision of a dangerous place, rather than the safe space conducive to afk hauling (at least in highsec) that it currently is."
12/5/2014,"i really like this idea. it makes the belts more active, it prevents afk mining, it gives gankers in belts an extra challenge and then there is no need for afk buttons to click. it could also make belts more fun for non miners too. brain fart : now if we do this on active gates too, it prevents (ganker / merc / etc) camps staying at one gate/system to long.... ---new surprising content is what makes eve great, so just smashalot."
12/5/2014,"considering the recent direction and developments by ccp, i find your platform mostly frivolous if not meaningless and misguided. unfortunately i'm going to have to side with code on this one (shudder) and say that i won't be supporting you in this election."
12/5/2014,"mercs/gankers/etc won't even have to hunt anyomore, haulers and war targets will just be killed by npc's now! let the game play for you instead of having to play yourself! such gameplay, much wow!"
12/5/2014,i doubt it. these npc aren't suppose to be unkillable so i imagine an organized gate camp will have no problem dispatching the webbing frigate. you would still need players to break an organized gate camp.plus remember these are suppose to be rare - just a small theoretical risk to make people a little more careful and used to the idea they can lose their stuff if they are afk. they shouldn't impact normal daily game play much at all.
12/5/2014,but then they have aggression timers and cant jump. and why make them rare. i rather see them join the fun more often.
12/5/2014,"you can propose any idea you want. you can also have them use scrams, or if you want real chaos, pod players. i imagine though you will get some flak for proposing the addition of a bunch of bloodthristy npc's cutting a swath through highsec's carebear population on a regular basis. i honestly prefer player-driven solutions, but npcs in highsec are currently inconsequential - i am not sure if they were always weak or have been just been left behind by the years of buffing of player ships. having the odd powerful one pop up from time-to-time and actually force a player to flee or fight might be a good idea."
12/5/2014,"hell, i'll vote for you... if for the sake of game changes are always needed for a game to evolve and keep the fun factor high.i don't necessarily agree with some of your ideas, but there are always unexpected and unforeseen outcomes which i always find entertaining.+1""eve is dying."" -- the four forum trolls of the apocalypse. ( pick four, any four. they all smell. )"
12/5/2014,"yes. specifically, for example:as i said immediately after that: i don't ignore tactics, i don't use autopilot, and i don't fly freighters.cheers for not listening again, though. bang your tinny little drum all day.on topic, i eagerly await tora's reaction to mangala's proposals for alternative social structures within eve."
12/5/2014,"i think interactions between players in eve (not just in high sec) should become deeper, more complex and more interesting. that certainly doesn't (and can't, reasonably) exclude ganking, but it's not limited to ganking either."
12/5/2014,"ah yes if you are looking at another complete re-rebalance of freighter slot allocation and hp distribution, then significantly more options open up. while agree that the ones you presented do not provide exciting gameplay for anyone, they at least make being at your keyboard significantly advantageous. to make up for that perhaps some form of active module that reduces align time? not only are you now tougher while at the keyboard but your travel times will be significantly reduced. just a random off the top of my head idea.if the value that can be ""safely"" carried in a freighter is in fact as low as 500m, then i would agree that's too low. i was under the impression it was closer to 2b which i feel is a fair number. now of course the numbers will be dependent of the freighter fit, for an anti-tanked freighter 500m might be fine whereas a fully tanked freighter should be higher."
12/5/2014,"then i believe you and i are at least conceptually in agreement, perhaps with differences in ideas and priorities of implementation."
12/5/2014,"sorry, i think missed the question. the recommendations regarding incentives for defenders typical involved hs space. it's pretty widely assumed that a small to medium corp in null that's not in an alliance is going to have a bad time. ls life will be hard but manageable, and in wh space you just might be ok, but you'll have to fight hard."

12/5/2014,"not at all, the frigate would be easily killed and if it is, the rest do not spawn. in his recommendation the frigate is essentially just a warning, if you deal with it there's no problem and no escalation."
12/5/2014,lol that'd be both funny and kinda cool. what would be the effect of fitting one of these on a bumping machariel? lol
12/5/2014,thumbs up for awesome propaghanda.
12/5/2014,"i'm still interested in the idea of eliminating afk play--which i can't say that i totally agree with. since using freighters as an example ended up starting another subject, i'll use a personal example:when we were still in w-space, we happened upon a couple of rr dominixes ratting in a c5. we caught one; the other got away. now, an ishtar and a vexor vs. a dominix is not a slam-dunk fight, so initially we were scrambling to get an advantage. and then we realized that he wasn't going to fight back. he was just going to wait for us to blow up his ship and get his pod away. so what started as a thrilling showdown became sitting there, watching our auto-orbiting, auto-firing drone boats gnawing on a battleship tank while we spammed d-scan. nobody else was around, except for the other dominix safe in its tower. i understand and respect that some people get a thrill from gaining an advantage on another player, but i don't. i would rather lose an interesting fight than win a one-sided rout. hell, i'd rather lose a one-sided rout; at least i can learn something from watching the other guys' tactics. so the whole thing was pretty dull.it's not literally afk play, but it's about as close as you can get in w-space without being a complete idiot. does this count? or are you more worried about literally afk, as in not near the machine, or with full attention in another window? because the problem there is that it's extremely hard to tell *why* someone is not inputting into the client. you only know that they are. so it becomes a question of finding out what gameplay rewards that kind of behavior and then changing it--if they want it changed.i spent a lot of time as a newbie jetcan mining in my cargo-expanded navitas. it was a way to make a little isk and chat with people while devouring the eve university wiki. sure, my attention was on the wiki, but at least i was learning the game."
12/5/2014,"out of respect to tora's csm campaign, although i wish his platform was different, but still, i'm not going to continue this here. if you would like to discuss it more this thread is a good place to go.however, before i go think about this: you admit to not using freighters and you also don't need to be aware of freighters alignment times, fittings, ehp, strategy, etc. because you don't gank/bump them, yet here you are arguing points about freighters; that you admittedly don't use."
12/5/2014,"sweet, huge plus for new groups."
12/5/2014,"i'm curious, would you want this to be a relatively risk-free activity in high-sec? if this was enabled i could see the mass rush for everyone to go out and find abandoned large towers in high-sec to sell with little to no risk, except from gankers perhaps. i think it might be interesting if hacking a corporation's anchored tower gave you a suspect flag, perhaps."

12/5/2014,"i want to see the tools for social groups strengthened, mailing lists enlargened. i would really like to see an entirely new set of mechanics for people who hang together for specidc things (like code, bombers bar, redemtion road, mining fleets, mission teams and incursions to focus on the hisec sort of thing). grouping is the glue that makes this an mmo and we need to keep working on the tools that help that.but i do take issue with your wording of the question. we should never have to force folks into groups or interactivity. there are people perfectly happy to play solo, to be the lone wolf hunter or the quiet single industrialist. there is nothing wrong with that and we shouldn't punish them for that style of play. casual players face this the most since often they have limited game time to be online or odd hours and so they find it difficult to be reliable in a social group and they self isolate.tl:dr so i want ccp to develop the tools to facilitate interaction but i do not want to force it.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

12/5/2014,you are an eve player who once posted that high-sec reward should not be nerfed because so much else depends on it.do you believe that other areas of space should be made more profitable relative to high-sec in order to drive conflict and higher population densities outside of high-sec? what would you say if i accused high-sec reward and profitability of making struggles for resources in other areas less meaningful?
12/5/2014,"calls for nerfing highsec income are usually based on the idea that 'they are playing it wrong so we need to force them to play our way.' i disagree with that style of thinking. if you want to make another portion of new eden have an advantage such as industrialism in low and null, i was in favour of that.if you start quoting risk/reward i will ask what risk afktars in null suffer. or rental agreements. some things are not a matter of risk they are a matter of effort. time. a miner may not be doing glorious battle but his effort is soemthing he is willing to do. why should we asdk that he do it in places where anybody can pop him for the fun of it (more so than they already can in highsec)the generalization of 'more profitable regions' is just that, too general. i think each section of space has appropriate activities and then some edge cases. it is smarter to carebear in relative safety. it is better to run industry where you are the government (null sov). profit margins for a trade center in low should be higher because of the risks that they take.but give me a good reason why we should nerf highsec rewards. then ask if that same reason applies to other regions. or is it you just want more targets in your space?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

12/5/2014,"i'll return to your questions later, but with respect to gank targets.tech 1 industrials are also a profitable choice, especially if pre-scanned for expensive cargo, and they can comfortably be killed and looted with two accounts.mission runner ganking was profitable if done exactly right prior to the recent exploration changes. you used to be able to sell a-type and x-type modules in a mission hub, watchlist anyone that purchased them, run locators on them and pop them with an alpha fleet to confiscate your sold modules back.however, recent changes to exploration and expeditions have increased supply of those modules to the point that the numbers no longer really work out. here's an interesting point of how everything in eve is interconnected: increased module drop rewards for lowsec and nullsec exploration and anomolies have resulted in reduced profitability of highsec ganking.incursion ships are indeed tough nuts to crack. i have done extensive theorycrafting on this matter and offered significant prizes as incentives to others to shoot them without much success. the main disincentive to ganking incursion runners is that scooping loot drops post-gank is extremely hard, making for-profit ganks difficult. part of this is due to the incursion runners' active defense of each other (a trait i respect and one that should contribute to their safety); but another major factor is rat ai. incursion rats strongly prioritize shooting anyone that uses a warp scrambler or ewar, which means that the rats actually provide assistance to incursion runners if you try to attack them when they are weakest."
12/5/2014,"these are basically all one question, so i'll combine the answer.firstly, there's people that want a 'corporation lite' that is just a chat channel. i think this functionality is better served by actual chat channels. there is a community around the minerbumping channel which includes people who are in code., people who support code., people who don't support our in game actions but find us hilarious, and spies. this community was my home, not the various corporations i've been in, since i discovered it.it's currently extremely hard to find a corporation that seems like it might be a good fit for your playstyle within the game client. this isn't an eve exclusive phenomenon - it's the case in every online game i've played. in my experience from other games, voice chat is what coheres communities, and helps you quickly ascertain 'nope, these people aren't for me' or 'yep, i'll get on well with this group'.corporation public chat rooms with voice chat would go a long way to improving players finding corps, i believe. if i could make one change to the 'corp interface' it would be encouraging the use of corp public voice chat (through eve voice). corporations could then carry out whatever recruitment security screening they felt was appropriate and recruit interested people that pass their #opsec.i'd also add the ability for corporations to bring non-members into their corp chat channel.i want to see players incentivised to hold on to a corporation and defend it when attacked, through some mixture of carrots and sticks that makes holding on usually the highest ev play (from a game theoretical point of view). currently the in-game benefits to being in a 1 person corp that was established yesterday are the same as, or slightly higher than, the benefits of being in a six month old 30 person corp.i would like to see some setup where the more ore your corp has mined over its history, the more mining related boosts your corp's medium to long term members receive. the more rats your corp has killed, the more bonuses to missioning and/or incursion running and/or anomoly ratting you receive, and so on. i don't have all of the answers here.for retention: getting newbies interacting with other players is needed, otherwise they mostly follow the 'level up your dominix then quit' path. for retaining established players, it's their social ties within game that are key. witness the cfc titan pilot that was recently accused of being a spy and expelled with extreme prejudice - the titan loss wasn't what made him uninstall eve, it was the severing of social ties. (from what i've heard he's back playing now and his alliance reinstated him in good standing, replaced his titan and consider him loyal, not a spy).making the 'game theoretical correct play' be to stay invested in your corp will help with keeping those social ties."
12/5/2014,"this statement is incorrect.depends on your definition of ""conflict"". arguably if you play any multiplayer game you have an effect on other players, but when you say that all activities should be ""balanced in ways that drive player conflict"", you're talking about direct conflict as the examples of conflict in your initial post show. at the end of the day, you're against players who want to just do pve and treat them as if the are irrelevant. a csm member has a duty to respect that people don't all want to play in just the way that csm member likes to play."

12/6/2014,"hi mike,i have questions/concern about new players and getting them integrated into the game. i think most people agree that the quality of a new player's eve experience in the game (and ultimately the time the stay playing eve) depends greatly on the initial social contacts that they make. ideally, they will shortly after finishing the tutorials end up in a good corp that can not only teach them, but support them in the activities they find most enjoyable. however, getting newbies into the correct corp can be challenging, and i am concerned that many new players can end up in small, incompetent (for lack of a better word) or downright exploitative corps which are unable or unwilling to help new players learn the game making their initial eve experience more frustrating. so firstly, do you think enough is being done to help guide new players into competent corporations that are interested in training new players? do you have any ideas on what additional mechanisms could be implemented to help new players find not only a social environment where the thrive, but into corporations willing to train and support them?secondly, there are upcoming changes in rhea which will facilitate the ""spamming"" of new players with corporation invitations and a proposal in the last csm minutes (pg. 78) to ban intracorp agression in highsec. together, these will remove two ""checks"" on this spamming behaviour that is so prevalent in other games, as there will now be zero risk in accepting new players into your corporation. this will make a strategy of ""spam inviting"" in starter systems to gather new players into an exploitative corp that has excessively high taxes or a low ore buy-back program a viable one, and one that will have a detrimental effect on the experience of new players.so, what can we do to help prevent new player's lack of knowledge of game mechanics from being exploited by nefarious, or just clueless ceos? personally, i think this is a strong argument against changing the intracorp aggression mechanics, but assuming they go through, what can be done to limit the danger of new players ending up in terrible/exploitative corps and just quitting the game?"
12/6/2014,"i edited his quote so i could focus on the questions.do i think enough is being done for new players? hell, no. that is why i am in the rookie help chat and why i am organizing operation magic school bus. i have said for years that we need to find some way to encourage the corps that actually help new players (as opposed to prey on them) whether it be by tax breaks, some sort of non-isk recognition, whatever. if we ever manage to make sorp and alliance skins i would say the helpers get theirs first.what can we do to help players against nefarious ceos? you mean like the ones already spamming in newbie systems to join their corp (which has the low low tax rate of 50-75%? or the ones who set up mining groups for thier own personal sources? spam isn't coming, it is already here. i am of two minds on this one. one: it is eve and as long as the rules are logical and apparent then some of the burden should be on the players. but this is why i agreed with the removal of awox. the rule was counter-intuitive and dumb. so yes ccp should have some very minor protections for new players in the starting and career systems i do think some of the burden alos belongs with the players.but damn, we need a better system to show them there is more than mining and missions. to encourage them to be social, to make them part of our community.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/6/2014,"you'll be getting a vote from me, mike. good luck!"
12/6/2014,"all of null-sec, both in the cfc and outside of it are pvp areas where anyone may freely engage anyone. ratting ships from all sides die, routinely, as a product of hostile action, and such losses are usually accepted and prepared for as part of the risks of living in the area. the effort required for solo pve can be minimized just as much whether you are in high-sec or null-sec, and i would assert that the main factor in balancing the incomes would be the risks players face when operating in each area.large scale sovereignty warfare moves at a glacial pace, you may see it as less ""risky"", and thousand man fleets fighting over sovereignty objectives are not an immediate part of the risks facing each sides' ratters. null-sec sovereignty deals more with alliances fighting at a large strategic scale. the risks posed to individuals making an income are more to do with small-gang pvp, which can exist anywhere in null-sec. small-gang warfare targeting ratters and renters are still very much alive, the two powerblocs do it to each other, and often support smaller ""pirate"" groups operating in each others' space.in stark contrast, there are far more limited options for directly engaging individuals making an income in high-sec. individuals can easily evade wardecs. suicide ganking has reached the point where only highly organized entities do it regularly. it may be a smarter player choice to pve in safer areas, but as a matter of having a better game, more dangerous areas should be more rewarding relative to high-sec. features like incursions which give a high-level of income in high-sec break the reward incentive for people to attempt to make money out of low-sec, null-sec and wormhole space. the incentive for making money in high-sec must decrease relative to the incentive for making money in other areas of space if pvp is to have a higher stake in the way individuals have income."
12/6/2014,"""actions matter"" is not the same as conflict. there is no conflict.miners love to say ""without us you wouldn't have your ships/modules/etc"". these people don't want to have to deal with suicide gankers(conflict) but they do want to feel like they have an impact on the rest of the game."
12/6/2014,"'the first half of the ship tiericide initiative was a mixed bag <U+FFFD> it made new players more powerful in pvp engagements in frigates and cruisers (a positive), but it also increased cruiser build cost significantly and made it much more crippling for a new player to lose a ship. this is a significant issue <U+FFFD> when i was a rookie, a vexor cost 6 million isk, or about 3 hours of running level 2 missions with low skills and little game knowledge. now it<U+FFFD>s 11 million, or about 5 hours, despite the mineral price index being about the same.'and yet you actively support destroying newbie mining ships costing much more than the 11million isk. the current cost of a retriever costs about 30 million almost three times as much as the 11 million vexor. a low skilled retriever pilot can easily be killed by couple of new order catalysts costing an couple of million isk (which is fully reimbursable). so just to recap the costs newbie mining pilot 30million isk ( about 15 hour grind (3*5) ) against sabriz's two new order pilots 2 million isk ( reimbursable 0 hrs). i guess the guy was a 'goofus' for mining. seems ok doesn't it??edit :'newbies and wardecs. newbies cannot fly freighters or afford them (anyone with those sp and resources is not a newb). our primary targets are exhumers (a month to train into), orcas and freighters (multiple months), and mining barges as a low priority (which still require more sp to sit in than battleships). 'mining barges low priority? from code. zkillboardexhumers 8,384 mining barges 13,895edit2: hiasa kite posted: 2014.12.06 18:15 i think you missed the point that the code csm hopefull doesn't really care about nuturing new players and indeed if a new player mines they are pretty much fair game. my experience of the new order is that rather than send a helpful mail offer advice they are more likely to try to send you one to attempt to make you upset so they get get a reply to post on their blog. the retriever is the optimal ship for solo mining when you start mining in a procurer you are not using the best ship for solo mining. where the procurer shines as you mention is in its defensive capabilities which as you point out is considerable and should be recommended to newer players because there is group of players that specifically target the newbie retriever pilots. since when was a retriever considered a suboptimal ship? it is a great little ship and indeed the new order along with sabriz adoudel thinks is too good a ship and wants it nerfed."
12/6/2014,"some miners do, some don't care. there's a significant subset of players who just play for the game mechanics, regardless of if they interact with others or not in any way. pretending they don't exist or ignoring them completely as an irrelevant is not the way a csm candidate should conduct themselves. it shows that if sabriz doesn't agree with your playstyle, your opinion no longer matters."
12/6/2014,salutations dear sabriznew player retention is an issue with this game and our play style can and does effect this.a new player mining in his first retriever very well may quit after his first gank. there is also the chance he will be thrilled and excited and maybe curious. this all depends on the player and how others interact with him or her. many see you as a negative effect on players but do not see all the help you give them. any ideas on mechanics that may help them? i believe solo ganking is terribly easy on people like this [solo new player alone in a belt]. i feel the best answer is community support on current mechanics and heavier interaction between players but well you know how some people are.don purple.
12/6/2014,"a fully fit venture costs less than 1mil isk.the much more powerful procurer costs 20mil isk.a low skilled procurer pilot with a ~30mil yield fit in a 0.5 system with prepulled concord requires at least 4, preferably 5 t2 fit catalysts costing about 40mil. a fully tanked procurer requires closer to ten. remember: these are best case scenario numbers for gankers. in higher security systems, it gets much worse.for mining? no. for using a suboptimal ship and fit? yes."
12/6/2014,going to vote again for core! +1
12/6/2014,both sugar and mike will always get my votes i want a eve pinball machine... confirming ccp cognac is best cognac
12/6/2014,"sugar, you'll get my votes again this year.i'm not a lowsec player, but the community that sugar has fostered as part of her csm9 tenure has made a huge impact on my day-to-day enjoyment of eve. the number of csm9 members on this thread saying how much work she does for you should send a clear message.make her your #1 vote. not #2. not #5. put her at the top of your list."
12/6/2014,"sugar running for a seat on csm x is great news for all. she is easily the hardest working member of csm 9 and will carry this ethos over to csm x with ease.regardless of whether you fly in lowsec or not, sugar deserves all the votes you can give. she is good for the csm which means she is good for you!"
12/6/2014,sugar has my vote.
12/6/2014,would you care to comment on the tweefleet.net that evenews has just setup and how alot of people on twitter who use #tweetfleet are rather annoyed about this.
12/6/2014,i run en24 not the whole network
12/6/2014,what gives with this tweetfleet grab? why did you steal an existing vibrant and open community? are you really that greedy to think you can establish ownership over something we have all shared freely for so long?
12/6/2014,"i am the owner of tweetfleet.net, registered it a few years ago. this is a side project of mine. you are welcome to go there and post.riverini / evenews24 @evenews24"
12/6/2014,"that may be the case, however en24 is the most visible and public part of the en24 network, and you as its editor are rightly associated with your sites wider network and any actions positive or negative that come about. so echoing corbexx here, what is your take on your employers blatant hijacking of a well used and loved community identity for his own ends?"
12/6/2014,"i think the question was would you care to comment, not what is your relationship to the site.as you are a csm x hopeful i would too like to hear your views on en24 network attempting to ""steal"" the #tweetfleet. obviously this has made a lot of the community very angry, so what do you think about this situation?"
12/6/2014,"except the guy who owns the domain is the guy who did it not bobmon and you're all idiots, no one ""stole"" anything."
12/6/2014,"i know that, the team tried to make a site that would support the already existing community. thats the reason behind why the name was chosen. stealing was never something the team wanted to do! support it was their objective. the project was also ment to focus on everything in the community and not have an connection to en24 at all (excapt same server and a few shared moderator positions). moderators position would be givin to those who are known for their work in the community.i always gets sad when the community gets angry. what i think about this situation? i think it was a good idea to make a new / active forum.about the name? they had the intention to help not to steal so it yeah.."
12/6/2014,"are you, as editor in chief of en24 and part of the en24 network, part of that team?"
12/6/2014,"hang on, i'm confused.earlier today you put up a tweet (which since looks like its been deleted) that had explained why you were doing it and that you had 'put this past some people who thought it was a good idea'. it was on your twitter account and signed in your name as ceo of en24.now in this thread your trying to distance yourself from the sight? so in an effort to actually find out what you stand for:1. reinstate or put the text of the tweet that has been deleted on this forum.2. detail your involvement in the start of this website.3. give your personal opinion on what you feel about."
12/6/2014,"longer then a year ago riv approached me with the time. i thought it was potentially great for a supporting platform. so i went out, i guess a year ago, with the name under my arm and asked some active users, how they felt if somebody would support the already exsiting community with a new forum. the reaction i got was positive but we didnt go through it because we had no team to really get it started. i myself didnt have enough time so the project was stopped. now others approached me with an idea to create a forum and i told them to contact riv. riv started up this project and asked my opinion. with my previous obtained knoweldge and the concept of supporting the community i said ok, i was dragged into a channel and the only thing i did was to make sure that the main focus was still on en24 and not on riv's side project. i also tested some early stuff and spent time creating some fun signatures...."
12/6/2014,"i had noticed it and felt that i was the one responsable (en24 is kinda my baby). i showed it to riv and he said: no, im the guy who they need to talk to, not you. riv told me to remove it and so i did. people started asking me questions in this thread and so i thought it was only fair to respond."
12/6/2014,"as i hope all other csm would do, i took over and we will soon change its name! have ideas: mail me!"
12/6/2014,"are you of the eligible age to run for csm? i recall hearing you're under the minimum age of 21.what does that forum provide that others such as failheap challenge, reddit.com/r/eve, zulu squad, and others don't?why did you and riverini feel the need to tack on the #tweetfleet name to a privately owned site that runs ads if you claim you aren't ""stealing"" the name from the twitter community for eve? since you seem to have made a mistake and decided to change the name, i can only interpret that this was a poorly thought out project to attach yourself to that has upset members of the eve community."
12/6/2014,"hello tive,and welcome to the discussion. that's an interesting question. the fake plex, though i see where you're coming from, is not something i would endorse. i imagine more scamming and things of that nature coming out of it. mind you i'm not opposed to people trying their luck at scamming, and such, i just don't believe a fake plex would help. on the other hand i do like that mod idea. in a broader sense the idea of there being more decoys, or electronics trickery, so that information isn't so easy to rely on would be a nice element to further develop in eve. this is also an angle that could not only help carebear vs fighter but potentially fighter vs fighter as well. naturally i'll let someone from the pvp community tell me if they'd have utility for decoys between each other but i'd imagine they would.more to the point though, i'd be fine with a mod that presents itself as a cargo expander but in reality is a lesser form of a bulkhead.kudos on the idea,~rl"
12/6/2014,"i fully endorse this person and/or serviceseriously, how could anyone not vote for this handsome bearded gentleman, covered in furs and standing next to a wolf?great dude, and would certainly make for an excellent csm"
12/6/2014,i believe in fisty
12/6/2014,"sweet i would love to chat to you, when is best for youwhat do you want to do, what would be your idea plays if you would do anything whats your idea for hisec lowsec null and w-spacewill you listen to people??"
12/6/2014,awesome to see you run fisty you have my vote!
12/6/2014,"catch me in game, or pm your comms info and i can come by to chat let me turn that around and ask you what you would like me to do? i am not skilled enough to be a game designer, so i won't even try that but i can listen to what you have to say"
12/6/2014,
12/7/2014,"tora u will have my vote. i used to fly with u guys a while back as p42alpha. you have a very good understanding of the game, when i have spoke with you in ts-even when i would do some things to really set you off(break the rules i agreed to when i joined marmite) you were very level headed and talked it out. and as a leader of a alliance like the one you have, you were very personable, and from what i could see you enjoyed and took in everyones opinion equally. was refreshing coming from 0.0, learned a lot about eve leadership from you. tyi hope the best for you. if you do get elected to the csm, i feel you will be a great benefit to eve online. tell blades i say hello, another good dude in marmite!though as small as we are, and all ex-marmite players our corp will be voting for u. but we will still be wd'ing u guys for-ever-er:)07 tora!!"

12/7/2014,"the more you write, the more people laugh at you. at you, not with you. it's important that you're able to recognize the difference if you expect to be taken seriously. this is as true for saeger1737 as it is for you, lucas.perhaps try to restrict your comments to topics where individuals who haven't hurt you are posting? that way you'll be less inclined to post emotionally and hopefully your words will deserve consideration as opposed to derision."
12/7/2014,"any don purple idea is good, you should run for csm i have no problems with my ideas not being the best around and am always willing to listen to better ideas. in the end we all want a better eve. which way we get there is up to all players in eve, not just a small group."
12/7/2014,"brain farts by sweet trader (founder of marmites) : * an autopsy skill that gives you a chance of recovering implants from corpses. yes/no, why ? * a shared inventory for all characters/alts on linked accounts (purchased by the same individual). no more trading or shuffling **** back and forth from an office. yes/no, why ?"
12/7/2014,yes yes yes yesi think when you pod someone you should have a chance to get 25%-30% of there implants drop into there corpse.
12/7/2014,"brain farts indeed... read lovingly crafted suggestions. the second one is a pure quality of life feature... we all know what multiboxers do, so why make their existence such an unnecessary clickfest? if you are in a station with stuff that belongs to any of your accounts/alts it should be in the same hangar. tora all the way. some think he's a character... some think he has character. i'm in the second group."
12/7/2014,"1) yes if there is a balancing pass made so implant prices don't collapse. if that happened the salvaging of implants will become kinda pointless. 2) no, i don't think multiboxing needs a buff."
12/7/2014,"hello,thank you for having the same passion that many of us share playing this game.i do not agree with you revised ganking procedure, eve is not a safe place, not even ""high security"" systems, ganking should not be revised. i suggest inserting a new item, secure passworded containers, items that only capital ships can carry that have an encryption level based on a skill, also a decryption skill would be needed in order for them to be opened and it would take say 15 days for a lv 5 decryptor to hack a lv 5 encrypted container.people should not be more baby treated, they should organize themselves when transporting valuables in high sec and not afk freight 15 billions of stuff, simple as that.plus the ""stations will spit you out"" if you gank is just pointless. stations have always been and always should be the only safe place for pods and ships (maybe not characters?).i do not agree on a afk timer for cloackers but we need a system to counter macro/botting, this should be not done through change in ingame mechanics but should be adressed by ccp internally with some monitor program.the mining boredom is a problem, i would make it more profitable but more challenging, changing the mining ships in a way that requires them to be dynamically managed, adding content, making mining belts casinospeople that want to avoid wardecks can stay in npc corp, the current system ensures only the best business models survive, generating stronger more coordinated and cohese entities. the current wardeck system works just fine.people should not be forced in leaving npc corp, it is a good aggregator and many people use them for various purposes.the industry changes i approve ofempire poses should simply have a limitation on defences that are possible to fitsorry but you do not have my vote, especially because of the changes you propose to high sec.r"
12/7/2014,"the incentive for making more isk is the same every where so i assume you mean the means. right?look, we can play this point counterpoint all day because you missed what i was saying. i am not trying to ruin or even change your gameplay when we discuss ways of making isk but i, in return, ask the same. do not look to nerf someone else to make your own situation be better. look to improve your own space, make it attractive.it is like real estate . . . graffiti on the next block over might make yours look better, relatively, but it is a downward spiral and in the end, few want to live anywhere nearby. if we make highsec untenable then we block a distinct portion of the game population who have no want or need to go to low or null. that hurts the whole game. make your space better . . . not by making someone elses space worse but by actually making your space better. as a result the whole game will benefit.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/7/2014,"what i am saying is that areas outside of high-sec must be more attractive for making isk relative to high-sec if we don't want the game to devolve into e-sports where players and groups can easily recover losses in the ""safe-zone"" of high-sec. groups like cfc and the new order actively attempt to disrupt high-sec economic activity because we understand the impact that the wealth it produces has on the rest of the game. if capital pilot owners on both sides mine in high-sec or run incursions, would it not be in our interest to disrupt and hurt such activities? if producers in high-sec are in direct economic conflict with our own industrialists, would it not be in our interest to slaughter them en-mass? conflict comes to high-sec because it is connected to every area of the game. if the humble high-sec miner, mission runner, incursion runner or industrialist who do not want to leave high-sec were not in economic competition with the rest of the game, you would certainly see less effort put into their extermination."
12/7/2014,doubtful. it's one thing for miniluv or code to target known logistics alts and alt corps of enemy power blocs. it's quite another to massacre every freighter that enters a pipe system. even if nullsec was far and away the best place to do industry you would still see people doing it in highsec and you would still kill them so your argument is pointless justification. but that is to be expected from james 315's followers.
12/7/2014,"mike, i always have fun talking with you, feel like i can approach you with any of my ideas i think are worth doing more than just throwing at a wall to see what sticks and when we disagree on things, you can articulate your point to even someone as hard headed and opinionated as me.+1 for mikes continuation on csm. +1 for letting mike continue to use the developed relationships and skills to be an effective part of csm."
12/7/2014,"i see mike as one of the more active csm on the forums, soliciting opinions and visibly reading and responding to feedback threads. i don't regret voting for mike in the past and i'll vote for him again despite his being a horrid dirty carebeargiven these conditions,- if players were avoiding activity in dangerous space due to rewards not stacking up to the effort/time/risk, - when players would otherwise enjoy activity in that space including hazards (i believe players generally gravitate to the most optimal method for an activity regardless of 'fun factor'), - when making changes would probably cause players who would prefer to play there to move there, - when making changes would not cause safer space to have inoptimal rewards for effort/time/risk for those who would prefer to remain,- and when changes would create additional or more enjoyable pvp/piracy encounters for everyone who desires such gameplay, i feel 'making more targets move to this dangerous space' would be a good goal, because it's adding to the entertainment value of the game by presenting more engaging options for those who want to take themthat's not reason for simply nerfing the 'better' options, though. it's a hypothetical circumstance that may justify a certain goal. i imagine there's many paths to achieving the goal, and by taking the most obvious, nerfing something, you're possibly ignoring more effective or less disruptive optionsi think it'd be ideal to have any given activity have about equal viablity in all areas of the game. for example, shooting red plus signs. pete might like lowsec belt ratting over running highsec missions, but before the clone tags were introduced, pete only ran missions because he when belt ratting he felt he was wasting his time. now with mordus rats and clone tags, pete flies around lowsec belts and enjoys his pve hours more than before. pete sometimes runs into pies but even with the bother and the hazard, the isk is more worth his time nowe: uh wow that last bit has nothing to do with what's quoted. i guess i wanted it in there as a positive example of making space more appealing to people who might want to play there"
12/7/2014,"i endorsed mike for csm 8 on a long shot - i didn't think he had all that good a chance of getting elected, but i thought it was definitely worth trying to help an advocate for the ""little guys"" of eve get elected, because i believe that a csm with a diverse range of experience and viewpoints is a stronger, more effective csm.mike repaid that that endorsement a hundred times over in csm8, and then gave us an encore for csm9. the argument that the individual, the loner, the casual needs a representative is as strong as ever, and mike's proven ability to speak up effectively for that constituency, and his two terms of experience in delivering that voice make him an inarguable choice for the role. i strongly urge you to find a place on your preferences for mike.vote mike azariah!"
12/7/2014,"what a joke. this is about as funny as your campaign on ganking incursion runners. probably end up about as successful.also, per your comment in tora's thread.""out of game - he's absolutely, positively someone the csm needs, and will probably receive second (maybe third) place on my recommended how to vote list.""you sure sound full of yourself, even have a recommended how to vote list, for the sheep?just another ******, trying for some eve fame."
12/7/2014,thank-you for supporting sabriz's campaign by bumping the thread.
12/7/2014,in addition to helping create a stereotype of what his opponents are like.
12/7/2014,you have my votes.
12/7/2014,"sugar kyle running for re-election is fantastic news, and was the primary current council seat i was hoping to hear would return given the chance. everyone who has kept up with the work csm 9 has done knows that sugar has been absolutely exemplary of what the eve community and ccp could ever hope to have as a council member.vote and keep her very high on the ballet if not the #1 vote that is so clearly deserved. it's not only a vote low-sec, it is a vote for eve online itself to be a great as it can be."
12/7/2014,"since you openly admit to being the man in charge of gia, the goon intelligence agency, how do you think ccp can stop people from doxxing other players for the ""meta"" game part of eve? as the leader of gia, why do you support efforts of members of the gia in their doxxing efforts? also, what is your activity level? how often do you actually log in to play?"
12/7/2014,why are you running for a csm seat with an alt and not your main character?
12/7/2014,endie is a good person and i like the ideas he is behind.
12/7/2014,if you try and read the last part of he's post you see that he don't own the real endie character
12/7/2014,"i answered this already on this page about two posts ago but let me say again: i don't doxx people; none of my gia people dox anyone; i have nothing to do with such activities.as i said on reddit when you asked me the same thing, since nothing has changed:""i don't want to do anything to anyone in eve which i'd not be happy about them doing to me, and i would hate to get doxxed. ergo i think doxxing people is ******, unpleasant, and if you want to look at it in totally detached lawl meta terms it is also stupidly counter-productive.edit: the nastiest thing i do is make rude jokes about people and god knows they do the same thing right back to me!"""
12/7/2014,"i answered this in the op: i play eve a lot, whether in mainfleet, mid-sized eg stuff, or roaming with bat country in small gangs. again, as i explained in the op, i don't own the character endie, nor have i ever. since quite a lot of people know who i am as ""endie"" and not by the name of any of my 20-odd eve characters, i decided to make a character that clearly identified me so that there was no confusion."
12/7/2014,"when it comes down to potential csms, i think the most important factor in any sort of evaluation is passion. when you have someone who is head of one of the games biggest fan-sites, the passion is undeniably there. ideas and campaign promises are interesting, but the csm aren't junior game designers. he's got the passion, he's got the motivation to work with the community, and he knows how the game works. pretty good combo if you ask me."
12/7/2014,"met bobmon , saw the passions, love the person, defo a awsome candid<U+FFFD>te"
12/7/2014,u awesome sir have my vote !!!
12/7/2014,"i've known bob for a few years now, he's a good honest guy who's got my vote. go for it bob!"
12/7/2014,"bobby has the mental age of stephen hawking, thus superior to yours.obviously it provides space for the readers of en24 to voice their opinion and the writers space to get feedback from their own readers as to what they'd like to see more of in future articles.surely if the name has been changed it means that he does not wish to create drama, and would rather have a compromise than upset the player base (something one would hope to have in a future csm member bobmon for csm"
12/7/2014,sure why not
12/7/2014,does this not make this whole topic/campaign pointless if he is not old enough to run?
12/7/2014,whats your opinion on rlml's and hml's?

12/8/2014,steve has been invaluable on csm9 and i strongly endorse him for csmx. he has been a pleasure to work with and his feedback has been vital in solving many of the current issues in the game.
12/8/2014,you stance against gankers and wanting your mining vessel to have a 50% win chance eliminates you as a serious candidate.you are in a pve ship facing someone who fitted his ship for the single purpose of killing you. if you fit for the sole purpose of tanking his damage can he still solo gank you while making a profit?what makes you a better candidate to vote for as mike azariah or sugar kyle?their goal is to improve eve for everyone. your goal seems to be improving eve for carebears while nerfing gameplay of people that are not you.
12/8/2014,"thank you for taking the time to read my campaign thread!what do war decs have to do with gankers? (other than code. seem to have a war dec thing starting up....)i do not want to make myself ""immune"" to it. i think i already mentioned a couple of times in the thread words to the effect of ""i am not campaigning for a theme park eve, because ccp will never make one.""for example:give me the tools to keep me safe.allow me to decide to use them, or take the risk not to.the new player experience does not (as it stands) prepare new players, also new carebears, for life in eve. i've played through the tutorials on more than one alt... and there was nothing there about d-scan. there was nothing there about how to fit a ship according to the current theories and trends for pvp or pve. there wasn't even anything like a friendly nudge in the right direction.ok, you could say that ""google is your friend"" but there are enough of us care bears out there that have not mastered the intricacies of efficient internet searching... how about (for example) an evemail automatically for every new character (firstly introducing the new guy to the functionality (or presence of) evemail) that has a couple of helpful links... wikis... eve uni... stuff that a new guy might like to read?press the information into the hands of us carebears. then see what we do with it. if we do nothing, then that is our choice/fault... but it ought to be a choice... and just trying to google eve brings up a lot of old information, and information of dubious quality.and i believe that i have also said that i would love to have the caldari navy intelligence secure self destruct module... that is 99.5% guaranteed to destroy my ship, all mods, all cargo et cetera. it is, of course, an active mod... but if i am not afk or dicking around i can make sure that those gankers don't get their hands on my shinies!"
12/8/2014,the marmite name makes everyone look for the hidden agenda.i won't vote for tora simply because of his stance against afk cloaking. afk cloakers are an annoyance but the only thing i think of is me being trapped in a dead-end system unable to jump out because there is a gatecamp and unable to log off because hostiles have probes out.and then i have to set an alarm clock every 20 minutes to prevent losing my ship and implants?i will accept an end to afk cloaking if they will introduce a way to log off safely without getting killed.
12/8/2014,"i knew i took a risk here, as marmites isnt the most loved alliance in game. but people who know me well, also know that i can set aside my personal issues and go for the bigger picture.i don't see why you can't log off after you timer has run out ?"
12/8/2014,"and i'm certain that players like yourself slapping their knees and laughing at me matter to me oh so much.i'm not posting positionally. you leaping in to launch personal attacks at me in defense of your beloved tora would seem to be an emotional response here. tora claiming that someone pointing out reasons he would make a bad csm representative is ""off topic"" is an emotional response. tora has never hurt me. a useless person sitting around in highsec running a corporation which is amounts to ""griefing new players and supporting gevlon goblin"" is hardly going to have an effect on a high level trader and industrialist operating primarily out of nullsec. i post in this thread because i oppose the campaign and will voice my opinions wherever i wish. if you don't like that, tough. go cry to someone else about it. or don't, who really cares.the fact that you're in marmite is neither here nor there. the fact that your campaign here is terrible and anyone having read posts by you or your alter ego general lemming knows that what spills out of your head is pure unfiltered garbage is what will put most people off of voting for you."
12/8/2014,i think you're confusing multiboxing to having more then one character active (which can happen on the same account)
12/8/2014,"if this change were to be used, why would a new skill be needed as opposed to the hacking skill? it's already a rather unused and untapped skill that only pve players use.i like the concept, but the idea of adding a whole new skill (when there are many redundant and useless skills already) isn't necessary. just make hacking v to be the minimum to revert an offline tower."
12/8/2014,"corbexx csm, best csm"
12/8/2014,i also endorse corebexx for csm
12/8/2014,easily the greatest and most active csm member i have ever met. keep up the good work and you have my vote for re-election
12/8/2014,"although corbexx and i don't necessarily agree on new features or how things should be implemented, i have found him to be a strong voice and trustworthy representative of the space that i ""grew up"" in. i still keep a close eye on wh space and i haven't seen another wh representative during my time playing who really does deserve the player's votes.keep on with the amazing work you've been doing and expect a vote from this player in the upcoming elections."
12/8/2014,mike azariah is one of my most very favourite people in all of new eden. and that's before i even take into account the amazing work he has contributed to csm9. you should vote for him - i will be.
12/8/2014,"much of the isk/hr that high sec activity can generate is because high sec is the beating heart of the eve economy. would you agree that part of the problem with nullsec income in particular isn't just the risk, but the fact that it's a nearly pure isk faucet that hardly requires any interaction with other players--and their wallets? given that a neck-punch to high sec might just bring the whole game's economy to its knees, wouldn't it be better to figure out how to get players to interact profitably? if you could get the isk transfer/isk injection ratio in null sec to roughly the same proportion that mission running enjoys in high sec, that would be a huge buff to null sec income, but with the same or less isk injected.unfortunately, that would be a very tall order. but do you think that it's the right track, or do you have a better idea?"
12/8/2014,+1 vote from me. every little bit helps.
12/8/2014,"man you ask think questions with a lot of layers.to the first part? no, null does make a fair amount of isk in their own space. they just don't talk about it as much. so null is not the impoversished waif some make it out to be.it would be better to help players interact but, as i have said before, not force them to do so. there are some players who take solace in quietly mining or running missions. i know, i am, at times, one of them. to gut highsec would not move players to other regions, some it would move to other games.as for the last part i wrote a huge paragraph and then realized i was tapdancing too close to my nda boundaries for my own taste. but i can say in more general terms that a lot of commonly held beliefs of how things are in eve are based on faulty premises.but back to my key point. i do not want to ruin one space to benefit another. each space should have its own draw and its own reason to be there.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/8/2014,"ok. i promised to respond more in detail to this when i had time; so i'll do so now.pve content in highsec is currently designed to be grind-based and fairly low player interaction. anomalies are the most competitive content in highsec but they have their rewards tuned so low that noone runs them.with the exception of quite new players, this leads to an environment where pve stops being about ""can i succeed at this mission"" and instead becomes about ""how can i most quickly/efficiently succeed at this mission"". efficiency becomes everything, and pve does not remain interesting once you get efficiency focused.fundamentally, this comes down to the fact that player opponents are dynamic and unpredictable, while npc opponents are static and predictable. even where npcs have very high stats (such as the burner missions) it all comes down to learning an established efficient way to beat them and doing so.add in competition with other players (not necessarily starship combat) and this becomes a very different equation. look at how *terrible* the pve aspect of factional warfare is - 'kill one rat, orbit a beacon, kill the rat when it respawns, then sometimes shoot a structure'. this utterly terrible pve content entertains thousands of players because of the involvement of other players.there is a form of conflict available in incursions via the mechanics for contested sites, but the stakes are just too low for contests to matter much. if your fleet loses a site contest, you incur no real cost and only a hundred million or so in opportunity costs. you can also quite easily determine who will be likely to win before a contest happens, and if you assess that you can't win a contest you usually just warp out of the site and go and do another one.some rough ideas of what player conflict driven pve content in highsec could look like, from lowest to highest level of pvp:- add level 5 security missions to highsec, but have them take place in deadspace areas where concord only responds to pvp aggression towards pods (not towards ships). unlike lowsec l5s, you will need to be scanned down to be attacked (in lowsec, you can be attacked on gates or undocks as well).- a new type of mission agent that give missions only once per thirty minutes (at a set time). everyone gets the same mission in the same deadspace pocket. these missions are designed in such a way that a limited number of people can succeed at them - perhaps you have to land a killing blow on an elite battleship npc and there are only three of them in the site, or perhaps you have to collect a particular dog tag or cargo item. penalties for failure are purely isk (no standings loss) and are at a level that irritates, not a level that cripples. - new types of anomalies that always offer escalations. however, anyone else doing these anomalies in the constellation or region will also get the same escalation. concord will not respond to pvp aggression in the escalation site.- new anomalies that always offer escalations, however, the escalations always occur in lowsec.- region-wide events where at unpredictable times an npc fleet fight takes place, and players can join in on the side of their choice, and have the right to shoot both players and npcs fighting for the other side."
12/8/2014,"sounds like your ideas pretty much boil down to ""replace pve with pvp"" and ""make places where i can gank without concord getting involved"".what you fail to understand is that some people like pve, not pvp. better ideas will be around making pve more engaging without turning it into pvp. the second you try to make it more engaging by adding pvp conflict, you fundamentally miss the reasons people enjoy pve. it's certainly possible for npc based content to be challenging, it needs to simply be less formulaic and require more on the spot thought from a player."
12/8/2014,"she's talking about adding stuff that will lead to pvp/pve hybrid situations, that's not 'replacing pve'. i really can't see why anyone would object to adding stuff like that. nobody will be forced to run them, they merely add another, imo interesting option."
12/8/2014,"this tax already applies, if you care to run a site you'll see a piece getting taken by corp tax. if anything this encourages people to create 'tax haven' one man corps.i think players don't join corps and stay fighting for them is mostly because of the effort to organise for game play they don't generally enjoy."
12/8/2014,"because it's all an attempt to gradually move pve into pvp. i'm sure that the arguments would be made that because it's pvp, thus more risk, that it should then be more rewarding, then traditional pve would be left behind to rot. and lets face it, the last attempt at hybrid pve/pvp was fw, and that got abused by people ganking their alts and is now pretty much dominated by double stabbed plexing.the objection i have is that sabriz has absolutely no intention of accepting the existence of pve players. it's in the op. pve players don't want pvp. what they want is more engaging pve. why should those players be ignored so players who want to pvp can have more hybrid content created for them?"
12/8/2014,"perhaps you have some suggestions for sabriz on how to make pve more engaging? in my eyes, players who only want to pve already have quite a few options, but by it's nature pve always becomes optimized and grindy. incursions and wormhole sites were designed to be very challenging, but even they have been ""figured out"" and reduced to an efficiency game. (and yes, wh sites do have an element of pvp).so how would you make pve more engaging - without including player interaction? sabriz has some ideas of her own, but one of the most important traits of a csm candidate is being able to listen to and identify good ideas from the community. what is yours?want to talk? join my channel in game: house forelli"
12/8/2014,"while the first part of your reply is a bit of slippery slope argument, sabriz seems to be voicing a reasonable position. she is saying that since eve is a single-universe competitive sandbox, any new pve content should be designed with fostering this competition and the emergent gameplay that results from it. you are welcome to disagree, but it doesn't seem to me that sabriz is proposing anything especially egregious. now there are arguments about where best limited development resources should be spent - on more solo pve content which (according to ccp) the majority of these consumers quit the game quite quickly, or on more interactive content and game mechanisms that promote social interactions and thus player retention. however, that is really a ccp business decision which requires information that i lack to make any solid conclusions."
12/8/2014,"the simplest way would be adding more variation, so ""figuring out"" pve is more difficult because it's dynamic. take for example missions. they are made up of static waves of npcs from static triggers. instead, give each wave a set of points, and randomise the npcs where tougher npcs cost more points. add the need to engage in ecm and counter-logistics to rats and it's already miles ahead of where it currently is.i've played more games that i could possibly try to count, and many of them have very engaging offline modes. it's certainly possible to achieve without needing to add pvpanother important trait of a csm candidate is accepting that not everyone plays eve for the same reasons you do. it seem pretty obvious that sabriz has absolutely no respect for players with gameplay styles which aren't focused around pvp. the op even goes so far as to suggest that a certain subgroup of players simply don't exist.slippery slopes aren't always wrong. suggesting they are is to suggest that changes would never occur as a precursor to further changes in the same direction. and while all content should have levels of competition, making it so that new pve content forces you to move to an area when you can be ganked without concord protection certainly doesn't seem like the right way to go about it. to be honest it sounds like ""i'm running out of targets and want a new mechanic that allows me to kill more people who don;t want to fight"". yes, many of those people quit. the stats from fanfest in fact show that around half of new players leave eve within a month, of those that remain 10% go into group content, and 40% move into solo/pve content. put another way, if 75% or less of players who stay more than a month but move into solo/pve content leave, they they are still above or on par with the number of players who stay for group content even if none of the latter group leave (highly unlikely).now to me, this would be an indicator to devote time to making pve more engaging. considering pve gets very little work, and mechanics like mining have been the same dull gameplay for pretty much ever it would seem it's long overdue. obviously there are players joining who like that experience, so pretending they do not exist and focusing on yet more pvp zones would seem to be a bit backwards."
12/8/2014,"ok, sure, but if you frame it that way then any attempts to add mechanics that promote more interaction or competition between players is ""an attempt to gradually move pve into pvp"". even mike azariah agrees that ccp should be spending development time on increasing the mechanisms facilitating group and player interaction. i see no problem adding new, optional, pve content that is more rewarding but has additional risks (such as, but not limited to, reduced/no concord). it's essentially just a proposal to bring a bit of lowsec into a specific highsec context. eve is all about risk vs. reward and lowsec (or this hypothetical new mechanic) pve should be more rewarding. perhaps you are right, and more people would stay if the pve would massively revamped. however, eve is not a single-player pve game: it is a sandbox where social interactions, both competitive and cooperative are paramount. ccp seems to have recognized that and everything ccp seagull has said points to development being focused on a more player-controlled, player-driven eve universe in the future, so i doubt you are going to see any significant solo pve content ever again. even if a complete revamp was done (which for mining might happen eventually), it will be to make it more group orientated and competitive, not make it more solo-friendly and isolationist.i am not saying you are wrong in your views - you like what you like - but you appear to be fighting an uphill battle against the direction eve is moving. you've made it clear that sabriz isn't your candidate, but i am not sure you are going to find many other csm candidates that share your view that eve development resources should be spent on expanding eve solo content over group content, nor even if you did would the developers listen to that csm member."
12/8/2014,"sure, adding more social tools (and if you noticed he mentioned pure pve activities for that too) is generally a good idea. i strongly believe that people would work together on pve if everything wasn't stacked against doing so. many games give bonuses to working in groups, eve simply splits the rewards, so there's really no benefit in working together. more tools for collaboration all round is a good idea. the real difference is though that mike accepts there are players who like to play solo, and that it's ok to do so.eve is a game for all types. and to be honest, whatever seagull says, the game needs players to accomplish anything. some players like to play without combat. if they are going to simply write those people off, then it really doesn't matter who's csm.i'm not saying that solo content necessarily needs to be a focus, but it certainly needs to be accepted as part of the game, and non-combat content will always be required and certainly needs love. sabriz's ideas amount to ""add more places to gank people who don't want to be attacked"" seem to be pretty selfish in design. like i said before, a csm candidate needs to be trusted to look out for the needs of the community, not just their own."
12/8/2014,"there is definitively no such thing as people that play without impacting the rest of the game.there are definitely people that *think* they don't affect anyone else. the ore they produce, the meta and faction modules they add to the economy - these people turn the tide of wars. would goonswarm have defeated test if 'phased muon sensor disruptor i' cost ten million isk, not 2.5 million? it would cost ten million or more without career highsec mission grinders.if people want to experience pve content completely sheltered from other players' actions - they already can do so on the test server, where surprise pvp is completely banned. however these players do not want to do so, because when they do so they also lose their ability to impose their actions upon other players through the market.i started as a 'carebear' player, levelling up my dominix. had i not been shaken out of that, i would have definitely left eve. the server structure enforces a 1 second 'tick' needed to support fleet fights which, when combined with inertia mechanics, removes any prospect for a 'fast action' feel in combat in the game. for those reasons eve's pve will always be slower paced and can never manage to be as engaging as the pve found in games like path of exile that are *designed* for pve first and foremost.finally eve is not a game for all types. it never has been. so many of its fundamental design decisions - real loss pvp, extremely high productive capacity to fuel all of that destruction, making sure that 'low level' ships remain useful to experienced players and more - all of these are designed to push eve down a very different path to other games. there have been many pve-oriented games with better pve than eve that have gone broke."
12/8/2014,"when people use this against you, it's just going to raise more votes for you.

12/8/2014,"corebloodbrothers is a very honest, loyal and straightforward (dutch: ""recht door zee"") guy. he is one of the most outspoken passionate-about-eve people i know of. the time this man puts into organising the near daily fleets for the providence residents is admirable, considering he has a fulltime job and a family. like i said, he is passionate about eve and cares a lot about the people he flies with and against.now, he might not know every final percent of min-maxing detail or capital fleet engagements, but he sure knows how to field large (and often very succesful) fleets of various compositions. with people flying both doctrine (main fleet composition) and as-good-as-it-gets ships (""kitchensink""). corebloodbrothers allows every capsuleer, both old and new, to participate in an accessible and enjoyable way. people (in providence) love to fly with him as fc.expect corebloodbrothers to actively pursue changes to eve which attract more new players, and bring back old(er) pilots. we all benefit from a healthy playerbase. he will advise ccp of fleet balance issues with the intent of keeping compositions other than ""supercap"" enjoyable for the masses. read up on his past efforts regarding this if you like to know more. i'd say corebloodbrothers' intentions to make eve a better place to enjoy nullsec pvp in are worth your vote."
12/8/2014,"i did... however, the response i got was that they couldnt get into it because they are not allowed to say bad things about other csm members, only nice things (something sensitivity training something). that is why i am asking why they are not endorsing you: do they have nothing nice to say? or do they just not want you on their team?like, you have none...."
12/8/2014,"you have my vote again! thanks for all the work you did this past year, and hopefully you get a chance to get back at it in 2015!."
12/8/2014,"sugar has been arguably the hardest working member of csm9 in my opinion. while she has been a massive credit to those lowsec pilots who elected her, sugar's views on other areas of the game have been invaluable. her work on the minutes was also frankly staggering. an easy endorsement."
12/8/2014,"as a player who started eve around the same time as sugar, i have found no other players voice that stands closer to my own on so many different areas and aspects of the game. the impact sugar has had on eve, not only since becoming a member of the csm, has easily earned her my vote again. keep up the great work sugar :)"
12/8/2014,"so then, when the issue of one player collecting, posting, and sharing the personal information of other players was brought to light, and it seemingly has become a recurring theme with different examples cited each time, what do you feel is the appropriate response to curb that behavior?do you think it crosses the line into ""real life harassment"" that ccp have reinforced their policy on recently and should be condemned? do you feel it's an internal cultural issue with that player's organization and the ""us vs them at any cost"" mentality that same player cites as his rationale? do you feel that is a healthy aspect of the community that 50% of the sov holders have towards the game?clearly people are linking you to the actions of digi and his usage of collecting other players personal out of game information. this is clearly due to the gia, which you openly state you are the head of and thus are perceived to be the cause of these acts.in the spirit of supporting the ""meta-game"" what do you think ccp can do both mechanically in-game and policy wise to limit the inherent danger joe the gamer can experience out of game by someone like that, without neutering the ability to prevent enemies in-game from committing acts such as the ones that destroyed band of brothers etc.? it is clearly the fear of being destroyed from the inside that caused those acts of doxxing to occur.please don't fall into the fallacy of thinking this is taking pot shots at you (as some people tend to resort to when these questions are raised to them), i'm genuinely curious how you see this issue and how you would go about fixing it."
12/8/2014,"i think that if someone has their private, personal details released without their permission then yes, that sounds like real life harassment and if ccp feel brave enough to enforce that then i would entirely welcome them doing so. of course, someone could rules-lawyer that with specious ""what if"" hard cases, but i hope that i'm being pretty clear on the principle. i think that i've been extremely clear on my distaste for such practises.personally, i can only remember this happening once in the last couple of years, but that once was too often, and i hugely regret that it was by my alliance.if ccp assigned some unique numeric id to each player, and made it a strongly-enforced contractual term that you do not attempt to register with more than one such id, and made public the characters linked to that numeric id, then that would do what the counter intel guys do. but that would be such a huge and dramatic shift in the nature of eve that i am not sure that the playerbase would accept it, and it would certainly strip away most of the backstabbing, convoluted, spying metagame that draws many people to eve in the first place. i suspect that it would also not be even 80% effective.but lets be clear: the spying metagame does not justify doxxing. it explains why counter-intel people try to find out if a given friendly character is owned by the same person as a hostile character: every major nullsec power has to do this to survive. but it does not justify publishing those details. so finding out that manny was flying a titan for a cfc alliance and blowing it up? that's an in-game consequence and entirely fine. publishing some of his details just to show off that it was him? totally and utterly out of line.i'm not at all annoyed, and those are very fair questions: given that most of eve probably thinks that mittani still runs the gia (something he happily encourages people to think), it is not surprising that plenty of them think that digi has something to do with it. i imagine some cfc members do.in fact, digi is not in the gia, and his only interaction with our agents is when he bans them and i have to tell him to leave them alone and unban them because they are our brave patriots fighting the dastardly enemy in his fiendish, underhanded war."

12/8/2014,"nullsec industry- not all things should begin and end with jita. what if there were a better way for nullsec'rs? i think nullsec industry boost would be great for nullsec and the game overall. it would also lead to more reasons for players being in space doing things like collecting and harvesting materials and resources. those people will be hunted so they will need people protecting the area. this gives lots of new meaningful things for attackers and defenders to do that actually make a real difference. also this strengthens the need of non-pvp'rs to be included in nullsec. as currently 99% of players recruited by nullsec groups are pvp'rs. allowing more dynamic playstyles is a good thing for everyone in nullsec. lowsec- why is it that high security space has all the bells and whistles and you lot are left with your hands empty? what if there was a way to offer great services to builders , refiners and researchers for a fee? creating a system where customers could purchase benefits and protection from faction warfare. they pay a fee and purchase standings to the local fw or the ability to use speedy facilities or efficient facilities that are better than what they can get in high security space. now fw have a vested interest in protecting customers or thwarting off wouldbe attackers or raiders. also gives fw a reason to want to expand territories to have a bigger market share of business. because business = isk into pilots pockets.*note - i ran for csm9 but due to usa immigration i didn't have my passport in time. i have spoken with ccp in great detail via petition to make sure i was in fact a valid candidate for csm 10."

12/8/2014,"what is your view on competitive pvp in eve? (at, neo, some kind of dojo)where do you see eve in a year, regarding competitive gameplay."
12/8/2014,what is your favorite children's toy to step on in the middle of the night while walking through a hallway?
12/8/2014,needs more swagger.what are your perspectives towards the sov. warfare's future and any ideas to improve it?
12/8/2014,+1 for an actual bomber re-balance. would love to hear your suggestions on how to bring the little buggers back in line.
12/8/2014,skilled player who would get my vote too.
12/8/2014,"how do you balance the learning experience for new players whilst also teaching them that eve is a rough place and they shouldn't particularly expect it to be fairwhat would you do to make it so that n+1 isn't the easiest way to win fleet fights e: how would your sov system work wrt to timers and sov structures. what would you do to actually encourage people to live in sov null. do you have any ideas on npc null and lowsec (that isn't fw.) what would you do to encourage pvp in hisec , and possibly make it a viable home for people in the long term."
12/8/2014,"t3s as they stand are better than bs , hac , command ships they dominate fights as they do most thing very well all at once. i am not a game designer but it feels like they do too much well at once. tank , speed , sig , dps & dps application. please point to a hac , bs , bc hull that can do all of the above other than the ishtar. i am not quite sure what to do with the ishtar either but its still pretty op. i think maybe reducing the dronebay size is the answer."
12/8/2014,pretty much. the ishtar and tengu still have lower sig because of the hull size and they are extremely kitey making bombing them much harder. the bomb meta is cancer on fleet tactics. you don't see alpha fleet you don't see missile boats like ravens or navy scorps. the high sig of shield comps makes them a instant non starter.
12/8/2014,"bs get bombed and have terrible mobility, hacs are generally speaking fairly flimsy and command ships are a mess.don't you think these issues should be addressed before what i would hope to be a reasonable t3 rebalance"
12/8/2014,i think occupancy based is great and will allow so many different approaches to conquest and defense. why would there be defensive mining fleets? i am gonna take a stab and say you are saying defensive mining ops would be utilized to maintain indexes for occupancy based sov. yeah i don't think anyone wants mandatory and tedious mining fleets.
12/8/2014,i love the alliance tourney. i would like to see more tourneys i participated in the past at on the pl team on my alt paik ( the eos that lived in structure ). unfortunately the problem with eve is its kinda niche and im not sure its viable for e-sports. i wish it was. i don't really have a answer but i'll be listening for the guy/girl who does have the answer.
12/8/2014,stuffed animals of course.
12/8/2014,i think in regards to new players that perhaps a week or so in a noobie friendly area would be great. completely insulated from the rest of eve. most games have a noobie area which is focused on helping new players learn about the actual game and its mechanics. once they have the time to learn this push them out of the nest. new players should be able to opt out sooner if they want. new player retention is one of the biggest hurdles for ccp. with the changes to power projection and further changes with sov you will start to see fights become more localized with less outsiders intervening. numbers will always be a huge factor in fights and there is no way that i know of to change that. so to be clear i don't have the smoking gun answer. but what i do have is a ton of knowledge and experience in this game. i plan to use that to help ccp develop or find the possible smoking gun. but in regards to why would people want to live in nullsec? risk vs reward and carrots should be the driving principles. you can't force players to do anything however you can incentivize the thing you want them to do and not make it painful and they will do it. yea i think there have been a bunch of good ideas on npc nullsec. the ones i like alot is that inhabitants that do things for the faction get added benefits similar to some of the benefits you get from holding sov. hisec pvp i am not really sure i think people that aren't interested in pvp mainly reside in hisec. so honestly i would just listen for good ideas for this area.
12/8/2014,+1ing in a vote manny thread.
12/8/2014,+1 for manny.the best man for the job.
12/8/2014,all of my account votes are belong to you.a good man who actually knows his stuff.
12/8/2014,"manny is already deserving member of the eve community, having him as member of csm will only improve his contributions for the beneft of all."
12/8/2014,what's your stance on lowsec? why do you want to take more power away from pirates and into fw hands? what do you think about fw lp stores and how they affect every other lp store? do you think there should be variance in which lp store offers what?
12/8/2014,"manny,you had me at hello...go get 'em big fella."
12/8/2014,"if i had more than one account, you'd get a vote from me. as it is, i wish you all the best in securing a csm seat. i suspect you won't have any problem doing that"
12/8/2014,i would not mind if t3's lost 10-15% dps and 20-25% tank in exchange for ccp making the rest of the non standard subsystems no complete garbage... plus if they get that kind of nerf i feel the skillpoint loss will need to go. also recons need to be fixed because they are complete trash right now and hac's need another balance pass most of em are garbage.another thing in regards to bombers i don't think a rebalanced will do bombing in its current form has to go. because in a game that kind of is about blobbing anti blob weapons have no place otherwise why did titan guns get nerf'd beyond reason... ccp is fairly inconsistent in their balancing and its hurting the game.
12/8/2014,ass we can
12/8/2014,"in your opinion:1) what is currently broken about lowsec?2) how would you fix it?3) how do you see low-sec fitting into the universe as a whole going forward?your post mentions something about fw, but there is more to lowsec than fw."
12/8/2014,my csm
12/8/2014,"what are your thoughts on the relationship between cruisers and battlecruisers and battleships. ever since the warp speed changes, this game has become very cruiser heavy, coupled with the buffs in the cruiser rebalance it seems that anything larger is irrelevant in todays game. (exception being drone based ships *cough* domi *cough* that can project damage on any size target up and down the spectrum of course)looking at battlecruisers do you feel that bc's are in need of improvements? what would you change about them, if nothing why not?looking at bs do you feel that bs's are in need of improvements? what would you change about them, if nothing why not?i have been around for a while, and recall the good days where bc's and bs's and cruisers all played an integral role in fleet make ups. bc > cruisers > bs > bc. it was a nice little food chain, that demanded intel on enemy fleets so you could effectively counter what they were bringing to the field. today 2/3rds of that chain are broken, and we are left with cruisers trying to counter cruisers...and due to the nature of that, you see a perceived imbalance in ships, namely t3s or the king of range dictating, the ishtar.do you think it is t3's and ishtars that are the problem, or could it infact be that presently there is no bigger fish in the pond worth using to snuff them out? or a little from column a, a little from column b?"
12/8/2014,"good luck manny, i hope you get a seat."
12/8/2014,manfred is in my top 2 list.
12/8/2014,7 votes from me m8
12/8/2014,"you have my sword, etc."
12/8/2014,"hi manny, i thought you were a great candidate last year, sure you will get in and be great. one note of caution however: remember the wormhole t3 meta needs to be kept in mind and is not the same as the null t3 meta. i would suggest that ""nerf the crap out of everything"" is not the right answer there either. would you call for instance an armor tanked ecm tengu op at that level? i wouldn't but yet it is a very common wormhole fit. author of interstellar privateer shattered planets, wormholes and game commentary"
12/8/2014,"no. your legion harbors members that scam newbros in recruitment channels. not cool manny, not cool."
12/8/2014,"i'm going to vote the **** out of manny, easily the most qualified csm of any candidate running so far."
12/8/2014,>newbro >12m sp
12/8/2014,loli'm sure manny will surely be able to dictate to each corp in pl how they are not allowed to make their own policies on things like scamming
12/8/2014,"that scam was perpetrated in a private convo. ccp allow you to do that, they don't allow scams to be don inside the recruitment channel.secondly, if we are going to define a 12million sp pilot with a nearly 1billion isk ship as a ""newbro"" then i'm an adorable newbie and should be free from being pvp'd.edit - also lmao at you thinking manny isn't ""fit to be on csm"" because people in his alliance use valid mechanics ccp openly support and even warn players about."
12/8/2014,**** the newbros
12/8/2014,"lol, you think its about you or your recruitment scams, or particular details of this scam? no my friend, its not. its about something bigger.its about creating and exploiting wedges in the community. right now i opened up a wedge - manfred's tolerance of scamming. now, if someone on say evenews24.com or tmc picks this up, they are going to ask him a question - whats his stance on recruitment scams in his organization?he has three answers.1) he supports it. result - alienates half the normal people who will consider him nothing better then a code scumbag or a goon scammer. lost votes, others will spin this against him. he loses the election, again. frankly, if he does support it, then he is no different from code. scammers are scammers, all the same.2) he fluffs the answer and appears weak and indecisive. other candidates will exploit this at a minimum. noone likes evasive politicians.3) he says he is against. he will have to throw you under the bus of course, or at least that dude of yours, to make a show of commitment. this will have a positive effect on his image and differentiate him from goon and other scamming candidates. lots of potential for good spin here.take it from me, i was senior campaign manager for several ontario provincial elections. i know how this **** works.edit - oh lol look at this, in time it took me to type this, already 3! posts defending recruitment scams, one questioning manfred's ability to enforce rules across his! organization, and one post got edited. definitely a wedge, and definitely worthy of further note by journalists."
12/8/2014,"do you have real world medical training to determine that these people are ""normal"" and that anyone who supports in-game scamming (which the developers of this game do) are ""abnormal""?take it from me, i'm an international lawyer and you can be sued for libel over this statement."
12/8/2014,"man, such a puppetmaster. truely manny is crumbling before your might.alternatively, lol nerd no one cares."
12/8/2014,"erotica 1 vs rippard teg.white knights win.gg.keep fanning the flames though, more posts and reposts, the better."
12/8/2014,"perhaps. depends if this gets picked up and fanned by manfred's rivals, or wont.my job is to highlight an issue."
12/8/2014,erotica 1 involved out of game harassment. please point to where manny (or any pl member involved with that scam) was involved with out of game harassment. if you think in-game scamming is a major issue and should automatically disqualify a player from running for csm then i highly suggest you petition ccp to remove any candidate whose group scams other players.
12/8/2014,"lol. please point where i said manfred was involved with any of the above. learn to read replies. the question was 'what is normal people in eve - those who scam, or those who do not'? erotica 1 episode demonstrated that majority of people are against scamming, ergo that is the normal behavior. and in any situation where there is a popularity contest between a normal and a scammer - normal wins."
12/8/2014,"u truly are a metagame masteru have singlehandedly ruined manfred ""manny "" sideous' career of fake videogame politicsthe world shall fear u 5evrmore"
12/8/2014,"oh that would be too pretentious of me no, i aspire to nothing of the sort reallyim just a simple (bored) eve bystander that sees a legitimate issue worth discussingbut dont let me stop you from trying to make me sound grand, i might grow to like it!"
12/8/2014,"well you certainly got the fact that you're simple right, at least"
12/8/2014,"first - i am not the leader of pandemic legionsecondly - pandemic legion has all kinds of players engaging in all kinds of gameplay just because a guy solo's in lowsec and is really good doesn't automatically mean the rest of us are as wellthird - i personally don't engage in scamming i would have to much guilt for it personally fourth - scamming is legal in eve as well as stealing despite how distasteful some people find it i am of the opinion that i like the diversity of gameplay in eve eve is a terrible cold and evil place and that makes it feel so much more excitingso i am sure this isn't going to satisfy you i am not a politician , i am just a guy that sincerely loves the game and the community and has alot of passion about it if i don't get your vote then welp sorry"
12/8/2014,"that's a beautiful slippery slope the incident of erotica 1 revolved less around in-game scamming and more towards out of game harassment ccp falcon even said so in his posts admonishing that incidentso again, please explain why you believe manfred sideous, csm 10 candidate, should have his candidacy revoked due to one of his co-members in pandemic legion partaking in an act of gameplay ccp endorseuntil such time, this is a moot point and you're just flailing your arms while failing to understand what you're talking about"
12/8/2014,"+1 i was interested in your candidacy the first time, and i'm happy to see you throwing your hat back in the ring"
12/8/2014,"i respect a man that gets ahead of the issue and makes his stance known thank you for taking the time to answer it quicklyi have more then one vote and i will keep your candidacy in mind scamming is distasteful for me, but not the only factor at the end of the day"
12/8/2014,+3 votes from one of the curse friends
12/8/2014,"i never said manfred should have his candidacy revoked; i said, he is not fit there is a difference, and dont put words in my mouthbut i will humour you, as i understand what you are trying to sayin my opinion, csm representative should stand for 'good' things in eve improving gameplay, reducing scamming, ganking, harassment, etc those that do not, by omission of leadership included, in my opinion, are not fit for csm dutysimple explanation really you may disagree of course, but it is your opinion against mine we shall see how the votes pan out"
12/8/2014,not empty quoting
12/8/2014,you have my vote
12/8/2014,"i don't see why it should, its not as though he is twelve. he has probably twice the maturity levels of any current csm member and he has the experience and ideas of somebody who should be heard.he also said he would decree that everyone will receive 100 exotic dancers if he was to win...yay exotic dancers! bobmon for csm"
12/8/2014,"insulting the current csm and missing the point. nice.you have to be of a certain age to run for the csm as dictated by ccp, and you're required to submit a passport screenshot for proof. there are a few reasons for this, but afaik it's mostly so that you can attend the summits in iceland.edit: but yay exotic dancers"
12/8/2014,+1 good man.
12/8/2014,"this is an adorable attempt at trolling and ad hominem, but please let bobmon answer the question for himself. it is a rather large issue for his campaign if he is ineligible automatically due to the csm white pages list of minimum criteria.bobmon seems like a decent fellow, but if he's ineligible then he's ineligible plain and simple. no amount of pedantic posts by you can really change that."
12/8/2014,"as soo as i can, i will"
12/8/2014,"your question was:are you too young for this?he is a legal adult in pretty much every country in the world i don't see why he can't. if 21 is the limit its obviously outdated and should be changed to accommodate the future of the gaming community. is it fair to say that your opinion is only valid if you're at least 21? at eighteen years of age most/if not all (a part from weird little cesspools of dictatorships in africa and south america) are legally allowed to vote in elections. how does it make sense that we can trust an eighteen year old to select the future leader of a country but we can't trust them to vote on issues in eve? sure this is something bobmon should be discussing, but don't you think it affects the gaming community at large? to say somebody is ineligible to vote on issues that concern the community solely because they're underage is an outrage especially when the game is aimed towards that age demographic. bobmon for csm"
12/8/2014,"yes let<U+FFFD>s change icelandic law to suit the needs of some spaceship nerd that would like to be a rep to the community for a few months.<U+FFFD> if the icelandic government says you have to be a certain age to do things (drink, sign nda<U+FFFD>s) in their country then that<U+FFFD>s the age you have to be. quite shore the main age demographic of eve is 18-80, at a fan fest a year or 2 back they showed the average age of an eve player to be 26-36 or something?edit: ccp gave us the info yay, and i was right it is between 26 and 36"
12/8/2014,"his question wasn't if he was too young for ""this"". it was if he could actually run based on ccps longstanding rule, which our dear friend bob has yet to answer"
12/8/2014,"as soo as i can, i will"
12/8/2014,good to see you're not giving up even after 99% of your own alliance rejecting you as a legitimate candidate bobmong.
12/8/2014,people have the right to choose who ever they want! thankfully there are others (even in pl) who gave me a +1 so we will see how this goes
12/8/2014,"i wouldn't hold your breath. your contributions to eve are hardly extensive, even if you do try and count your iliterate attempts at writing articles for a second rate news site. serious question, how damaging do you think your bad penmanship will be to your ""campaign""?"
12/8/2014,"not very hedliner, i do my best and as long as i get my message across i'm happy."
12/8/2014,*snip* please refrain from personal attacks. isd ezwal.it's a rather straight forward question. if you're 21+ then you're good. if you're 20 years old and under then you're not eligible per the csm white pages (unless those change this year).
12/8/2014,"i have removed a rule breaking post. please people, keep it on topic and above all civil!the rules:4. personal attacks are prohibited. commonly known as flaming, personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user. posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated.isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
12/8/2014,"who knew asking someone, who has avoided a question about his age and the eligibility pertaining to it, if they didn't know their birthday or if they were consulting with ccp to potentially change the rules was considered a ""personal attack"" to isd ezwal?"
12/8/2014,"not avoiding them hendrick, i said that as soon as i know more i will post it."
12/8/2014,"so it's safe to assume that you're awaiting ccp to confirm or deny any appeal to change the age requirements from the csm white pages then? again, it's a rather straight forward question you stalling to answer."
12/8/2014,just kidding about the bro-status thing. gorski knows his pvp and understands how mechanics being introduced can affect that aspect of the game.
12/8/2014,"what is your view on competitive pvp in eve? (at, neo, some kind of dojo)where do you see eve in a year, regarding competitive gameplay."
12/8/2014,thoughts on ogb?
12/8/2014,"as a pilot who has flown in a couple of alliance tournaments, both neos and scls i have to say that i am a big fan of competitive eve. i think that ccp should continue running these events. i think that events like these is a good way to get people into eve because it looks exciting. competitive eve is also very different from normal eve pvp and it does a good work of bringing bitter vets and people wanting to try something new back to eve pvp. i know personally that i was kinda numb from dumpstering scrubs in lowsec but when i went into my first alliance tournament was when i got the shakes back that i liked so much from my first moments as a pvper.large 2k vs 2k battles in 0.0 battles also do this well but i feel the smaller scale pvp with commentators is a bit faster and more exciting to watch. in a year i really want ccp to still be doing the tournaments. i think they should keep alliance tournament as the big tournament every year that people look forward to and the one with the biggest reward. i think ccp should be looking into maybe doing some smaller tournaments where people can qualify for neo/at or win some cheaper prizes.but i also think that players should take some more responsibility creating these events. currently these events are kinda hard to arrange for players but the dojo while kinda unrefined is a good start towards making this easier for people to handle."
12/8/2014,"capsuleers,my name is xander phoena and i would like to confirm my candidacy for the 10th council of stellar management.before we go any further, if you want to know a little more about me and my work on csm9, you should begin by reading my candidacy announcement for csm9. my main goal was to stand for two key things <U+FFFD> work on 0.0 and <U+FFFD>communication<U+FFFD> in the broadest sense between csm, ccp and the player base.let<U+FFFD>s look at a report card for both of these goals:communication <U+FFFD> my weekly reports have kept the player base informed of what csm9 is up to on a regular basis with insight to what we are up to as a group, where we agreed with ccp, where we disagreed with one another and what particular issues i was personally focused on at any given time.i<U+FFFD>m very pleased that i have been able to keep these going every single week despite issues being offshore and such like. that said, more could be done both personally and as a collective. i said this last year:<U+FFFD>the csm as a body fails if it does not adequately communicate the wishes and thoughts of the player base to ccp, ccp's intentions and plans to the player base (within nda obviously) and it's own work to both.<U+FFFD>we are closer to the above goal than we were a year ago but the work is not yet complete.nullsec <U+FFFD> ccp is tackling 0.0 head on. we have had the jump nerf and some tweaks to structure hp but major changes to sovereignty are just around the corner. it is imperative that csm does what it can to keep ccp on the righteous path they are currently on. over the past few months we have seen blocs at war in-game join hands to push ccp for change <U+FFFD> 0.0 has never been so unified in ensuring sovereignty is improved for the overall health of the game. i have played some small part in that and wish to continue to do.much good work has been done by ccp and csm9 over the past six or so months. ccp is taking bold and brave steps in breathing new life into new eden and csm9 has been a vital part of that. but based on the two goals i set myself for csm9, the work has begun and is going well but i feel the need to see it through to the end and to do that, i believe i need another term as a council member.i mentioned last year how i had worked very hard during csm7 and csm8 to bring the csm closer to the player base and i can tell you that that doesn<U+FFFD>t even begin to compare to the work involved in being a member of the csm. it is also incredibly satisfying to feel you have made some small impact on the sandbox that is eve. many of you talk about how the csm does nothing or has no power. i highly recommend you read thisto see how some csm members worked incredibly hard on feedback received from the community on input automation via third party software and enacted real change in the game. this is a tangible, specific proof that your votes matter. last year i was worried that my work offshore would make it difficult to be an effective member of csm. i can confirm (as i hope can others on csm9) that it hasn<U+FFFD>t proved to be a hindrance. indeed, it proved to be a huge help during the summer summit where i was able to attend every session bar one remotely from home. i worked hard to bring csm to the player base before i was elected and i have worked incredibly hard as a csm member over the past six or seven months. vote for me and i will continue to do so. most importantly, even if you don<U+FFFD>t vote for me, vote for someone!thank you for your time,xander"
12/8/2014,i highly recommend people read ccp leeloo's csm9 dev blog from yesterday here:

12/8/2014,"i've known xander pre-csm 9 and have recently worked with him on crossingzebras.com and the new eve101.com websites.while he can be a chore to communicate with at times (due to timezone differences) and depending on if he's on crappy oil rig internet, he has always seen something through he promised he would see through.his podcast is quite good and he posts weekly about the role csm have had in recent changes or announcements."
12/8/2014,"at the time of the last election i did not know xander personally but he had my vote. in him i saw a candidate who was not a celebrity fc or held a high-level bloc leadership position, but a representative of the many nullsec line members. not only that, i also saw someone who did his utmost best to deliver independent quality content for the community despite his demanding work schedule. here's a candidate who kept his head level and his thoughts focused, never partisan, always passionate about the game and its players and with his moral compass pointing in the right direction.since i have become a member of crossing zebras staff i only found every single quality i had assumed about him to be true. if you vote - as you hopefully will - then xander definitely deserves to be on your ballot. not because some in-game group endorses him, but because the csm needs people like him.also, if he gets elected, he promised he will wear one of those quaint checkered skirts the male natives of his country dress in on formal occasions."
12/8/2014,i am glad xander is running again. he has been and still is a strong proponent of the csm process and an easy guy to work with.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
12/8/2014,xander is a great csm and ill be voting for him. he goes out of his way to communicate with people and try to keep people informed. all you have to do is look at some of his publications and videos to know this guy has passion for the game and community.
12/8/2014,"sion and i haven't always seen eye to eye during csm9. some of that is public knowledge, some less so. for what it's worth, he is easily in the top two or three hardest workers on csm9 and while we may disagree from time to time, i have absolute belief that he cares about the future of the game. he doesn't need my endorsement but someone who works so hard and has such passion for the game has it anyway."
12/8/2014,i like you. i am going to vote for you. do you like me?

12/8/2014,"i would like more transparency from ccp related to ddoss attacks. when the last series of ddos attacks where hitting games across the world, game company's where slow to acknowledge it. this led to frustration among the base. i would like a quicker response and more preventive measures in place (can you reduce a ddos ?) i would also see improvements on the tranquility sever. mainly in load balancing and latency. jita is a main trade hub. it's always packed, i believe ccp can do a better job keeping these systems active and available, not tidi and closed."
12/8/2014,"1) ccp rise gave a presentation at fanfest 2014 on the general direction his team wanted to take the new player experience. have you watched it? it's worth it, because they're not thinking of iterating on what we have now. they're looking at starting over with a completely different approach.2) it's extremely difficult to counter a ddos, for roughly the same reason that it's hard to counter a flood. what would you have them do?3) ccp is working on the back end of eve, to tackle various performance issues. team gridlock also gave a presentation at fanfest 2014 giving an overview of what they're trying to do and what they're up against. definitely worth watching. the tl;dr is that load balancing in a game like eve is a difficult problem in the best case, but more so when you're making live changes to your more-than-10-year-old game engine written in a language that doesn't really understand what threads are."

12/9/2014,"funny how a couple salty hotdropping alliances are trying to astroturf threads like this into relevance. are you guys so stymied by your inability to bridge everywhere that the only other thing you can think to do is launch forum ops? the changes were needed, and most of the coalitions like them. sometimes eve requires that you adjust your play style."
12/9/2014,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i am one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
12/9/2014,started a blog and updated the orginal post to try reflect a more considered approach.
12/9/2014,i endorse steve for csm
12/9/2014,"oh look, another carebear wanting to turn hisec into a risk-free disneyland.when eve becomes a milquetoast wow of hisec fappery, we will be able to look back through successive csm members like ripard teg, mike asariah and this carebear as the clapping seals who didn't fight ccp on behalf of preserving the sandbox and our htfu traditions.but then it will be too late.tldr;do not elect carebears like this to the csm.f"
12/9/2014,"not exactly. but if you had read what has been written, you would have known that. for example the post directly above yours!"
12/9/2014,"vote tora bushido, time for a new generation of leaders to step up."
12/9/2014,"...either you log off cloaked, ewarp, and your ship sits in space uncloaked and probable for--i can't remember, 30 seconds or a minute? when i was in w-space i always safe logged--or you safe log off, which involves deactivating all modules, including your cloak, and sitting there while the timer runs down.in the former case, active hunters with probes out can likely pin you and blow up your ship once you've left the game. in the latter case, you're basically spamming d-scan hoping that you don't see 4 or more combat probes before your timer ticks down--it's 30 seconds, so any good prober in system, with probes out, is going to catch you--and cloaking up and bouncing safes if you do see probes, in which case you have to start over again at 30 seconds.or you can just cloak up and wait."
12/9/2014,"my support of any csm candidate is tied to some specific things....1) remove the wardec-dodge exploit. after an aggressor has paid good isk for a war, a defender can just drop corp and reform under a new corp for negligible comparative costs, effectively ending the war and making wars consensual only. this exploit must be closed, period. one remedy is to have wars follow individuals if they leave corp. another is to increase corp creation costs to 50m isk+ 2) incentivize war defense.put all aggressor wardec fees into a bucket claimable by the defender or his allies, based on aggressor assets killed.3) incentivize corp membership (dis-incentivize npc corp membership)increase npc corp taxes to 60% for players older than 30 days. if you want to be safe from wardecs and hide out in an npc corp forever, fine, but its going to cost you for that privilege. further, i do not think wardec fees should be increased as a priority, until the above issues are addressed first.i do not think ganking mechanics changes are a priority, ganking has already been nerfed (as wars have), and there are guides on how to avoid it. for my support (for what its worth), i would also invite sabriz to comment on the above.f"
12/9/2014,"hello mike!just so that you know, i haven't forgotten about you. we just have been busy fighting in catch. so to be completely fair and not make you feel excluded:good to hear that you have decided to run again.as you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10.here is our announcement:"
12/9/2014,"i'm not so much interested in answers--which is why my questions are generally too big to answer--as i am in revealing thought processes. csm strikes me as involving a strong analytical component, so i like to watch the candidates think.i can't really argue against :nda:, but it's a shame that i won't get to see that paragraph, given that it's what i was angling for. still, i'm sure it's the best answer you can give, and it's tantalizing. i agree 100% with your key point."
12/9/2014,"a vote for mike is a vote for continuing down the road to nerfdom, and slow water-torture death of the non consensual conflict traditions eve was founded on. mike offers the usual platitudes of every liberal social engineer to have haunted real world political circles, that he is all about the 'middle ground', 'whatever makes sense', or that he doesn't 'go to extremes'...while constitutions lay shredded, and freedom lays destroyed.any csm or candidate that refuses to swear an oath to the eve constitution, that they will never support any change that reduces player conflict, and will only embrace changes that increase player conflict, should be summarily removed from consideration. mike does not subscribe to this pledge.in past years eve was defined by its htfu nature, the non-consensual hard fit, the live or die by your wits ethos that made it special and different from wow. mike would take us down that wow road while pretending not to, while espousing 'middle ground' platitudes. yes, mike is a 'nice guy'...while he is slitting eve's throat and refusing to acknowledge he is doing it.there is no middle ground between food and poison, just poisoned food. once you deem htfu as the food keeping eve alive, and nerfs the poison to one day kill it, there is no rationalizing a mixture of the two. one is good, one is bad, a middle-ground mix is where disingenuous evil lies.a vote for mike is a vote for disneyland in hisec and making eve into wow, period; he would just go about it slower than more up-front carebear radicals, and then years from now perhaps say ""i never intended for that to happen..', when all that is left is dust. however, if you do want to turn eve into a pansy dreamland disneyland of wow in space, mike is indeed your man.f"
12/9/2014,i've just posted a soundcloud recording of a very informal discussion about wardec mechanics i did with beboparhubarbpie and a couple of other people.it's available here:
12/9/2014,wonderful accent on you and an interesting topic. i'm glad you are not shying away from these vectors in the game that seem to have garnered such distaste recently (at least from what i see looking around).i would like to add that these darker elements of eve are interesting to me as well.
12/9/2014,"it was you and bebop who kept me in the game sabriz. met you in the mining chat, bebop in e-uni chat.without you two i'd not have joined the new order. i was on the verge of quitting this game, whilst on the path to leveling up to a dominix.you have my vote."
12/9/2014,"well for starters, that's nto what you said. this is:which is wrong. some people *do* play just to play the pve content. did you even listen to fanfest? it's not about whether or not they think they affect other things, its about how they want to play. and you won't accept there are other people who play in a different way to you, and who can and should be able to continue doing so, because it's a sandbox, not an ""everybody plays my way"".and sure, eve is about impacting each other. what it's not about is adding more game mechanics so you and your mates have more cannon fodder in the form of players who don't want to fight. adding better paying missions which require people to fly into ""gank zones"" isn't about adding unique ways for players to interact, it's about adding a place you can gank ships that would normally be ungankable with very little at risk.at the end of the day, you're a scammer, a ganker, and you seem to have very little interest in even acknowledging other players playstyles let alone supporting them, so you'd really not be doing the game a favour if you secured a position in the csm."
12/9/2014,"and suddenly it all becomes clear - lucas is frying doom, who viewers may recall attempted to **** up previous csm threads only to see those candidates win. never stop poasting, frying kell."
12/9/2014,"i actually want lucas and others like him that reject large swathes of my platform but are capable of remaining civil to bring some hard questions to my 'ask me anything' interview (details to be confirmed but probably december 20, 2330 eve time on the minerbumping teamspeak). he'll be welcome in person if he wishes and is ok with being recorded, or he can submit questions in absentia."
12/9/2014,"who are you again? oh, nobody. shush then kiddo. grown ups are talking.there would be no point. so you can hop on your teamspeak server and record yourself saying whatever you can to get votes. the only thing that matters is looking at your past and seeing what is is you are and are not in favour of. whether or not your can bs your way through an interview now is irrelevant. i'm not against scamming and ganking, or generating more opportunities for pvp, but they certainly shouldn't take priority over historically bad mechanics long overdue for a revamp, and players who don't scam, gank and pvp shouldn't be treated as if they do not exist."
12/9/2014,"you have my interest.you just lost me.one question. what is your position on the current exploit that allows a defender to completely duck a war, by leaving or disbanding corp, and immediately creating a new one (or fleeing to npc corp for a week)?would you champion the closing of said exploit?f"
12/9/2014,"responding, and adding more to the response i made this morning.i'm for a meaningful unilateral surrender that means serious concessions, not some 'oh here's a refund of your dec fee, now go away'. i would not support unilateral surrender options that don't feel like a defeat to the defender and a victory to the aggressor. the goal here is that a corporation would be incentivised to defend itself unless overwhelmingly outmatched, but that they have a surrender option if they would otherwise simply not undock for a week.i would not endorse such a surrender being available in the first 48 hours of a war going live, nor for entities with anchored structures.i'm for closing that exploit, yes. i would push for ccp to return to considering disbanding and reforming corp an exploit again. likewise various other permutations like having six corps, five with just a ceo and the 'main corp', where everyone drops from the main corp into one of the alt corps. as for people dropping corp to hide in an npc corp for a week - anything that bans doing that will have other consequences that are serious, such as two permanent wardecs preventing anyone leaving a corporation. but i also want to provide incentives to stick to your corp. one rough idea is a mechanic where if your corporation has earned five million lp from missions over its existence, the corporation gets a bonus of 0.5% or 1% to lp gain from missions, that only applies to members that have been in the corp 14 days or longer. a second tier of this bonus might exist at 25 million lp. these provide an incentive to stay loyal over time. i'd add the same for mining, but as i have less experience with mining i'm not sure what appropriate numbers would be (perhaps a first tier of -0.5% cycle time for mining lasers at 50 million cubic metres of ore/ice mined, and a second tier at 250 million).if you drop to an npc corp, you therefore don't just miss out on a few percent of mission completion rewards and bounties, you lose out on possible bonuses to mining yield and mission lp rewards, and you don't get them back just for setting up your own new solo corp, or even immediately upon joining an established corp.importantly, however, the thresholds at which any of these bonuses kick in should not be set so high that they set a major barrier to creating a new corporation.finally, on npc corps and long term players. i think dropping to an npc corp should be a viable option for someone that derps badly and loses everything, and it should be a viable place to rebuild until you both own and can afford to lose a hac, t1 battleship, or a similar level of ship. but they should offer nothing to players with those ships.my concrete suggestion is to change the tax system to apply only to bounty ticks and agent mission rewards exceeding 500k isk (presently the threshold is 100k) but for the tax to be much, much higher, and to apply to incursion payouts, mission lp rewards, and (if a mechanism can be found to do this) to mining and potentially market interactions. for a rookie in their failfit level 3 mission battlecruiser they will seldom notice taxes, but for someone blitzing l4s, being in a player corporation would be strongly incentivised."
12/9/2014,"i havent checked, nor asked, nor did i announce it big :) , maybe they dont like me haha, i serieusly have no clue. i dont belong to a big null voting block, except my own :) . we agreed indeed to not comment on eachother, i on my side havent posted in their campaigns either, and i dont feel the need. they are all very competent in their own way, and add too a mix of poeple that ran a succesfull csm, in my eyes. but i dont feel like posting i like xander to get him to write it here, nor aproach him as example or any other in there. i rather let the players that know me, trust me, my actions that made them vote for me last year decide if i get in again. on which i am confident of my own performance. nor am i involved in cross ballot voting, which i dislike, or any of the forming groups that work with tactical voting lists. i endorsed bobmon as i met him and know he s a stand up kid, and maybe hero and i have a chat about common intrests in null, but i past the backroom dealing 2 csm s ago and didnt like it. independant, but to my knowledge, no major **** between any of the current csm members."
12/9/2014,sugar kyle has already reached out to us regarding an interview but for the sake of fairness:good to hear that you have decided to run again.as you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10.here is our announcement:
12/9/2014,i also endorse sugar kyle for csm
12/9/2014,"it's happened at least three times in recent history that i can remember (manny, erotica 1, lucia denniard). just because they're less public incidents than the infamous k.com one, doesn't mean they aren't happening so you're influential enough within gsf/cfc to tell him to reverse his decision as an it guy (let me tell you just how hard that is in my own experiences, sysops are the least receptive people to be told that they're wrong), but not influential enough to either get him to stop doing it altogether or to remove him from the alliance? because as i said above, his actions are less public now but they still happen, and that's a problem.you've clearly said that you don't condone what he does, so does that mean others in gsf who are above you do? iirc there's only 2 more people above you, and that's mittani and sion.like he's already been banned from sa, the gsf homeland, for admitting to collecting personal info on people. isn't that enough of a smoking gun?"
12/9/2014,"i cannot ban people and i have to ask to get people unbanned, and every single time i do that it is a lengthy period costume drama.there is not much more i can do except to repeat that i don't doxx people, i have nothing to do with it (i don't even remember anyone publishing any details about lucia or erotica, thankfully) and i disagree with other people doing so. it's not part of the game of eve i play and it has nothing to do with the csm. if that is getting boring then i apologise but that's the truth."
12/9/2014,"you're an absolute imbecile, i want you to know thathe has absolutely nothing to do with that, for starters nevermind that, if i judged your alliance by how you behave, then i'd be doing them a disservice indeed, since i doubt they're all sjw wannabe moral crusader slime like you+1 to manny, he's been on the ball with some things lately, and he basically called the jump range changes way before they actually happened [edit: oh, yes, and a question if you had one, and only one issue you could really stand behind, what would it be, and why?"
12/9/2014,"manny understands that this game isn't a crappy playground for idiots and accepts that scamming - the fine art of separating the idiot from his pixels - is a tradition in eve, and an honourable profession choicehe has solidly earned his place on my ballot ""it's easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths"" - abrazzar"
12/9/2014,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i am one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement:
12/9/2014,0utbreak with a zero manny ps u got my vote <3
12/9/2014,is that why you're part of a corp that has scammers?
12/9/2014,"not sure why the scamming hate for pl here pl are mostly good guys, top notch pilots, and the vast majority of them are not involved in this stuff a few bad apples? sure but nothing like the degree of scamming in goons or the rest of the cfc being in the leadership of pl is certainly not disqualifying for being an asset to the game and being on csm i would definitely consider voting for manny, but i'd like to here more about his thoughts on highsec (ganking, awoxxing, wardeccs, etc) any ideas?"
12/9/2014,"if you're not smart enough to not get scammed, you're not smart enough to play this game"
12/9/2014,plus one manny good luck mate
12/9/2014,"vote for the man because of his own stance, his own actions and his own deeds, not because of what someone else in his alliance does or does not do if you only elect people from alliances whose members never scam then you will end up with all the nullsec representatives from provi and etny, and that might not be wholly representativeeve is a dark, exciting, dangerous place and scamming, piracy and all-round depravity have always been huge draws for the game like manny, i don't scam due to having too much of a guilty conscience to be comfortable with it, but it is part of the game we all chose to play you can't move in next door to a nightclub then complain of noise in the night"
12/9/2014,please don't even joke about that.
12/9/2014,you know you've got my vote :3
12/9/2014,hi xander!great to hear you're running again. +1
12/9/2014,xander has already reached out to me in regards to an interview but for the sake of fairness. :dgood to hear that you have decided to run again.as you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10.here is our announcement:
12/9/2014,do not elect this man he is a traitor to my heart
12/9/2014,ignore hvac: this post leaves him with egg on his face. xander is a good man.
12/9/2014,xander and endie are like the only good scots in the worlda pity they still lick the boot of the queen
12/9/2014,xander is ok but he still hasn't been able to explain what irn bru tastes like.so take that as you will
12/9/2014,"xander is a rare thing in a csm, he's proactive and communicative. i actually feel like the csm does something other than get a trip to iceland after interacting with him."
12/9/2014,"hi xander!you and crossing zebras are the reason i actually know anything about the csm. for me your communication and thought processes have been wonderful, so, you do indeed have my vote in yc117.having said that, i'd like to ask you some questions i'm asking the candidates i'm seriously considering, if i could.space has become littered with abandoned pos structures. what is your position on getting rid of them? i'd like to see, perhaps, a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone. this, then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them. the current mechanic, of course, involves wardec-ing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures. i think something better is quite possible.eve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game, perhaps moving into the hobby realm. i'm aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual play-style option into eve. would you advocate this? if so, how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game? would it?it seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term. beyond that, from a gameplay perspective, what would you advocate as the next priority?eve players seem to be quite passionate about the game, yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms. does this diminish the validity of the csm? what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively do?finally, and most importantly, do you like cats? :-)thanks so much!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/9/2014,"xander has been an excellent csm throughout his whole tenure, and his crossing zebras blog has been great at communicating with the entire community. + 1"
12/9/2014,"i didn't vote for you last time because i was indifferent to yet another nullsec bloc candidate. but you've distinguished yourself, and you've provided lots of meaty updates and analysis at cz, so i'm happy to eat crow about last year's judgment of you. you'll be on the ballots."
12/9/2014,"xander is awesome and in his time in pl has absolutely set the standard for a csm to be communicative and approachable. he's just a great dude who has already proven he can do a great job at this and has the passion and energy to keep on succeeding. you've got my vote, boss."
12/9/2014,xander has demonstrated that he is a great communicator which is an ideal trait for a member of the csm as they are charged with communicating between the devs and the players.he is exactly the guy i want the devs to come to when they are trying to decipher the rationale behind our (the players) opinions of game design changes. he has my vote.
12/9/2014,"i think some kind of degrade mechanic would be entirely reasonable. as you know, structures are going to be addressed soon - mainly in the case of sov but certainly not exclusively. i'll definitely make sure this question is asked at winter summit. hm, this is a tough one. see on the one hand, i would like to see there be more ways to play eve 'quickly'. i hate that in eve you normally need to sit down and dedicate a good chunk of time to any given play session. fw is maybe one of the few exceptions to this. so i guess i am more an advocate of 'quicker' gameplay options as opposed to more 'casual' ones. whether that is actually an achievable goal, i'm not so sure. i definitely like the fact that eve isn't a simple game and it caters to a fairly specific audience. i'm not necessarily sure attempting to attract a more casual audience in an attempt to increase subs is the way to go forward. another tricky one. i think lowsec as a whole, not just fw, could probably do with a good looking at. i think it's purpose and niche within the wider eve universe has perhaps lost some focus of late and it could do with being worked on. of course, those who fly in lowsec may avidly disagree with me there.i don't think it diminishes the validity of the csm. i also don't think there is a direct correlation between what the csm can achieve and voter turnout. that said, it's reasonable to assume that ccp would be more likely to trust a csm advocating a particular position on behalf of the player base when 90% of that player base voted them in than if 10% voted them in. as such, we all need to work hard to increase voter turnout.as to what can be done? ccp do seem to be doing more and i have very high hopes for that they have planned for the csm x election. as csm members, it is imperative that we each actively go out and engage with the player base. i myself have regularly blogged and taken part on #tweetfleet. i know some others have blogged, some have been incredibly active writing for news sites, some have been active on eve-o or on their own alliance forums, etc. i will be watching the turnout figures for csm x very closely indeed.i love cats and own one but i hate to tell you, i prefer dogs! myself and my wife have two labradors and they are way more fun that our cat who i feel barely tolerates our existence. thanks for the questions!"
12/9/2014,"xander has been a sincere and effective member of csm9, and it's also my personal opinion that he's a good character who would be too proud to betray his duty. csm x will, god willing, have many eve luminaries, members of the great and good of eve who are obviously attracted to a term due to the increase in the csm's credibility and reputation earned by the previous and current teams. but amongst these titans, we should remember that just as the unconnected, unprivileged ""little guy"" in hi-sec needs a man like mike azariah, so the average mediocre grunt in 0.0 needs someone to represent his viewpoint and needs as well.and i deeply believe that xander has the long exerience, both in game and on the csm, to accurately represent that constituency."
12/9/2014,"cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, playand the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hatego for it, u know who u are"

12/9/2014,"a character can create a new application to join a corporation from anywhere. (previously could applications could only be submitted whilst docked in a station)you are correct, i wrote this up and have been working on it for quite a while now. thank you for the correction.i have multiboxed eve since almost the beginning with more than one account. then three, now i have started utilizing third party software and am up to 7. as a multi-boxer this simply means more than one account. over half of eve's players are multi-boxers but don't necessarily consider themselves as such. let me put this out there right now. i support the upcoming broadcasting changes, but most of the multi-boxing community feels misrepresented and their playstyle has come into question and attack with little to no response from ccp. i feel all multi-boxers should be represented correctly and communication between some of this games most devout supporters and it's developers needs to happen. this change actually affects me very little, but it affects some dedicated players a great deal. third party software can be considered any mouse with a program or hotkey built in. those mice with multiple buttons that you can map to eve...that's third party software. either way, third party software has a huge impact on this game and there is not a single player that does not use it to affect their game play. the issue is how the third party software is being used and how it affects players. some believe stuff like siggy and unsupported cache scrapping like eve central (agaisnt the eula) is ok and some don't, just like some don't agree with third party multiboxing software. there simply needs to be representation. i hope to be that. not everyone will agree i just hope enough do to let me help the community communicate better.check out my podcast! my blog!"

12/9/2014,thanks for the video links i haven't seen them. i was only able to see the economic presentation. the code used for eves old and i think i know of a program that may help but i'm not familiar with the specifics of it. it was used to update the legacy code in the faa system. i have to look into the details and link it here later. it may be something worth looking in to.found it :

12/10/2014,"over the past few months there has been discussion in the features and ideas forums of the merit of adding a new class of ships to the game whose purpose will the rapid construction and destruction of deployable structures. so far the reception has been very positive. here is the link, and i will summarize the discussion so far here if you don't feel like reading through ten pages."
12/10/2014,"you have to be trolling.for starters, if you think battleships are weak, then mail me in game and you can fight mine.the rest of it must be a troll.. no sir, i dont like your version of eve at all.your rantings sound like the rattles of a teen with too much time on her hands.you know what eve needs?moa ponies!!!!"
12/10/2014,know how the gurista logo is on some ships? i can get on board with some ponies on a ship. little easter egg for those that zoom in far enough.
12/10/2014,"third party and industry. steve is your man, i wouldnt know much about it, glad he looks into that. if crest api is yoru future, follow him. last csm had several departures, and those that sticked with it, did their share. a nice spread of interest. steve specificslly mentions pve, where others call themselves null or pvpgoodluck steve"
12/10/2014,ccp keeps repeating that new player retention is much better for players that join player corporations yet wardecks make high sec carebear corporations foolish affair. we really need change that even if it means having corp-lite and tears of some high sec pvp'ers.
12/10/2014,"thats a part of eve.eve is not, nor is it supposed to be, easy. most things in eve you have to fight for and nobody is gonna hold your hand while you figure out how to do it. the first corp i ever joined got deced into oblivion cause most of the members didn't want to fight. such is life, but saying that high sec wars are why players don't stay in eve is kinda silly."
12/10/2014,"no, ccp is saying that player retention is much higher when you get players to socialize. nothing silly with that, makes perfect sense."
12/10/2014,"thank you for taking time to read my thread!well i am serious. just because i do not say all the things you agree with, does not make me any less serious. that 50% chance can be achieved in a myriad of ways....one of the first among them would be teaching new players... having some kind of tutorial... about dscan and how to use it. if i am paying attention to dscan then it is harder for the catalysts (or atrons) to get close enough. that is worth a few percentage points right there. the problem is... there is nothing letting new players know about dscan... there is no official guide to sensible fitting... or even really the basics.like i said... give me the tools to do what i can, and then if i choose not to do it, then it is my fault.probably not. at least not if i do it properly.vote for me and them, if you want. there is room for more than one high sec member on the csm. one of my main points is also to try and get people to vote, at all. so even if you don't want to vote for me, and want to make sure that i have no success... please vote for someone! that way we know you care!oh. at the start i thanked you for reading my thread.i should just have thanked you for replying to my thread. i don't know what i am saying that would be a ""nerf"" to gankers... for example? in fact some gankers might claim that with the faction police, concord, the barge buffs... that they have a significant disadvantage, and in the interests of coming up to 50% they need some love too...funny that the gankers don't say that..."
12/10/2014,"the net effect of this change would be that less people would gank with implants (whatever) while you have more people getting complacent and hauling even more loot. it won't reduce ganking for profit and podkills are essentially meaningless without implants being destroyed.

12/10/2014,"having met tora at evesterdam, flown in marmite collective on an alt, and being heavily involved with hisec pvp for a reasonable amount of time before my current stint in oe i will unequivocally denounce any sort of run by tora bushido for the csm.while we may agree on a number of issues facing the game i cannot endorse tora as a worthwhile representative of any player in eve, especially those he claims to represent the most. he has absolutely no ability to effectively communicate or conduct himself with any sort of respect for his audience or peers. in other words, he is self-involved, selfish, and short sighted. i base this conclusion based upon his behavior during evesterdam presentations (talking, joking with neighbors, generally not giving the presenter their due respect), and my experience with him as an alliance leader (not encouraging content creativity, a supportive environment to try new things in hisec). tldr, while his ideas may be appealing i would not want this person representing hisec pvpers to ccp or representing ccp's ideas to the playersi'll also say most of his outline in the op is ill-formed garbage but i'm intentionally avoiding that to focus on the real issue i'm trying to point out."
12/10/2014,"less loot anywhere in fighting sucks.people afk cloak in systems to prevent isboxer people from 1 button warping 25 mining ships into a area and again 1 button pressing all the locking and mining.furthermore, the broken mechanic of being able to see everyone in local in null sec reinforces this.funny though, your from null sec and not one mention of it? really?what you have to offer is little to nothing."
12/10/2014,"you might have different views on things in eve and real life and that's ok. the biggest difference between you and me is, i tell people that right away, straight in the face and not on the forums when it suites me. but you're right, making jokes at a great thing as evesterdam is terribad. and laughing with the entire group about good presentations is also very bad. having fun with you at the bar, when you accept our beers..... ahh, well, i think you get the point by now. very disrespectful to use an event as evesterdam for your own personal issues. you're probably the last to lecture me about respect."
12/10/2014,send tora a fedo for every vote you plan to give him!-sniped-
12/10/2014,you found my weak spot. a few thousand fedo's might stop me from running for csm.
12/10/2014,i was laughing imagining the contracts :pyou will soon need a whole system for that fedo sanctuary :d
12/10/2014,"if people vote for me, they will know their fedo's are safe. already have a few thousand running around in my hq (no joke )."
12/10/2014,"i'm offended at the presumption that i somehow used evesterdam as some vehicle for a personal vendetta. i observed you acting like an ass, i felt it pertained to your csm run (of which i had no knowledge of at evesterdam) and i voiced my opinion.if i were you i'd be telling people how good your interpersonal skills are but seeing that you lack any ability to respond to criticism in any sane manner, that would just be a waste of everyone's time."
12/10/2014,"are you sure beer was all you had in amsterdam ? funny how your opinion is so different then all the other people i spoke too. personal opinions are ok, but don't go crazy on the fairy tales you are offended....lol"
12/10/2014,"to be honest, while i've only had contact with you through the game i'd be surprised if michele's comments are far off. you are pretty self obsessed and not really a people person. it would be half interesting to see you get onto the csm just to see how long it takes for them to ask you not to show up to meetings. that said, it's probably better for people to stick their votes somewhere they might make a worthy difference."
12/10/2014,"are we talking about me or yourself lucas ? if there is someone who enjoys listening to his own long forum posts, it's you mate do you think i could run marmites for years if i wasn't a people person? players who have been there from the start. do you think i would have good relations with so many alliances all over eve ? just because you don't know about these things, doesn't mean they aren't there. you life in your own perfect world, where everyone else is weird, which is ok, but remember it's just your fantasy world. don't start making up things because it makes you feel better. that's not very nice, is it ?/me waiting for longggg ""i am lucas, i am so great"" posts...."
12/10/2014,"an absolute bear would also say the same thing in reverse. if there's one thing i've learned about mike in the 2+ years he's been a regular on podside is that he doesn't deal in absolutes.if you are a full blooded code adherent, interested in murder for murder's sake or a super bear who wants 100% safety. mike is not the candidate for you.he is the candidate for those who can respect a balanced and well-rounded perspective."
12/10/2014,some of your ideas would of been nice.the last people i vote for are the ones with no ideas.we have enough political figures like that.
12/10/2014,"mike 'balls of steel' azariah. you have my vote, oh gentleman and scholar."
12/10/2014,"what subject would you prefer? eve is a huge place with lots of facets.but maybe you misunderstand the purpose of the csmwe don't make the roadmap. we don't design the game or demand new features. instead we help ccp with ideas that they have and bring modifications or ideas from you the electorate. we may filter those ideas (face it, some ideas on the forums are bad) but it is not upon us to write all the great next new things as a council of players.best way to see where i stand is to read the minutes of the csm, i have served for almost two years so a lot of what i have said and thought is a matter of record. or, if you have a particular cause . . . ask. i will answer as i did feyd, above. obviously he was not happy with my answer and i am ok with that. i say what i think, not what i think you want.if reading the minutes is tl:dr then check out any number of podcasts (i do get about and hit a fair number of them) or wait for that interviews lanctharus and others will be doing.the bowhead was not my idea, but i liked it and pushed for it. damn glad to see it coming into the game.you are electing a council to speak, for you, for the game as a whole.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/10/2014,"lots of bad stuff will come of this. that's why you'll get my vote. and my sig line, at least for while"
12/10/2014,1
12/10/2014,"this was like wading through a pile of crap to find the bone, then finding out there was no bone.how many paragraphs did he just post and literally tell no one about any ideas he had to improve anything?it was like watching a real political ad, he really didnt tell you anything you really wanted to know.sure can't decide yes to someone with no position.do not forward me to a different link where the information is he should of explained here."
12/10/2014,"hard working,critical and direct when needed, a aswsome voice in helpchannels, all the stuff already mentioned in replies fit her well. a obvious x candidate that deserves a vote"
12/10/2014,"+1 vote, no questions asked. csm of our hearts."
12/10/2014,"arguably it does, as the csm can push for either policy or game mechanic changes to prevent the sort of out of game harassment being referred to. we saw it with a firm usage of the ccp policies towards out of game harassment when the ""bonus room"" happened as well as with the eve monument incident. these were out of game acts that ccp deemed detrimental to the community and took action against. ccp were even scolded on video game press sites, much like the fanfest ""suicidegate"" as being an example of a community that has problems differentiating between real life and video game land. is it farfetched to think that collecting, using, or even spreading a player's out of game personal info is just as detrimental? if one player is actively, and even openly admitting to, collecting personal data outside of the game and using that information maliciously as is claimed then it's a problem that ccp and the csm need to investigate and find a resolution to if they want to keep the ""meta game"" healthy and available to players. the worst case scenario i can conceive is that if this sort of behavior goes unchecked, an event will happen that will greatly damage the game, the company that makes it, and the players which ultimately see the meta game removed entirely.in the cited cases, and yes there are others, a player is collecting real life info on others and has been seen spreading that personal info to other players, even if it's a select few. for example there are logs from themittani.com's editor jabber channel in which the mittani himself stated that he had digi look into and erotica 1's personal stuff and felt the need to share that information with tmc editors who weren't involved in the ""counter intel"" and ""spying"" game, we were writers/editors discussing erotica 1's application to join the staff (we unanimously decided not to accept the application). there is little purpose behind being told the personal life details of another player, even if they were banned. you admonish the act of disclosing manny's personal details on k.com. i can only imagine that, as dirk stated, the case of digi supposedly contacting luccia out of game on a personal form of communication which she claims to never have disclosed would be equally deplorable to you. again, there's no rhyme or reason for doing any of these things out of game, they don't even really have any context to in-game events or actions. these, among others, are examples of the ""meta game"" going too far and potentially damaging to the eve community and it's sandbox gameplay for the sake of one's own internet space pixels.there was one person elsewhere who poised that if we are to condemn the act of ""doxxing"" and using out of game personal information to either out the spy, harass, blackmail, or even intimidate them as being wrong then we must equally condemn the act of spying. as the head of the goon spying group, i would imagine you have some thoughts on this stance. to this person the two can't be separated as the only way to prevent spies is to eventually hit out of game personal information, even if it's not intended. you stated you agree that you dislike ""doxxing"", so then what would you propose to ccp as a csm delegate do to allow the act of in-game sandbox behavior such as spying and counter-intel not spill over into out of game actions like the examples listed above?edit - please note that this isn't a ""grr goons"" or ""grr digi"" post in any intended manner (though i personally find digi to be woefully incompetent in his ""space job"" given the antics he's been up to). it's a ""this is a problem, how do you intend to fix it if you're on the csm?"" post."
12/10/2014,"there is no need at all to feel a need to explain why you ask. if ccp did feel the need to ask the csm's opinion on this matter i would restate what i've said in my previous answers in the last few pages. if they pushed me for a definitive solution i'd have to hold my hands up and admit that i don't have one. but i think my distaste for anyone that acted like that, and my sanguine reaction if ccp chose to ban someone for publicly intruding on someone's personal life, out of game, should be pretty obvious. it's not something i would feel any desire to defend."
12/10/2014,"manny has consistently impressed me with his knowledge of game mechanics and his ability to theorycraft the implications of potential game changes. he has a deep knowledge, a wealth of experience, and the work ethic that the csm needs. vote for manny, ccp needs to hear what he has to say."
12/10/2014,"my own eve career has drifted in and out of manny's path many time over the years. not only is manny one of the most knowledgeable guys in eve, he's also possibly the nicest guy ive met in game.while being ""nice"" doesnt make you a great csm - being knowledgeable,active, helpful and most importantly a great communicator does make you a great csm."
12/10/2014,voting based on this alonegame desperately needs balance changes and this hits most of the problems on the headishtars lmao
12/10/2014,"but why bother; either he'll qualify in which this line of questioning is moot, or he won't, in which case any questions at all are moot."
12/10/2014,"gorski came late, but woudl have been a nice add on from the start. hard core knowledge of small pvp, direct in aproach he deserves a shot at a full term."

12/10/2014,"xander deserves his next council obviously, i knew him through his previous csm interrviews and he was a very nice guy. also within the csm he s a guy with a moral compass and a passion for eve. they say, what you see if what you get. xandr works hard, nice guy. worth your vote"
12/10/2014,"so basically, everyone wants to log on and create content, be part of a fight, get rich and/or acquire something,, or otherwise partake of some chaos and hilarity. however, in the current state of eve, this can be an actual challenge <U+FFFD> so much of the population is in high sec, which should come as no surprise as so much of the 'cheese' is so safely available there for new and old player alike to grow fat and bored on. the main principle i am running on is buffing npc null, low sec, and sov null to the extent that people can start in any security band from day one while also prospering learning, and getting involved with the universe. let's make eve like the trailers <U+FFFD> for real. distribute resources as content seeds and watch the players do the rest. give people a challenge, not a chore. my go-to success story is that of barleguet and brave newbies. i am in no way affiliated with brave, but i have seen their work first hand. basically, you had an empty low-sec system which was otherwise unremarkable besides for a few level 5 agents. once they were done moving in, barleguet was transformed into a 24-7 content stop where a man could buy a quafe, a rifter, and 5000 rounds of emp s and use them all on the way home. just by concentrating some population, all sorts of content sprung up; new markets, defense fleets, and gangs coming from far and wide. surely some of the most fierce players in brave now surely got their first lessons and adrenaline rushes from belt ratting around planet seven. content fed a cycle of content creation. an unimposing, non-fw system became a huge hub of activity. which brings me to the actual crux of it all <U+FFFD> there needs to be more resources in low and null that are both profitable and accessible to new and old players, resources which will both be in demand and create content. the security tags and mordu's angel spawns are great examples. i think everyone sort of tacitly realizes that high sec l4s and incursions are a sacred cow that will not be tipped over any time soon, ergo the solution if you want to promote more real interaction is to actually properly balance other resources and income potential. if you could put another barleguet on the map, you would create a great place for new players to actually learn the game, and content for everyone. the charm of barleguet wasn't smashing the day old player in the venture trying to get rich off that sweet, sweet jaspet, it was the chaos that immediately descended into asteroid belt. for better or worse, you just need an impetus to get people undocked, the rest created itself. i want a reason for a new group of players to rush out into lowsec, struggle to survive, lose countless ships, but have a chance to become far wealthier than their high sec cousins, and have many more exciting tales to share. basically, i am against anything new in high sec <U+FFFD> high sec is fine. add all new content to other security bands and plant the seeds of content today. getting people to lose ships day one will create players who appreciate the beauty of the game. alternatively, they can just grow fat and bored in high sec, and not create content for others and themselves. the new player experience should be unique and personal, not reminiscent of some tired quest hub npc telling them to slay 30 yeti and recover 30 yeti toenails...i mean 30 serpentis and tags. give the new player a rifter, and let the universe and his new friends be the teacher. if you are a high sec player, then you should still vote for me. why? half the reason high sec is such a warzone right now is because you have tons of bored players with nothing to shoot <U+FFFD> all the big, easy killmails are in high sec. i used to run a ganking corporation. under a proper re-balancing of resources, there would a reason for some gankers to actually grow up and leave high sec, as there would actually be content to chase. incursions, however, should not even be in high sec. story people should have sansha kuvakei use wormhole technology to steal concord ship plans from the jove, enabling them to jam system-wide communications; no concord response to capsuleer aggression in systems under incursion. having income that secure and that high in high sec literally asphyxiates content in all other security bands. at least nullsec ratters create content for people, and are at risk for their daily income. put another way, we would never have seen the miracle of barleguet if all of those brave new players simply min-maxed risk vs reward and stayed in high sec doing l4s or incursions. tech ii logi frigates need to be a thing. many players would be very interested in flying one and the skill requirements should be forgiving enough so they can get into one as they would an assault frigate. it is good that lots of good fleet doctrines use lots of lower sp ships. lots of ""fun size"" ships are in good shape now, but are always in need of some work; the golden rule should be, can a group of 5-10 friends who decide to play the game together, after enough welping, be able to field a good gang? whatever new ships, whatever new tags, whatever new anything is released, the core question should be, will it create conflict? will it be a resource people can fight over, and a resource that will be in demand? a lot of that is probably way above what one can do as a csm, but at least you know where i stand. after a few hours in thera, it shows the promise of a barleguet style area that is linked to the whole universe <U+FFFD> this idea was amazing and is fantastic for every part of the game."
12/10/2014,"good guy , very effective communicator and csm. will be getting my vote."
12/10/2014,"sion was the first csm to contact me at the start of the term to chat with me, reach out and get to know me. i was highly impressed, he invested time, and shared. sion can be critical and direct which is refreshing and he s not afraid to tell poeple stuff in their face, internally and towards ccp. if anyone stands uo there its him. just like mynna i never seen him as a goon. a decicated eve player and solid csm, he would be on my vote list, and i am looking forward to spend time with him in thr winetr summit"
12/10/2014,"great job on proposing a software conversion tool for porting cobol programs as a solution for updating eve's python and c++ code. i'm sure with such expert knowledge as yours, ccp will have no problem re-writing the entire server code base in a few months./sarcsmok, serious mode now .... while it might be refreshing to see someone newer on the csm who can bring fresh eyes, how would you address some rather obvious gaps in your knowledge of the game. what skills and attributes do you have in dealing with project managemant, design, consulting and communication ?"
12/10/2014,never did i claim to be an expert but did you read the trsi software capabilities presentation? they are capable of taking almost any code and updated it to a code that can handle multithreading and other capabilities that the current code does not have .
12/10/2014,
12/10/2014,
12/11/2014,"i disagree.taking away awoxing will retain a small % of new players who rage quit because of corp on corp losses on day 1 - 14 from griefers who are too scared to hop into deccing entities like marmite or jihad entities like code. they love their risk free pvp on players who dont have enough skillpoints to know whats hitting them.players in eve should never be 100% safe, but bad mechanic was bad even if only for lolz (like a titan aoe some might say...).and lets not forgot, that lol mechanism was nerfed into kingdom come because it was ""killing pvp"" for anybody who couldn't survive a hit from that module.awoxing was killing trial account retention / conversion into full accounts, which directly translated into less new players per anum.as such, if more subbed accounts = more players in a pvp game driven by combat, then said removal has only strengthened eve.."
12/11/2014,"i admire your enthusiasm for balancing out the power, but removing the csm is really just going to put eve back to the way it used to be, when it was more like other games and ccp didn't hear the voices of the playerbase. i think there really is less imbalance in allowing nullsec blocs to control the voting power than you think. for instance, it was not until the mittani went into the csm (csm 6) that the game development took its major swerve away from adding new features and into fixing what was available. he may have taken a little too much credit for everything that happened, but his efforts were no doubt instrumental in things that most would say really benefited people outside of nullsec, like the industrial and mining barge updates. and while he didn't focus on the wormhole aspects, he demonstrated that a player voice can matter, and then there was an outpouring of voices which eventually led to the major turn toward giving wormhole gameplay some love in csm 8 and 9.i think the best way to get good representation is to make sure everyone knows how to make their voice heard. for newer or less experienced players (which highsec has a larger number of), that involves taking them under our wings one by one and showing them the ropes. i've also seen a trend among the longer term highsec players in that many of them are unaware of what goes on in the rest of the game. perhaps another big way to help get them contributing and taking advantage of the power they have is to make better ways of informing them. maybe player-run news corporations that control in-game banners in high security space. but i think the biggest cause of unfair representation is uneven awareness of what a person can do.poor argument, you haven't compared battleships except for a generalized taunt that in a one-on-one, you believe you would win. ship balance isn't all about one-on-one fights, and even when it is, different pilots still have different skills (in-game and as a player) and different access to other valuable bonuses. you winning against another ship in your battleship proves nothing about their viability. statistically speaking, battleships are underused in most pvp-combat-heavy areas in eve."
12/11/2014,"your post history is full of making gamebreakingly bad suggestions. and little else.-1.oh, and a little tip? defining yourself solely in opposition to something does not actually comprise having any substance. since you pretty much have nothing but ""grr nullsec!"" and your horrendously bad ideas to recommend you... you might consider trying to stake out an actual position before running for csm."
12/11/2014,frakk yeah!bring teh poniez!
12/11/2014,i also would like to see ponies on the moa.
12/11/2014,this thread isn't even two pages long and you missed something. i have no hope of becoming a csm. that is not why i am doing this. i can't think of anyone that wasn't disappointed when they realised how flimsy battleships are the first time.quite happy to settle for a vote of no confidence in a candidate and have struck out the lines that people seem to get so hung up on.this csm section should be linked in every local chat channel right now as a motd.
12/11/2014,"i believe it's in the rules that in order to run you must be prepared to win a seat. if you want to express ideas to the csm, there is the assembly hall for that. if you wish to express ideas about the csm or candidates to other players who may be voters soon, then you might better spend your time replying to the csm candidacy threads."
12/11/2014,if i accidentally win it i will take it most seriously. i just find it highly improbable and am using the soap box while i have it.
12/11/2014,"i've seen other candidates do that, but most of them don't broadcast that little fact."

12/11/2014,"beyond the restructuring of the csm, which i'm not sure would really be a high priority, what would be your priorities for in game? the job of the csm is to act as a conduit between players and ccp. having a sole focus of changing the way the csm works isn't doing that job."
12/11/2014,"wow, after all this time, still running with the ""i know you are so what am i"" response. think that will really win you the votes? and yes, i think any idiot could run a highsec corp which goes after easy targets. there's literally nothing to run. you don't have assets, you don't need to worry about holding space. you can just dock up if the going gets tough. other than accepting recruits and kicking people out when they lose a ship, you really don't have to do anything. and i seriously doubt the ""good relationships"" based on the way people talk about marmite and yourself specifically.at the end of the day, we don't need someone that acts like a child whenever they are criticised in the csm. perhaps that works from running a nub alliance, but it really doesn't work in the grown up world. you can accuse me of ""making it up"" all you want, but people can go ahead and look at the posting history of yourself and your alt general lemming, and they can see the way you act. if they really want to vote for that, they have that choice, but i doubt most people will. should you by some miracle make it (let's face it, competition is weak this year), i give it 2 meetings before ccp tells you to leave."

12/11/2014,"corbexx, like sugar, has been an absolute workhorse on the csm this year. he has worked ceaselessly on behalf of all wormhole dwellers and even extended that hardwork ethos to other player groups/types within the eve community.he will be high on my own ballot for a seat on csm x, and he should be high on yours too!"
12/11/2014,"as the interviews for csm x candidates are starting to be done, i will post the links in this thread as they are being published."
12/11/2014,"to me this seems like a bad idea considering the time it seem to take new csm to get into the flow of their new responsibilities and figuring out who to contact when and where. and this point i also have issue with, i actually find it a fun part of the game to try and figure out alts and trying to trace groups. forcing players to be open about all their alts would be a terrible for anyone wanting to play as a spy. if you have a hard time cutting ties to groups there is no clean slate for you either as all your other characters are readily available for the world to see."
12/11/2014,"i certainly understand that one can not like the idea, but i do not believe that nothing can be achieved in one year by lack of contact information. if this is actually a problem, then a revolving tenure of two years, with half of the members elected each year, would address it. my main point is to have only one tenure per player. the current situation gives a significant advantage to players with a lot of financial resources. they are the ones that can afford mu'tiple accounts to, amongst other things, infiltrate other groups, hidden by the current system. it is thus very easy to spy if you have the means. nothing would prevent a player to be a spy even if the alts are made public. it just makes it more difficult for a few high ressources players to fully control their spy network."

12/11/2014,"hi mike!amazingly, i think i've checked ""like"" on this thread more than any other, ever. your ideas and mine seem to align quite closely.having said that, i'd like to ask you some questions i'm asking the candidates i'm seriously considering, if i could.space has become littered with abandoned pos structures. what is your position on getting rid of them? i'd like to see, perhaps, a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone. this, then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them. the current mechanic, of course, involves wardec-ing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures. i think something better is quite possible.eve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game, perhaps moving into the hobby realm. i'm aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual play-style option into eve. would you advocate this? if so, how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game? would it?it seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term. beyond that, from a gameplay perspective, what would you advocate as the next priority?eve players seem to be quite passionate about the game, yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms. does this diminish the validity of the csm? what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively do?additionally, i am friends with a legally blind capsuleer and someone else early in the thread brought up the issue of accessibility. you responded to him saying that you're active and you'll continue doing what you have done in the past. for those of us newbros in the audience, could you please expand on that or give us some reference links if you have them?finally, and most importantly, do you like cats? :-)thanks so much!-- alan mathison, explorer & industrialist, star tide industries"
12/11/2014,"but eve's traditions and original founding wasn't based on a 100%-safety mindset though was it urziel? to the contrary, it was founded on htfu. 'middle grounders' who don't believe in an overriding eve constitution centered on htfu are destroying eve in slow paper cuts under the guise of such 'well rounded' bs platitudes. the point you are missing is that ccp is quite adept at slitting their own throats by themselves thank you very much, without our so-called player representatives giving them cover to do it!!the player-csm should be gandalf on the f#ckin bridge, telling ccp ""you shall not pass!"" whenever they go to implement any change that would decrease non consensual conflict from status quo. mike's middle-ground mindset however is like gandalf saying ""ok, you orcs are allowed to pass, perhaps only one or two goblins too, but i sure won't let the balrog pass..gosh no, look at how balanced i am guys!""there is no middle ground between food and poison. protect the damned sandbox, or at least be open and honest about your ultimate endgame of turning eve hisec into wow slowly over time, hoping people wont notice what your really about with your 'balance' self delusion.we have noticed. the nerfs must stop. no more. focus on new content, instead of breaking existing mechanics that create conflict and renounce our htfu traditions.f"
12/11/2014,"strictly speaking, this is not true. more often than not, whether a substance has toxic effects is a question of dosage, and possibly ambient pressure. it would be more accurate to say that there is only middle ground."
12/11/2014,"in reverse . . . i have a maine coon watching me answer so yes, i like cats. (she is a big cat, don't want to cross her)legally blind is a tough one as there is going to be a limit where the video in video game will be hard to get around but i fight for ui ability to enlarge text. icons that are easily distinguished. and consideration of people with red/green colour blindness. this is something near and dear to me as my own vision begins to fade. a lot of it comes down to having bigger clearer fonts and multiple clues as to what is going on so if you miss one another might catch.does low voter turnout diminish our validity? that depends on what you consider the measure of validity. those of us who get elected should try their best to represent the players regardless of whether they were elected by 5% or 75%. there is nothing in the white paper that says we can do a half-assed job if the voter turnout is low. i do what i can to promote the election (well especially since i am in it) and hit the streets calling for not just votes for me but voting in general. i have high hopes that ccp will do more to promote the election this year. but 2 things are beyond my reach. first. it is in large blocks best interest if the voter turnout is small. then the weight they swing can be more easily brought to bear so do not expect a lot of groundswell support from the larger alliances to 'get the vote out' oh they will work hard, internally, but not with the population as a whole. secondly, i am one voice. if you want to see a greater voter turnout then join in, help get the word out and get corp mates, fleet chat, posts on the forums, twitter, whatever . . . do your part to educate your neighbour on the issues, the candidates, that there even is a bloody election. the community as a whole needs to step up their game and not just look at the 30+ candidates and ask . . . 'well why didn't you do more?'"

12/11/2014,"your mistakenly taking my position to extremes mike. i would never support 'removing concord'. here's the thing, and i hope you can get where i am coming from on this, and why i am so vehemently calling bs on the 'balance' claims...for the last three years ccp has already been implementing a pogrom of nerfing hisec, in the minds of many content creators this has already swung the scales of balance well into the nerfdom side of the equation.. (lets call this a -10 condition from status-quo htfu zero..).no really, i am not making this up, look here.now, my problem with you mike (like ripard teg before you) is that you refuse to acknowledge that already present shift in the scales to -10, and you just look at each new additional nerf proposed by ccp and nod sagely saying 'that sounds balanced', in a vacuum......the problem mike, is that real true balance would be to seek to tip the scales back from that pre-existing -10 nerfdom to htfu zero, and implement some buffs to non-consensual conflict in hisec (ostensibly by closing wardec dodging mechanics, etc)now this -10 condition has been mentioned numerous times, so at this juncture it must be willful ignorance on your part, thus invalidating your claims of 'balance'. thus we see revealed another ripard tegian carebear, seeking to nerf the hell out of hisec, while seeking moral cover under the bs guise of 'nice guy being balanced'.protect the damned sandbox, undo the damage already done to conflict creation. that would be real balance mike.f"

12/11/2014,"domanark for csm 10i am running for the csm for the first time. i think the csm program is a great idea and opportunity the players are given to voice ideas, complaints and offer opinions of ccp's ideas. no matter what the original reason for creating the csm, it has slowly become a very important aspect to this game. i do feel the last few csm's have really stepped up and moved the program forward in a very positive way, i think i could be an asset to continue this momentum. who am i?i have been playing eve without any breaks since 2010. i have subscribed 3 accounts since i started playing. 2 combat characters and 1 industrial character.started out my eve experience by joining fw right away. i was a member of draketrain when there were in caldari fw, then wolfs brigade.i left fw to join with sev3rance when they were in the north supporting morsus mihi. fought along with those alliances in the northern coalition. i was with sev3rance for their return to providence. during that time i also had a character in rvb, where i was one of the many recruiters.left -7- to join up with test because as everyone else, once i could fly capital ships, i wanted to give it a try. stayed with test until they were defeated by the cfc. our corp decided not to follow test into low-sec, but instead repaired relations with the local fountain core groups and stayed there to harass the owners of the area. helped our corp, technology, establish the alliance sorry we're in your space eh.during this time i help create and co-host the eve podcast clueless space nerds. i have been co-hosting this podcast for the past year and have occasionally appeared on a few other podcasts. my involvement in the eve community continues to increase. i have been to several meet ups and have hosted an eve meet up myself, with plans for more. i continue to support programs like the pod and planet fan fiction contest and have my own eve blog.while all this was happening i had moved my rvb character to the rifterlings a low-sec, new-player friendly ""piratey"" style corp.currently i am still with the rifterlings and my main character is with black legion.my industrial character has been active in manufacturing of modules and ships, both t1 and t2. i have successfully ran reaction towers for profit. i also have quite a bit of experience with bpo research.i am running for the csm not because i feel the current members have not done a good enough job, but because they have. their success has inspired me to want to be a part of this process, and i feel my experiences both in eve and in real life make me well qualified to bring a fresh and positive perspective to the csm.i am running on a platform of:supporting a continuation of the positive directions the new point release system has given us so far.i believe the community of eve is as important to the game as the content itself. i would like to see a growth in the relationship between the players, the player run community functions and ccp. player run meet ups, podcasts, blogs and fan fiction is a healthy and vibrant community. i think sometimes this content's existence isn't always readily communicated effectively to the players.pirate and bounty system changes made were a step in the right direction, but i will advocate the continued focus on these areas as to make piracy more exciting and dangerous and to make bounty hunting a more viable choice for players to make isk.i will advocate the continued ship balancing and tweaking that has been done so far; but also support the addition of not only new ships but new ship classes.i will support a occupancy based sov system. i have in fact offered several ideas on this matter. these ideas can be found at my blog site. warp and jumpi will support the effort to make the new player experience one that engages, entertains and stimulates new players without taking away the aspect many who play the love the most. the difficulty level. one of the greatest draws this game as always offered is the fact it is hard, unforgiving and complex. these aspects separate it from most other games and bring in a player base of more intelligent and mature people.i believe my platform is one that can and will support high, low and null-sec. while i find wormhole space absolutely awesome, my lack of real concrete experience doesn't lend to me being a credible wh candidate.lastly and most importantly i will be running on a platform of being a player representative. i will bring the ideas and opinions of the groups of players to the conversation as the subject dictates.please feel free to ask me any questions here on the forums or you can send me an in-game mail or you can contact me on the podcast homepage."

12/11/2014,"hello aigele.the corporation interface has a major learning curve. the reason this is the case though is because it grants the director/ceo the ability to control, in intricate detail, every single move that takes place between a member and his/her corporation. this level of ability is obviously a good thing and the array of option that upper management has truly is remarkable and realistically necessary. the complexity of this though is what often leaves most choosing to go with very basic set-ups and then having to micro manage member to member roles as they come. and i've seen the complaints by some about this. ultimately though, it's entirely up to a member of upper management whether they wish to utilize the full capabilities of the controls (going through all the ranks, for all the ""based at""s, for all the take/query, and hundreds of boxes to click, etc) or if they wish to white wash their set-up, and this is not the fault of ccp. the only thing that i could see being of more help with this then is if there were some kind of tutorial (in game) explaining all of the options and what they mean. the huge learning curve in eve, from which the expression ""you lose your noob-card after playing eve for 2 years."", is a part of what makes it such a great game. so my suggesting a tutorial for this keeps the richness of options while also giving the player a better chance at understanding what s/he is looking at.i believe each of the industrial professions and gunship play-styles should have representation. i also believe that the 4 spaces should have representation as well. one of the industrial professions, hauling, has not had its own personal representative. and at base root, given the powerful necessity of logistics, i believe these players simply deserve a representative. that's the foundation of my campaign and why i decided to run for csm 10. beyond that there are a number of things that need to be reexamined. so yes, you could label me as an advocate and reformer. on the reforming side there has been quite a lot said towards that end. obviously there's a lot of information on this thread so i'll point you to 2 examples that stand out as examples of reform: post #22 & post #32. i also have another point of reform besides those two posts, quoted here:so the combination of these potential reforms and the large industry of hauling needing its own representative are the essentially the summation of my platform. i am very interested in helping eve overall though and offering my perspective on other issues that will appear as well. i hope this satisfactorily answers your questions, aigele . and thank you for choosing to participate in this thread with them.~ rl"
12/11/2014,how about a csm representative who actually knows how to play eve?fisty 4 csm
12/11/2014,go fisty! go fisty! go fisty!the glorious camel empire needs to have his representative in the csm to strengthen the influence of small gang pvp in eve and cater to the few people worthy of the only true way of exploding ships in spacein all seriousness tho: this guy is an awesome dude and will do a lot of good work for eve
12/12/2014,"i have removed a rule breaking post and the one quoting it.the rules:27. off-topic posting is prohibited. off-topic posting is permitted within reason, as sometimes a single comment may color or lighten the tone of discussion. however, excessive posting of off-topic remarks in an attempt to derail a thread may result in the thread being locked, or a forum warning being issued to the off-topic poster. also, thread unlocked. reason being: everybody that complies to the requirements set forth in this article under the header candidate eligibility is allowed to run. the perceived chances of them winning, perceived by themselves and/or by others, is irrelevant in that respect.edit for clarification: if a person complies to the requirements to run for csm is only for ccp to decide, as the forum moderators have no access to private information of the players, or access to information on or about their player accounts for that matter. and quite rightfully so i might add. the only thing we can (and will!) make decisions upon is if a character has broken the forum rules.isd ezwal community communication liaisons (ccls)"
12/12/2014,i confess that i am pleasantly surprised. thank you very much.
12/12/2014,"i have said in the past that running is a great way to influence the direction of the discussion and thinking of the csm and even ccp . . . win or lose. so i think it is fine that jen runs and uses this platform to make the points that he/she feels need making.make the voters think, make the other candidates think.good goalsmmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/12/2014,"mike, thank you."
12/12/2014,"i'm glad you backed down from the ""delete csm"" position.i would also be more worried about overrepresentation of sov nullsec powers if they were abusing the privilege, but as long as they send thoughtful people with an eye on the big picture (which is one thing that their lofty perch gives them access to) it seems more like an academic question to me.rooks and kings are infamous--especially in wake of the latest promotional video--for pipebombing, which seems more like an example of the ""suddenly dead"" pvp that you dislike than any sort of stand-up brawl. also, how do you nerf ""alpha"" when it's mostly a function of the number of ships? until very recently beam lasers had terrible alpha individually (and it's still not great), but if you get enough of them to fire simultaneously at a target, it will evaporate just as surely as if you used tornadoes. you just need more of them. fleet alpha is a significant design problem in eve, but i'm not sure that you're coming at it from the right angle, especially in terms of ease of implementation.the only time ships just appear on grid is if you undock or jump onto a grid where they're already there. otherwise, you can see them on d-scan (and, situationally, in local). the basic survival strategies of setting standings and using d-scan are, regrettably, not taught to new players by the game itself. is there a reason you prefer mechanical nerfs to attacks that are already in progress instead of putting greater emphasis on teaching situational awareness?i understand how an ""abstain"" vote would have semantic value, especially if you could specify a reason, but i'm reasonably sure that a vote of no confidence would be terribly abused (see also: the lack of a ""dislike"" button on the forums) by precisely the blocs that you're worried about. is that a larger problem than the apparent disinclination of most of the game to participate at all?"
12/12/2014,a high sec industrialist candidate? yes.will you be doing any of the interview podcasts?
12/12/2014,hats!!!'nuff said.
12/12/2014,"i'll interview with pretty much anyone. i've not arranged anything yet, due to a chest infection (don't like coughing in people's ears) but once that's cleared up, you should be hearing my dulcet tones abusing your ears."
12/12/2014,"and on the subject of ""gankers"".... is there anyone out there that would want to tell me what that particular ""crowd"" might view as important for the next year?!?"
12/12/2014,i take csm more serious then this.
12/12/2014,"corbexx has been one of the most impressive, ambitious, and committed csm delegates and players i've had the pleasure of working and corresponding with during my time in eve. he has always been honest and straight forward in his communication with the community and has always been available and made time for questions, support, and dialogue. he will certainly be at the very top of my ballots this year and will be my first recommendation to anyone within or without the wormhole community.it's dedicated and driven player delegates that help to ensure that the various members and playstyles within this great community are heard, and in my interactions with developers, such as interviews and player gatherings, i've learned firsthand the impact that our csm delegates, notably corbexx, have had on this game. best of luck, my friend."
12/12/2014,"as a director in a small industrial corp based in a lower class wormhole for more then 4 years, i can say we have cheered at the small improvements in wormhole life that have been implemented in the game in the last half year or so.i can safely say the entire corp is glad with things like the consistent sig names, the separated d-scan window and so forth. small things, yes. but for me in this case it's those little details that make the difference between 'good' and 'great'. i thank you for the effort you put into getting all the (little) wormhole improvements prominently on the table and convincing the rest of the csm and ccp it would be worthwhile to implement them.this year, just like last year, you will be no 1 on my list. and i am sure i can convince (at least some of) my corpmates to do the same....here i used to have a sig of our old camper in space. now it is disregarded as being the wrong format. looking out the window i see one thing: nothing wrong with the format of our camper! silly ccp......"

12/12/2014,+1 vote from me. your blogs have certainly helped me to keep track of what's happening when i haven't had the time to follow the news as closely as i would like.
12/12/2014,i endorse this product and/or candidate.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about.
12/12/2014,"sabriz, what experiences do you have with sov null? do you have any opinions on the state of the game there?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/12/2014,hurrah for sugar!
12/12/2014,"""he""?oh and it's ""should have"", not 'should of'."
12/12/2014,sugar removes the bones and presents only the steak.
12/12/2014,i think i agree with a lot of what you say in your blogs. are you planning on doing any of the podcasts? i like to hear the csm candidates needing to answer questions as they come.
12/12/2014,"yes, i will do podcasts where invited. i've actually talked about my changes quite a bit on soz in this episode:"
12/12/2014,tora created this:
12/12/2014,i claim being drunk !
12/12/2014,"i may be the eic, but xander phoena is my boss and handles pay at cz, so i'm voting for him. i'm a lowsec poor and will sell my vote to the highest bidder.joking aside, xander stood on a platform of communication and politically independent improvement of eve online through the will of the community. his conduct and work during csm 9 have proven that he delivers on both points. if you vote for xander you are not voting for a political bloc, you are voting for a truly independent conduit for the players. i've seen xander go the extra mile to bring issues from the community to ccps table, even ones that had absolutely zero to do with him as a player. he as without fault reported on the work csm are doing every week through cz, whilst being accessible in all manner of ways.xander has his finger on the pulse of the community better than most and i would recommend anyone to vote for him. +1/nmoira corp | villore accords | gallente militia | lowlife on crossing zebras | @niden_gmva"
12/12/2014,in addition because i was brought aware of this today when i watched the o7 show. apparently i can add keeping ccp neutral in regional conflicts to my list of issues to raise as a representative. otherwise it was a great show despite the sound issue early on.
12/12/2014,hurrah for sion!
12/12/2014,"first of all, how do i pronounce your new name? the english or the french way?secondly, what do you think is the most important issue facing the playerbase today, and how do you believe it should be addressed?"
12/12/2014,"1 pronounce my name whichever way is easiest for you 2 that is a difficult question because each player plays the game differently, so each player has their own 'most important' issue that they want addressed industrialists will have much different issues than wormhole roaming pvp'ers, who in turn play the game differently from incursion runners but if i had to chose one, i would say that new player retention is the most important issue facing the playerbase today improving this would affect all aspects of new eden for the better giving us more sand for this sandbox for one example i will take small gang pvp as an example over the last few weeks, i have been running a chat channel called 'pvp and piracy help' whose main goal is to get new players started down the life of a pvp'er we talk with them, answer questions, and try to help them get a good understanding of the game mechanics a lot of the players i talk to have very little knowledge, but are very eager to go out and learn many have been recruited by fw corps that do not explain the mechanics or drawbacks of participating in fw others are recruited by 00 corporations that say 'move all your stuff out to our system' without explaining the mechanics of bubbles, clones, or bookmarks it would be nice if there was a default chat channel they could go to if interested in getting into learning the basics of pvp there are channels for ratting and real estate, but not for pvp"
12/12/2014,"new player retention is indeed an issue facing eve so to expand on that i have a few questions the first experience of many new players is the recruitment efforts of highsec corps near the starter system while many of these corps mean well, a large fraction of them are run by ceo's with an incomplete understanding of eve mechanics, who let's face it, run less-than-stellar organizations that are not capable of properly supporting and teaching new players about the game new players ending up in these lackluster corporations will have a more frustrating initial experience in the game than if they ended up in a better corporation, and might quit the game altogether this problem is set to become worse with the recent changes allowing the spamming of corporation invitations, and the proposed removal of intra-corp agression in highsec which will remove a major disincentive to ""farm"" new players for income (that is the possibility of highsec awoxing)with that in mind, i have three questions: 1) what do you think the best approach would be to get new players into quality corporations with the real interest and capability to train new players, not just in highsec, but also in low, null and wormhole space? 2) do you agree with the proposed removal of intra-corp aggression in highsec? 3) do you think that a ""social corp"" mechanism - that is a new tier of corporation that is immune to wardecs and awoxing, but has none of the current advantages of a player corporation is a good idea to increase new player retention?"
12/12/2014,"thanks for throwing your hat in the ringof late, there's been a huge push by both ccp and by player corps and alliances to respond to the huge wave of new players that have come in as a result of the ""this is eve"" promotional video as a veteran of new player friendly alliances (agony in particular), do you think there's a way to sustain this level of attention and helpfulness? it seems to have been able to get new players right into the heart of the game--almost immediately in the case of brave newbies--and that can only be good but can it be sustained?"
12/12/2014,"dradis,welcome to the csm x campaign, and congratulations on taking a step to involve yourself in the process to ""be the change you want to see"" in the game. many players generally prefer to only complain about issues as opposed to step up and take charge by joining or attempting to join the group that will work to help solve them. so, as long-winded and tedious as this campaign may be for you and other candidates, you've taken the first step and that deserves a note of recognition.on that note, some advice: be involved in the various discussions (features and ideas, general discussions, etc.). join the gambit of social media (reddit, twitter, skype, etc.). provide multiple avenues of communication (eve-mail, character g-mail, twitter, skype). when listing issues, provide examples and prospective solutions (npe, highsec, jita, etc.). communicate with current and former csm delegates (ask for guidance, learn from them). be visible, answer questions, keep your head. get involved in the campaign process (get involved in the interviews, debates, and podcasts). there is certainly more, but i'd bet that you can figure much more out by getting involved with other candidates and csm delegates to learn more and better solidify your run for csm. i also noticed that you said you have issue with ""new player"", ""skills"", and ""fittings""; what type of information would you like to see added to tutorials for skills? how would you prefer to see that implementation, and how specific should a ""skills"" tutorial be? when saying ""so many stats"", which stats are you referring to that you believe could/should be clearer/compacted? please provide a ""top"" list of the following: a. what are your top 5 favorite things to do when playing eve? (pvp, mission running, mining...) b. what are your top 5 ""must have's"" for eve as a player? c. what are your top 10 ""wishlist"" items that you'd like to see, should you be elected? d. what are your top 10 issues with eve, that you'd like to see fixed? e. what are your top 3 gameplay items that you'd remove in eve? (awox'ing, wardec's, supers, mining, etc.)"

12/13/2014,"the whole point of this is to make it harder to move any fleet around. to make you spread your forces out more to defend the same territory. how many alliances actually use every system they claim sov to? how many have almost no presence other than the tcus? i have been in null and most players use jump bridges as a crutch in null. i am not saying this is bad per se, but i am saying that given the choice most use the jump bridge network for day to day traffic. that made the game a lot easier than it was probably intended to be. i mean there was no real need to even go into some of the systems that the alliances have sov over. i can even get using some of them as a buffer zone for defense purposes, but that really has no meaning if no one is there to spot the roam. i think that add fatigue to both caps and jbs was a good choice. it will make alliances have to pick and choose where the station fleets. now instead of 1 massive fleet, you may have 3 or 4 (talking a mid sized alliance here, large alliances may get into the teens on numbers of fleets) fleets stationed at different points in your territory for defense. this should make for much more interesting combat as opposed to you dumping everything you can find on short notice on any roam."
12/13/2014,"so you would ignore any indy corps you have working wih you. their contribution means nothing? i am an indy pilot and while i do not have problem with sov based on military might. i would hope that ccp would want to give you other ways to help secure a system. what you are saying is the guy with the biggest fleet wins. while that is true for battles, it is not true for wars (speaking in rl not in eve atm). in rl the guy that can keep producing the weapons of war and warriors wins. i am not saying make it indy necessary. i am saying that make it's contributions applicable. you dont think they should be because you are about pvp. who builds the ships you fly, upgrades your stations, etc.? i would like ccp to make it not where you have to do ratting mining etc. to secure a system, but where they contribute to the security. do you want to have to let your fleet sit in every system you own to maintain your sov or would you rather let the indy side of your alliance handle their own, so that you only have to maintain the systems the have a strategic advantage but no real industrial one? just saying why make our contributions null, make your life easier."
12/13/2014,what about ships which are undocking and are under 30 seconds invulnerability timer?
12/13/2014,"my reply might be a bit short and sharp, i am in space so my attention is split and it is getting late here, bear with me, please.i doubt most of the csm do it deliberately, for the most part people see themselves as good people, doing good things, rel- {de-railment food deleted} however, when you live in a certain place, be it a city, country or type of space, you naturally develope a familiarity and a bias. you make decisions based on the experience you have had and the freshest of those.as i see it, the problem is two fold1) null has voting blocks and coalitions vote for their representative for the most part, rather blindlythe inverse is that high sec is split up, scattered and hardly knows each other.2) the other sectors of space don't know or have lost hope of being represented in csmthe vote against option would allow them to nullify the first part of the problem. then knowing that and putting coming forward to stand for their type of space would rely on ccp informing them properly through motds in local and the launcher.the pipe bombing is a tool that will hopefully have a counter found by the players or coded. however, the root of it is that it is a small group that stand toe to toe with much larger foes.alpha, i have been thinking that either there is a delay where logi have a chance to respond, preventing a one shot or you can link your fleet in someway to ""dissipate energy"" and spread the damage.as i said in another thread, i have slow boated between two book marks across asteroid anomolies in worm hole space, ready to warp at a moment's notice while hitting that horrible d-scan over and over again. - that is not fun. there should be manual d-scan with quicker results and a slower auto d-scan like auto pilot, some drawback to it.so, i would say a bit of both. i like some darwinism but i like good tools for people to use also.71% of active pilots are in high sec. eve essentially is a high sec game, a fair amount of them might be null sec alts but they would not exist without a purpose there. my belief is that the null blocs might vote me to 0 repeatedly because i antagonise them and am not charismatic but i still think that if high sec felt empowered then they would knock some nulls down to a level that is more competitive and vote up some of their own."
12/13/2014,"i support your position on changing voting mechanics to allow players to vote against but you will still end up with null blocs just voting as a bloc against certain individuals, instead of for individuals, and since it is a runoff either way ls hs and wh candidates will be eliminated by the combined efforts of ns block voting.that being said, there is nothing wrong with having ns bloc voting, but i think that ccp and csm should encourage a format change where only a certain number of regional representatives can be voted in. a set number of spots for each region ns 2, hs 2, ls 2, wh 2 for example. this allows people who aren't being spoonfed a vote to target representation that reflects them, instead of simply picking from a list of names in a hat essentially.as for alpha, any reduction to it should be met by an equal nerf to logistics, as the only way to counter the logistical capability of fleets is to use enough alpha to eliminate ships before reps land. if you eliminate alpha strikes then what is stopping half the people who used to fly alpha ships, from flying logi. you end up with 2 unkillable fleets fighting each other...which makes the change redundant.thats my 2 cents on your issues good luck in your campaign!"
12/13/2014,"thank you. i have no further arguments for the first half of your post. the voting could go either way but at least if we tried a new system then we tried.possibly the energy spread trick could be linked to the logi? they could sacrifice one or maybe two high slots to be used as absorb slots instead and lock onto targets with them. any damage to them would be shared with the logi locked on. example:the fc is yellow boxed by 100 tengus that are all doing 1000 volley and he has a pure 85k ehp with 0% resists for the purpose of making the example simple. now with 100 000 damage incoming, he would be completely wiped out in one shot. however, he warns the logistics and some (say 10/25) of them are quick enough to lock him with the absorb damage module, some of them are already damaged and don't risk it, some are locking others incase of target changes, etc.so, he takes 50% of that damage and is left with 35k ehp. the ten logi each take 5 000 direct damage, since it is a module on their ship that is relaying the damage it is direct and by passed their resists.now they will have to repair each other, repair the further dps the fc will take, turn off some of their absorb modules to not die themselves and are doing this while only being 75% as effective at repairing as they were before.... but they saved their fc and the fight goes on.edit: now like previously you can argue that a fleet of 100 logi would keep one guy alive and you would end up with two fleet like that, however, eve players find the counters. for example, more damage per second and less volley, attacking the logi, laughing at how little damage the other side does or jamming the logi with ecm."
12/13/2014,"but the same can be said of the current metrics in game to limit alpha, there are a pile of ways to mitigate alpha damage, one current method that is being enjoyed in large fleets currently is heavy focus on ewar namely damps. if you can spread damps on enough ships to the point they can no longer target your fleet with any reliability then you have already reduced the effectiveness of an alpha doctrine. on the other side of the coin you can apply those same damps to logi and reduce their effectiveness in engagements where you are not in an alpha fleet.i personally don't see the issue requiring any large change because ultimately the problem will always come down to n+1, regardless of the mechanics at work group a and group b are bound to the same rule set, and thus in an everything being equal environment at the end of the day the only difference is who can bring more dudes to a fight.as for the idea itself of limited targeting or spreading of damage, i think it is quite gimmicky. i don't see the ""realism"" in a ship taking hits for other ships, or inversed, ships damages being mitigated based on the number of ships firing at others. in my honest opinion the balance is there already, and if you bring the wrong fleet to the wrong engagement then that is the chance you take when you undock and engage."
12/13/2014,".... and so tengu fleet vs tengu fleet .... ishtar fleet vs ishtar fleet.current meta but ehp and damage are the two you keep going for. passive tanks, active tanks, etc there are so many varieties never mind ships that are entirely side lined because they pop far too easily."
12/13/2014,"> for null sec voting blocks to have less power.do you hate democracy?if nullsec has too much power it is because nullsec, along with w-bros and lowsec are the ones that care about this game enough to engage into spacepolitics and influence the gameplay.most people in highsec play eve like if the ships around them were part of the landscape, they wouldn't even notice if eve became offline.so why would we have to give the power to people that essentially want to kill this game slowly?"
12/13/2014,"i think democracy in the real world is a farce. the most gullible people vote for a few charismatic faces that don't care about them.we have no voting power over the bureacracy and no real way to stop the corporations that control and bribe them.the next step would be some form of technocracy.my contention is that they are simply formed into bigger groups with a few recognisable people within them. why high-sec doesn't manage this could be down to many reasons, such as the systems being too barren or they don't face enough conflict or there are not enough defendable pipes and dead ends or or or.worm holes are split off from each other, they are like tribes in a jungle who if they meet anyone else there automatically have to assume they are hostile. they can't form friendships with their neighbours because their links keep changing.low sec .... well that is just a waste land. considering the number of systems and the population, it is worse than null sec.i am not sure how to make low sec more sustainable and i do not think there is a cure for worm holes but i do believe that they should have tools to give them all a fighting chance and null sec will have access to the very same tools. it will be impartial in that way."
12/13/2014,"you have to also support what your voters want. if you dislike the way the csm itself is run and the way votes are cast, then you'll find the majority of your voters among those who already aren't voting. so to get more popularity, the best thing to do is to spread your campaign around the areas that are opposed to the csm. you've got to get the word out to the right people.corebloodbrothers campaigned in support of nrds, and gained votes by passing his campaign in front of providence residents, for instance."
12/13/2014,"good advice.statistically 4-7% of the eve population is female.90%~ of my voting base is female.while i agree that i should expand my reach to those who have already given up on the system in terms of voting, i also think statistically it makes the most sense to dedicate the limited resources i have to the female eve demographic."
12/13/2014,so what exactly is your plan for reform?anyone can stand on a soap box and point at everyone else on their soap boxes and say they are doing it wrong so vote for me.
12/13/2014,source?
12/13/2014,i am crying xd.
12/13/2014,fewer crunchies and more dancing eh? clearly this campaign just got real.

12/13/2014,"i spent the best part of a year in your alliance as a ceo and an alliance diplo, yet have no idea who you are. two can play at that game. thank-you again for your continued free bumps in support of the sabriz for csm campaign."
12/13/2014,"how do you feel about making a wardec's cost based on the number of people in both corporations? i.e. the more people involved, the more expensive it is in total, but the less expensive it is per person?"
12/13/2014,you have all of my votes.
12/13/2014,"greetings all,you don<U+FFFD>t know me. in eve<U+FFFD>s big scheme i<U+FFFD>m well nigh nobody; just another undifferentiated basement dwelling soloish player. still as chance would have it i ran across sugar kyle<U+FFFD>s blog not long after her election to csm9, found it a congenial place to hang and stuck around. the reading<U+FFFD>s good, the company<U+FFFD>s a pleasure and we basement dwellers get to not only spout off on occasion, but actually get listened to by a member of the csm. you may or may not change her mind, just as she may or may not change yours, but your concerns will not be ignored.so, as you read through the important people endorsements above (and no doubt more to come below) keep in mind that if you<U+FFFD>re a basement dweller like me, sugar kyle deserves a place on your ballot."
12/13/2014,i've scheduled my interview with capstable for the start of next month. thank you for the kind words and questions. i appreciate and thank you for the support.
12/13/2014,my name is damishu and i support this message.
12/13/2014,"hmm, i don't want to be part of a fight, i don't play simply to make my wallet larger and don't partake in chaos and hilarity.as a permanent high-sec dweller you want to deprive me of any developer-love and yet you ask for my vote?you claim that thera is a wonderful idea.i assume that this means you will spend a lot of time there.good."

12/13/2014,"improving corporations is a good start, and i am anxiously waiting to see what ccp will do with that there will always be 'non quality' corporations that actively recruit new players, there is nothing you can or should do about that in a sandbox but information for new players is extremely important, increasing the amount of game knowledge gained from the new player experience the tutorial needs to constantly be improved and updated i would personally love to have a new pvp tutorial for new players that sends them out into low-sec or 00 to get fights high sec intra-corp aggression is mostly used as a griefing mechanic if you want to **** over your corporation there are still plenty of ways to do it if you want to practice pvp then you can duel a corp mate a social corp mechanism would just be abused to avoid high-sec wars i have done incursions and the community seems to function fine even though many of the players who fly with bling are wardecced"
12/13/2014,"yes, it most definitely can a lot of the time in eve, the more players that you have, the stronger you are so it is smart play to make sure you always have a steady recruitment of fresh blood"

12/14/2014,i'm not sure why i find myself partially quoted here. the original post was based on if the bowhead was fit for the purposes that ccp was promoting it for.
12/14/2014,so you don't believe that ganking is very cheap?
12/14/2014,"a. socializing isn't the same as joining a corp. but judging by the stupidity of what is going on in npc corps, i can't blame people and ccp for saying that joining a corp is better. b. only stupid ******** indy corps do get wardecced.a friend of mine, miner by heart, has been in an indy corp for nearly 3 / 3.5 years now...and only once saw a wardec, which was when he just joined.it's those that make themself a target in one way or another that get wardecced."
12/14/2014,"all miners already have a 99% chance of winning a gank attempt. the fight starts long before my guns start firing.i am a lion. i have set up camp in a region, i have scouted it out. of all the miners, i have selected you to engage solo. why is that? because you are a sickly gazelle, i saw you stumble while i was hidden in the grass.the big strong tanked procurers and skiffs (and even well tanked rets and macks) won our engagement before it even started. i scanned everybody, checking for a weak tank or antitank, i checked your bio for anti-lion propaganda. their shields warded me off and their bios, while not positive and compliant, were at least neutral, so they remain safe. i have no reason to call in the rest of my pride to send a message. others in my region will continually bring concord to protect them. or post falcon sentries to jam me, or camp the gates to protect their pocket. some will keep an eye on local and watch for my scout, they will warp off before i get there. the fact that i started firing on you means that i have pegged you as a wounded gazelle who is too focused on eating the grass, look up once in a while would you? the ones i gank voluntarily gave up their 99% chance in favor of yield. that choice has consequences, that is what eve is all about.now then, you do seem a bit confused about some of the mechanics and what goes into ganking. i hereby invite you to try it out for yourself. i don't believe you can fairly take this anti-ganking position as a csm candidate without having explored what actually goes into successfully suicide ganking somebody. that 50% thing is nonsense, but because you haven't seen it from our end, you wouldn't know. prove you have an open mind, gank something (barge/exhumer).e: to be honest, i don't trust you enough to tell you what i find important as a ganker, what's stopping you taking that and just running an an anti-(whatever i say) platform. you need to prove yourself first. the info is already out there though...e2: the above edit seems like a real problem for a 'high-sec' candidate"
12/14/2014,"so if i have to go pee i have to log, not cloak. if i have to run downstairs to fetch a pizza, i have to log, not wait in a station. if i have to drive my son to school which only takes a few mins i have to log, not sit in a pos....i guess i have to be happy that you'll allow me to stay online for 20 mins without activity.now for real, if you want people to be online and active have ccp build a timer into the client, if there's no action for 20 mins have it closed. too extreme? thought so."
12/14/2014,but... i like afk cloaking!
12/14/2014,"i too, wish to vote for someone scared of disclosing his main..."
12/14/2014,"borat is my main public alt/character. i am glad to see you are in favor of plublicly displaying all alts of a player, as you would only vote for someone knowing the alt you want to see. there is no reason for me to put out my alts out at the moment, and this is part of my program. so surely you can get behind that to vote for me. if indeed the disclosing of alts become public, as i am supporting, then you will be able to see all my alts. everyone applying for the csm put forward their public alt, so there is no difference... unless you prefer judging a candidate not on the ideas they support but on some other base. i prefer focusing on ideas myself."
12/14/2014,"it's funny to watch you chest-beat and whine about sandbox game-play when you seem to forget the fact the sandbox sword cuts both ways. targets have just as much right to use any and all available mechanics to evade your intentions as you do to try to imbalance any encounters (neutral rr, non-war target boosts, etc.) they don't pay a sub to amuse you."
12/14/2014,"you seem to know who i am enough to have followed my posting history well enough to know where i was posting last year. as for yourself, clearly you made no lasting impression. that's even more embarrassing. the fact that you're floating around this thread patting sabriz on the back and shiptoasting at critics like some kind of lackey really shows how far you've fallen.and sure, i don't mind bumping the thread of anyone running. at the end of the day, i actually believe that people will make the right decisions when posting their votes. if they really want to vote for someone intent pushing for self serving changes, who refuses to even acknowledge a huge portion of the playerbase as existing, purely because their post happened to appear recently posted in more often, then they can. i think most people will read the campaign outline and consider the author, then realise it would be pretty dumb to vote for sabriz."
12/14/2014,"persistant shiptoasters tend to stand out.in breaking news, supporters of a csm candidate were spotted posting supportive things in their candidate thread today."
12/14/2014,"greetings sabrizmy issue is this: eve is an mmorpg, a massively multiplayer online role playing game. yes, so many lost souls in this game neglecting the 'mm' and 'g' aspects of eve are both huge problems, problems we have both dedicated ourselves to fixing. but what of the rp part of it? all too often role play is neglected and even maligned. my thorough investigation into the csmx campaign (an advanced search of these forums for 'role play') yielded no valid results, there is nobody else willing to represent or help the role-players, you are our only hope. will you take a brave stand in favour of role play?-tisiphone dira, knight of the new order and right hand of james 315."
12/14/2014,"it's a sandbox, and roleplayers are welcome, but it's not a roleplaying game in any way."
12/14/2014,which part of mmorpg made you think that?
12/14/2014,"how about a rotten egg ? that pretty much sums up intention of gankers. they are playground bullies, and they want their profession - ganking to be the only safe one in highsec. ganking is either a profession or a form of griefing. because without the profit ganking reduce to destroying other player's ships and clones for no gain. griefing is a bannable offense so let's be merciful and consider ganking as a profession.and it's completely broken: amount of potential profit is order of magnitude greater than the investment. we will consider ganking fair if 20 t1 mining ships turns out 5-10 billion isk every 15 minutes. consider those gank boat are worth 5-50 mil. and the gankers already know how much of a loot they will have, ganking is less risky than daytrading or mission runing. that industrial gankers blew up is taking more risk at market fluctuation than the gankers.as a profession, ganking is the exploitation of highsec mechanics for easy money. you can't get bubbled in highsec, so instant undock always works. there is no aoe in highsec, so spam always works. let's use an occam's razor here. do the same people who blow up empty freighters and random shuttle for tears want a better, more enjoyable eve out of good of their heart, or is it more likely they spin this nonsense so they can continue exploiting a broken profession without ccp ever balancing it ?"
12/14/2014,this is a tired and frequently mythbusted claim. blowing up internet spaceships in a game about blowing up internet spaceships is not bullying.
12/14/2014,"i'm away at a conference irl, but keep the questions coming in. hope to catch up with them soon."
12/14/2014,"okay, so if you don't like doing any of those things, i have to ask, what are you doing, and why do you think high sec is the best place for those things?yes, i ask for all high sec votes. if you want high sec to be a low-impact, low-effort, low-paranoia area, than the very best thing you can do to achieve this is put 'cheese' in all other security bands. ergo, buff income, buff resources, buff everything about other security sectors. let actual content develop in other areas so people can meaningfully become outlaws. so long as high sec has the absolute monopoly accessible income, player base, etc, so too will it remain so turbulent. i am as much for a better high sec as i am for a better new eden. thera is good, but needs some more accessible content seeds. i feel as if the first day people were very good natured and sportsman like about jousting spaceships into each other, but there needs to be a persistent source of conflict. something pvp fit ships can do which rewards them but puts them at risk. get people off the stations and holes, get fights going in space."
12/14/2014,always good to have a merc representative!
12/14/2014,"i fully endorse. psianh is the guy who really helped me when i was first starting with eve, and remains a good friend and mentor to this day!"

12/15/2014,i support this idea.
12/15/2014,"obviously posting with an alt given the controversy that this post will no doubt create.i would hope the assembly hall will read this in full . consider the contents of the suggestions and arguments and recognise there is a fundamental flaw in the game war mechanics which impact on a significant number of the subscribers.as a long term player of eve and running an successful pve and indy corporation. i very much appreciate that wars are part of the fun of eve....for the people that enjoy that element of the game ,.however many of us enjoy the pve elements and our alliance is a collection of player that enjoy that side of the game.paying for at least 100 accounts each month to do so.the current war mechanism has protected the smaller corporations from war decs and shifted that to the larger alliance where a small group of pvp griefer players can distrupt the gameplay of paying subscribers just to get easy kills...forcing people to stop playing the game they enjoy or to use npc corporations to avoid the wars.i would like to propose a plan to shift wars to become a meaningful objective based mechanic and not continue with the notion that wars are part of eve. learn to pvp or hire mercs ( the very same mercs that abuse the current system)i have started to lose faith in what the development team values in eve as the direction its going the sandbox seems to only favour people who want to destroy sandcastles not build them...there really doesn't appear to be anyone considering why do the small corporations form up and then disappear? crime and punishment is littered with corporations asking how they defend themselves and their operations in high sec wars...granted its part of what makes eve online eve that if someone really want to spoil your day they can...but the current mechanics are far to open to abuse.this actually harms the games development ..the smaller corporations never get off the ground, new players who band together often have to join a larger alliance in the hope of some protection only to find that the same griefer corporations war dec the empire based alliance even more frequently.my alliance has been subjected to this for many years..we have operations and procedures we put in place to fight back, we work with the other corporations and we avoid losses through intel etc. however the fundamental way to actually end a war where the purpose is just to create targets for people to shoot at is to merely avoid the conflict and ship spin....is that really how ccp views winning a war and for it to be meaningful game play?i don't propose making high sec completely safe the beauty of eve is there is always a way to get something done. the espionage, fraud , theft and aggressiveness of the game makes it what it is.there has to be consequences, team super friends put a significant amount of work into the bounty and security mechanics..this should be the mechanism that deals with high sec conflict..if a corporation has an issue with an individual the game mechanics should mean that they can assassinate the player but they have to choose their time and place..high sec concord will deal swift justice...but are they quick enough to save the victim? unless the victim is lured into a trap through legal game mechanics.if a corporation has an issue with another corporation then the fee for concord to turn a blind eye to conflict in high security space should be significant! would the usa allow microsoft and intel to start a war within us territory? that should be the view of concord ( as is being used for another space mmo).the cost should be enough to make the corporation consider all other options...engage the pilots in low sec?, infiltrate the corporation?, undermine its trading options through market pvp? conduct a propaganda campaign ? hire genuine mercs to complete a job ( again this would still cost a significant amount more than the current 50 million for a small corp. and 500 for an alliance.) for the pocos in high sec any corporation that chose to claim a high sec poco would forgo the protection of concord . concord being the protector of high security space is stretched too thin to provide defence for structures within high security space...but there is always a price this would help ccp with the desire to shift game play to low sec and null sec..low sec used to be a case of ""here there be dragons"".navigating low sec used to be fraught with danger because that's where the pirates lived and getting to null sec was even more of a challenge as you had to survive the route through low sec 1st.this also made the pvpers actually pvp not just gank mining barges ..players would be anti pirate groups breaking gate camps, players would need to escort assets if they didn't have access to jump freighters or carriers or use logistics corporations such as red frog. i am not someone who needlessly complains about game issues , i have played since 2003 , ran a successful player alliances for most of that time , the changes ccp has introduced over the years have kept the game fresh but i do worry that the new player experience, the interests of your subscribers who just want to play the game how they want to following the pve and industrial careers that the game offers.high sec should never be safe ....but there should be significant consequences to any acts of aggression there and the game mechanics should enforce that. not circumvent it."
12/15/2014,"bro, your formatting and sheer length of post is kind painful, woudl be nice if you added a bulleted tl;dr at the end summing up the major points for debate, that way we can go back and read in more detail that section to bring a response"
12/15/2014,"things are being considered.the csm are actively talking to ccp about how social grouping in eve can be taken forwards, both in adjustments to the current system, and more complete overhauls."
12/15/2014,"the current industry and market mechanisms guarantee that i lose money to builders and traders... forcing me to perform money making activities that i do not enjoy and disrupting my preferred style of gameplay, ship on ship combat.the only recourse i have is... well... nothing. i have to either build stuff myself, make money, or find someone willing to do either for me... or i have no ships and equipment to blow up other players with.all of eve's systems and styles of play are integrated. the conflict that arises from this is intentional. because that is what makes for an interesting game.pvpers cannot blow up ships without performing industry or money making activities that they may not enjoy to support their gameplay.pveers and industry types cannot make ships/equipment without performing ship-on-ship combat that that they may not enjoy to support their gameplay.it's a two-way street. neither side is entitled to be ""left alone"" or have mechanics discourage the ""other side"" from bothering them.i read; ""i do not like pvp... make it so that it is not worthwhile to engage in pvp in high-sec so i can be left to my own devices.""sorry... but the only way that will happen is if i, a pvper, can get the stuff i need/want without having to give you much (if any) of my hard-earned money.oh wait... that would not be in my interest because then my industrial operations would not make much money anymore. and i would not be able to feed my habit of spaceship violence.it is actually in my interest to encourage more war and conflict. because then people buy more stuff. and i can sell for higher prices due to higher demand and more difficult logistics."
12/15/2014,"i believe that if you have to go quoting partial sentences out of a post i made more than a month ago to back your point then you need to learn to present a better argument. presenting arguments is of course the primary role of the csm, the election of who is what this part of the forum is dedicated to :)anyway, i consider this to be a likely troll candidacy, and as such, having dealt with the issue of a barely-in-context quote, i shall retire from posting any more to it."
12/15/2014,"sorry you feel that way.a) this is not a troll candidacy. i really am this crazy.""i don't suffer from insanity - i enjoy every moment of it."" b) i would like to point out that i :i) sent you a mail with a link so you would know that you had been quoted.ii) have in the un-edited post a link back to the original for the full thread and context, so it is not partical, it is brief. (can you imagine how long winded non-fiction would become if no one could use citations but had to quote the entirety of books and chapters?)"
12/15/2014,"thanks for your reply, jen. i share your frustration with d-scan as currently implemented. but i'd rather see it improved, and then taught to new players, than add some odd new damage-ablation mechanics.i agree with this in principle, insofar as logi is as silly as it is now because fleet alpha is silly, too.i don't know how much would change in practice, though. have i told anyone about the time we engaged our 8 (6 dps/2 logi) to someone else's 12 (8 dps/4 logi) on a wh, and my scout in the hostile hole watched as they warped in 8 more logi, ready to jump in case we actually managed to bread the 4 they already had? except for one run in nagas, we weren't flying alpha ships, either.so i'd say that risk aversion is already enough of a problem that nerfing logi along with a nerf to alpha won't change anything substantially."
12/15/2014,it was posted on the screens at fanfest when i first saw the statistic. i will try and get a cite for you.
12/15/2014,"if ankesemtapemkah liked to pvp, the campaign thread would probably look like this. tora just doesn't have to social skills to be an effective csm. the petty back and forth on this thread is fairly typical of the interactions i've had with him, both working with and against him. we can do better."
12/15/2014,"if you can do it, anyone can. at least my social skills are much better then yours. this noir. support might just have given me more votes.thanks for the bump ! <3"
12/15/2014,bump because **** yeah mike azariah.
12/15/2014,"wait, wait, wait. 5-10 billion every 15 minutes? what? i'm going to assume you mean million, and even that is generous. lets ignore ganker srp for a minute and look at margins on barge ganking for solo gankers.currently a t2 fit catalyst costs around 8 million isk. 1.5 million of that is the hull + rigs and cannot drop as blue loot. gankers don't receive insurance so the average loss per gank in a t2 cat is around 4-4.5 million isk. this assumes of course that no one interferes with your attempts to scoop your own loot. for yellow loot, a reasonably fit retriever might have 10m in modules on it. (i'm using pyfa numbers right now, someone can double check my math with eve central if they want). strip miners are around 3m a piece, a meta 4 shield extender is similar. dc2 and mlu2's are 300-400 thousand a piece, so 10-11 mill isn't an unreasonable estimate. i can ignore the rigs because again those can't drop, so our average revenue per gank is about 5-5.5 million. 5.5 in yellow loot - 4.5 average loss = 1 mill per 15 minutes, or 4 mill an hour. i don't think there's a lower paying profession in the game than that, but it gets worse.we've been calculating 1 gank per 15 minutes, but this isn't realistic. the criminal timer lasts 15 minutes, that doesn't include time spent undocking, warping to the target and ganking the target. i also doesn't include all the time spent searching for a target because there's none around when criminal timer wears off. if a ganker manages to consistently hit 3 ganks an hour, they are doing very well, so i think we can safely drop our estimate for the average income of a belt ganker that does not have srp down to 3 mill an hour. ""but bebop!"", you say, ""what about all of those ore strip miners?"" well my friend, those are few and far between, but this is a fair point. the real profit in ganking comes from the abnormal fits. the people who think ""yes, i will spend half a bill to get 1% better yield"". still, should the ganking profession be based around the careful miner who mitigates risk, or should it be based around the person who is offering expensive modules up on a silver platter? also, how many hours might i have to gank to encounter this player? i personally have never hit a barge with this sort of profit on the ship.i guess now we should look at freighter ganking. again, i will run all numbers with t2 cats at 8m a piece, but plese keep in mind that profit margins here are even more inconsistent.a fleet of 20 t2 catalysts costs around 160m due to the cirus industry changes (it used to be around 200m). that fleet also has to be supported by at minimum one scout (also doubling as the warp-in), one bumper, one neutral agressor, an orca pilot, a freighter pilot, and multiple neutral loot scoopers. the fleet has 26 characters working together and can output approximately 326400 damage before concord arrives assuming they are in a pre-pulled 0.5 system (i use a 24 second response time for this calculation instead of 26 because of dps loss for likelyhood of imperfect warp-ins, also, i'm calculating it at 680 dps with is perfect skills without implants due to the likelyhood of pod loss to white knights). this is enough damage to gank anything except a triple bulkheaded providence or obelisk, or some specific armor fits (usually involving slave implants). again, we see a loss of 4.5 mill per catalyst multiplied across 20 ships to be about 90 mill total. this of course again assumes that we somehow get all of the blue loot. actually doing so is fairly rare on crowded gates, but fairly common in deadspace. i think we can safely say actual losses are closer to 110 or 120 million per gank. calculating average yellow loot is much much harder. freighters range wildly in amount carried, but my experience would put an average somewhere around 500m in the cargohold. 1.7 bill is a fairly normal amount for a freighter loss. at 500m in hold, 50% drops (i'm ignoring courier contracts for this, but they do put a strain on consistency), giving us about 250m in loot. subtracting the costs of the catalysts nets us 125m or so in profits distributed across 25 characters for a total of 5m/person/gank. at three ganks an hour we're still only matching level 3 mission payouts. finally, this has assumed perfect yellow loot scooping, and no failed ganks. at any given time when we are freighter ganking we'll have 5-10 people trying to stop us. we've been using eccm for a long time now, and it is extremely effective, but we are still contending with attempted smartbombers and burst ospreys. 3 ospreys negate approximately 4 catalysts worth of dps with extremely low risk to them, so we are constantly playing a numbers game. currently we have the numbers to continue, but how long can we hold that?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/15/2014,"there is so much wrong with your assumptions and logic i almost didn't want to repsond to it. 1) ganking is not safe, it is in fact very unsafe compared to almost everything else you can do in highsec. we are aware of this however and act accordingly minimizing what we put on the line. in other words: we don't act like idiots and then complain when acting like idiots loses us hundreds of millions or billions of isk in implants, ships or cargo. examples: not blinging out your pod as at some point you will lose it due to being sloppy, flying into a well placed trap, dc, connection latency.2) shooting someone without a profit motive is not considered griefing by ccp, at least not to the point where it would be considered harrassment and bannable. the proof of this is in all the petitions filed against gankers without them being banned.3) ganking in itself is not profitable unless you pick out your targets. if you use t2 catalysts for ganking miners, you're losing money even if you are able to recover your loot (which is often not the case). from ganking miners, i'm breaking even at best. 4) ganking is not less risky than daytrading or mission running in itself. the risk of daytrading or mission running and ganking relies completely on what you are putting on the line and how much effort you put into it. completely in the player's own hand.5) spam does not always work because of lag. i once had my pod warping out already only to be rubberbanded back onto grid and going *squish*.6) you complain that ganking for profit is not fair yet you also seem upset about ganking without a profit motive. does not compute unless you simply want to remove non-consensual pvp from highsec (or the entire game perhaps) completely or nerf it so far into the ground that ganking will completely ruin your char, your entire account or even all of your owned accounts. stuff like that has been advocated many times. account wide sec status drop, not being able to enter highsec anymore ever, removing all docking rights etc etc etc."
12/15/2014,"i've actually read through all of your responses and all i see is constant whining that code is doing every single day:""wah wah, nerf the income of other parties, wah wah, we need more pilots to join pirate ranks, wah wah, nerf industrialists.""i'm sure you understand that the content you're trying to promote heavily relies on the content you're trying to downtrod ever so heavily.if and when, you actually ""fight"" for rebalancing of everything done in high-sec, including non-pirate activities (industry, legal business), then we can talk.until such a time comes, you're just a wailing child who envies its neighbour another toy."
12/15/2014,what rebalancing are you referring to? can you be more specific as to what you think needs to be fixed in highsec and what you would like a csm candidate to push for if elected?
12/15/2014,that's quite the imagination you have there.
12/15/2014,"sabriz, some time back, ccp soundwave said he'd like to see concord eventually replaced with player tools. what do you think of this idea? if you agree with it, do you think the time is right to lobby ccp over it? if you don't think it's time, why not?"
12/15/2014,"neither is throwing a ball at a kid while playing dodgeball, but if a group of you repeatedly pelt the same small kid full pelt while he's obviously not enjoying it, it kinda turns that way.all of these calculations, and yet the reality still stands that ganking is highly profitable."
12/15/2014,"that's why ccp has stated that if you go out of your way to make playing impossible for a single player in highsec, it will at some point be considered harassment. if 'the small kid"" in eve however decides to constantly undock in the same **** fit barge in the same part of space and keeps getting blown up, that is not considered harassment by ccp (they will judge on a case by case basis though). from my experience, it is very rare that miners don't wise up to some extent after a gank or two. would that be the reality that exists primarily in your own mind? ganking in itself is simply not profitable, it can be profitable if you pick your targets right but that requires more effort and time to find said targets, which will really, really hurt your isk/hour ratio. i only gank miners (and everything else that happens to be within a few km if i get the chance) and i can tell you that it does not make you a rich man. i'm always happy if i can loot enough to cover my catalyst."
12/15/2014,"the people directly responsible for that profit are those that insist on carrying way too much in ships that are far too weak. as bebop pointed out, suicide ganking isn't profitable against competent targets, it's the ignorant, the lazy and the greedy that end up losing their ships and providing the big payouts."
12/15/2014,"come now lucas, you know that isn't a fair comparison. gankers typically seek targets of opportunity - players who make a mistake and afk somewhere they shouldn't, or overload or overfit a ship. gankers don't sit in front of a station repeatedly podding some new player every time he undocks in a noobship as your allusion implies. gank victims have at least 15 minutes to get away from the situation and learn from it, and have plenty of tools to defend themselves from another gank in the future. painting them as hapless victims without agency is disingenuous, especially as we all voluntarily play a spaceship game with exploding spaceships at its very core. ganking can be highly profitable, like trading, but usually isn't as bebop laid out in detail. and just like trading, ganking is completely dependent the decisions of other players - in fact if other players play 100% defensively, there is zero profit in ganking. it is this trade-off of opening yourself to the risk of being ganked for some benefit (increased yield, less hauler trips, autopiloting your pod, etc.) that is a central design pillar of this game. this forces player choice for fits and behaviour and makes the game much more interesting than the simple exercise in min-maxing yield/cargo that it would be in the absence of risk.i am sure you know all of this already lucas even if you would prefer eve to be a more solo-friendly game, but i am not so sure of that is true of several of the other posters in this thread."
12/15/2014,thank you for your earlier response.what is your position on fighter assignment? for example a nyx assigns fighters from the edge of a pos to a t1 frigate which is somewhere else in the system.with kind regards l0rd carlos
12/15/2014,"t3's and ishtar's - i was having this discussion with some wormhole people the other day. it feels like the tengu is the biggest violator currently. if anything the loki might need slight tweeks. ishtars i think reduce the drone bay to 200m3. they can carry 1 set sentries 1 medium 1 small set of drones. the problem with nullsec pvp is bombers. they are still completely ******** and coupled with how easy probing is now the godbomb run is a actual thing and threat at all times. they severely restrict fleet concepts in nullsec. when my opponent brings dominix's i'd love to bring alphafleet but doing so is suicide due to bombers. yeah bc,bs & hacs are way outside the meta especially in nullsec. most times its just better to bring a t1 cruiser than a hac. bc's are so woefully inept next to t3's. command ships aren't in much better shape and most bs are laughable at best in nullsec."
12/15/2014,"the problem with lowsec is simple. there is no meaningful reason to be there other than pvp. it offers no unique features or advantages. think about it with me what do the other areas have that are unique.hisec - safetynullsec - sov ownership , supercapital productionwormholes - sleepers , semi-isolationismlowsec- hmmm something should go here. i mean i guess fw but thats basically sov war with training wheels.what i would change is:lowsec should be the premier industrial area of eve. it should have the best and most efficient factory lines available in eve. players should be able to contract protection from factions. basically put in a system where players can purchase standings to fw by purchasing a 30 day certificate from the faction of their choosing. the isk then gets divided amongst fw members every month. furthermore when factory lines are utilized it unlocks benefits for that faction. so basically you end up with a system where lowsec is busy with builders and industrialist. faction warfare members now have meaningful reasons to patrol and protect their factions space. they have reason in which to raid opposing factions and reasons for conquest of opposing factions space. because whoever is providing stable and safe areas will get more business. furthermore with increased traffic and population it gives more reasons for piracy to exist. i see lowsec as basically empire space and the factions are basically mafia families. they extort money for protection services from people wanting to engage in industry in lowsec. but the hook has to be that doing production is so much cheaper and efficient in lowsec versus hisec that it draws builders there."
12/15/2014,a few things. fighter assignment is kinda dumb because the carrier/supercarrier pilots drone skills are meaningless. this needs to be addressed. secondly its a very contentious subject as lone carriers and supercarriers are easy to kill with bumps. so making them sit to far away from pos shields means instant death should someone land on grid and call in friends. however it is frustrating to have a capital slink back into the shields whenever someone tries to stop them assigning fighters. furthermore you see pilots using sticks to assign fighters from. a stick is a online tower that has not had the forcefield turned on . the forcefield can be turned on instantly if the capitals are in any danger. honestly i don't have the answer but i understand the problem from all sides and its permutations . if i had to stab in the dark i think capitals need to be somewhere between 5000-7500 meters minimum from the forcefield to assign fighters. thats a stab in the dark though if ccp were actually willing to look at the issue id wanna talk more with the community to look for better ideas.
12/15/2014,"they can also assign from the inside of the edge of a deadspace pocket. only way to point them is to burn 15 minutes with a interceptor.but thanks for your answer, looks like you know the mechanics.if i may, i want to give you my personal opinion. i guess you can read from my wording that i am not very fond of the current mechanics. a nyx or thanatos on a medium / large pos with ecm and guns is very hard to remove, at least for a smaller fleet. while they only risk 3x frigs, they have over 7000 dps that can hit interceptors. the risk / reward scale is way out of balance on this one. the drone module changes to fighters and the latest jump mechanic changes made them pop up more and more around lowsec.i would remove the fights assignment all together, why is it there? what benefit does eve have from this.it eve gets ""abused"" in pve. i had an alt in a corp that rent space, assign fighters from a gank / tracking nyx to a brick tanked carrier. the carrier always had cap to jump, had ~7000 dps and a immense tank. (+ scram + web) 200+ mil isk/h farming machine in a cyno jammed system. gf gf.no need to response, i just wanted to vent. thanks again for your response, changes are high you will be getting my vote."
12/15/2014,"whenever you're fighting in catch, you might be able to zoom in at a ship and see me leaning out a window, shaking g my fist at you. for the csm however, you'll be getting my vote.+1 my dear frenemy."

12/15/2014,thank you for your earlier response.what is your position on fighter assignment? for example a nyx assigns fighters from the edge of a pos to a t1 frigate which is somewhere else in the system.with kind regards l0rd carlos
12/15/2014,"it is no secret that assigned fighters are way to strong and they don't have any risk at all involved in using them. you can set your carrier up at a offlined pos and just online it as soon as anyone drops you. i have no idea why fighters even can warp or receives bonuses from ddas, omnis and drone nav comps while the carrier is not even on grid. two of my friends run stiletto + hyena with assigned fighters and the stuff you can kill when you have 4k extra dps provided from off grid is insane. it's like the old gila/worm drone damage exploit except not an exploit. i know there are many things in eve that are not fair or fun for the hostile party but this really is one that needs to be looked at by ccp."
12/15/2014,"i am fully endorsing psianh for csm. i have had multiple dealings with him and have spoken to him in regards to his campaign and feel that he is exactly the kind of person we all need on the csm. it is in the best interest of all players to have a diverse and experienced representative group and i feel that, with the influx of so many new players into eve, psianh's unique perspective will be an asset to ccp and to all players moving forward.please join me in supporting him for csm.rj"
12/15/2014,psianh would make a great addition to the csm. full support buddy.vote psianh
12/15/2014,+1 for psianh. he has what it takes for csm 10. great guy.
12/15/2014,guy's a ****.one or two of my numerous votes will go on him.
12/15/2014,+1 for that ! i really like to give my support to him because he is an active friendly and professional player!
12/15/2014,+1 always great to have fellow merc on csm!burn the land and boil the sea you can't take the sky from me

12/15/2014,"hi carlos, thanks for the questioni do not view fighters assigned from off-grid as good gameplay why should a character be able to apply dps from the edge of a pos shield anywhere in system? now that fighters are affected by drone damage, speed, and tracking mods, this has been abused and it's use will only increase i am of the opinion that fighters should now function similarly to normal drones this would force the carrier pilots to be on grid to unleash the damage of their drones if anyone is interested, carlos filmed a video of a typical engagement for us with some nice commentary:"
12/15/2014,is your campaign based on just small group roams and being a representative of camel? you know that most of csm have to pay for themselves to go to iceland now?
12/15/2014,"my campaign is based on the fact that i can represent all aspects of eve since i have participated in a large portion of what this game has to offer. i can represent wormhole space since i have been a large part of thera and use wormholes daily (both k-space and w-space). i can represent 0.0 because i have lived in sov 0.0 and npc 0.0i can represent low-sec because i have participated in faction warfare, and currently base my operations out of low-sec. i can represent high-sec because i have alts that use jita and run high-sec incursions. i can represent the small gang community as well as the large gang pvp community because i have participated in both. paying for my own trip to iceland would be absolutely no problem for me. i am doing this solely to help represent my fellow players."
12/15/2014,what do you think are the main issues w-space has at the moment?
12/15/2014,"there have been many changes to many aspects of w-space in the last few months:*sleepers now rep each other*rebalancing of blue loot in the lower class wormholes*rebalancing of w-space effects*introduction of thera and 101 other shattered systems*introduction of more statics and random connections*introduction of tactical destroyers*changes to isboxer in januaryso in my opinion there needs to be more time for the meta to settle for a few months before you start drastically changing pve or pvp again. so i will choose the easy, low hanging fruit and reply with 'pos'es and corp roles. which luckily ccp have said they will be focusing on in the next year."

12/16/2014,"consequences. that is truely something that is lacking in the eve universe. so you did something bad and concord blew up your cheap fit cata... no big deal. so you did so many bad things you are free to shoot by any player, but since you can only fly cheap/fast ships around and go anywhere you want and do anything you want, again, no big deal.concord and faction navies make grandiose claims when a criminal or enemy comes into their space ""you will be terminated!"" ""you will surely die!"" ""you will not be tolerated!"". different navies have different flavors, but they all boil down to telling the offending pilot that they are not welcome and will be killed.but when have you ever seen them back those claims or even take a stand against those they want to kill and will not tolerate? they sure don't escalate if a drake is just hanging out tanking whatever navy ships happen to be there to catch it. and they don't really do anything about the -10 criminals flying around in t3 cruisers either.back on your point about hi-sec wars. in any sandbox you will have griefers, and no matter what you do you will always be griefed by players whose sole desire is to ruin someone else's fun. there will always be exploits and ways around the system in place to maximize their griefing potential. the best way to defend against it is by having spread yourself out in gameplay styles available to you. some of my characters are in their own alliance with a few dead corps and some cool people we have met along the way (maybe half a dozen active players amongst 30 characters), they get their usual grief decs like everyone else. but they have ways around it, passive income and activities are one, alts in separate corps that are sufficiently skilled and can also do griefing of their own is another. when one set is dec'd i play on the other more, and vis versa. diversify, that was the word i was looking for.though i guess you were also directing it at the cost it has on new pilots, which cannot do that or don't know how to prevent the extended dec's or don't even know people they can recruit to help. also doesn't help that there are so many fake war assistance corps out there which just lure the new corps into thinking they will get help when all they are doing is giving away isk. maybe some sort of rating system for corps so that you would know if they will help or just want your isk (but then that would be abused as well by the very same griefers, nevermind).regardless i have some ideas i've been writing up along the lines of real consequences in a game that ""says"" there are consequences for actions, probably just as long a read as this one, which is a shame because of the number of people that can't keep their attention for longer than half a paragraph :("
12/16/2014,"removing industry from the equation basically kills renting, which is a good thing."
12/16/2014,with the removal of clone grades and the cost to update your clone the one mildly usefull system bonus we got when upgrading a fw system with lp was lost.can we have a new bonus to replace it because at the minute after phoebe fw needs a bit of love.
12/16/2014,"while i've been playing eve for a while, i only recently joined the role-playing crew. i heard of arek'jaalan, read the in-game news, looked up interesting characters, etc. i then found the intergalactic summit and the live events discussion forums. intergalactic summit is fine, if a bit stale, as there's too much delay between each new interesting piece of information for us to discuss.the real problem right now is the live events forum. whenever we try to interact more with the lore, we are supposed to discuss it there, maybe get in contact with some special npc from a faction via eve-mail, etc. there's a sticky where we're supposed to declare our loyalties, another that lists npc contacts. neither of them are kept up to date.among the many threads in the first page, only a few (about 3) have dev replies within the year of 2014 (!), none of the sticky threads have any contact from a dev in 2014 either. ccp falcon seems to be the only dev who ever looked at the forum in the last two years.really, if we want to shape the game's universe (as advertised), we need more feedback on our actions, more points of contact with the universe, and this lore-side contact is very interesting and powerful. so please, talk to ccp, or even take it onto your hands if it is in the csm's power to do so. the rpers might not be ~leet pvp hardcore gamerz~ but they are as much a part of the playerbase as any others, we want some love too. this ton of (wonderful) lore that ccp has been dangling right in front of our noses is useless if we can't interact with it."
12/16/2014,"apparently people prefer to just snipe the team auctions instead of bidding on them, kinda defeats the purpose of having an auction system to begin with.if you aren't going to change it at least tell me how much i oversniped the team by? i mean i get an email when i lose a team auction telling me how much the winning snipe was, but nothing about how much i oversniped an auction by.i think i'm done referring to this awful system as an auction system anymore, cause all it has turned into 90% of the time is a game of chance for who snipes at the last second with the highest value. i stopped even bidding on teams i was not going to be present at my keyboard for the end time because it is going to get sniped unless i snipe it instead.darn shame really, the system had such potential."

12/16/2014,probably the best representative highsec industrialists have ever had in the history of the csm.
12/16/2014,"would surely agitate against stealth ""nerf hisec to death"" candidate such as you sir."
12/16/2014,"i find it difficult to take your proposed changes seriously considering the alliance you lead thrives on pushing the limits on some of the very issues you've brought up.in fact, it beckons the mind to consider whether or not your proposals are merely an elaborate charade, the end game of which would be switching your official position to the exact opposite upon election."
12/16/2014,"if you look at the last two replies you can see one telling me i will nerf eve to death and the other one who thinks i will do nothing as it doesn't suite my alliance.eve is about content and balance. if i think eve is getting to nerfed, i will bring in more darkness. if it's to dark, shine more light. and to keep this in balance, i talk and listen to people. even to people i personally do not like. making decisions as a csm should not be about feelings, but facts.i have made some strong statements here on this post. not because that is the fixed direction, but to get some good discussions going on and see how people think about things. after reading the replies, i'll start correcting the direction we move in. no yin without yang and vice versa.for people who think i will turn high-sec in to a nerfed wow disneyland, no worries"
12/16/2014,"the truth really being that you'd only really push for changes which benefit you regardless of whether it's balanced or good for the game, whine endlessly about other changes which negatively affect you and explode into childlike rage when you are challenged. i'm pretty sure most people know how you behave and really don't want to see the csm with someone like you on it. i mean seriously, look at your response to alekseyev: ""at least my social skills are much better then yours"". this isn't a school playground where ""i know you are so what am i"" is a normal response. also, it's ""than""."
12/16/2014,"eve is a great game, where you can get daily tears from some predictable players. this is something i will never nerf !"

12/16/2014,"i needed a candidate to give an example of absolute worst, rock bottom, lowest of the low. the candidate, who, should he make it to csm, would surely give people enough reasons to say that csm is a manure pit.you guessed correctly, i have found one. a code member with eve-killing intentions, there can be no greater disgrace to any community than to have one speaking.ed: oh dear, i have found myself agreeing with lucas kell. just how obvious an issue must be for the pinky and the brain to have the same opinion on it."
12/16/2014,"ok, back after the conference i was at all weekend. i decided not to post anything substantive while at it, and i won't catch up fully for a couple of days.i seem to have attracted a few detractors here. as i understand it, the unifying thing behind the detractors is that they don't like me because i promote ships getting blown up in every class of space that has resources of nontrivial value (i.e. everywhere except for rookie systems). i both personally blow ships up and encourage others to engage in asymmetric warfare in game, calculating and exploiting the weaknesses of other players.although they vary on the details, my detractors want to see areas of space with resources of relatively high value (highsec incursions, l4 soe missions, mexallon-rich belts, ice anomalies) in areas of space with minimal or no pvp, and want to see changes that reduce the advantage the attacker has in surprise pvp (at least in highsec).i've addressed why i think this is a bad idea earlier in this thread.i'm intending to run an 'ask me anything' session this weekend on the minerbumping teamspeak. i invite detractors to come and ask hostile questions (as well as inviting supporters to ask questions both sympathetic and curly, and neutrals to ask whatever they want). it will be recorded and posted to soundcloud - if you'd prefer to ask questions anonymously, i'm happy to facilitate that, evemail your question to me from an untraceable alt and i'll have a supporter read the question out."
12/16/2014,ripard teg has already come and gone.
12/16/2014,"sabriz and i might not agree on all things, but he does have the skills and passion for eve to be a good csm. he spends a lot of serious time on his campaign and isn't one of those ""i want to be a csm, because its good for my ego"" kinda guys."
12/16/2014,"as expected from a failure of a candidate, you couldn't have been further away from truth.i promote more ships exploding in hisec. more of your cheap ones you never worked for, and less of the expensive ones people had to work for. making you work for your ships and not just do zero risk ganking would be fine too."
12/16/2014,"could you please expand on this? how do you ""promote"" more ships exploding in highsec?"
12/16/2014,"devaluing the pve content isn't going to miraculously fix high-sec issues. you don't fix things by nerfbatting everything you personally disaagree with. that you personally think in your own opinion is breaking the economy.if anything, it'll promote more pvp pirating activities and there'll be a point where it becomes degenerative and malnutricious to new and old players alike. (the hounds outnumber the foxes)you want less afk miners and bot-aspiring behaviour - make mining more interesting other than staring at your mining lasers cycle for hours and hours on end while your ore holds are getting full.i'm totally against a mini-game that takes your mind off of your surroundings (like hacking mini-game which takes half of your screen away), what i'd like more is the rebalancing of asteroids in a way, that there would no longer be so many different types of rock but less, where the most common materials would be on the outside and more valuable ones on the inside. if you left your mining lasers alone, they would be mining the outer layer, which would require no guidance. getting to the inner layer would require you to make corrections to the angle/penetration/whatever of your lasers to get that valuable hemorphite ore out of a rock. also, introduce collision damage. battleship ""bumping"" a frigate should result in the frigate being crippled or destroyed. make collisions with space rocks on an equal scale. you can shave off smaller rocks, bigger ones will cause dmg. with the introduction of manual control it would give a whole new level to being chased and taking them into an asteroid belt (wing commander i style) or staying in the middle of rocks to try and avoid falling prey to pirates.size should matter. a partisan with a slingshot should not be able to kill a tanker."
12/16/2014,"i would not vote vote for you, despite you trying to 'big' yourself up as some sort of purist pvp player.go do some real pvp against ships that can fight back.code is weird role playing, but whatever turns you on i guess.james aged 13 and a bit has an ego to rival that of mittens and you are associated with him in the game.code offering to save hi-sec is like the fox offering to guard the chicken coop."
12/16/2014,"ok, i am still not clear on what you think needs to be ""rebalanced"" in highsec. in fact most of your post is just arguing what you think shouldn't be changed. as to mining, i think everyone, including sabriz (although perhaps you can ask him about this at his ama on teamspeak?), would love to have a revamp making mining more engaging as well more rewarding to those that engage in team play and risk taking. your last point though makes it clear you think bumping needs to be rebalanced. your solution is unworkable though as gankers will just start ""ganking"" by ramming everything with massive ships, with no concord response. and if you make collisions spawn concord, not only will the jita undock will be a continual field of wrecks, how will you decide who should be concorded? if it is the big ship (or both ships), then gankers will just sacrifice small, worthless ships to get the loot from the concorded big ship, or if it is the small ship, gankers will just ram frigates all day in an agility-fit mach and let concord blow them up for them."
12/16/2014,"i don't agree with you here, but understand why you are saying this. for most players it's hard to separate evil eve role play with real life. csm is real life stuff, code is mainly role play. i try to role play an evil annoying war lord and many will probably agree i succeed at it . but in real life i am totally different. just like actors in evil movies, arent evil people in real life.try to find out if sabriz can separate the two, before judging him."
12/16/2014,"no, it's more like the stern, responsible farmer offering to guard the chicken coop."
12/16/2014,"if there are players on both sides it meets the definition of pvp and mining ships are certainly capable of packing tank, dps and tackle.role-play, sure - this *is* a role-playing game after all. weird, not so much - we've claimed space as ours and we use force to keep it. we hold sov without those pesky sov mechics that everyone so loves (yay! *another* multi-million hp structure to grind - only 3 more to do in this system, chaps!). our sov claim can be invalidated by other people taking it from us by force.i'm sure you can do better than throwing around insults. please try and be civil.that's a terrible analogy, though interesting in that you seem to associate a segment of highsec players with a bunch of chickens."

12/16/2014,"greetings, fellow capsuleers.i've been playing eve for approximately two and a half years, since may 2012. my experiences are fairly diverse - i do everything ranging from 50-100 person fleets helping contest sov, 5-20 person small roams/local defense, wormholes, teaching classes to newbies, and running moon reaction farms. however, i feel that i am most qualified to speak about the challenges of being a small, independent entity pvping in nullsec, and about the struggles of newer players.since august 2013, i have led one of the smallest and least veteran-heavy alliances active in sov nullsec, of sound mind. we have lived in providence, lived in wormholes, lived in curse, lived in syndicate, and most recently have been a part of the hero coalition living in catch. however, my sovereignty and bloc isn't my identity -- my identity is as a mentor to newbies and facilitator for their learning first and foremost, regardless of who we fly with and where we live. i have maintained an active killboard since the very first week i've played eve, and always have a boots on the ground perspective as to things that are fun/working well and things that are resulting in a stagnant game.my perspective is unique because of my ongoing individual work with the new players we train every single day. i see firsthand how players struggle with eve's learning curve, and how a little bit of individual guidance and mentoring can help transform them into confident, empowered players excited about eve. i want to make that scale, and give every newbie joining eve the same opportunity to become excited about the game that i had, and that i am only able to give a few dozen newbies at a time with the resources i have today.my experience isn't merely the sum of my ingame activities. i have the expertise to hold ccp accountable to realistic goals, and to translate player demands into clear and reasonable requests to ccp. i have previously worked in the mmorpg space as a software engineer/anti-botting/anti-cheating czar working on puzzle pirates. i have substantial project management skills as well as software engineering skills, so i can easily determine whether something is realistically possible for ccp to implement, or whether it would suck time away from more important development work for comparatively little gain. i will be unapologetic about calling out vaporware bullshit promises without delivery, and will hold ccp's feet to the fire about making progress towards a healthier, more stimulating game.in keeping with what i said about my experience, i won't promise things as part of my campaign platform that i am unable to deliver. i won't promise you rebalanced sov now!!!oneoneone, but i will promise to make the perspective of the small pirate corp/alliance that wants to plant their flag in null one day heard in the ongoing dialogue with ccp about evolving game mechanics. i won't promise you redo all the tutorials, but i will be insistent about pointing out to ccp the pain points felt by the new players i work with every day. i won't be able to fix power projection with a snap of my fingers, but i can speak to the ways in which i feel that current power projection mechanics help/hinder fights today, and speak up if i see instances in which malcanis's law that ""changes designed to help new players help experienced players/incumbents more"" may be coming into play. furthermore, i am always willing to open-mindedly listen to perspectives that i initially disagree with, and am comfortable advocating for the overall position of the community rather than only presenting my own views.some of my past writing on sov mechanics, coalitions, and force projection may give you an idea of my views on things that are working and not working about eve's mechanics today.here are some overall principles that i will adhere to when speaking to ccp if i am elected: eve's challenge comes from making meaningful choices. ishtars online and supers online do not make for interesting content. everything should have a counter. newbies are the future of eve. if something would hurt incumbents, but make it easier for newbies to get sucked into eve, i will advocate it every time. smaller objectives make for more interesting content over 'big bang' once in a blue moon 10% tidi lagfests. i look forward to answering any questions that the community may have for me. i'll collate my answers in a post below this one in order to make reading them at once easier."
12/16/2014,"compendium of questions and tl;dr answers:q: what are your opinions on lowsec? a: i have individual reasons that i don't play much in lowsec, but prefer not to force my opinions on people that do live in lowsec. q: why are you running? a: sov, poses, and alliance/corp management are very important issues to me that i want to see done right. not in it for going to iceland -- i intend to contribute remotely. q: what do you think about alts? a: alts are a symptom of mindnumbingly boring gameplay. make the gameplay more interesting for mains to do, or add deployables that eliminate the need for alts. q: what do you mean by 'forcing' people to do things? a: give people incentives to engage with mechanics and/or add consequences for ignoring mechanics. q: what do you think of ccp rise's npe mechanics proposals? a: great to see ccp experimenting. some further thoughts into the eve 102 of player interaction are needed, but the steps towards improving 101 look promising. q: are you a bloc candidate? are you ali aras's successor? a: maybe, and maybe. in the event hero does organized voting this year, i will likely only get a trickle after brave candidates, similar to malcanis in past years. i think similarly to ali, but am not her clone. q: are you electable vs. cfc candidates? will you work for your coalition? a: csm voting is not zero-sum, and i am neither pro-cfc nor anti-cfc. i expect it will be difficult, but that i can be elected. i will work for the overall health of the game even if it hurts my coalition, but my experience that i draw upon for discussions is primarily from flying with my coalition. q: why should people vote for you in one sentence? what do you want to fix? a: i'm the only currently running candidate whose fulltime game job is teaching newbies. i think matching players to good corps is the key to player retention, and that the corp finder needs rework. q: how will you make pve suck less? a: i do not want to see 30% or 50% of ccp's energy sucked away by level/content treadmilling. increased vulnerability to other players (and commensurate reward) is the best thing to make pve more interesting and less monotonous. q: what do you think about small/large fleet meta balance? a: not necessarily broken - petes, bombers, cerbs useful for smaller gangs harassing larger gangs. if nerf becomes necessary, nerfing massed logi would be required to buff smaller groups harassing. q: how would you make smaller groups viable in low/null? a: low/npc null: decrease value of carrier camping, increase supply of staging systems. sovnull: remove incentives for people to have vast renting empires that take up spots on the totem pole that smaller groups should be contesting instead. q: what are your thoughts on wardecs, corp cycling, and awoxing? a: corp cycling for dec dodging can be fixed by giving everyone a very strong incentive to own a pos, and making it so that poses can't be taken down during wardec spoolup. if the corp disbands, you at least get to make it cost them. awoxing is complicated - weeding out bad corps is good, but the mechanic also hurts corps that want to train newbies. if wardecs can be fixed, then that would be a viable mechanism for doing the weeding. cap stable interview:"
12/16/2014,"the easiest way to reach me is by evemail or on tweetfleet slack, if you have questions you'd like to directly ask.my recommendations for high ballot slots (besides myself) are, in no particular order: sugar kyle (outstanding communication, newbie education efforts) dave korhal (a smart genuine newbie) jayne fillon (who has done *so* much to ensure fleet pvp is accessible to newbies through npsi) steve ronuken (who does an amazing job advocating for third-party development upon which every single organized community in eve depends so much) cagali cagali (who works with an order of magnitude more newbies than i do by virtue of running the brave dojo) psianh auvyander (who speaks for the non-highsec merc and small gang communities extremely well) list may be amended as i see more of others' platforms in order to feel confident issuing recommendations. i do not accept or give cross-endorsement deals - i'm telling it like it is without any kind of kickback backscratching stuff.there are other people not listed here that still would be good on the csm, but don't need any help getting there."
12/16/2014,in your opinion:1) what is currently broken about lowsec?2) how would you fix it?3) how do you see low-sec fitting into the universe as a whole going forward?thanks!
12/16/2014,"having had some experience flying with june when sound lived in syndicate, and now being re-united in catch with hero, i give a big +1 for her bid for csm!she's good people, and we certainly need more good people fighting for us."
12/16/2014,"honestly, i feel like lowsec is not one of my core competencies. i would prefer to avoid issuing major pronouncements about systematic issues in lowsec when i don't actually live there. you also are not distinguishing between fw lowsec and non-fw lowsec, which are two very different animals -- which one are you interested in hearing about?that being said: i can say that my personal annoyances with lowsec and security status mechanics are threefold:1.) alts make the concept of security status and militia status meaningless, because you can get your own alts to take care of your market shopping, etc. for you. there is no reason not to go full flashy, because the consequences to it are mitigated with alts.2.) gate guns penalize frigate-sized fights on lowsec gates unless you've deliberately opted into fw.3.) fleet boosting on a station undock is stupid broken and defeats the point of ccp's changes to make pos boosting harder. that one's easiest to band-aid fix by giving boosters weapon timers if they run their links, but the long term fix revolves around ccp's plans to bring boosters ongrid and at risk.rambling a bit -- i would love to see lowsec as a major thoroughfare that everyone has to pass through rather than being something that is easy to bypass. many nullseccers and highseccers could care less about goings-on in lowsec because it doesn't affect them, and that's a problem. people should be forced to interact.i don't know how well ccp's fixes to lowsec income via mordu's spawns and clone soldier spawns have worked -- anecdotally clone soldier spawns were helpful for brave member income when brave lived in barleguet, but i'm not sure that problem is fully fixed. having lowsec be a second class citizen for income potential because the income doesn't measure up to the risk-free income of highsec incursions, the unlimited anoms of nullsec, and wormhole cap escalations is definitely unhealthy for the game overall.i'm pretty happy with the wormhole superhighway effect in lowsec that ccp added recently, because it makes lowsec much more attractive to use as a travel pathway.in general though, i really prefer to defer to the opinions of people that are lowsec experts when discussing lowsec balance. i have my core competencies and dislike it when people that don't know what they're talking about try to too many cooks me. i'm not going to go trample over what sugar kyle has to say about lowsec. she lives it. i don't. i'm happy to say what things would make me more likely to interact with lowsec in my day to day gameplay though if it's helpful to discussions."
12/16/2014,why are you running? why this year and not years before?
12/16/2014,"believe me, it's not because of the free iceland trips. full disclosure: i am unable to physically travel to iceland due to being responsible for the care of an epileptic dog. if elected, i promise to attend every session remotely via videoconference. i believe i can be as effective as someone attending in person -- i have plenty of experience with being a constructive remote contributor from working with teams in other offices in my day job.getting back to answering the actual questions - i have two reasons why this specific csm term is important to me: this is going to be a pivotal year for eve and for the csm. the increased tempo of changes coming from ccp demands a laser focus and early feedback so that ccp doesn't release something botched that it then has to backpedal (or worse, simply allows it to damage the game). i'd much rather have a steady cadence of on-point releases that take the game in a healthy direction. with sov, poses, and alliance/corp management on the agenda for 2015, i feel that representing other players that are small, independent fish is going to be important. the heavyweights have their voices already - sion, endie, and mannie among others, that are almost certainly going to be elected. i can speak coherently and competently for the 50-300 character sized groups. one size does not fit all. i felt that ali aras represented my opinions very well and saw no reasons that both of us should be in the running in previous years. i helped her with her campaign planning, and advised her to the extent that the nda would allow. she is not standing for reelection this year, and i feel that no other candidates represent my perspective as well as i could by representing directly."
12/16/2014,"as an early supporter of ali's, i'm glad to see you running to take her place. i have a few questions:alts make a fair number of intended mechanics in the game either meaningless or hobbled to the point of redundancy (i'm thinking of bounties). nevertheless, ccp seems to have embraced them wholeheartedly. i realize that this is a huge can of worms, but since you're brandishing a can opener, i have to ask: do you have a specific approach on this? not necessarily answers, but an approach you want to take toward the issue, since you clearly think it's an issue?could you clarify this? i get twitchy when i see the word ""force.""last question: did you see ccp rise's presentation on the intended direction for the new npe? what do you think of it? right way? wrong way? hard to tell? would it dovetail with the way you've brought new players under your wing, or interfere?"
12/16/2014,"great questions, thanks!there is a huge amount of eve that is so mind-numbingly boring that no player is willing to do it as a career, or requires so much trust that you'd rarely delegate it to another player. cyno alts or eyes alts definitely spring to mind for that. multiboxing also is a huge problem -- if your brain is so un-engaged by what you're doing that you have plenty of attention span to spend it on three other accounts at the same time, then maybe the mechanics should be changed to be less afk or 'click a button every 10 minutes'. there should be a reason to get another human being to do something for you instead of doing it yourself on an alt. i think that deployables present a good solution to cases in which you really can't make it more interesting such that a player would be interested in and valued for doing it.feel free to treat 'forced to engage with x' as ""there should be meaningful consequences for ignoring x, and meaningful benefits to becoming more engaged with x"". i honestly cannot say i am happy about the fact that except for the fact that i need to light a few logistical cynos in lowsec, there's not much of a game mechanical reason for me to care as a person living in nullsec about what happens in lowsec. there should be more incentives for me to want to do things in lowsec, even if i don't live in lowsec. right now my alliance pretty much ignores the existence of lowsec since there's no benefit to us from engaging more, and no penalty to us for how little we engage in lowsec activity.let us imagine, for instance, that the spawn rates of outbound wormholes from null->low increased dramatically and the spawn rates of null->high wormholes trickled down to ~0. that gives me a very, very, very powerful incentive in combination with, say, a jf range nerf, to start doing more logistics through wormholes through lowsec if i live deep in null, and to start escorting industrials through low or roaming low more often instead of just waiting for the next wormhole to highsec.unfortunately i wasn't available at the time that that was scheduled on the vegas stream, and i didn't realize that the videos were helpfully being archived and published to youtube after the fact :) - i'll watch it in the next day and get back to you."
12/16/2014,i've gotten to know june pretty well over the past year and a half. i think she'd do a pretty solid job as a csm rep!
12/16/2014,xander's a stand up guy and an excellent b-level podcaster he's worth your support to send him back for another successful year.
12/16/2014,continuing the tradition of strong goon candidates. he doesn't need my vote but i'll put him on my ballot anyway xd
12/16/2014,i fixed that for you.
12/16/2014,+1 for psi and good luck mate

12/17/2014,"nariya kentaya i am not really a fan of the tldr; if theres a case and argument for change then detail is essential especially in the assembly hall.steve ronuken great to see the csm are in discussions with ccp and vice versa . it would be interesting to see the proposal. having read the summer summit minutes there seemed to be very little on the subject.this post was in response to gms suggestions that any change would only come about via this forum and discussion with the csm i would be more than happy to discuss this further with you using my main.shahfluffers i personally do like pvp and i do believe no one should ever be protected from the risk of losing assets your comment ; ""i do not like pvp... make it so that it is not worthwhile to engage in pvp in high-sec so i can be left to my own devices"" pretty much sums it up players live in high sec for the perceived security.the current system means anyone can pay concord to turn a blind eye...making high sec effectively null sec without bubbles/capsi appreciate the game mechanics are linked supply via industry and demand from conflict. i don't propose any change if you /someone wants to pvp they can still gank miners, mission runners or pay to war dec a corporation or alliance. the issue is griefer corporations that merely war dec half a dozen newly formed small corporations or industrial corporations just so that they can await a victim at a trade hub.is that meaningful game play? there's no risk for the griefer corp and the new players or industrialists have no option other than to ship spin, play alts or relocate for a week...until the war is declared void and then another griefer corp picks up the mantle.dangeresque too indeed there are too few consequences i do believe that concord is the correct mechanism to deal with high sec criminal acts they maybe need for tools to serve justice on offenders. i don't think concord should ever prevent the crime though so people still have a choice.again its a sandbox and the inventiveness of people makes eve what it is...from back when moo was around and there exploits to goons and burn jita but for me the current war mechanism is far too open to abuse.the options to play during a war are varied my alliance uses all of them even if the war mechanics are changed ..if someone pays the price to declare war then my members still would have the same option.all i am proposing is make the act of declaring war mean something...not just be a means to create targets of opportunity."
12/17/2014,"which is bad because it is not, nor ever was meant to be, true.high-sec was meant to be ""relatively safer"" compared to low-sec... which is ""relatively safer"" than null-sec... which is ""relatively safer"" than wormhole space.plus, balancing the game based on perception alone is a very dangerous thing.no. not like null-sec. not even low-sec either.in either of those two areas... everyone is out to kill you... not just the people who you are your sworn enemies. this means you can't fly casual in any way, shape, or form without also being very smart and/or well prepared.if you have been living in low or null-sec for any stretch of time... high-sec wars are trivially easy to deal with.to each their own.i get off roaming around low-sec aimlessly shouting dakka dakka in local. then blowing people up. that is meaningful gameplay to me.if someone feels their time is will spent camping a poor sob in a station... who am i to judge?though... from the victim's perspective (either in my scenario or the station camping one)... our forms of gameplay probably won't have any meaning in any way, shape, or form... and it certainly won't be fun if they just sit there.but that isn't exactly a systemic issue. that's a player issue. the ""victims"" can have fun... they just have to ""make it fun"" by either turning the tables or changing their perception altogether (both of which are difficult, but possible).edit: as far as ""risk"" to the war deccing corp*** goes... players are supposed to provide that risk. if you have nothing to dissuade someone from attacking you... then you are making yourself an easy target. ***understand that the act of attacking people (even ""helpless"" people) is not ""greifing"" in eve. even if it is for ""lols.""this means that high-sec war deccing corporations are not ""griefers.""""greifing"" is when you single out and harass an individual over a substantial course of time despite the efforts of said individual to avoid it.this is laid out pretty clearly in the eula.one last thing... in eve, a player is only as helpless as they make themselves. if you are an industrial corporation with no ability or will to fight back against aggressors... you should not be surprised by the result.and yes... everyone should learn the basics of pvp (even if they do not like it). because pvpers have to learn the basics of non-pvp activities to survive too.again... it's a two way street.war means whatever people want it to mean. you can't forcibly ""make it worthwhile"" when it is subjective in their first place (not without turning it into a grind-fest akin to 0.0... which you do not want... trust me).i've once declared war on a corp where one of its members ""looked at me funny."" rationally, there was no ""meaning"" to it. for me though... it was perfectly justified and i proceeded to make the war as ""fun"" for me as possible.the other guys though... half of them left the corp right away... half of the other half stayed in station cowering... and the few remaining scrubs tried to take me on.they died of course... but after a few chats i decided i liked a few of them. so i poached them for my corp. i don't really see a problem with any of the above. i went through it when i was a newbie... yeah it was painful... yeah it made me mad... yeah many of my newbie peers were confused (though, i could not understand that one as the term ""war"" is pretty self explanatory; ""people get to shoot you"")... but because i asked (both my corp leaders and the guys who shot me) i learned what to do and how to survive better.i expect nothing less from a newbie... let alone a semi-established player with set money-making activities."
12/17/2014,"as a former highsec pve/industrial subscriber, i can honestly say that op is full of it. oh no, someone wardec'd my highsec carebear corp! whatever will i do?!?!?well, i guess i'm off to go run lvl 3s in a t2 fit cruiser for a week or two rather than lvl 4s in a blinged out battleship. remember, most highsec wardec corps are after easy kills with decent payouts. moving 15-20 jumps away from where you were based and switching to a ship that costs less than 30mil will generally take you off the wardecer's radar, since it's just too much work to track you down for that puny of a kill. not saying all highsec war corps are like that, but almost all of the ones i've encountered have been."
12/17/2014,"so... how many ratting ishtars/battleships/carriers should be stuffable into one system?and is blob based sov really better than having military objectives with timers? so you can't hold objectives even with your blob, but you want to be able to take sov anyway?"
12/17/2014,"interesting idea on the orca and rorqual, makes sense especially with the jump fatigue and range reductions.democracy is currently a farce in most of the west, we have no hopers in positions of power who hate their own people, the only place in europe that has a functioning democracy at this point is switzerland and that is because they have a binding system of referendums that gives the people some power to rein in their political class, and wow the people have actually been sensible.the vote for none of these is rather large in real life and in eve, so again an interesting idea, i don't vote in teh csm because doing so would give it legitimacy, even though i do feel at times they ahve done some good things, but many have a viewpoint i do not agree with, so your suggestion would enable me to vote.i like your comments in the mining hate thread, the key point is that there needs to be a buff to consequences for suicide ganking, i have suggested -10 to remove docking rights, but there may be others that work.well so far you have my support. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp"
12/17/2014,"i agree entirely with sabriz, and am very disappointed in the positions tora bushido has taken here."
12/17/2014,"as i said before, my direction has not yet been set in stone. i am using them to see how people think about eve. i am not here to make eve as i would like it to see it, i am here to make it as the community wants it to be. so tell me, how would you like eve to be."
12/17/2014,"to use a roleplaying analogy, in-game i'm chaotic evil.irl, i'm chaotic good.however, when the consequences of chaotic evil behaviour are limited to space pixels (i.e. outside rl), chaotic evil characters make for a much more interesting world."
12/17/2014,what would eve do without folks like code and marmites... make isk in high-sec so they can pvp?
12/17/2014,"no monocle, no vote."
12/17/2014,"i'd fit into neutral evil. i'm mostly lawful evil, while occasionally acting against the rules when i see fit. irl i'm probably neutral good."
12/17/2014,"when you chose representatives, you don't necessarily need one with his/her own vision (that happens to mostly match yours), someone who actively gathers information, concerns, ideas and presents them to people who have final say on the matter, would work as well, if not better.i was trying to figure how my ballot will look and honestly i had other candidates in mind for priority position, but if securing a place for kyle means that primary function of csm - being a voice of playerbase in ccp's ears - is carried out, then this is where my voice goes.i admit, i wasn't around this year and so i missed most of op's work as csm representative, but from my past and present experience, if you can't contact her, you aren't trying. having someone like that on csm has an advantage: you will be able to relay concerns of your group of players even if those didn't arise and got formalized prior to election, regardless of where you live and what you do.props to kyle for her style because that sounds to me like csm on hard mode."
12/17/2014,you have my vote.
12/17/2014,are you running in place of ali aras?are you the official candidate from hero?
12/17/2014,"i am a close friend of ali aras. i am running this year in particular in part because she chose not to stand for re-election -- in previous years, i would not have wished to split her support base, and also felt that she represented my interests well. i leave it to her to announce her csm x endorsements upon her own schedule.i made my decision to run without regard to whether i was getting support from my blues. i intend to pursue support from all parties - blue, neutral, and red. my belief is that i will need every vote i can get in order to be elected - if brave announces any official candidates (again, i do not control the schedule upon which any such announcements might take place), they will very likely come well before me on any ballot that brave or hero would produce. my situation is similar to malcanis's from past years."
12/17/2014,"my answers to foo's questions, which should appear at"
12/17/2014,"pve in eve kinda sucks from the lowest levels up to incursions and stuff like that, would that be part of your focus"
12/17/2014,"+1 include psian in your voting. he'll make an excellent csm. kitchen sink? seriousy, get your ship together - fleet-up.com"
12/17/2014,"angrod,currently brushing up on my ""praise bob"" episodes, and really enjoying the podcast. i'm looking forward to hearing your interviews and following your campaign. i'm glad we have a couple wormhole players running currently. keep trucking along and i hope that your campaign goes well. best of luck!"
12/17/2014,"i'm very interested in your platform, especially anything that will make w-space accessible to new players. you've mentioned a few things about roles. i completely agree that the system is in need of improvements, but are you committed to keeping corp theft viable as a profession? i know its a bit off your platform, but what is your opinion on the discussion of removing intra-corp agression in high sec?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/17/2014,"i feel that intra corp ""combat"" or aggression is more than viable and will remain so. i do not feel that adding ease of use or logical changes to the current role system should be postponed in regards to no changing current intra-corp aggression tactics. awoxing will always exist, corp theft will always exist. i would simply prefer the ability to actually control my role system logically rather than with the limited options they currently provide.in wormhole space specifically intra-corp aggression is a very real and dangerous thing to ceo's and new corps. it destroys dreams and turns more people away from this game then should be. there are game mechanics flaws that pander to making corp theft amazingly easy. where as safety becomes increasingly expensive and logistically insane. i think with the resolution of these game mechanics issues we will have a decrease in small time corp thefts and an increase in much larger schemes and thefts. mainly due to lower totem pilots who think they can just enter and take **** their first week or so will die off rapidly, but as directors and corporate espionage professionals realize that the corp is increasing in wealth instead of having it taken over and over again they will be more and more tempted to disappear into the night with more valuable loots and isk.check out my podcast! my blog!"

12/18/2014,"which is exactly what the problem is with the current wardec mechanics. the aggressor is able to throw a wad of money at concord to get virtually unlimited targets for a relatively small price. there are corps out there that are constantly at war with over 60 different corporations at once. the fact that such a thing is even worth considering is proof that the current wardec mechanic is one big joke.from a gameplay perspective a mechanic needs to be 'favorable' to both parties. it needs a balance of risk and reward, which is what eve is all about. where is the risk vs reward balance in the current war mechanics? the aggressor wardecs because they want kills. they are prepared to fight. fighting is the entire purpose of the wardec so there is virtually no risk involved for them while at the same time they reap all the rewards (killmails, loot, payment, satisfaction).while, as the defender, it's the other way around. the average corp getting wardecced isn't exactly excited to have a war. they have to stop whatever they're doing and adjust to the situation someone else forces onto them. your example of a 'proper' reaction to a wardec, by flying a different ship and moving to a different system, is completely insane and further shows how broken the system is. that should not be the 'proper' response in any situation. let's not forget that this is a game people play for fun, yeah? furthermore the defender corp bears 100% of the risk and absolutely none of the reward (and consider just for a moment that there are people who don't consider killmails and pvp kills rewarding).to put things in perspective, imagine this situation was the other way around. imagine there was a way for industrial corps to declare 'forced labor' onto any random pvp corp. for one week straight they would have to do mining and industry even though they hate every single second of it. of course they could keep doing what they were doing, but it wouldn't be very effective, very risky and could potentially lose them billions if they didn't move far enough away from their mining overlords to stay off the radar.so to recap. aggressor: 0% risk, 100% reward. defender: 100% risk, 0% reward. that sh*t is broken and needs to be fixed.and no, high sec should not be a safe haven. war decs should always exist in some form. but in their current form they're just hilariously broken in favor of the attacker. at the very least this needs to become a 50/50 balance. but realistically the defender needs to have an advantage. wardeccing someone should be an important decision that requires careful consideration. not something you do in freaking bulk with 60 different enemies at a time just so you have something easy to shoot that won't shoot back.saying the current system is 100% not broken is nothing short of complete ignorance."
12/18/2014,"war deccers are not some ""superhuman"" players with access to stuff that no one else has. everyone in the game can use the same stuff, is subject to the same mechanics, and can use all the same tactics whatever their form may be.risk comes from players. be they aggressors or defenders. if you don't provide the risk... you are making the situation favorable to them.it's really that black and white.how is adapting to a situation to better control the conditions you are in ""insane?""that's common sense.now this does not mean you have to ""stop whatever you are doing""... you can continue as you were. but now you have to take precautions and accept that there is a higher level of risk.your comment here says to me that you do not want be forced into any situation you do not like. tough. that is one of the core principles of eve; people can affect you in any way they like for better or worse. it's your job to work around that or push back.so provide the risk.jeeze... you are only as defenseless as you make yourself. and the aggressors actions are only as ""risk free"" as you allow them to be.uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...we pvpers already do this to a certain degree. ships, weapons, equipment, and ammo don't just come out of the sky (well, technically they do). we do need to have an income to pay for our stuff.so in a way... we are already being forced to learn (at least the basics of) of the harvesting, market, industry, and trade.and a lot of us hate every minute of it.i fail to see why ""peaceful people"" should not learn the basics of warfare.this is probably the only thing i will partially agree with you on."
12/18/2014,"1: yeah, those corps that have 60+ wars going at a time are almost exclusively merc corps, who get their wardec bills paid by the clientele. changing the price of wardecs will not effect this in the slightest.2: favorable to both sides? you need to share whatever you're smoking that makes you think this is even possible. if one side of a fight has favorable conditions, then the other side, by default, has unfavorable conditions. in eve, if you're in a fair fight, both you and the other guy screwed up.3: so it's utterly insane to expect you to fly smart? it's utterly insane to not give the wardecers free kills while still keeping an income stream? i think you also forgot that this is game people play for fun, and some people consider it fun to blow up the spaceships of people like you. defender corps only face the risk when they don't fly smart. undocking in lvl 4 mission hubs in blinged out battleships while at war is not flying smart. afk mining at any time is not flying smart. wars are zero risk to a defender who flies smart.4: if an industrial corp had the firepower to enforce a rule like that, i'd say great. of course the pvpers who fly smart will have backup options far away from those industrialists.recap: aggressor: risk based on ability of defender to actually fight back, reward based on ability of defender to fly smart smart defender: couldn't care less about the war, as it doesn't really effect him not smart defender: cries on forums that wardecs are broken and need to be nerfed because he cannot fly smart bottom line, if you fly smart, you can ignore almost every wardec."
12/18/2014,i love how people are arguing that it is essential that eve has risk but they than ignore the fact that awoxing comes with no risk what so ever.
12/18/2014,confirming that there's no way an awoxer could ever end up on the wrong side of a killmail.
12/18/2014,"i don't think it's a bad idea in and of itself; i'm just wondering why you prefer it to better leveraging the tools that are already in the game?i've also wondered about ablative effects, specifically as a way to allow active-tanked ships to be viable in fleets."
12/18/2014,"ok, so my last question went nowhere. let's try this one:what do you think of the direction that ccp rise and his team are investigating for the all-new npe? what can the csm do to support their effort?"
12/18/2014,"i have encouraged ccp to look at other games and perhaps do some major shifting of how the npe is approached. sugar and myself and others are 100% behind improvements both in interest of having better player retention and just making the game learning curve a bit less of a cliff. this is partially why i started operation magic school bus. i am trying to get new players ready for fleets and low/null trips. we need more of this sort of thing, some encouragement for players to, once again, step up and be the content. this means the biggest thing we need to drum into new players is communication skills. how to read, research, use comms and mail and mailing lists. look, the current npe trains the players to mine, to shift a bit of freight, to run missions. is that how you describe eve to people in real life? the disconnect needs to be addressed.i'll toss it back to you, though. which game has the 'best' npe/tutorial, in you opinion? for me it is portal.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/18/2014,do you happen to have a link to something about operation magic school bus?
12/18/2014,"yes, it is....ok, no, not really. but you don't have to convince me that the current npe is absolutely terrible.i'm not much of a gamer, and eve strikes me as different enough that i'm not sure how much eve can learn. i mean, sure, teso has a decent tutorial, including the fact that you can skip the little baby part if you're rolling an alt, but what you have to learn for a mostly themepark game vs. the urgent problem in eve, which is giving new players the ability to reach other people and plug into whatever the meta is.the 'basic controls in the game' part is easy, although the current tutorial manages to do even that wrong."
12/18/2014,"i to will be voting for you again mike, you are by far one of the most publicly active members of the csm next to xander.~~~~question time~~~~i know some and maybe all of this may fall under the nda so don't feel bad if you have to give ""general"" answers.ive heard the guys on the podside podcast mention this to you several times but i absolutely love the idea of station services in npc null to be attackable. this happens to us in sov null from time to time and if i recall correctly you your self mentioned ( i cant recall your exact words) that you saw npc null as a way to get used to the mechanics of sov null and the tactics used there. as it stands now npc dwellers don't have to deal with the defensive side of sov warfare. now im not saying we should be able to flip stations just incapacitate there station services the same way its done to us. with the difference being the npc station services will eventually repair them selves just at a slow rate or they can form a rep op the fix there services faster. what is your though on something like this.agents....why cant we have some in sov null? there everywhere else but sov null and w space, why cant we have some sort of station upgrade for agents. it would be very helpful for the newer players that move straight to null to have access to mission agents. another station question the different station upgrades that can be installed and as far as i know can not be removed unlike ihubs. ihubs can have the different upgrades removed they are just destroyed like ship rigs. i think the station upgrades should be able to be fully customizable not a one time deal.im fairly sure this is in the pipe line but ill ask it anyway, the current balance or unbalance as it is of the low end ores in null sec is an issue. if ccp wants sov null to be eventually be self sufficient, as is my tin foil hatery from phoebe with the introduction of space aids, the minerals need to be rebalanced. im just curious as to how you stand on this as a high sec indy guy since right now we still, myself included, do the majority of our shopping in jita 4-4. let me know your thoughts and ideasalso where do we sign to get you a permanent seat on the csm"
12/18/2014,"i agree with most of that analysis, except this.the average is meaningless when there are 10-100 fold variations.you only need a 10 bil gank and you are set for the week and a 50 bil gank buys a plex for everyone involved. so why do you even consider the average case ? are you saying there isn't even one of these per month ? you also did not address the risk factor. ship scanners allow you to make exact caculation of how much it cost to gank a ship and within good margin how much it will drop. you can see the antigank fleet in local. either the ag fleet is big enough to stop the gank (which only cost potential profit, not inuring a loss), or the ag fleet is not big enough to stop the gank (and can only incur a cost increase, but not a loss), what actual risk is there to ganking ?"
12/18/2014,"only a 50bil gank? well, those occur practically every day."
12/18/2014,you seem really hung up on how much an activity can make. are you equally concerned that one can make billions of isk/day market trading?zkillboard seems a little wonky but you can see here how many 50b isk ganks there actually are:
12/18/2014,"that you will lose your ship (it being a certainty doesn't stop it being a risk), that the loot fairy will stick two fingers up at you, that you get a great loot drop but someone else nicks it, that the gank will fail. those are just off the top of my head. i'm sure there are a few more."
12/18/2014,"risk, it doesn't mean what you think it means.risk is the uncertainty about a net loss. there is no risk if you know your ship loss will be covered by the the loot dropped.since there is cargo scanner and you know approximately half the stuff will get dropped, your can gank only targets that carries many times more than the ships are worth (not hard, considering the ships are about 100mil for 20, and freighters tend to carry a billion or more). iosses are extremely unlikely without ag intervention.now if freighters are immune to cargo and ship scanners, you'd be right."
12/18/2014,you are trying to establish that ganking is risk free?
12/18/2014,"a gank ship is ammunition, albeit more expensive ammunition than most. a careful ganker can mitigate their risk to just losing their ammunition without losing their pod and can attack only targets that will probably offer a profit.you know who else does this? mission runners. they select missions that look profitable, skip ones that don't suit them, and use ammunition (including drones) but manage to mitigate risk to a point where losing more than ammunition is exceedingly rare.i know that because i used to be one (and actually i run missions more than anyone might suspect as i always seek to keep my security status high)."
12/18/2014,what do you think of the direction that ccp rise and his team are investigating in order to overhaul the npe? what could the csm do to help?
12/18/2014,"let me first describe my experience with pve, then describe how it informs my viewpoints.my personal primary income source is alliance srp, which is primarily funded by hunting and killing hostile ratters. my secondary income sources are selling plex and running combat signatures. i do not personally do any ratting in anoms. i do try to help the newbies in my alliance establish their own income streams commensurate with their interests, and see secondhand many of the struggles that they have with finding profitable and useful pve to do in nullsec. i spent a week grinding l3 missions in highsec in order to run quafe l4 missions in syndicate as my income source when my alliance deployed there.in the interest of being transparent and not doubletalky catering to everyone: if you make your money through highsec incursions, i want to nerf your income stream, because it's bad for game balance. it's highly repetitive gameplay that requires little attention, and is nearly risk-free unless you're being stupid. it is a hugely unbalancing force that causes people to have incursion alts running on a second screen that they make their real money with grinding in order to fund their other activities, rather than being vulnerable targets in space for me to hunt/harass. i've done incursions a few times to see what the fuss was all about and left very unimpressed. i've been happy with lowsec incursions because of the potential to interact -- to outright kill fleets running them and have a brawl rather than just plink away at the same thing for hours and end.overall, my high-level goals are to push ccp to get people into space and interacting with each other, with reward commensurate to risk and balanced across all classes of space. however, similar to how i answered the lowsec question, if your question is specifically about the ins and outs of l4 missioning in highsec, i am not going to be the best person to address that need. having a balanced csm of people from all areas of the game is important.specifically addressing your question about the pve being boring - more randomness in spawns would certainly help to some degree of not making every anom exactly the same, but let's be realistic: ccp currently does not have the tooling or personnel to handle both doing ambitious other projects and also getting into the content mill grind of an absolute shitton of level design. look at wow. look at how little time (order of a month or two) it takes for players to 'finish' grinding what takes multiple developer-years of effort to create. eve's content is other players first and foremost, and developer effort to encourage player interaction scales into far more distinct possibilities for player enjoyment rather than ccp focusing on simply making the risk-free content less dull. take the risk-freeness out of things, and you will tend towards a much more compelling universe without having ccp permanently stepping onto the level design treadmill.obviously, fw button orbiting mechanics are a counterexample to my point about adding risk solving problems - there still has to be something to keep you occupied while you're waiting for a fight, other than just sitting there. but to some degree i think that's already the case with anom ratting at least - triggers to think about, managing drones/guns/etc. (unless you're doing afktar ratting, but that's a whole other bucket of worms.)this post has gone on long enough, and i'm sure it'll spawn a new wave of questions, so rather than try to preempt what people are going to ask, i'll take followups."

12/19/2014,"perfectly sums up the purpose of a request for change...the response that those 60 corporations are as a result of mercenary contracts is pure fiction..the majority have been declared to give the mercs something to do while waiting for a genuine contract ...if we want to start ripping the eula for support for any argument ""you may not do anything that interferes with the ability of other eve online subscribers to enjoy the game or web site in accordance with its rules. this includes, but is not limited to, making inappropriate use of any public channels within the game and/or intentionally creating excessive latency (lag) by dumping cargo containers, corpses or other items in the game world.""by utilising the current war declaration scheme a number of my members are unable to enjoy the game for a significant amount of the year. yes they could leave the corporation (some do and then come back) they are still not enjoying the game as theyre in an npc corp not the one they want to be in.again...there's a need for war mechanics , pvpers need a means to permit then to shoot people in the face..there needs to be consequences on both sides ie you get war dec'd then respond as you see fit....move. dock up..fight ...the issue is the ability to spam war decs to cast a wide net means most small corporations and alliances are permanently at war with no consequences for the aggressor other than a token isk fee. high sec should never be safe ....as shahfluffers stated high-sec was meant to be ""relatively safer"" compared to low-sec... which is ""relatively safer"" than null-sec... which is ""relatively safer"" than wormhole space.when your at war 90% of the time based in high sec then that relationship with security status doesn't mean anything"

12/19/2014,"okay this one first, it is a cool idea but the sov free areas are used by a lot of sov folks because of the safety. a place where you can put your stuff that will still be there tomorrow. you know that the null entities would enjoy making life hell for their less committed brethren in npc stations. so is there a balance? maybe not kill the services but hinder them or make them scale up in expense. a price of battle and failure to consider where you are, your home.moon mining, why can't we have that in highsec? some things are the difference between one space and another. there are supposed to be differences between parts of space to give us a reason to make choices and not all of the choices should point to null being the end game where everything evrybody else has can be found there, as well. i know some folks think each part of space should be self sufficient unto itself. i am sure if i looked hard enough i could find someone demanding that sleeper loot become atainable without all the hassle of wormhole life.out of curiosity, though. are all the belts in null mined out? is it that you lack the minerals or people willing to mine them?mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/19/2014,"ii will not vote for you. you represent everything i hate. under a pretext of roleplay, your gang of ganker (code) try to apply mafia techniques to take the property of others players in highsec (and often are young players with not a lot of isk). in addition, you (code) try to implanting to all the players in highsec the mafia ""pizzo"".i hope that ccp will adjust the highsec security to make this place more safer for new player. because ccp lose a lot of subscription to the game because your cowards technic discourage new players.remember, animal and humans learn through play. it's important to learn good human values and it's not what you do. you are about to rot this game with your so called ""code roleplaying"" ganking. it's just a mafia technic! for looser.your ""code"" exceed the limit, and it is not fun for the player to be harassed every day."
12/19/2014,"everything we do is within the rules and is as much part of the game as mission running or atk mining. a safer high sec won't do anything for new players, btw, it'll just mean more of them will have officer-fit pimpmobiles before they finally get blown up."
12/19/2014,"new players are completely safe from hostile player interactions in the rookie systems and i would never encourage ccp to change this fact. in fact, i'm in favor of ccp increasing protection from player interaction in those systems by disallowing the use of strip miners so that rookies can always find asteroids for their mining tutorials.it's the not-so-new players that grind out extreme wealth in near total safety in the rest of highsec by doing things rookies cannot do - strip mine asteroids in orca fleets, blitz l4 missions and multibox incursions - that make code. necessary."
12/19/2014,"by that definition there is zero risk in mining or missioning as every cost is known for mining (i think just t2 mining crystals) and every mission and the triggers are available on community website removing all surprises. certainly you are not arguing that ganking is somehow less risky than mining or mission running?but again you mis-perceive the role of the risk here. it is there to provide incentive for players to balance the yield/cargo of their ship with protection when fitting a ship. ganking is not there necessarily as a mini-game in-and-of itself. plenty of tools exist to make yourself 99.999% immune from gankers (certain ships, modules, behaviours) - they just all require a direct tradeoff against yield or some additional effort. that is just how the game is designed. making freighters immune to scanning is a poor choice as it would diminish the purpose of ganking in the game - to provide risk to players overloading and overfitting their ships. if pirates could not look inside, they would have to just destroy ships blindly and there would be no incentive for the haulers to carry less as the risk of loss would be the same no matter what they carried.besides, what you suggest is already in the game - blockade runners are immune to cargo scans. if you have something valuable to transport you want to remain unscanned, you can use one of them. if you want to inject uncertainty into ganking i would suggest looking at varying the predictable concord mechanics or through new modules that can provide false information to gankers."
12/19/2014,"you do know, that each csm x candidates thread is for people to ask them questions and have the candidate answer right?i didn't in any way want his or her internet space lawyer to go answering questions. so either you're yourself a candidate for csm x (which invalidates sabriz's candidacy due to incompetency) or you've overstepped your boundaries. please decide which and let us know."
12/19/2014,"i'm fine with other people answering questions directed at me. if i strongly disagree with them, or even if i agree but want to raise a particular nuance, i'll do so.my opinions on what would be good for eve are heavily influenced (but not determined) by james 315, psychotic monk and several other people. others with the same influences will often (not always) have similar opinions to me.this thread is a conversation as well as a q&a.also sylphy - not sure if you saw it, but i'm running a q&a at 2300 eve time saturday of this week on the minerbumping teamspeak. hostile questions are welcome, and if you aren't willing to be recorded, you are more than welcome to ask them anonymously."
12/19/2014,"hey sabriz,first i would like to wish you good luck with your candidancy, if i may ask you a serious question which if possible i would like to be considered in the ""outside of game manner"".i consider the current content of code in high sec and the effect it is creating in particular the anti gank group to be some of the best player driven content i have ever experienced, whether this is intended or a side effect i am not sure. i only have one serious concern and would appreciate your view;due to the nature of the miner gank it naturally targets young players trying to make the initial start up isk which could then project them into more costly gameplay (pvp or pve), are you not concerned that we as a community of eve players could lose newer guys due to this? during that initial period of joining its hard to make reasonable isk and as we all know survival is skill point dependant. out of game head please"
12/19/2014,"i apologize that i have upset you by pointing out the flaws in your proposed changes to game mechanics, but i have been very careful not to answer any questions directed at sabriz. in fact, you haven't really asked any direct questions at all. i encourage you if you do have some questions for sabriz you ask him directly in this thread or during his upcoming teamspeak session."
12/19/2014,"genuinely very new players are insulated from this, as the most expensive dedicated mining ship available to the less than one week old character is the venture. whenever i've popped one of those and discovered the person is brand new (usually discovered after the fact), i usually advise them that they can replace their venture by running a different training agent's missions. i advise other gankers to do the same - the loss still matters but isn't crippling.moderately new players (7-28 days) can fly a retriever or covetor if they desire, but generally in my experience they are more dilligent in it than most longer term players are, and thus more likely to escape a gank attempt. if they aren't - it's an easier loss to bear than a level 3 mission runner losing a battlecruiser to rats is.mackinaws, hulks, orcas and skiffs cannot be flown by new players due to extensive skill prereqs."
12/19/2014,"sure it does, it makes it a cost, not a risk.the risks in missioning or mining are things such as the risk of getting blown up while attempting to accomplish said task. the same exists in ganking. the difference is that if you lose a non-blinged mission fit battleship, it might take 10-20 missions to recover that loss. with gankers, the cost is considerably lower and the rewards considerably higher, so if the gank fails, chances are the next one will recover that lost and still be highly profitable. in addition, it's incredibly easy to ruin a mission for someone. jumping in and nuking the triggers for example will often overwhelm a player, stealing mission critical loot or ganking the player also disrupts this. with ganking it's not so simple. pretty much the only effective way to disrupt a ganker is ecm, and even then you'd generally need to be on grid with the target beforehand, meaning the ganker can just pick a new target, and you'd need to blind luck your way to actually locking and landing an ecm hit on them. code members laugh at the ""white knights"" all the time at how futile it is to try to stop a gank.so yes, ganking is considerably less risky than mining.except that also needs to be balanced against the cost of ganking the ship. as it stands ganking is cheap and has no real consequence, as a ganker can simply use alts to do anything he can't do on the ganker, thus things like bounties, killrights and sec status are irrelevant. a ganker flying around in a cheap disposable ship with an empty pod is hardly going to care if people around him can kill him.that's not ""the"" purpose of ganking. that's your purpose. ganking is simply there so people can blow people up if they like. their motivations for doing so are not part of the design.agreed that concord mechanics been less predictable would be beneficial. i'd certainly consider looking into adding more consequences to ganking however. sec status should make it more difficult to freely roam around highsec, and the ability to reverse your sec status should be considerably harder too. personally i'd look at killsrights as well. extending their duration and adding that they don't expire after one kill of any value, but instead expire once the amount of isk damage has been done equal the the amount they caused getting the killright, which would stop people being able to cheaply dump killrights with an alt."
12/19/2014,"""just because"" isn't really a reason. ccp falcon (and other developers for that matter) has made it quite clear that there is suppose to be risk in highsec: and: he is explicitly saying that that suicide ganking is in the game so you, the player, have to make some tradeoffs. you are responsible for not making yourself a target by overloading; you have to balance yield and tank; you have to remain at the keyboard; you have to bring escorts.suicide ganking is in the game to force these choices on players because presumably ccp thinks this makes the game more interesting, and that this is good for the game. if they did not think it good for the game, then some developer has been extremely negligent for not fixing the problem during the last 11 years."
12/19/2014,"no he's not. he's congratulating emergent gameplay and stating that concord are a reactive not a preventative force. at no point have i seen ccp state that ganking is possible so a group of idiots can fly around making sure noone carries too much and trolling. i didn't say it wasn't good for the game either. i simply said that what code say is the reason for ganking isn't the reason it's actually possible, that the balance between cost, risk and reward needs to be seriously looked at and that there's very little in the way of consequences for gankers, which is weird in a game where your actions supposedly have consequences."
12/19/2014,"well you're welcome to believe what you like but that is not what he is doing. he, that is ccp falcon the lead community manager for eve, is responding to the concerns of the community about sucide ganking by telling them that suicide ganking is an intended part of the game and they are responsible for their own security in highsec (including not carrying too much cargo - or ""a sizable chunk of isk"" in his words). i don't know how much clearer he could be that suicide ganking is in the game design from the beginning and what the developers expect the players to do to deal with it."
12/19/2014,"re-post from page 5:how do you feel about making a wardec's cost based on the number of people in both corporations? i.e. the more people involved, the more expensive it is in total, but the less expensive it is per person?also, i heard you speaking about ensuring there is a significant amount of pvp and player ship destruction in areas with nontrivial resources. how do you feel about the idea of taking nontrivial resources out of upper-highsec and allowing suitable protections? it gives people a place to rest briefly, or new players more room to get used to the game."
12/19/2014,"i like the idea presented of a more interactive interface that responds to what the player is doing instead of spoon-feeding them content. it is more adaptable and it puts a new player into an inquisitive mode where they get responses for their curiosity.currently, the npe is funneling our players into structured content. it makes sense until you remember that we are playing eve and the game does not feed us content but we must go and find it. that means expectations are created that have to be corrected later.i think the goal of introducing the new player to eve in a grander scale is a good one. being involved in helping new players as a csm member allows me to gather and condense common problems, questions, interests, and concerns for ccp to use to help focus their development. a csm member involved with new players can share what they are experiencing helping new players with their game. the new players experience is different from a veteran player and we cannot structure all of the new player experience on the known player<U+FFFD>s knowledge. we miss small, obvious things because we are used to them.then as ccp develops a new player experience or tweaks their new player experience the early csm interaction helps get things on the proper path. the recent graph showing the real average age of eve players has also said to me that if we approach this seriously, we<U+FFFD>d get some type of adult education foundations worked into whatever our new tutorial system is. we<U+FFFD>d use what we gather from the players, see in rookie chat, and know are hurdles that have existed for years, and use modern tools to propose change and direction alongside of ccp<U+FFFD>s grand scope of project."
12/19/2014,well hello there!my name is lanctharus onzo and i am one of the co-host and writers of the cap stable podcast.in early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10.here is our announcement:
12/19/2014,"compare and contrast <U+FFFD> the astero vs the garmur.the astero is probably one of the best ships that has been released in recent history. it is versatile, multipurpose, and has fits and uses that augment almost anyone's play-style. much the same can be said about its bigger sister, the stratios. it can solo, it can explore, it can blops, it can even rat. even though the game ill-needed yet another drone-boat, the rest of the package literally redeemed it's reliance on the overplayed weapon system that is drones into something new and minty-fresh.the garmur, while undoubtedly one of the most powerful ships released in recent history, is another beast entirely. its sleek design is as sharp and focused as its purpose. existing as either long range tackle or 'solo' and plaguing faction warfare as an un-engageable target, speed and scram/point range are the only things on its resume. while every ship isn't supposed to have a diverse fitting profile, the single-mindedness of combining point range and speed into new ship when kiting is already king leaves a bit of a sour taste. while really cool, the current meta neither wants nor needs more ships like this.basically, the sisters ships increased diversity; the mordu's ships just encapsulated everything that was overplayed by current field: omen navy issues, ishtars, mass medium rails, etc, fast sniping stuff. so this is where i stand on ship balance:->brawling needs some love. kiting setups are used almost exclusively to brawling set ups in many areas of the game. i do not hate kiting at all, just that too much of any one style is stagnation.->battlecruisers basically went the way of the dinosaur once the patch-day meteor hit. previously they were a great balance point between size, sp requirements, cost, and performance, giving people something to fly that was just rite-sized for some fun. scientists still debate if it was just the warp-speed changes alone which caused their extinction, with some pointing instead to other causes, such as their performance versus other ship classes, and their hulking mass which left them awkward at chasing the new preponderance of smaller prey items. dumb metaphor aside, battlecruisers and battleships need some love and adjustment. the nestor and the barghest are almost never used, whereas the frigate and the cruiser in their respective lineups are some of the most popular ships <U+FFFD> when you cannot get people excited about a new battleship, maybe it tells you something about how battleships/battlecruisers in general are suffering. you are never going to see battleships outside of larger fights regularly until there is a need for them, and there will never be a need for lumbering, awkward giants so long as the only ships worth flying are small, fast, and kiting ships. while in general i think its cool that the warp-speed changes brought some diversity, they did so at the cost of wiping out entirely the age of the battlecruiser. it is a sad day."
12/19/2014,"piracy, ganking, and hisec. in an ideal world, there would be few pirates in hi sec, as there would not be much worth pirating in hi sec; they have chased the content to other security bands. however, i don't believe that is libel to happen any time soon. hisec is too safe, and people determined to create content there have too few options; suicide ganking itself has about as much game play depth as video games in 1980. that's not to say it isn't fun, just one dimensional. so how bout we do a thought experiment?imagine if there weren't hi sec incursions. however, they have been replaced by something else: pirate faction ess. you would purchase these from pirate faction lp stores, and anchor them in hi security space. once anchored, any capsuleer could spend 10 minutes in contact with the ess to get the following effects:-immunity to concord/gate guns <U+FFFD> the capsuleer's ship is now masked as a serpentis/gurista/sansha ship. the pilots name is replaced with 'rogue serpentis capsuleer', etc.-anyone may freely engage the capsuleer's ship and is awarded isk and concord lp for its destruction.-if the ess is destroyed, all ships that used it to go 'red' are immediately concord'ed. boom. the ess is plainly warpable from anywhere in the system.-like cynos or incursions, it's plainly evident on the map one of these has been anchored. it is a loopy idea. perhaps too loopy, but it actually is a content seed. instead of just hurdling catalysts at things which is incredibly one dimensional, there would actually be a risk/reward paradigm; do you want to actually try to fight, defend, and control a system, or do you just want to use a boring tactic? traditional suicide ganking would be in no way changed.for example, imagine a typical saturday morning. incursion groups begin to undock, preparing to do the same dance with sansha they always do. ganking groups likewise prepare for the herd of freighters to march down the pipes between the major hi sec hubs. the former shoots red crosses, the latter essentially is fighting against white crosses shooting them too quickly. boring. where, pray tell, is the player conflict?now, imagine a world where some nefarious group has the audacity to put a pirate faction ess in uedama, or nijara? incursion group has content, the ganking group has content, neither of it is against npc crosses of any color. that's winning in my book. wrecks for the wreck god."

12/19/2014,response sent to email. ill make my schedule work
12/19/2014,"i am concerned that the recent change in corp invite mechanics, coupled with the proposed changes in intracorp aggression mechanics will result in more players ending up in terrible, or even exploitative, highsec corporations as their first corp. these changes will allow bad and nefarious ceos to sit in starter systems and spam invites at new players as a way to make money at the cost that a new players initial experience with eve may be more frustrating in a small, highsec corp that is unable or unwilling to support them. in the end, these poor corporations may cause many players to quit eve. what do you think specifically can be done to get new players into good corporations that can teach and support them properly, not only in highsec, but in the other spaces? further, do you agree with the proposed changes to intracorp agression in highsec (csm summer minutes pg 78) which will remove one of the few risks to the ""farming"" of new players through recruitment into exploitative highsec corps?"
12/19/2014,that is a good question. the previous game mechanic had the same strategy go to a starting system spam the corp ad. but the new invite system definitely has a new level of issues. most good corps run api verification even on new bros spam recruitment without process can and probably will cause more problems for the ceo than anything else. i do think adding a control for access to new player friendly as a tag on the corp ad might be a good idea. ethically i don't know that anything can be done without not teaching people the level of harshness this game can lay on them at times. however i do think that the current system for searching corp ads needs a revamp. i would also consider floating the idea of adding a search for a corporation into the tutorial to try and get people out into the player run corps.

12/19/2014,"so i'm going to run. at the encouragement of few but i think it's a good idea. i've been playing just over a year and spent all but a month in null sec. i have a broad exposure to various things in the game but i still remember my new player experience. i'm definitely not a bitter vet by any stretch.so the csm is often made up of veteran players and those who are relatively prominent in the public eye. i'm not really that guy. i haven't been endorsed by any coalition or corp or large group in any way. i love this game and it's still so much fun. i'd like to represent the every man of eve and the relatively new players. i think with some new perspective and fresh eyes eve can be even more awesome than it already is with some creative fresh blood in the mix.feel free to evemail me on this character and ask me any questions you may have. suzy for csm!now proud to announce a partnership!!!suzy rc mudstone will be running together with chance ravinne aka wingspan tt. basically chance and i used to fly together shortly after we both started playing eve. have had good times and have a generally similar outlook on the game. hillarity, fun and overall shenanigans are what eve is all about. embrace laughing while playing eve."

12/19/2014,it's happeningit's happening
12/19/2014,yay!
12/19/2014,"one small step for man one giant leap for eve-kind!!!good luck suzy, you know you will always have my vote.lesrip booboo 26/7/1971 - 23/7/2014 my lady my love my life my wife"
12/19/2014,you get all 43 my votes!
12/19/2014,oh ya!
12/19/2014,that is a crap ton of votes! rock!
12/19/2014,"ok, i have no clue what you represent so i will just throw out a random question.many say that eve is built on the idea of risk vs. reward. do you agree with this, and if so, what do you think is the most pressing issue facing the game from this view. what is the biggest current problem resulting from an imbalance of risk vs. reward, and what would you suggest to fix it?"
12/19/2014,"that's a nice tryhard politics type of question, but this isn't about that. in fact it's the opposite. i thought that was obvious.here's what i think suzy is good for. breaking things down like i'm five, and if you can't do that, you probably don't understand it well enough. what suzy needs to do is keep an inquisitive attitude and hear people out when they want to communicate.it's fresh and not a gimmick. you, me, and everyone else qualified to answer your question thoroughly is already experience-heavy, and probably too opinionated to reach an honest conclusion.suzy is sacrificing their love of eve for the good of us all. i think it's something we need, and that's why i'm voting un-ironically.you'd be planting a rookie into csm discussions, which is otherwise impossible due to nda.ask suzy what their personal and education background is. you'll be impressed."
12/19/2014,"in response let me offer a bit of clarification hopefully. i have in no way been hardened or corrupted by this game. i honestly wish that we had a better retention rate for newer players. not because i'm some new bro sympathizer but because more players is more things to shoot at or with. that will always be a good thing.people argue that ccp need to ""fix"" the game before devoting resources to other things. the game isn't broken. it's brilliant fun. there are some mechanics that need repair or rebuild as anything aging will need from time to time. poses (in the pipe), corp managment (in the pipe). the tutorial missions. they get minor little barely improvements.most players don't even remember when they ran theirs. others just don't care because the community will scoop up these players and push them down one path or another. i tend not to refer to this as the ""new player experience"" because it's not an experience. it isn't epic. it should be. the tutorial missions should introduce mechanics in a story/lore driven way. make it an exciting introduction to this world we call eve. then they get plopped into the main shard in their starter system.here's the absolute of my campaign. eek this almost sounds like serious space business... :( the csm is meant to represent the everyone of eve. sure every one on these panels has their own interests and passions. the diversity in those is important. representing the players of the game is just as important. not just the space celebrities and those that are in leadership positions but everyone. no i can't talk to everyone but i do try to talk to anyone who will talk to me. ask anyone who's interacted with me... i love to talk to people friends and space enemies alike."
12/19/2014,boosh. putting the quote at the end of the post... that's what fresh feels like. sorry suzy i'm trying really hard to be quiet but this thread is just way too awesome. (sorry)
12/19/2014,that better? haha it's like i almost know what i'm doing.no worries. but i need to be exposed to the more traditional questions because i kind of do need to answer them. if i'm going to represent the playersi have to be willing to interact with anyone and answer questions and i will as best i can.
12/19/2014,"i love your enthusiasm, and i've always been happy to support new players running for csm.have you seen this presentation on the direction that ccp is investigating for a completely different new player experience? it seems somewhat different from your idea, though the two could go together. thoughts?(as i've said in other candidate threads, i'm less interested in getting ~answers~ and more interested in seeing how people think.)"
12/19/2014,i think it can go hand and hand and it was mentioned they are looking at how to motivate and reward. i think that a narrative based coupling with all the tooltips and popups would be great. concern would be with streamlining the popups and tool tips so we aren't doing internet in 1996
12/19/2014,"now that the eve universe is a lot bigger than it was a few weeks ago, how has the hauling experience changed?what things are better? what things are worse?what are other haulers telling you?"
12/19/2014,
12/19/2014,
12/19/2014,
12/20/2014,"being blown up, war decced, or ""interfered with"" has never been a eula violation by itself.in fact.... all those things are ""design"" principles that ccp follows.""players are not entitled to success. the most aspirational goals are coveted by many but reached by few.""~ balancing tears with laughter presentation, fanfest 2013the only way the eula comes into play with regards to ""not enjoying the game"" is when players are being singled out over an extended course of time despite their ""best efforts"" to counter, fight back, or avoid it... for no reason.again... even us pvpers have to make decisions and perform actions that we do not enjoy. nope. it still does mean something. in high-sec you can be at war... but you are only at war with a small segment of the total population there. if hostiles are not around... you are ""safe.""compare this to low-sec, null-sec, and w-space... you are effectively ""at war"" with anyone and everyone who is in your system. at all times. and you don't get a warning from concord when they come gunning for you.ergo... high-sec is ""safer"" than low-sec (much more so in fact)."
12/20/2014,"look, if people really wanted to pvp, they'd go do faction warfare, or nullsec blobbing, or roam whspace. what this thread is talking about being an issue is the ability to buy a permit to take a crap [read: 'declaring war on'] on mission runners/industrialists.its not fighting, its like a boxer in a bout with a 12 year old, or usain bolt racing in the paralympics, and then arguing that this competition is fair. there is no contest in these wars. the wardeccers are then claiming that the industrialists/pvers can fight back, much the same way that a paralympian can beat usain bolt....."
12/20/2014,"here is a rehash of my original argument...you claim that pveers, miners, and industrialists can't fight. nor do they want to fight. fine. they should then find someone else who can fight for them.because the reverse of this is also true.most pvpers and combat pilots can't harvest, build, or trade to save their lives. nor do they want to do those things. so they find people to do it for them.you claim that it isn't fair for a 12-year-old to fight a boxer. well... why is the child fighting in the first place? - he/she should use his/her small stature (and superior agility) to slip away from danger. - he/she can hide. - he/she can then hire a guy named lenny. lenny is a hulking mass of man. lenny doesn't need to be paid for service rendered. lenny is instead filled satisfaction and joy when smashing someone worthy of being smashed.- in the event that lenny cannot be relied upon... the 12-year-old can gather up all of his/her friends and arm them with sand (see: ecm, sensor dampender, energy neutralizers, tracking disruptors). lots of sand (have you ever seen a fleet of griffins?). which they will throw in the boxer's eyes. repeatedly. you claim it isn't fair for the fastest man alive to race against cripples. why are the cripples playing ""fair?"" if i was them, i would throw nails all across the track. or fire tear gas.or... better yet... make it so the man has to pay through the nose to get his shoes, pants, shirt, and anything else he needs.market warfare is a pita for people with a poor mind for numbers."
12/20/2014,"its not like there is a way for anyone to force pvpers to engage in these activities, there is no way that your gameplay can be disrupted, market pvp does not work, as there is not one system or entity comprising the market.pvpers however, can very easily disrupt the gameplay of industrialists.i get my fair share of pvp, but i don't shoot miners, back in the day i did my fair share of mining and stuff too.i've done highsec wars, and actually enjoyed them, because the fights were reasonably fair, i was fighting people who actually wanted to pvp.in reference to op; spamming wars on 60+ corps is hardly pvp, its buying targets to shoot, who statistically wont shoot back."
12/20/2014,"the game organically does this (force pvpers to do something other than ship-on-ship combat).ships, mods, and ammo are not free.ergo... a pvper either has the learn the fundamentals of pve, industry, trading, and the market... or get someone else to do all that for him/her.you know how code has to band/organize together to take down large or multiple targets? yeah..."
12/20/2014,"not if the industrialist is smart, they can't.i've served my time as an industrialist along with running missions (yay for alts). i lost a hulk, once, seven years ago, to suicide gankers. over the next 5 years that i played as an industrialist i didn't lose a single barge, exhumer, or hauler to either suicide gankers or wartargets. at no time did a wardec hamper my ability to make isk.learn to eve, and you'll never worry about wartargets or suicide gankers again."
12/20/2014,"thank you, much appreciated. i think the absorb would be complimentary to other tools. for example, a damp ship could use more damp modules and have less tank knowing that some logi will be absorbing a lot of the damage.the problem with a lot of tools is that you are weighing them off against your tank usually if you are a shield tanked (armour could have a bit more damage and speed). so, a fleet of ravens for the sake of example, would probably only have 1 damp each. now if there were 50 of them + logi and they meet 100 tengus, the damps are pretty useless to them.a) because the tengus can probably fire from range beyond the dampsb) because they only have enough damps for 1/2 of their opposing team.however, say you have blackbirds for some reason in the fleet, they could have in their six mid slots, shield extender, invul, prop mod and three damps. now say you have 10 of them and 40 ravents + logi, that would be 70 damps, far better odds. they black birds could actually surive long enough to do some good.as for active tanking, i had a suggestion thread where the shield amplifier would be able to convert some of the damage energy into shield energy, so the more that are firing on you the more resistance you have. they would need a few very high damage ships to take them out.another option is for the active tankers to be able to store some energy from logi, just buffer up their shields or thicken their armour temporarily.edit: realised something else with the absorb module idea. don't have enough logi or turn it on before others and you could save someone but blow up yourself."
12/20/2014,"without hesitation mike gets my #1 slot on my ballots. what does it for me as far as mike is concerned is the fact that it doesn't matter the issue or the style of eve-play a person has. mike will represent, regardless, if he sees the need to take it up with ccp. go get 'em mike"
12/20/2014,"answering in reverse order.i'm fine with rookie systems as an example of space with no nontrivial resources (except the ability to strip mine in them) and would have no issue with them being expanded to all deadend 1.0 systems. rookie systems presently do provide an opportunity for someone to get back on their feet after a catastrophic loss and a place to learn the game interface, and those are valuable functions of them.with respect to wardec fees, i do not see why larger defender entities should cost more to wardec and propose a shift to a fee that is based upon the size of the aggressor entity (and i proposed a formula - x^0.5 * 10m, where x is the size of the aggressor entity, capped at 2500. the present system encourages people to sign up dozens of trial accounts to pad out the numbers in their corporation, which isn't done much but could be a real nuisance if people start doing it."
12/20/2014,"i love how you keep linking to posts claiming he's saying thing while the post says something else. at no poitn has he stated that the mechanic was designed to restrict the amount of isk a player can load on a ship. all of it irrelevant either way be cause it doesn't change the fact that ganking is too easy, too low cost and without consequence."
12/20/2014,"first of all, big +1 from me just based on your initial few posts.secondly, what in your opinion is the largest issue facing the playerbase today, and how could it be addressed?thirdly, i have reported lucas for his excessive off topic posting."
12/20/2014,"lucas is useful, he keeps bumping the thread so i'd rather he stays here. there are three biggest issues i'd identify, two of which i have ideas of how to fix.firstly, stagnation in sovereign nullsec, which is being addressed fairly effectively right now.secondly, the non-interactive nature of mining.thirdly, the fact that the risk/reward balance of some highsec activities are so off balance that they are killing off other areas of space. i'll cover solutions in more depth in my 'ask me anything' session in 45 minutes."
12/20/2014,"much belated response, now that i have working internet at the same time/place as me having spare time (this week is kind of crazy with holiday-related travel for me):i approve of many things but disapprove of one or two things with rise's direction for the npe. let me start by saying that i'm hugely happy with data-driven approaches using a/b testing and user studies. i very much like the 'new ccp' approach of fairly rapid iteration compared to the ccp of old that released twice a year and stuck to guns when things were going pear-shaped.the aspirations are overall pretty great about players feeling like they know what they are doing, and that they're being pushed towards interacting with others where possible, and i think the tooltips/module renames are definitely great for ""wtf is this fleeting propulsion inhibitor and what does it do?"". however, i'm wary of approaches that rely only upon tooltips for conveying information (for instance, pretty much every single newbie i train still is very confused about the meta/t2 system because it's un-discoverable even with tooltips). it feels like what's important is to be able to provide players the option more information, but only in contexts where it makes sense rather than making it a blocker to 'finding action'. definitely it's a great step that ccp is thinking about making it easier for newbies to find action to get hooked on eve. in general, making the tutorial experience much less linear and more self-directed definitely conveys better what eve is about.on the negative side, however, the work that rise showed didn't appear to actually push newbies into interacting with other players (nor help them find other players that they'd get along with -- although some caution there is merited about putting incompatible people in touch with newbies and trolling them out of the game). perhaps it wasn't feasible in the case of the ux studies that they were conducting because said studies were not on tq - however, getting that piece right i feel is going to need to be an important eve 102 thing once eve 101 is redone in the style rise describes."
12/20/2014,what are your thoughts on the state of small fleet vs large fleet balance? what should ccp do to make small groups viable in low/null?whats your position on multiboxing?
12/20/2014,"there are plenty of things that smaller fleets can do to harass larger fleets, iff they can alpha through the logi reps of the larger fleet. you should know that, having seen pl successfully deploy petes and bombers against hero fleets to score a pile of kills plenty of times. or from the afterlife. harassing the **** out of honor with cerbs then warping any time stuff got too close. any solution along these lines to make smaller fleets better able to harass larger fleets is going to have to rely upon weakening logi by diminishing effects (or just removing broadcasting for reps) -- however, i'm not sold based on what i currently see that large fleets are necessarily overpowered in and of themselves, necessitating that nerf. yes, ishtars online is an annoying balance problem, but i don't think that's intrinsically a problem with the small vs. large meta, it's a problem with the specific ship balance meta.the first question you asked is orthogonal to the latter question:npc null/low: my previous experience with npc null and lowsec says that playing station games is definitely harder for smaller, lower sp groups to avoid getting stamped out. what in the heck do you do when someone has a carrier+bubble camp on your station that you can't hope to break without a pile of caps of your own, and that will deaggress at the first sign of real trouble if you batphone? in lowsec you can instawarp, in npc null you can instawarp with a travel inty, but it's just a way to get out and set up shop somewhere else rather than actually being able to usefully fight back. granted, the cloning changes have helped a lot in that there's now no longer a very fixed and finite number of viable stations to live in, so the scarcity problem of staging systems is less of an issue than it was before in which any new group would find itself contesting oversubscribed cloning bay stations.sovnull: making smaller, less sp-intensive groups viable in null requires more gradations in quality of space, fewer regions like the drone regions and period basis where you *have* to be blue to your neighbors to run logistics, and making it so that it's difficult and undesirable to hold more than one region at a time. the way towards better null balance is having a totem pole, with people with high numbers and skillpoints competing for the most desirable regions, and not interfering with people with low numbers and skillpoints contesting the least valuable regions. the changes to force projection have been good so far, but haven't yet fully solved some of the game balance issues that would allow smaller groups to take sov wholesale.

12/20/2014,"vic jefferson is one of the most supportive individuals of new players i have ever encountered. he has spent countless hours with me talking about skill plans, ship fits, teaching me how to fight, and more recently how to rat. did i mention the ships and isk he sent in support of these efforts?he has lived in npc null for a very long time, and still spends significant time in syndicate (when not welping ratting carriers in gw space). he knows this area of space is important for the game, for transitioning characters and corporations out of lowsec and into null. he also has knowledge of other details of the game as a long time player. as a new player who has spent most of his time in npc null i have no reservation in endorsing his candidacy."
12/20/2014,"will you provide a voice for the voiceless in new eden? will you smack talk reds in every system you find them in, and call them 'bitches'?!"
12/20/2014,that's kind of my ultimate goal. i think there's a lot of concerns that people have that are going unnoticed because they are being talked over because they don't have much voice muscle in the universe. i think that identifying and addressing some of those would be beneficial to everyone at all levels of play.also a little bit of smack talk in jest is always good. though sometimes individuals and groups get a bit carried away i think it goes along with the theme of eve being a bit harsh and lawless.to those abusing reporting mechanics with the sole intention of getting people banned i'd suggest they watch this video on ccp's youtube channel.

12/21/2014,"whats your thoughts on fighter assign.i both small scale a couple supers assigning fighters to fight roaming gangs. and on large scale say assiging hundreds of fighters to a fleet to massively increase its dps, and also to big interceptor fleets to kill structures (in all cases with tiny risk to the super caps themselves)"
12/21/2014,"i feel that assigning fighters is a bit to powerful because you can simply slow boat inside of the pos shields with your (super)carrier, and you are safe. the only thing that you might risk is your fighters, which if would cost you around 200mil if you lose all 10 of them. therefore, i don't agree with the fact that (super) carriers should be able to assign fighters to people off grid.i don't think removing the ability to assign is the only right option so i came up with some other possible solutions:1) lowering tracking of supercarrier fighters because they are way to powerful, especially when compared to all other capital. example: a titan has 0% chance of surviving when he gets pointed down while a super can just launch his fighters and clear hics/dics without a problem, bit strange, yeah i think so! lowering their tracking will also result in less usage.2) make it so that fighters are affected by warp bubbles, just like normal ships. doing this would make it riskier for super capital pilots to use these tactic's and opponents will have a better chance at eliminating the fighter thread."

12/21/2014,"the last thing you need is more unmined belts and afk ratting in null. it is not surprising that your candidacy comes with an obvious alliance-centric agenda.i agree with you that hisec is bloated. the bloat from hisec should be used to enrich lowsec, and lowsec only."
12/21/2014,"the point is more about what all skill point levels can do for isk. as someone who basically ""grew up"" in null, i can tell you that there is really very little to do there as a newbie for cash. mining comes with rats you can't kill at early sp levels. anoms are out of the question until you are into a vni at a minimum. exploration is mixed, and the isk/effort not really spectacular. i made my most isk by finding ded complexes for bitter vets to run--fortunately in my corp folks like vic cut the newbie who finds a site in for a full share of the proceeds."
12/21/2014,"there's plenty of rocks in null. i've mined it when i was a blood miner in brave. there are also plenty of people in frigates and dessies for newbies to go roaming against to destroy, loot, and salvage.how do people make isk with low skill points in highsec? simple. they mine rocks, or they resort to piracy. explo sites with low sp requirements don't earn anyone any money (certainly not in hisec), not without spending more time than you need to. station trading isn't really under ccp control. trade hubs go where people go and the holy trinity is it.i flew and died in brave when an srp program wasn't in place, so pardon me if i'm failing to understand.. explain the need for newbros in a 150% srp alliance to line their wallets with cash. the point of surviving in null is working with the bittervets to earn isk and survive in fleets. it would be hilarious for you to suggest otherwise for wh.you are confused if you think low sp players are raking in hundreds of millions in hisec. i fail to see what exact changes you are suggesting are made to introduce this possibility in null. do you mean move some low isk explo and ded sites into null? why don't you set up a short wh hop into hisec for your newbros instead? seems like a much better solution to me, and one that already exists in the game.when i'm talking about gutting hisec, i mean moving isk opportunities for mid- to high-sp players out of hisec into low. these opportunities should never be moved into bluesec, unless we really are interested in destroying eve.edit: and why wouldn't your newbros doing industry and pi?"
12/21/2014,"answering for myself, because they are boring, require a stack of isk and sps better spent elsewhere in null at the start, and require a whole lot more knowledge and experience than a real new player has. (also, my alliance doesn't have srp)eta: and even if mining, pi and industry didn't somehow bore the new player to unsubbing, with the changes to jfs success at these professions requires a thriving local market, which in at least my area of npc null just doesn't exist because its so sparsely populated. which gets us back to the op. granted that i assume that most people are in the isk generating grind to buy ships to get blown up, because we all want to be bad ass space pilots shooting other nerds and laughing about it in locali agree with your other point though that there has to be incentive for players to leave highsec, and i think vic's idea is a good way to do it."
12/21/2014,"i approve of vic jefferson's message and for csm, and you should too. i've tried to play eve for years: i signed up in 2008, i resubbed in 2009 and in 2011, and finally go dragged back in by droog recently. those first three times i came in alone, in high-sec, and quit within a few weeks. for many a new player, sitting in front of space rocks for a few space dollars is boring. thrashing waves of easy npcs for a few more space dollars lacks challenge and isn't why we get into the game. we want to be space manfred von richthofen, we want to go down in glory, guns blazing, ramming our ships into our enemies. we want the thrill of the wild-west in space, where a brand new player can help take down a 5 year old vet in a ship worth 10x more than your own. we want what we saw in the this is eve trailer, and those of us who started and quit so many times wanted what the 2008 no other destiny and empyrean age trailers promised.my blood gets pumping and i get excited when i watch those trailers. low-sec and null-sec, especially npc null, brings me exactly what was promised. leave high-sec alone i say: those who want to mine or fly around in glided boats have their playground. give us thrill seekers, us warriors, pirates, criminals, bounty hunters, kings, and vagabonds ours. give a reason for a mass exodus into null-sec and the beautiful flames of war will bloom and the resulting scramble for resources will do nothing but help all players. give us new players a place to become an eve ace, a place where we can make a difference through glorious combat day one.vote for vic jefferson: for new eden, for the new player, for profit, and for never-ending showers of killmails."
12/21/2014,"i do not believe i speak for a specific alliance, or particular security band. i hope to have the privilege of speaking for any who want more content seeds planted, for those that spend far too much time searching for content, only to have hours of empty space grate their will to play. you know who speaks for the alliances, who then, will speak for you?it's easy to hate afk ratting, but it does actually generate a fair bit of content on both sides of the equation. especially with thera now, you can get anywhere you want really to harass ratters, whereas before i could see not wanting to go 60 jumps to get somewhere.if i had to compare, npc null is in more dire need of enrichment than low; at least low has faction warfare. in either case the issue is the same, and both need work. more people need to live and prosper out there, instead of day tripping."
12/21/2014,"i think you have to wait and see what 'bluesec' really churns out to be after a few more patches, before thinking about what needs to be moved in or out of it. on paper, we could be seeing lots of smaller entities continue to grab hold of a small part of sov, which is a fantastic thing, so you really do not want to pull out the rug from under them. if new entities are actively fighting wars or defending their space, can they actually sustain losses and is their space worth defending or taking? i can understand reservations about buffing the income of a true blue doughnut stuck in an icy-blue frosting of stagnation. what about a thriving, vibrant, byzantine nullsec?the golden rule of all such adjustments is, do the people who live in the space use it?so long as members of null alliances use high sec for income, nullsec needs adjustments.so long as low-sec dwellers and npc nullsec dwellers use high sec for income, they also need adjustments. content is stifled at the local level when income is so routinely outsourced."
12/21/2014,"i've read a few of your comments on pos's on reddit.about doing reactions on a planet you mention doing them in a station and having it need a station upgrade to do even that.could you explain the throughts behind this and why you think its a good idea. and why you think its necessary to force people to null do do reactions for drugs, t3 polymers and t2 items.you also mention this doesn't make sense. could you explain if pos's do or don't screw a fleet up.from my pov and this is mainly wormhole stuff, pos defences aren't really a issue at all if you know what your doing (with the possible exception of dickstars in c1 which are annoying rather than anything else) i'd imagine in null where you can bring way more numbers it also being the case."
12/21/2014,ooh whats your thoughts on hisec incursion income?
12/21/2014,"well as everyone hates to do but upgrading a station to allow reactions to take place would make it significantly less frustrating. as the majority of the value form goo is from the main pull from the moons. alternatively have it be a low sec option as well with stations but taxed to reducing income. a benefit of holding the station/sov to avoid the solid pull to null sec by itself. i am a firm believer of keeping industry local and if given the option we know people would run ores to high sec react there and then sell it. i think the continued risk is necessary however incorporating it into pi a system that is both frustrating and tedious even after its set up seems like overkill. i want to see null sec industry rise to be more than capitol and super production as a focus and have t2 or t3 production local for alliances and making it easier. potentially the balance for this could mean that the reactions take more time to complete. with the risks to stations potentially increasing in the future the risks might be there. (apologies for typo)on pos defense, my alliance fought a maned enemy death star pos with several ecm units and a magnitude of defenses we got torn apart by it. just like the russian fleet earlier that day. a properly fit and manned pos can and will eat through a fleet regardless of a high eccm fit experienced logistics team. as well as it can eat a dread it fit properly. energy neuts and large guns. wormhole commentsmy corp used to do day trips or weekend trips into low class wormholes just for some added content and without fail we ended up downing someones long forgotten pos despite not being able to bring much more than destroyers or cruisers. in a c1 or c2. its been a while. but it was worth the 5 hours or so we spend downing the large tower cause we made off with all the mods and a bunch of their gear. as for incursions, i love them they provide a specific skill goal for new players to earn a consistent paycheck while teaching the basics of fleet composition and fleet broadcasts. i would like to see newer more challenging sites or different brands instead of just sansha. make variety a bit better. a lot of people say there is not a lot of risk in them. i have seen ships lost. several times in high sec incursions as for those that have their marauders pimped to run them quickly well that is a risk itself flying something that shinny. a lot of the time its down to who you are flying with and the quality control of the fc to make sure his fleet members know how to broadcast. i think its a great place for new players to aim for and can provide them with a significant pay check"
12/21/2014,"but if the income is so good, why would these players ever leave highsec to do pve? do you think that model - that players pve in highsec, but only do direct pvp in other spaces - is a good model for the game?"
12/21/2014,the isk isn't as good as many other routes. i use incursions for content if i get bored. null sec is significantly more profitable. i use incursions for my high sec corp as a benchmark to if players are ready to make the jump to null sec. replying from phone sorry for poor formatting. tldr. incursions don't make what i make in null or running a site in wormhole space with blue loot can get you. could use more variety to make it more challenging but then again to new fc without prior experience the current sites are hard. made to look easy by communities that specialized in that content.
12/21/2014,"ok, so one thing that has bothered me ever since the new deployables came out is that there is no way to deploy them for corp, or better yet passworded so that you can use it between alts and corp members. as a member of the csm what is your stance on the multiplayer aspect of eve and how the new deployables ignore this."
12/21/2014,yes.ok i'll embellish. something i really believe in is the social nature of this game. for me i come on after work and i want to talk to the people i play with. i want to do things together as well. i think that mobile tractor units certainly pose a minor barrier to this. as do ess. the mtu needs to be anchorable for corp. if you trust your corp mates you should be able to set something up so that they can scoop the unit.ess also needs some rework because in their current state they seem to be more of a drama generator as much as they are an lp and isk generator.
12/21/2014,"as csm, will you still make an effort to continue taking us out on fleets from time to time? your fleets represent everything that is fun about dying in a fire. xoxo"
12/21/2014,absolutely! this game is so fun even losing is awesome sometimes. the seriousness of this thread is a bit troubling but it's for the greater good i hope. something we talked about last night was cloaky camping and the upcoming recon changes. it was really interesting.check out last nights podside podcast

12/22/2014,"when i wardec a highsec industrial corporation i give them a clear set of terms for them to get the war to end.1) buy mining permits for the whole corp.2) put a pledge of support to james 315 and the new order of highsec in their bios and in the corp description.3) all members agree to follow the new halaima code of conduct while in new order territory, ie, highsec. in all my wars only one corp has complied with these terms. so its not that they don't want to pvp. they could have peace in a minute if they would agree to my demands. its that they think they can ignore highsec pvp and do whatever they choose to do without interference. its their principles! this shows a clear misunderstanding of what eve is about. at its root it creates calls like the op for more nerfs, more safety, less interaction, eventually the death of the game. despite their caveats, what they truly want is to not have anyone have the ability to force them to do anything they don't want to do. just fix one more thing ccp and everything will be good. won't anyone think of the noobs?!?! here is the bottom line though. there have been many nerfs to highsec aggression over the years. and yet, the industrialists keep dying. because we always find a way. and we always will.... by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"

12/22/2014,"seconded, not to mention the support for third party development, which pretty much everyone uses in one way or another."
12/22/2014,"each area of space has its own challenges. the initial post of ideas were never a basis for my campaign, but to act as a spark plug for getting to the down and dirty of these kind of issues. while this approach may have turned the stomachs of many<U+FFFD> if one can<U+FFFD>t identify the down and dirty from the player base, then what good is the csm. i<U+FFFD>m here to listen and i want more of your ideas! so let<U+FFFD>s get down to business.a few ideas that were send to me. your thoughts ?fleet escort - anyone within a fleet of someone who is unlawfully shot at immediately gains lock against that criminal. the immediate lock doesn't make any sense, but neither does the criminal ship being held in place, unable to move. this just helps those with any escorts or anti-ganker groups to react quicker in an attempt to defend the target.the hideout <U+FFFD> a mobile deployable unit that shadows criminal targets from concord. while of course criminals will lose their ships, and they can<U+FFFD>t undock in another ship, they could still undock in a pod and warp to this 15km area to hide in new ships. the hideout will also tick down the timer twice as fast while they are in range and in a ship. what this does is provide opportunities for anti ganker movements to hunt gankers who may find this unit useful to quicken their return to another gank.war evasion - this is still a legitimate problem. it<U+FFFD>s far too easy to just drop corp and reform a new one. to me, the solution is rather simple and in part, already in game! what happens when a corp leaves an alliance that is war decced? the war doesn<U+FFFD>t just drop anymore! it satys with them for the remained of that war<U+FFFD>s initial term! bingo! the same should be for players! i think ccp didn<U+FFFD>t want to lock people into their corp as it has been laid out in the past to do. locking down a corp under war dec is too much. if a player wants to leave, let them, but they<U+FFFD>ll still be flagged as a war target for the remained of that week of time. pure and simple.more content - random mission generation: i think the damsel has been save over 10 billion times now. missions need to stop being repetitious and be more random. by random, i mean to space and enemy deployment with unknown triggers... random faction spawns... mission that lead into nearby wormholes... etc. it needs to be more challenging and have such variety that players don't get bored. some random mission elements should include limited engagement periods with other mission runners... competing for the same goal.., or one is protecting something the other needs to destroy... etc. more interactive gameplay!"
12/22/2014,"now that is a proposal that adds gameplay and risk to the highsec criminal mini-game. gankers would get a small benefit, but at the risk of being exposed to law enforcement. +1your other two ideas i am more ambivalent on. the auto-lock probably won't change much and may be hard to implement but it seems fine - a slight buff to haulers that bring escorts for protection might encourage the practice. your wardec idea maybe a good solution but i think it should be coupled with more changes as i think it might be counter-productive to force a player to wait out a wardec if they really, really, don't want to or can't fight. i would suggest a surrender mechanic would allow a player to opt-out of the wardec that follows them for a fee and banishment to the npc corp for one or two weeks. make living in an npc corp a little more difficult (higher tax rate/slower mining cycles) and players would have an incentive to stay and fight. i think though more carrots to make a corp more attractive to live in would be an additional solution. corp owned structures that like pocos, that cannot be unanchored after a wardec is started, that give bonuses to mission, mining and industry activities. players would have to defend those structures or lose them - a strong incentive to fight."
12/22/2014,"fleet escort seems like an unnecessary one sided boost to hisec pvp. what is the problem this proposed change would be solving?the hideout is pointless with zero clone upgrade costs. edit: i reread it. i guess i don't understand how pilots on gcc are undocking in ships.war evasion works for me, but it fails to solve the larger issues with wardeccimg, and may be a technical nightmare to implement.more content makes something that is grindy into something that is grindy and tedious. content should come from players. i think ideas that bring more content from other players into pve activity is more useful than hitting rand() on mission objectives."
12/22/2014,"leave the damsel alone! i agree with adding more choices to missions, but don't mess with every mission because *you* find them boring.if you are bored: do something else besides mucking up my game experience.i enjoy rescuing the damsel and feel happy if i get the mission twice in the same play session.i also really favor things like the burner missions which are opt-in (although, i don't actually do them, too much adrenaline for me)"

awkward and there's no good reason for this.when i first started in eve i imagined myself as some sort of han solo, running drugs and contraband across new eden... and what i actually got made me sad. this could be an amazing area of game play if there was something other than blind luck and guaranteed standings loss for moving them. imagine instead trying to bribe customs officials, smugglers holds in ships, getting caught and making you suspect in the system... there's so much more you could do with this area of the game.implants need a second look as well in particular the current system for learning implants and pirate implants need a revisit in light of the clone changes recently. i'd like to see more implants that affect your pod (imagine an op interdiction nullified pod) or specific ships and reviews of concepts like implant salvagingenabling hisec pvpi applaud the changes made and the progress we've had this year in improving pvp generally in the game, from the recent clone changes to the pirate implants changes and interceptor re balances. its been a good year for pvp and things that encourage pvp, but we've also seen some things that worry me for example removing in-corp aggression, while i can see and acknowledge that this need to change to encourage new bros to join corps, there are groups in the game this seriously affects (rvb for example) and although i know the current csm and ccp recognise this, i want to make sure changes to core mechanics are properly counterbalanced by choice... something that is at the very core of eve. i can choose to join a corp with pvp in-corp, i can choose to join a corp that doesn't allow aggression, i want to make sure this choice is something that can be made, and made in an informed way.more tournaments and enabling player run tournamentsthe alliance tournament exists on the good will of a dedicated bunch of developers. if they didn't put their free time to making this happen then things like the alliance tournament wouldn't exist and while we already have tournaments like the neo etc. i want to push for more tournaments and for the tools to allow player run tournaments by improving on, revising and expanding even abandoned concepts like the dojo, perhaps getting volunteers access to special characters with some limited tools to help run tournaments (with these people under nda) and improving in game and out of game broadcasting tools to support these events.beyond this making eve sports more widely visible by putting tournaments on the front page of the launcher and possibly things like in game advertisements is something i think needs to get some attention. i would also like to see more acknowledgment and rewarding of the enablers for these in game tournaments.corporations and alliancesas a recruitment manager i feel this pain day in day out... managing roles, managing members, advertising the corp to new bro's, banning users, accepting new members, etc. it can be really hard. anyone who has managed a corp of more than a handful of friends will have felt this pain as anything like granting access to pos', hangers, roles is clunky and far too complicated. it needs to be made easier to manage and perhaps even crest enabled to allow management of these resources in the same way we manage our comms servers, forums and other oog resources.i want to make sure that this aspect of the game gets its time in the sun, that due consideration is given to what needs looking at here and making sure that the management system is fit for the decade to come.3rd party app developmentthe improvements made in the area of 3rd party / api this past year are a testament to the work of the dev team there and the current csm but this still needs further work. first and foremost the development of crest (please, please please give us read-write access to things like skill queue, mail etc.), documentation improvements, sso updates and improvements, etc. lets give the tools to the people who create the great apps and systems that compliment the game so much.sov / null fixeslast but by no means least we need the long overdue and promised changes to sov. this has now become one of those items that just needs to be fixed, to show us that its being taken seriously i believe that now is the time to start feeding back some of the thinking to the community. even if just a bit more flesh on the bones, communicate more often has to be the message delivered here.while we await solid plans for change from ccp, my position is one of wait and see, we have heard from a vast array of people on the issue of sov / nullsec changes, the current csm have put forward some idea's, the community has fed into the process so now we need some plans from ccp and soon, so we can provide concrete feedback on their thinking.wow, that was a wall of text... i would like to thank you for reading though to the end here and i hope that i prove worthy of your trust, your time and your vote for csm x.thanks and fly safe o7.k"

12/22/2014,"i am glad that you recognize the negative effect that highsec incursions are having on the other spaces. it is poor game design to have something with so little risk pay so lucratively, and is making low, null and wh space much less vibrant than it could be if people were incentivized to make their isk in the spaces where they live/roam, rather than returning to highsec.in keeping with this idea of the balance of risk vs. reward, i am curious to know your thoughts on the current state of highsec corporation mechanics. one of the major problems as i see it is that currently, the mechanics do not make it clear whether a corporation is suppose to be a ""social club"" where players can form a social group and hang out and do stuff, or a true competitive entity that is fight with other groups for power and resources. right now, there is little ""reward"" for being in a corporation in highsec, while there are risks (wardecs and awoxing), and these little rewards that there are not tied to any particular corporation so there is little reason to actually fight for your corp if wardeced - it's often better to drop and reform or hop to another corp. i would like to ask do you support the idea of a lower tier of corporation, that would not have any of the risks of a ""real"" corporation, but also none of the rewards? further, what mechanisms do you think could be added to the game to make ""real"" corporations more persistent and worthwhile for members who take the added risks, and that would make them want to fight for the corp (or hire mercenaries to protect their corp)?finally, on a related issue, what are your thoughts on on the proposed removal highsec intra-corp aggression (highsec awoxing) as described on pg. 78 of the csm9 summer minutes?"
12/22/2014,"if you have a pos, you can't just disband your corp. making it so that gameplay in highsec is much less profitable without having an online pos, and not allowing unanchoring of poses during the 24 hour spinup prior to war (similar to how pocos can't be transferred out from a corp pending war) would help a great deal in terms of preventing corp cycling. however, disclaimer disclaimer i don't run a highsec corp -- highsec is just a place that i go to as the last stop in my logistics runs. someone like mike or sabriz might be much better qualified to speak to that point.yes. the npsi community etc. needs love. better tools for managing the membership of combined mailing lists/chat channels would help (i would think of such communities as 'interfaces' in java terms where you can have more than one, whereas first class corps are 'subclassing'). poses and pocos are pretty much the tools we currently have at our disposal right now as far as fixed reasons to maintain a corp in highsec, so making it so that poses and pocos are more lucurative to own would help tremendously.i am ambivalent, actually. i think one of the major barriers towards corporations recruiting newbies is that the corps are afraid of 7-day hero alts awoxing (and also, on the flip side, reverse awoxing 7-day old legit newbies is ******* downright vile), but on the other hand nullsec deals fine with the potential for awoxing even without concord's help. so i support awoxing in general as a mechanism to weed out and kill bad highsec corps that don't actually teach newbies anything and just leech as a 10% or 20% tax moneymaking scheme off the backs of newbies. wardecs, however, also can be used to the same purpose, so perhaps wardecs are an appropriate counter if they can be fixed according to your points above.(edit to add: i love almost everything about psychotic monk, especially the big red wardec newbie effort, but i was very disappointed in him when he started a reverse awox corp that advertised newbie friendliness and said that the way that newbies could avoid getting reverse awoxed by him was looking at the corp window once they joined a new corp and going to the corp kills/losses tab under 'wars' and looking for reverse awoxes. really? really? that's super un-discoverable :( )"
12/22/2014,"i agree - making poses more relevant (and harder to unanchor like pocos) and/or the addition of new, significantly expensive, deployables that are vulnerable (like pocos), but provide a bonus to the corp for some activity would go a long way to allowing a highsec corp to determine their own tolerance for risk vs. reward. if they want to be relatively safe they can avoid such vulnerable assets and pve with friends or solo, or if they are up to the challenge, they can deploy significant shared assets to increase their income, but at the risk that they might come under attack from someone and they will have to defend it.i also agree with much of this. the practice of exploiting the lack of knowledge of legitimately new players is deplorable, and actually reverse awoxing someone who just started the game and is looking for a corp is not cool. however, if you take a look at zkillboard's awox category i see very little evidence this is a problem at all - by far the largest number of highsec kills are from rvb other obvious intra-corp sparring, and the small number of ""actual"" awoxes there are against expensive industrials flown by players with typically years of experience in the game. in fact i can't find any evidence of a ""reverse awox"" corp actively preying on newbies anywhere there (although i guess if such a corp exists they might not have their api registered and neither might a newbie). it seems to me the increased risk for a new player to end up in a bad highsec corp run by a terrible or nefarious ceo because of this increase in safety is a much worse to than the slight chance they will actually get reverse awoxed (which this change doesn't even completely prevent - only for newbies joining highsec corps). i am not adverse to a ""social corp"" that is immune to awoxing and wardecs where new players and risk averse players can form a group (with no benefits of a corp like keeping taxes), but an actual corporation should be required to defend itself from threats both external (wardecs) and from within (awoxes/corp theft). anyways, i like what i am hearing so far. best of luck with your csm campaign!"
12/22/2014,"they aren't api registered on purpose, to make it harder for carebears & newbies to just look at zkillboard to detect that they're reverse awox corps. carebears won't have personal killboard apis on file, and the reverse awox technique relies upon not being killboard registered. still doesn't help the case of a corp that's trying to recruit newbies, though - a lot of good corps won't recruit newbies at all because of awox risk, so they instead put in bullshit requirements like ""minimum 10m sp"" in order to raise the bar to entry to having a nontrivial amount of time playing the game so that it's unprofitable on a plex basis vs. what someone would kill. and that's what i understand the core of the argument is for removing awoxing. like i said, complicated issue, and more data would help, but only ccp has that data for the most part."
12/22/2014,"i understand this argument but don't buy it. ""good"" highsec corps that are interested in training new players already have ways to protect themselves - like dedicated training corps for new players - but they require some work. all this does is lower the risk for lazy and clueless corps to spam invites as there is now much reduced risk to themselves. competent highsec corps are still going to be careful due to the other risks of infiltration (spying, theft, etc.) and not change their behaviour towards inviting new players, but the proliferation in terrible corps run by players that don't understand game mechanics spamming invites in starter systems are going to snare more new players into corps that aren't capable or willing to train and support them properly, leading to a more frustrating experience than necessary for many starting players. i don't believe that there are a mass of ""reverse awoxing"" corporations hiding off the killboards killing newbies in large numbers, but as you say only ccp has the data. if they came out with a devblog tomorrow saying that i am wrong and 25 new players are ""reverse safaried"" each month and most quit the game, then i would reverse my position (although these hypothetical corps could just move to lowsec and keep reverse safari-ing with this change so i would advocate for additional protection for them than just changing highsec intracorp agression). i don't think that is the case - the number is probably much closer to (or actually is) 0 than 25. i think this is just a change pandering to some highsec players' continual demands for increased safety at no additional work/cost. but it doesn't really matter what i think as you are running for csm and this is your thread."
12/22/2014,"if you made your decision without regard to whether you are getting support from blues, this begs the questions. do you have support from your blues? if you don't have full fledged support from your blues, why should reds vote for you?"
12/22/2014,"i do have some support from my blues (but it's not my announcement to make about hero's voting recommendations or who else is running), but my belief is that brave will overwhelmingly vote for candidates from brave as their first priority. i am not a bloc candidate. like i said in the earlier response, consider me to be in the same position malcanis was in for previous csm elections -- someone experienced that won't be ranked #1 or #2 on a bloc ballot, and therefore needs to get broad grassroots support to be elected.people should vote for me if they believe the perspective i will bring to the table is valuable for the csm. a well-balanced csm is important to the long-term health of the game. i represent a set of players that otherwise likely wouldn't get a significant voice on the csm in terms of 50-500 character groups of players."
12/22/2014,"agreed that that very much is a risk of removing awoxing, and is a factor pushing me away from supporting removal of awoxing. like i said, it's a complicated issue, and i can see good arguments on both sides and will be thorough about devil's advocating and making sure all the arguments are clearly stated and understood.however, i think it's terrible mechanically to segregate new players in a new player ghetto. you were talking about making player corporation membership mean something. ducking things by putting new players in a separate corp until they're fully trusted seems like a backwards way of handling things."
12/22/2014,"a pi alt with 20 days of skilling can net you half a plex's worth in a month of purely passive isk. the skillbooks will cost about 10 million. it's really a matter of poorly utilizing the space in which money making opportunities already exist.a throng of newbies who can just shoot things don't get to eat. to eat, you need to know how to collect and cook food. and alts in this game are a thing.in terms of the market in npc null being scarce, this is nothing a csm member is going to change. uncapped hope is a thing but we are arguing mass market mechanics here."
12/22/2014,"you can live in a nullsec pipe dream if you'd like, but i'm presenting you my viewpoint of nullsec as it stands even with the travel changes from the previous two expansions.not convinced by this argument. hiseccers may need to go to wh or null for better industry and pve drops. it doesn't mean we bring these into hisec, as a reverse argument. not being able to leave your couch doesn't mean the fridge has to come over to where you're sitting.being too lazy to organize logistics out of your space to facilitate income is a poor reason for instituting change. introducing risk and challenge and danger are good reasons for advocating change. i'll agree with this point.i hope you don't mind the discussion. unlike some other csm candidates you actually read posts and reply thoughtfully to them. i wish you good luck with your candidacy."
12/22/2014,"i was under the impression it isn't just a matter of skills though, but of the initial investment in interaction equipment, access to pocos, transport ships (which in npc null, at least syndicate, have huge targets painted on them), access to planets, etc. however i'm willing to concede the point since i've never really looked into it in great detail, nor talked to the folks in corp necessary to get involved in pi, and our discussion is becoming somewhat tangential to the campaign thread."
12/22/2014,"i don't think its a problem when hi sec natives come down to lower security bands, that is a good thing. they should be motivated to step into the unknown in the name of profit, and they should be left felt wanting at what hi sec offers them. the question then becomes why are so many low and null sec dwellers are motivated to come up to higher security bands to do missions or incursions as their bread and butter. part of the reason is that there simply isn't enough reward compared to the risk/effort ratios they could get in hi sec, thus another source of local conflict fails to sprout."
12/22/2014,"this is so true. c4 and c5 wormholes have been basically destroyed by the presence of highsec incursions. why put a 15-20b capital escalation fleet at risk in a c5, or a pair of 3b marauders at risk in a c4, when you can make 70-90% of the isk per hour with much lesser logistical concerns in highsec?the more of vic's posts i read, the more i endorse what he stands for (even though we do not have 100% agreement), and i have no loyalty to his alliance."
12/22/2014,"i'm curious to know why noone has addressed this yet.i read the csm minutes every time they're released. i read them several times over. specific people saying specific things gets lost in the details but what i've quoted above directly violates/contradicts the publicly disclosed stance of ccp (through the minutes) and while it's not a surprise i think it's worth more than just a footnote in your campaign.you're a volunteer peer reviewer, pretty much, from what i'm able to gather. to publicly state the things you have above is.. pretty damning really (of ccp). you're running for csm 10, but i haven't seen mynnnas declaration yet. any other goon candidates this year? to be honest i haven't checked i'm mostly interested in recurring terms like yours. i appreciate that you've avoided using lofty rhetoric for the most part. your honesty about ccps position on their own institution is also appreciated. i just wonder why you're doing it, again i mean. it's pretty clear the csm is being progressively marginalised and that last year especially was a pretty clear indicator of that. and then the sudden resignations of 2 csm members this year as well.i would run for csm too but not for the same reasons you do, i think."
12/22/2014,"the last rat i shot for isk died in 2009! oh, right. suzy. umm, a lot of players rat happily, but in the opinion of those who rise above, it's suckie gameplay."
12/22/2014,it is fairly mind numbing. however it's the best isk/hr i've been able to find with my modest skill set. seeing as the barrier to entry is minimal i don't think it needs much to change... just be smart and optimize.

12/23/2014,"recently ccp wanted to give a force recons a small balance to give it immunity to direct scan. as it was before you should click direct scan button once a minute and at least you had an option to get situation in the near field. but now even after pressing this button you cannot know the situation.what does it mean. simple, you are becoming more nervous. your game becoming more slower.because you need to check more.more checks > more time .game is slower.in my opinion good idea would be to change direct scan system give it more deep and get rid it from scan now button.you can add more parameters for your ships similar to stealth technology .bigger ship has better radar but has more surface of reflection.as for the direct scan you should make a 3d radar at last something similar to this space radar from nasa sitei dunno how much load this will add to your node but for the large scale fights you can jast say that large fleets are creating distortion and maximum scan range is cut to some point ."
12/23/2014,"just a couple of observations:i suspect the final solution for sov mechanics will include some similarities to your proposal, but there are a couple of things to consider.the conquering cloaky camper can be a thing. your proposal only requires ships in space. who sits in space better, withless drain on the system resources, so less annoying tidi, than the cloaky camper. "" armed"" with the basic gun from a freerookie ship, or maybe a prototype cloak on a battle badger, the cloaky camper can sit and drain the efforts of the sov holding alliance while they are at work, or outside, or asleep. and if the enemy counters with their own cloaky camper, then the""attacker"" can simply counter with a multitude of cloaky campers and simply out blob the enemy with a cohort of cloaked campers. the attacking and defending fleets could save all that time maneuvering for position, or probing for warp in points; the two fleets could just float in space and be invisible to each other the entire time. a second point is that occupancy and numbers can not be the sole criteria. if that is the case, you leave no room forskill, training, strategy, or leadership to make a difference, or for a smaller, skilled, well led force to make an impact on the outcome. under your scenario, say 10,000 pilots under a fleet commander named perses show up in a system. the 300 defenders show up under someone named king leonidas, count the 10,000 opponents, and say oh well, and leave. we won't need dramatic, tension filled battle reports, every ""battle"" report could just be a census tally."
12/23/2014,hmmm... i thought ccp was always trying to find ways to get people more involved with pvp? when did they start going the other way?people need to start figuring out that eve is a pvp game with elements of pve not the other way around.while i have been on the losing side of an awox(and yes it does suck) it did sever to give me a lesson on 1. trust is expensive and 2. pvp is way cool even when your in a retriever getting blasted by a hurricane
12/23/2014,"hi steve -in response to angrod losshelin running for the csm with a platform that includes ""multiboxer representation"" what do you feel about the current voting mechanics?should the voting mechanics be restricted to one vote per person? if owning another account is enough justification to earn an individual another vote towards the csm, would you support allowing another vote to those who use multi-character training on a single account?thanks in advance."
12/23/2014,would it be nice to limit to one vote per actual person? yes.is it viable? no.not worth talking about any more.
12/23/2014,"remember, these are not my ideas, but from people who support me. the main reason i post them here, is to see how the community (dis)likes it. i just collect, sort, check feedback, analyze, filter and use the output for the csm campaign.the hideout is something i do like myself. it gives both sides new options, its simple and it eliminates the other ideas about timers, kickout of stations, etc. that some had issues with.the ideas about being afk (undocked and on same grid) and ganking ideas have been updated in the original post."
12/23/2014,"while i think your heart is in the right place, some parts of this i feel are kinda 'nope'. some ideas i'm hearing from my ts right now:1) limit the number of wardecs one can give and one can recieve2) make it really hard for gankerscum to live in highsec. you're a marauding criminal and a mass murderer, why the hek (get it, 'hek'?) are you allowed to dock in a station in hs?3) remove the tags you can buy. you've killed people to get your low sec status, you need to work your butt off to get back there pirate scum!4) more penalties for suicide ganking. it's too easy. a timer system similar to fatigue for killing people in highsec. timers that prevent you from undocking, leavign a pos, ect. also, if we push them to low sec or null sec, that means more people moving around, more moving around means more pvp, more pvp equals a better eve. pirates should live in less secure areas because the secure areas are dangerous for them. making it so gankers can't live in highsec would be great for the game (they can go there, just can't live there, so they'd have to work for it, unlike now in comparison)5) bounties are a joke. killrights are too. fix them so they have more consequences"
12/23/2014,"1) i can see where you are coming from with this, it's not a terrible idea and possibly worth considering. i'm not sure it would be helpful though.2) life is already pretty damn hard. unless you've lived it you have no idea.3) no. have you ever payed for those tags, they are not cheap.4) this is just laughable. i won't even say anything more about it.5) fully agree on this. the bounty system is less broken than it was before, but still needs some work. kill rights aren't really so bad, but most people do not use them properly. i think killrights should provide free locator agents as well as a brief guide on how to make use of killrights properly. i've personally had killrights, and i used them to kill the aggressor in his hulk. got his pod too. i've had lots of killrights against me, and only one person has ever used them for anything useful."
12/23/2014,"fleet escort - two words. sensor boosters. your guys use these all the time. i don't see this change really doing much as unless the group brings enough dps to shred a significant amount of the gank fleet before concord shows up they aren't going to be able to stop it, instant lock or not. in other words, this addition wouldn't accomplish anything.the hideout <U+FFFD> this idea is really cool. as a ganker i can say that sitting in a bubble watching your timer tick down and hoping against hope that a white knight fleet doesn't show up to slaughter you. the incentive to use it of increasing the speed at which the timer ticks down is really good and would definitely make these worth using. bowheads would see a lot more use as well. giving white knights the ability to have a meaningful impact on the gankers and their activities would be really cool.war evasion - i fully agree that war dec dodging is a problem. i'm not certain that this approach is the best though. perhaps when you declare war against a corporation you can optionally identify one or more members of that corp. if you do, those members will still be war targets if they leave the corp. this would increase the fee for activating the war. this would allow you to pursue specific targets if the war dec is a targeted attack or a vendetta, but would still allow the less important (to the aggressor) targets to leave the corp if they really don't want to protect it. couple that with more carrots for remaining in a corp, and things should improve on this front.more content - these are some cool ideas and i would support them.you might earn my votes back yet mr. bushido."
12/23/2014,"they still wouldn't be able to, but they could reship from an orca, bowhead or unpiloted ship when they reach the module. (or carrier if and when they become allowed in hs again.)"
12/23/2014,"1) why would you nerf something if they are ok with paying the bills for it ? what if someone would have said, limit the number of titans in1 alliance ? or limit the number of enemies in one null-sec system ? sounds just as weird to me.2) ganking is part of high-sec. nerfing it would be bad for eve. and ganking isnt mass murder. 3) i had to buy tags to get back from -10 to above 0. i still feel the isk pain let's keep them anyway.4) why push people to low and null if they want to be in high-sec ? people decide themselves where they want to play.5) bounties are a nice extra, but need a lot of work to be useful. kill rights are ok if it would be easier to see who has them on who."
12/23/2014,if you go by the lore (the ships actually have full crews) then it is mass murder. however that line of argument would also make concorde the worst perpetrators of mass murder in human history.
12/23/2014,"i agree that more information about people you have killrights on, and who has killrights on who (so you can contact them and work out an arrangement), and maybe a variety of other possibilities, would make killrights more useful."
12/23/2014,"1) vov2) i've fought it though. it was just a sequence of warp to insta, gank, lose ship, dock in pod, rinse repeat. no way to evict or combat outright. hid from wardecs and use system i said above. the manipulation of the mechanics make it so it's pretty easy to evade any strife.3) your point? neither is a supercarrier but yet they're still prolific. too easy.4) more risk more reward. problem is, there isn't any real risk to ganking some guy in a freighter. you're going to lose the ship anyway so why would that count as risk? you can't be shot if sec status isn't low enough. you can manipulate mechanics to avoid getting a confrontation. you can dodge wardecs if a bumper (i hate you kalorned). even if you lose a ship, it was going to die anyway so it doesn't matter. yet you can sacrifice a 10 million isk dessy and reap in massive profits from ganks (or a 70 mil (just guessing) talos but that isn't really that much. where is the risk then? when i rat out delve, i face much more risk than you do in hs. null is riskier than low, low is riskier than high, but you have an altogether lack of risk for ganking, while the freighter pilot has all the risk, sometimes by just flying to thing (killing empty freighters is the silliest thing). after you kill, you hide in station to rinse and repeat. 5) :dat least we agree on something"

12/23/2014,i am comfortable with the current voting mechanics. they are not perfect. and it leaves loopholes because they can use the same isk or income to open another account and gain another vote instead of dual training and only keeping the one vote. i do not believe that giving each actively training character on an account an individual vote would do anything more than fluff vote numbers.there are advantages to organized players who coordinate their votes. i<U+FFFD>d like to see one vote per player but until ccp has a method to consistently separate the player behind the accounts from the accounts restrictions have to be absolutely consistent as not to cut any player off or decrease their access to representation.

12/23/2014,"gorski you're a really cool guy in your own weird ways :-) you had my vote last time and you'll have it again. there's something about you that is very easy to dislike on autopilot, but i get the feeling that when push comes to shove you are able to put on your serious face and do some real good for the game.i don't know what you did in csm thus far, and i probably won't have a clue what you'll be doing if you'll make csm again, my involvement in eve never went that deep. which is why i think its important to have at least one pilot who really know solo/smallgang pvp in csm, to carry the torch for the rest of us.if i'm not mistaken, you often fly with links. i know many people have issues with ogb, but i like the fact that you really know what it means, to fight a linked ship when you don't have them yourself, the difference it makes. many pilots just complain about links, but have no idea what it really means. i really liked the way logan described links in one of his videos ""used and abused"" which is a fine balance. without links some aspects of smallgang/solo pvp would be destroyed, just as links themselves can destroy the experience for an unlinked solo pvper. so that fine balanced needs to be addressed by someone who knows both sides of the scale inside out. if some highsec ganker who makes csm (nothing personal against anyone, i don't even know who else is running) even touches a links-rebalance issue thinking he/she know what links are, without ever having flown a 5 pilots smallgang w/links deep into null doing gurilla warfare against 100 locals, not understanding what links mean to those 5 in such a situation, then just like that - csm will fail small scale pvpers instantly. and the same can apply to various other issues.i'll write something else now, that i think is good to just put out there. i feel that ccp fail to give a proper platform to pvp video makers. they are just beginning to understand the ""power"" of videos, but they are still babies when it comes to this point.personally i got plenty attention, views, criticism, feedback for my videos. but i throughout the years i have seen dozens and doznes of solo/smallgang pvp videos that were literally much better than mine, go almost completely unnoticed, and fade away with only a couple hundred views. ccp fail to understand the influence that a good solo pvp can have on bringing new players into the game. i got more messages through youtube than i could count, of people that never played the game having seen my videos, asking me questions about if they should begin playing, and how... it would be to the incredible benefit of ccp to create some sort of platform for pvp videos to be seen in an ""official"" capacity.to take it out of the ""elite/myeve/out-of-reach"" mindset (that's basically an illusion anyway) niche it got to become, where experienced pilots brag to the other 10 experienced pilots who roam the same subforum, and rarely get seen by the other 99.9% population of new eden, and more importantly, the population of people who haven't created an account yet, but would have access to see those videos in one way or another if such a platform would be created. eve has the outside world's curiosity, it always had, it always will. and there are few better examples of the beauty of eve than solo/smallgang pvp. anyone can feel the pure fun of the player when watching a good smallgang pvp video, even people that never played the game can sense it. i don't think ccp realize how many subscriptions they got.. say in the last 3 years.. from people running into random solo/smallgang pvp videos in youtube.when a solo pvper roams endlessly (time-wise), against the odds, through the blob losses, and records. then edits a video, which can be a time consuming effort in itself... and finally releases it, only to recieve 400 views and a bunch of criticism from elitists (because more or less only the experienced pilots get to see his video, rather than a whole bunch of ""cool!"" from less experienced pilots), then it's very easy to give up on ever doing it again, and even resent the game for it. ccp don't see that those pilots are offering them gold for free. they do things like this contest for video makers, to make a new trailer ""this is eve"" style, which is a cool idea, but it can even do some intentional harm. think about all those that created videos and never got a second look, they don't have the amazing editing skills that ccp want for that grand prize, what they have is skills, understanding of the game, and patience to roam until they find those rare fights, +record them, and edit them the best they can, into their own little pvp masterpiece. it will never be a top edit piece of cinematic, but it will have the true essence of eve inside of it. the spirit of the pvper. they don't need some 100 plex. heck even 1 plex through a buddy link in their video description, or a donation from a viewer, can be infinitely more substantial for them than some grand prize. give those pilots a new platform, that can be ""theirs"", and just watch how much life is injected into smallscale pvp. it can be an alliance tournament level excitement all year round.it is very easy to overlook solo and smallgang pvp, because on the surface it seems like a small part of a big game. but it is not so. first and foremost eve is a pvp game. and a true pvp game without the possibility of a healthy solo pvp aspect... is a dead game!make small scale pvpers happy, and you'll see the effects on the entire game. more players, more activity in previously dead systems/constellations, more videos, more creativity, more general understanding of mechanics, more fit discussions, more everything. it will leak to every other aspect of the game. it won't be noticeable that the things are connected, it'll be hard to connect the dots. but the connection is there, in the very core of the sandbox.don't have questions for you. just a thumbs up :-)"
12/23/2014,"i honestly think part of the problem is that during ""balancing"" or ""rebalancing"", the idea that you can earn isk in total safety is not factored in or weighted properly. being immune to pvp as a default (until a ganker takes exception) eliminates a lot of dead time, and adds a lot of logistical value into the isk per hour equation."
12/23/2014,"in reply to your blog post:@ scanning rigs - while this is something i'd currently consider a little thing in the scheme of things, as most players in the wormhole community at this time aren't likely to be the sort flying t1 frigates, i see that your vision for npe toward wormholes would mean this adjustment for scanning rigs for those newer players. first, thoughts on npe:i'm not against npe to wormholes across the board, but i don't see wormholes in general as a new player experience, nor do i want it to become something that is easy enough for any new player to experience. wormholes and the mechanical understanding required to live in them is somewhere after the learning curve (corp/pos management, fittings, implants, drugs, various and relatively more difficult pve/pvp, fleet and ship management, etc) and although wormholes have become easier over the years, with help from training, documenting, and third-party tools, i don't want to theme park the experience. so to that end, i'm of the opinion that npe for wormholes should be reviewed and developed very carefully as to not end the frontier completely. as far as the rig changes, this is fine.@ wormhole npe - at one point last year i talked about how it would be nice for ccp to create tutorial missions in the exploration side that would allow players to probe down a generated wormhole that would lead to a specific mission area somewhere and allow them to complete a mission against sleepers. it would likely conflict with lore, unless worked around, and would have to be limited to maybe the player who generated the mission, or those in fleet/gang with him/her to prevent nastiness. that or make the mission area ""highsec"" rules, which i don't care for unless the plan would be to have different level missions that allow players to work up to the dangerous level of wormholes, where the higher wormhole ""missions"" would be -1.0, no local, and anyone could scan down. not sure on this, as i've said, i don't feel wormholes are npe. but, i'm irrelevant :p@ pos mechanics - i've been setting up/tearing down/infiltrating pos's in wormholes for a long time, and at this point, i say to let ccp develop a permanent fix to address all current concerns and not waste any development time on band-aids. that's all.@ multiboxing - you quote:i don't agree with this statement, as many wouldn't. it isn't an accurate statement. a multiboxer is someone who actively plays multiple accounts at the same time. i have many accounts, and i am only multiboxing if i play more than one at a time. that is the definition of multiboxing. multi-account =/= multi-boxthat said, mutliboxing is a playing style, and since all playing styles should be considered, so as long as they adhere to the eula/tos, i appreciate your concern with representation to a familiar playstyle. to each their own :)edit: spelling"
12/23/2014,"yes, exactly. i do not want to see wh space become anything less than it is, i simply want an increase in people to shoot. what better way to do that then to expose our awesome slice of space to new bro'si think this would be best handled in an ""instanced"" or roomed wh for new players. something non exploitable. i agree, and with the new proteus patch announcements this looks to be happening, but we will have to wait and see if this actually resolves all of the issues.i can agree with that statement, however, how many accounts do people have without actually using them at the same time?either way, i want to follow the eula as well but i will argue against any eula that restricts my gameplay outside of my bounds of reason. i'll follow it, but that doesn't mean i have to agree with it. with that being said, the current changes are acceptable if they are explained. the main concern for alot of multi-boxers is that this will not solve any issues, so whats next? that's what most are afraid of, as am i. ccp's reputation with taking the ax to an issue that needs surgery is well known and feared with good reason. check out my podcast! my blog!"

12/24/2014,"i'm personally kinda tired of hearing the 'if they don't add walking in stations then..'. no one has even a glimmer of an idea what gameplay element should be placed into wis that will work with eve(flying in space). meeting places is just a tired and kinda pointless version of player housing that doesn't really make sense with the gameplay reality that all your corp mates will be spread daily amongst multiple systems traveling constantly. no one wants to put a combat element into wis, at least not with actual isk or implants on the line anyway. only a tiny portion of the playerbase has any interest at all with npc storylines and trying to 'bring the npc's to life' will cost literal years of work to make happen."
12/24/2014,"so you're both saying that other games have caught up to eve, in that they've said they're going to do something?"
12/24/2014,... and you have my support. thank you for taking the time to write this piece.d-scan immunity is a shiny idea but it is too shiny and people aren't seeing past it to how it will impact on the game.
12/24/2014,"1. the amount of isk paid for mass wardecs is too low for the benefit it gives. personally i'd exponentially grow the cost of wardecs, so after about 10-15, it costs hundreds of billions a week for the next dec.2. ganking is pretty easy and without any real consequences however.3. it's like what, less than half a bil (edit: it's 350m)? that's pocket changes to completely reverse your sec status. bring back the old days where it took painful manual ss grinding.this is a prime example of what is wrong with someone like you going for csm. you're so self serving. what you want is stuff to make things easier for you. wardec corps like yours are a problem, because wardecs are too cheap and too easy to run to the point that declaring war against hundreds of tiny corps with no chance of defending themselves is possible. and now you want those people who are in those corps to effectively be unable to undock for a week because you think it's unfair that they can run away.and i know, cue you and your usual minions claiming that i must be getting brutally wardecced on all of my npc alts. the truth is that it's easy to see a fundamental imbalance as large as the one that dedicated wardec corps have over non-pvp corps from the outside. the fact that you can't see (or more likely won't admit to seeing) it is a testament to your ineptitude."
12/24/2014,i see your point.
12/24/2014,"nullsec could never truly be industry self-sufficient in its current state of being. a few examples.non-regional ices (not much helium up here in vale of the silent.)regional moon materials (mitigated somewhat with alchemy)datacores for invention. (local sites only produce certain types)faction ammo/mods/ships (no way to get the lp or access a store for all that ess lp [that no one has])by merging gabrial's desire for mission based (as opposed to anom based) ratting and creation of a more comprehensive (and expensive) lp store the last two needs could be met. the first two could be mitigated by expansion and improvement to the alchemy system. add in some more mexallon in the local ore sites and we'd be much closer to a far more self-sufficient nullsec, we'd still have to go back for skill books and bpo's but those can be hauled without the need to invoke the bane of our existence, space aids."

12/24/2014,"gorski, you did some solo pvp streaming right? and when u streamed u put a small cyno icon to help avoid stream sniping?ccp tried to make more ppl stream, even creating a new ingame twitch support. but it didn't work. the number of streamers stays very small. compared to other mmos eve is one of the weakest in pvp streaming.i know a few ppl that are very good at pvp and would like to stream, but gave up on it. the reasons are that eve is already so hard to find good fights in, solo, duo, trio or small gangs, becoz u always find blobs more than anything. then to add on top of that the risk of getting stream sniped is just too much hassle. they tell me it feels like they are working for ccp when they stream. can u relate to that statement?what do u think, if anything? can be done to make eve more streaming friendly? or is eve just really unrepairable bad for pvp streaming?"

12/24/2014,"what the csm ""is"" is difficult to define. the csm isn't really a peer review process though. we're not peers and we rarely see things in time to review them in any meaningful capacity. mynnna is not running this year, in his place endie is running. the reason i'm honest both in public and in private about csm matters is because i remember how the csm came to be. the csm exists not as a junior game developer consultancy, but as a means by which players can make sure we have a voice in legislating the rules of the game. according to one ccp employee, the csm is a ""pr tool."" but that's a sword that cuts both ways as history has shown, and savvy csm members recognize this. the reality is that ccp is in general in frequent contact with the playerbase, and they seek out and listen to many individuals and experts who don't have a csm tag. on a superficial level, this makes the csm redundant if the only purpose of the institution is to talk to ccp as player representatives. on the balance, this is a good thing. though<U+FFFD>since individual players aren't under nda<U+FFFD>it does sometimes result in some pretty hilarious nda ""breaches"" for which the csm sometimes gets wrongly blamed. as the other members of csm 9 and ccp would no doubt tell you, i've been a firm<U+FFFD>some might say belligerent<U+FFFD>advocate for the csm as an institution. i've consistently went to the mats with ccp on being cut out of processes, our rights to engage as players, and the increasing marginalization of the institution. as for why, it's because i'm convinced that the csm, when used properly and populated by capable members, is a huge asset to the community and the game as a whole. but regardless of what ccp does with the csm, the ultimate responsibility is on us as players to make the csm effective. and the reality is that we're not there yet."

12/24/2014,"what is your take on cloaky afk camping as a tactic?personally i view it as at best a broken mechanic. worst as harassment. this being simply because there is no counter to it.. what might you do to provide a counter to cloaky camping, what costs might it have and how would you balance it?"
12/24/2014,here's the thing with cloaky camping. it's not gameplay. pizza/pasta rage incoming. you have been warned.cloaky camp 0 risk. you go to the store. you go to work or cook dinner but you don't play eve. then you sit down look at the target decide what you need to win and do it.needs contrast and i like the concept of some sort of cyno like beacon for the recon ship class vessels. timer based where you can break that cloak throughout the system for as long as that beacon can be fueled just like a cyno. i think this allows the afk hunter to be hunted. it also makes the cloaky camper have to actually play the game. seems this could be a decent balance for the mechanic.
12/25/2014,"if they're going to sell outfits and stuff then they need an outlet for those items to be shown off.portraits only show at most the shoulders of your char. all the other stuff you're wearing is hidden from view unless a player clicks ""view full body"", and no one really does except the very curious so i support some modicum of wis if only to view how other players look. it'd also serve as a way for players to meet up and socialise in local instead of everyone just posting to a chat full of isk scams.but eh for full appreciation of it, at the very least we need some advanced camera controls, which could be implemented right now at almost no cost! a needed tool if we're to appreciate all these outfits. the default angle of the camera doesn't really let you see things in proper perspective."
12/25/2014,"no offence, but there has been a huge number of suggestions for gameplay within stations and derelicts. including combat."
12/25/2014,"simply not true. if pvpers need something they can simply buy it off the market at fair market prices and be done with it. why would a pvp corp pay an indy corp to mine and produce stuff for them when they can get their ships and equipment from the market just as easily (and cheaper to boot). indy corps do this too, don't make the mistake of thinking that just because a corp is indy they produce everything themselves.when you propose that an indy corp should 'just hire some help' you're effectively saying that on top of being harassed by a pvp corp looking for easy targets, the indy corp should also pay for another pvp corp to get some targets. and those hired guns aren't cheap. 200m for what is essentially protection money. paying that sum every time some griefer corp wardecs you will quickly drain your wallet. not to mention the lulz that ensue when griefer corps find out you pay a good 200 to 400 million to hire protection every single time they dec you for what, 50m? being the griever corp i would laugh my ass off and dec that same corp over and over and over again just to see them spend the money. or better yet, work together with whatever merc corp gets hired by the target and share the profit. ironically hiring help in eve online is actually counter productive to what you, as a target, want to accomplish (ending the war), which is why no-one ever does it. on paper the 'assistance' mechanic looks interesting but it's absolutely useless against griefer corps.anyway the thing that all big and mighty pvpers seem to be missing is that eve online is a video game that people play for their own amusement. some entertain themselves with pvp, others are more drawn to the industrial side of the game. both are fine. but you need to understand that you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do. pvp players want to shoot stuff, but they would rather log off for a week straight than spend more than 2 minutes in a mining ship if given the choice.on the other side, industrialist like to mine and produce and would rather log off for a week (which they often do, leaving no force to fight with in the first place) than spend a week flying around in pvp fleets and ultimately getting their asses kicked if they were to try anyway. because let's face it, most indy pilots have sh*t pvp skills and have no interest in training them. which is subsequently the reason they get decced in the first place, because they are easy targets that probably won't shoot back, making for easy laughs for the griefer corp.war dec mechanics are currently broken because they are used to grief. a corp is wardecced not to spark a fight or to measure who is better, but to embarrass a target corp. if they dock up and hide the deccer laughs at them and feels good about having disrupted their operations. if the targets forms up and fights they tend to get their asses kicked based purely on experience, which also makes the deccer laugh and feel good even if they lose because 'content'. if the target ignores the war and keeps doing what they are doing they get their mining or mission ships blown up which just about makes the deccer cream their pants.once again i feel the need to state that war decs should always exist in some form and that the high sec care bears should never be 100% safe. but if some huge pvp merc alliance wardecs a small 30 player industrial corp that has absolutely no pvp skills, things need to be balanced enough so that the small inexperienced corp has a realistic chance of winning and thus ending the war on their terms. not just the terms of the attacker. and yes that would still mean that the small target corp would have to go out and fight, but they would be able to fight for a purpose instead of just serving as cannon fodder for a week.i won't pretend to know what kind of changes or new mechanics would be fair and balanced to both parties, but i do know that the current system is extremely biased towards the attacker which is not a good situation no matter how you want to look at it."
12/25/2014,btw this is a very interesting discussion.
12/25/2014,"so where do the pvpers get their money to buy that stuff from the market?oh, that's right. they pve, do industry (the high-margin stuff), or farm/harvest.very few pvpers can say that they earn money from pure ship-on-ship violence. those that do are more of the exception than the rule.true... most indy corps don't produce ""everything."" but they do produce what they feel they will get the most out of.as for pvpers and pveers that attach themselves to each other... once you leave the confines of high-sec this becomes a lot of common than you think.pvpers want stuff that they use for cheap (stuff on the market usually sells for 5 to 15% higher than the material value... more if you are far away from a trade hub). indys want potential attackers to be discouraged from attacking in the first place (it won't save them if they are caught on a gate, but it may help save their poss).eve is based on the concept that you can affect anyone and everyone for whatever reason even if they do not like it.i, as a pvper, am affected by industrial people and pveers. i am ""forced"" to spend my money on stuff they build/earn because if i do not... i have no way to play the way i want. i do not enjoy it. i have no means of avoiding this without also getting into industry/pve.so why should i not be allowed to affect an industry player in a way they dislike as well?at the same time, why should industry/pve people not have to learn the basics of pvp the same way i have had to learn the basics of indsutry/pve?oh that's right... because no one should be ""forced"" to do anything.in that case i propose...- that all building materials, ships, mods, equipment, ammo, etc. have their prices automatically set to ""zero"" (or something close enough to that) - every time i lose a ship, that ship should respawn in my hanger so i do not have to buy anything. - i get paid large amounts of isk by concord for every player kill i make. that way, i do not have to do pve or industry.it's only fair after all. because i do not want to be forced into doing things i do not like to do. and industry players take away from that by forcing me to buy their stuff (which requires me to perform other activities that i do not enjoy; like pve).see what i did there? it's the same argument.as long as industry ""forcefully"" affects me... i am allowed to ""forcefully"" affect it back.so what arbitrary mechanic would you propose to force people who do not want to fight to fight people who want to fight?the issue here is that you are running into the conflict between different human natures that the game is predicated on!people who want to fight versus people who do not want to fight.people who produce versus people who want to destroy.people who want to be left alone versus people who want to affect everyone.people in all of the above points have to find ways to make their side win using the mechanics to their advantage.you can't have ""i-don't-have-to-do-anything-i-do-not-want-to-do"" mechanics while staying true to the ""everyone can affect everyone else in any way"" theme.both concepts are mutually exclusive of the other... both literally and in essence.then again... it is this conflict that makes the game so interesting."
12/25/2014,"dear eve players and developerswith the up coming eve update the eve community will gain new levels of gaming experience without question. but with that said one possible and promising aspect of eve game play might have been over looked by the public. though not popular or unknown to many of the eve community. the factory work teams have been given the pick slip. as a industry focus player. i have used work teams with many build projects if possible. it is an interesting aspect of eve game play and has given the game it self in my opinion a face of the industrial side of eve. though at this moment many of the current work teams are available until their expiration date. the idea of shorting or and improving build orders in eve has made the game more interesting and has open the game to many new possible types of gameplay. so i ask the eve community to release the work teams to the public. if possible that they could be bought as for example as a passenger in the market or contracted in contracts from their current employers. that could be rented and transported though space as any market item to work at any station or crop. or faction. as if possible work teams could have special skill books that focus on higher work team skills in player work projects research or use the player already used or learned skills that might be common to every industrialist that improve work team performance in ether production or research. or for extra income work teams could be working for the players as a service for the eve industrial market. if possible make it streamline and not making any addition to a players skill queue and make work teams with industrial invention or blueprints that improve work team skills which ever is the case. if possible work teams as a wild card could if used in build projects and research with a add twist to the projects of ships equip etc. unique to the work team, project, player standing and many other factors which could add improvements against certain enemy ships or weapons and in research a higher level of tech or unknown out comes that might surprise inventors in positive or negative ways that might increase their use. or for the extreme a player standing with a bought / rented work team that has a poor standing with the player or corp. in which the projects are now are at risk from sabotage. that might cause differences in time/cost or with small negative aspects during times of combat with the sabotage work team corp or allies. that might tip combat and or game play. faction / corp / player work teams working in opposing faction space doing the same as an focus team working to sabotage a specific type of enemy faction ship you might want to weaken against your warship / corp / faction or other areas of interest which ever the reason work teams can operate in eve. if any or possible a future with work teams could ripple threw out the eve community and game. thank you for any replays neg or pos any feedback any interest that might get a conversation going about work teams. i would think if work teams have a future to stay in eve is that at least a special item be made for the mass firing of the eve work teams made available so at least a few can remember.(joke?ugh) even thought if what is written here the ideas for work teams noted or seen by any or none this was an attempt to save the man in the machine.thank you eve community"

12/25/2014,"first of all thanks for the question and merry christmasi strongly believe that pvp in all its many forms (consensual and non consensual) have a place in this game, its what makes this game pretty much unique. having said that i'm all for the idea of giving people more chances to fight back (because that encourages interaction) and there are a number open to them as it stands (neutral rr, boosts etc.) so maybe its just the case that people need to be made more aware of the options open to them. sitting ducks are no real fun to shoot.there are some changes i would like to see, i would like to make more of the bounty hunting / kill right system which is at the moment not fit for purpose (at least the way players use it). there are plenty of things you could do in particular with the bounty system that could make it more cat and mouse than it is as well as this you could look at extending kill rights duration or possibly extending kill rights to be available for more than a one time thing or make it proportional to the value destroyed as an example.i would like to encourage group activities and fleets escorting high value targets and giving them ways to interact and interfere, because its all encouraging engagement in the game and makes the game more challenging and satisfying.hope this answers your question..k"
12/25/2014,yes i do indeed stream at twitch.tv/hkarn. when i was in pandemic legion i put a badly photosho...painted image of a cyno as overlay it was mostly as a joke. i streamed without any delay or anything blocking my screen. i actually very rarely got streamsniped :( i would welcome it most of the time since it's a fight at least. i understand that streaming sometimes can get a bit frustrating in a intel intensive game as eve but it's your own choice. some like it some don't. i think eve is decent for pvp streams there are a couple of semi big ones and ppl can have success doing it.and jimmy jams/aldap: thanks for your support. i actually sold my link alt recently and i would love ccp to support movie makers more but there is also stuff you players can do in form of rewards (think one man crew) or sponsorships.
12/25/2014,
12/26/2014,"i never said you shouldn't be able to affect people. hell, i never even said that wardecs are a bad thing. just that the way they currently work is bad because the attacker gets to basically set all the rules and duration and the defender is at their mercy.the defender has absolutely no way to end the war on their terms. the only way it can end is if the attacker decides they've had enough. which, when purposely fighting targets that don't have the experience, skillpoints, money or numbers to fight back, is pretty damn unfair. fights and the metagame do not have to be fair because, eve being eve, if you're in a fair fight someone made a mistake, which is true. but the game mechanics that make those fights possible, aka wardec mechanics, should be fair. this is still a video game, after all. so if the attacker has a way to end the war on their terms, so should the defenders.true. players who don't want to fight won't ever undock and fight no matter the mechanics. but within my own corp at least, there's not so much a sense of not wanting to fight, but rather not seeing the point in doing so. after all, fighting back is what the enemy wants and pleasing them is the last thing anyone wants to do.however, if you were to give players a purpose to undock and fight, like being able to end the war early or some other useful bonus, then most of the people in my corp would most certainly try to give it a shot. why? because then they'd be fighting and working towards a goal.like i said, i have no clue about the sort of mechanics that should be involved. many ideas have been posted over the years. from objectives to kill quota's, capturing structures, you name it. i honestly wouldn't know what the best way to go about it is. i'll leave that in the capable hands of ccp seagull and her infinite wisdom. all i know is that what we currently have is pretty sh*tty."
12/26/2014,"got to admit that this rings true. it is a shame because there should be good and enticing options available for all types of play. i never understood the war dec mechanic in isolation of a reciprocal option, perhaps to bribe concord to kick them out of highsec for a while."
12/26/2014,again the whole thread is going off topic with regards to what my alliances issue is and that of the newer start up corporations..wars are not a bad thing...eve needs that as an option issue is the option atm is abused to circumvent a concord response.make the mechanic of war mean something and then the industrialist will have reason to fight..atm only motivation to fight is the warm feeling of getting one over the aggressor which isn't why many of us play eve.have it cost something to declare war...build in a risk verse reward for both sides...make the results mean something currently a clean slate means nothing and is seen as a win for the defender ..50 noob ships counts as 50 solid kills..maybe track and rank the effectiveness of wars against others a high ranking merc corp verse a indi corp loses rank? indi v indi ? pvp v pvp...higher rewards...im sure there are far more inventive and creative means to make a war worth fighting and make spamming war decs to cast a wide net for a few kills pointless..
12/26/2014,"is there a more inventive means? if you have one please put it forth.the reality is that eve is a competitive sandbox where everyone's actions, both combat and industrial, can affect everyone else. therefore there needs to be mechanisms where players can disrupt the activities of other players, especially large, organized groups of other players. wardecs are one of the few ways to do this in highsec and as such need to be in the game in some form.you seem though to have an issue with the concept of risk vs. reward. this idea doesn't mean that each player has to be at the same risk - that an aggressor has to be at the same risk as a defender for example (in fact, the actual wardec mechanics are heavily biased in favour of the defender). it means that if you are engaging in an isk-making enterprise, then you are the one that has to be at risk. ideally, the greater amount of isk you are trying to make, the greater the risk should be to you. if your opponent is not trying to make isk/resources, why should they be at equal risk to you if it is you that will get all the reward?what is needed is a way for players to tune the amount of risk (and reward) that they want to expose themselves to. if you are a small corp, say just running missions with a few friends, you should be at much less risk than a large industrial corp trying to put billions of isk/month of goods into the economy. one way to do this is to have ""opt-in"" mechanisms, similar to the current pocos that were mentioned, that increase the income (reward) of a corp but make the corp vulnerable to attack. there should be similar deployables for mining, industry, missioning, etc. that increase corp income and are moderately tough to install and expensive, but are not able to be taken down in the event of a wardec (like pocos). this way, corps can decide to earn the reward of using them in exchange for the risk that they might be attacked and this would motivate those attacked to defend their assets. also, i think there should be a ""social"" tier of corps that can opt out of wardecs (and intracorp aggression) completely. they would have no benefits of the current corps (no taxes, poses or the like), but would allow casual players to play the game albeit with less rewards than a true corp that is taking responsibility for defending themselves against other corporations."
12/26/2014,well i kinda like this one...so far..there must be hundred of options..to make the whole point of wars and well even corporations worth while...
12/26/2014,"there is already an opt-out mechanism for avoiding wardecs. its the npc corps. players who want to not be wardecced can simply (and automatically) move into an npc corp and never be wardecced again. now i know this will not satisfy the op and his supporters. they want their pos's, their poco's, the taxes of their poor underlings pouring into their coffers. they want to ""make a name for themselves and eventually move into nullsec"" as countless highsec corporation descriptions have read since eve began. but that is a misunderstanding of the nature of this game. if you can't protect your organization and the people in it your corp has no right to exist. the pvpers are culling out the weak. they are showing the leadership and membership of those corps what the reality of their organization is. that they are weak associations of players with no group loyalty who's main purpose in joining said group is to profit individually off the labors of the others. since by admission of their leaders they get no protection and, as miners and other pve'ers, provide no protection in return there is no other reason for them to be there. as always, they are there because they think they will be paid for it in some fashion. the membership of pvp organizations will fight for each other. the members of pve corps only stay as long as they profit and, if called to make a sacrifice, will bolt at the first opportunity. for the health of the game, these corps must be destroyed. the individual pve'ers fill a useful niche as the bottom of the food chain so they can stay. but their ""leave us alone"" corps? no. by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"

12/26/2014,
12/27/2014,yeah npc corps are an option if want to forgo the idea of being and creating a corp identity .... kinda why many make a corp on first place then find themselves permanently in wars.if actually took time to read the op you will see it states deployment of pocos would mean you opt out of any kind of concord support or opt into war dec . same should apply if you decide to put towers up.as for saying loyalty is about isk your way off the mark most of our veteran (nearing 8 years) in one case are pve pilots.
12/27/2014,"but not just npc corps. you can also avoid war decs in player corps, it just takes a little more work in some cases.it really boils down to this. if you want to avoid consequences, then that comes at a price.eve is pvp centric. even though you like to look at some pilots as 8 years pve veterans, they are actually 8 year pvp ones. i guarantee that they have done pvp for the vast majority of those years.certain wars may not mean much to you, but they may mean a lot more to those making them. but it is up to you to try and make them mean nothing. it's all well and good running to the forum looking for hand holding, but how about some corp action to make them wish they hadn't bothered decing you? this doesn't necessarily mean all jumping in ships and fighting, it means thinking outside the box and doing what eve players are good at. screwing over other players. so screw them over, cost them isk, make them regret messing with you.the beauty with eve is the fact that we can affect each and every other player in the game, to some degree. no one should get special treatment against that aspect. including those that think they are pve only, when in fact they are mistaken.are war decs broken? damn straight they are, they are too damn easy to avoid.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
12/27/2014,i don't look at them as year pve veterans they are pve player they don't pvp some relocate and work around the war others stay docked till its over...unless your in npc then they are unavoidable...the impact of a war dec is easy to avoid..but not the war dec.
12/27/2014,"they do pvp. they are pvp veterans. pvp is not exclusively ship to ship combat and almost every aspect of eve is pvp. even ship spinning.as much as you wish eve to have a pve only environment, it's not going to happen. you could always play on sisi, it's the nearest to what you are after.war decs are easy to avoid, you just have to work at it a little. or you can fight back. (this is also not exclusively ship to ship combat.)destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
12/27/2014,"i read the op again to make sure i didn't misunderstand anything. i didn't. it was just another ""one more nerf please"" request from the carebear community to ccp based on the illusion of highsec safety. let me ask a few questions about your successful alliance and its 8 year veterans. 1) when wardecced do you immediately contact the aggressor and offer to surrender and meet their terms thus possibly avoiding a week or more of corp activity disruption? 2) do you access the seriousness of the threat, scout the enemies locations and numbers, analyze their killboard? 3) do you contact your entire membership with a plan for winning the war, even if winning means just surviving without heavy losses or do you just tell everyone to dock up? 4) do you make sure you and your membership have no obvious weak points at which to be attacked? do you put your pos defenses online? do you move fuel, ships and ammunition into position to ride out an interdiction? 5) do you have standing agreements with other like minded alliances to join your wars as allies? do you ally with other alliances who have been wardecced to help them out in their time of need? 6) do you set traps that appear to be unprotected mining or mission runner activities but are really well protected and overpowering forces ready to snap up an inprudent attacker? or do you ask ccp to do the work for you? eve allows you to play in perfect safety. just don't undock. but if you choose to come out of station then you have to realize that there is someone waiting to kill you, burn your ships, destroy your corp and laugh at your outraged cries. corp identity means nothing if its not based on protecting the corp. your wealth means nothing if its just sitting in your wallet and not invested in the tools necessary to keep your organization in one piece. maybe they should just make it much more difficult to form a corp or alliance so only people capable of leading them are able to push that button. the bottom line is this. many if not most highsec corps and alliances do not deserve to survive. if a wardec pushes it into a failure cascade it was too flawed to exist. most highsec ceos do significant damage to their members, especially the new players, through a combination of bad information, self serving direction of corp assets and just plain ruining the fun of playing the game (really? dock up for a week is good advice?). pvpers blast those corps apart, expose the inadequacies of the leadership and, believe it or not, convince a not insignificant fraction of the new players that pvp is not only fun but available to them right away. we just have to pry them out of the grasping hands of their carebear leaders. by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"
12/27/2014,"serious question.do you hate babies like sabriz does?or do you understand that babies never ever cry and scream for nogood reason and simply have no other way of communicating their needs and problems?i am definitely not going to vote for a human being that is so low and hatefull as to think thatbabies scream for no other reason than ""just so"".thanks."
12/27/2014,thanks for the upswags
12/27/2014,"as someone who also spend a large amount of time training new players, i am very interested in some of your ideas. i have repeatedly heard the argument that awoxing affects new players, but in my year of experience recruiting newbros to a variety of corps, i have yet to recruit someone who has actually awoxed a member of my corp or organization. what percentage of applicants are you encountering that have malicious intent and actually make this an issue? obviously i'm just asking for a rough estimate, but i'm trying to figure out why people see this as such as issue for new players. my experience is that corps that recruit new players are targeted, but the new players in the said corps almost never are. have you found something different?also, do you have any opinions on the state of w-space currently?founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/27/2014,"correct me if i am wrong, but isn't this how many corps (especially with significant assets) handle new members in wh, null and perhaps low security space? why should the good highsec corps with significant assets be any different? i am all for improvements to corp and pos management that would allow allow better granularity of control (and simpler) to help integrate newer members into a corp more readily, but the issues with trusting new members exists in all spaces and will still exist in highsec even if intracorp aggression is removed from the game."
12/27/2014,"could you please expand on your thoughts on upcoming changes? its hard to support someone on corp history alone.founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/28/2014,"they specifically exist to circumvent the loathsome presence of concord. there is an answer to making wars worth something.and that answer is not to screw over pvp players like you're trying to do.it's to make player corps worth defending. to do that, you have to take away a lot from npc corps, which are too attractive in comparison.there already is one. you get to shoot back, for free. if you choose not to, then it's your fault that your opponent has no risk. your risk aversion's consequences are not the fault of the game mechanics.why should people's desire to find people to kill be made ""pointless""? their playstyle deserves to exist as much as yours does. moreso, since they're actually interacting with other players."
12/28/2014,all of the above except 1) as 99% of the time its some bulls&*t reason for the war and the terms are ridiculous.even after all that preparation no war targets turn up as theyre hanging on the undock in jita.having done the above week in week out some we fight others we don't...usually the same corporations who dock up when we field a fleet just what is the point...make it that the aggressor has to bring a fight and that its worth the indi guys fighting atm theres no incentive but tears which the indi / pve pilots just avoid by ship spinning or playing alts...nice speech. added nothing to the argument but nice rant..
12/28/2014,"whether i do or do not won't change my ability as a csm nor should it reflect on sabriz overly much. however, to answer, crying takes effort and that requires motivation; attention, food, discomfort for examples.now, onto a topick everyone loves:cloaks.we can see when structures are going online right across the system. sov holders needs a structure they can online and wipes out all cloaks for a given time.give plenty of warning to cloakers to log off or run. a way to annoy them as much as they bug us.edit: can even announce it in local: ""de-cloaker coming online in xx minutes"""

12/29/2014,+ 1 now this a pvp barrier
12/29/2014,"i disagree, there are still battle reports coming out, still violence being done. it does put up a barrier against a specific type of pvp, the hotdrop of redonculous proportions where bored super pilots hit a miner with dreadnaughts. but a barrier making null peace and sunshine and lollipop wielding carebears?nuh uhmmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/29/2014,i think it impacts the player that does not have 4-5 accounts accounts when you live in a region and have to travel from isk hunting grounds to join fleets reduces speed of form ups ect. ect.
12/29/2014,perhaps this is more about how many blues you have chosen to surround yourself with?
12/29/2014,"if i live on a mountain i should not complain about the lack of waterfront property.if you live deep within a blue part of space you cannot complain that we have removed the easy button of cross galaxy teleportation and you now have to commute or even move to where the action is. you cannot be both safe and a threat.but as has been said before and i will probably say a lot more often. this is one step in a process. you are complaining you cannot live in a house that does not even have walls yet. give ccp the time to make all the changes, i will still be here to listen to you comment, compliment, or complain but i am looking at the long game, not how things are perceived to be in the short run.no more than i complain that a house is drafty when they still haven't installed the roof or windows. mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/29/2014,"so you agree theyre just used to engage in high sec to avoid the criminal system no other purpose or objective.why are we screwing the pvper over it would be making the war more active ....moreso if the indi corps and pve corps where able to actually get on with what they prefer to do...your ships, ammo..mods everrthing would become cheaper....making pvp more affordable...plus your pve mains could go about their business too....most high sec pvpers we encounter don't pvp they just gank solo miners , haulers etc turn out a fleet and they dock and jump back to a trade hub.maybe that's an answer remove npc corp options..but how do you make a player corp worth fighting for? currently most effective way to end a war is not log in! how can that be right?again why shoot back its partly what the purpose of declaring war in high sec is about...to get fights theres nothing to motivate the indi/pve pilot to do sothe suggestions make the kills have a purpose moreso by the war actually being about an objective a true victory with some means of reward each kill or defense means something ..."
12/29/2014,"what are you talking about? that is the purpose, to get rid of concord in a specific engagement.first of all, i do not have a pve main, because i have some self respect.secondly, putting handcuffs and conditions on being able to declare war is unacceptable. you do not get to lobby to curtail other people's freedom as players just because you're unable to deal with them in the game.thirdly, ganking miners and haulers is pvp by definition. you do not get to derogate and disqualify an activity just to fit your agenda.the most effective way to end a war is to dec dodge. and that isn't right. but to answer your question, to make player corps worth fighting for, player corps should be made the only path available for optimal gameplay. npc corps should carry enough penalties for any character older than 30 days that to remain in one is not economically viable.that by itself makes a player corp something valuable, something worth defending.see the above. if they are economically hampered by not being in a player corp, then they have something to defend. you say that, but what you really want is to put ""conditions"" on my actions, taking away my player freedom to benefit yourself. i see what your true objective is, and it's certainly not game balance."
12/29/2014,"this, so much this. it's what all these types of threads are about.i dislike many other activities in eve, such as mining, industry, markets etc. people are constantly beating me at pvp in those areas. sure i make a bit of isk now and then in the market, but no where near as much as many others.should i complain to ccp and ask for changes to those fields, so i can compete? or should i look for other ways to avoid heavy losses that may require a little more work?well it will not be the former, simply because i know the game is pvp centric. all players compete in everything in the game. just because i'm not good at a certain aspects of the game, doesn't give me the right to ask for those parts to be nerfed in my favour.so like i said. you and they, see themselves as 8 year pve veterans. but i guarantee they are 8 year pvp ones. destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
12/29/2014,i must say isnt it the miners and builders that make the pvp ships.start a cartel and raise the prices of them ships they use to kill you in drastically more expensive in certain areas make them pay for there modules.
12/29/2014,"i don't see removing awoxing a barrier for pvp it will just make pvpers have a bit if organisation about them, actually show there skills , i would not call awoxing and war decing people who cant defend them selves pvp to be honest,come to 0.0 lets get wrecked"
12/29/2014,"with talks about destructible stations on the cards in the near future and eve online declaring that its likes the real world aspect in the game player driven economy.it seems null will have to become a self driven place i would like to see that if an alliance takes a station ,they own that station, and should be able to reclaim all the assets in that station that does not belong to the alliance.wouldn't that be sweet would be a lot better for every one involved would truly make null the ultimate place.because i just see the destructible stations as a huge money stint if ccp just said yeah now you can destroy them there has to be more though in the process obviously as it is a subscription based game and people would get upset if there 1-10 years playing went up in smoke would create many tears.i would like to see many views on this, i was just thinking out aloud but would like to see other views and ideas around this.regardsminnie"
12/29/2014,as sugar has said the recordings normally get posted in the orginal threads and also on blogs as well as us tweeting them. we might be able to sort a site for them to all be put up in one convenient place.yeah there is always some circular talk its one of the things thats hard to not have when you have people from different areas of the game with different views we try to move stuff on. its still in the early stages so a work in progress.
12/29/2014,"i don't really mind you stealing my catch phrase as it cannot be said often enough, although an attribution would be nice for my publicity loving self. however, i do object to you following it with a sentiment that is the exact opposite of what it means. fight back. do something to win the conflict between you and your enemies. think about what he has and what you have and turn the odds in your favor. if you won't fight then you deserve what is done to you. we in the new order and our supporters are fighting for highsec, fighting against those who would ruin it, make it into a safe, quiet, uninteresting isk faucet. those like you. your campaign boils down to ""destroy highsec aggression"". like thousands before you you only claim to want to make it even, just a little more balanced, just one more nerf. and unfortunately, highsec has received these nerfs. but the carebears keep dying. and so here you are, asking for more because the carebears will never accept less than total safety. its a desparate battle for the soul of the game. after enormous setbacks we are finally turning the corner. highsec will be saved... even if we have to kill every carebear to do it.bing bangboomagent of the new order of highsecbelligerent undesirable by choosing to mine in new order systems, highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct. www.minerbumping.com"

12/29/2014,"thanks to cap stable for the opportunity to drill down in my program for csm x. a few things about stuff i said,that i wanted to clarify- i mentioned combat cov ops, i meant combat recons. oopsie.- i want to adjust my terminology, to represent solo players and micro-corps, rather tham small corps. i believe small corps and small gangs already have had representation in the csm (ripart teg comes to mind...), and have slightly different agendas. the solo players and corps composed of only a handful of players fit better into the denomination of micro-corps.- on the question about if i could change one thing in the game, i went with the way interceptors can stay under the one second tic align, and travel too easily across new eden. i think there is a more important issue that unfortunately did not come to my mind immediately, but it is about afk cloaky camping. i believe that this practice is detrimental to the game, and i would change that by having cloaked pilots not show in local, and unable themselves to see local or to use d-scan while cloaked.merci <U+FFFD> cap stable pour cette opportunit<U+FFFD> d'approfondir les <U+FFFD>l<U+FFFD>ments de mon programme pour le csm x.il y a quelques d<U+FFFD>tails que je souhaite clarifier- j'ai parl<U+FFFD> de combat covert ops, je voulais dire combat recon. oopsie.- je souhaite ajuster ma terminology, et repr<U+FFFD>senter les joueurs solos et les micro-corps, plut<U+FFFD>t que les petits groupes. je pense que les petits groupes ont d<U+FFFD>j<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>t<U+FFFD> repr<U+FFFD>sent<U+FFFD>s dans le csm (ripart teg est un exemple...), et ont un agenda l<U+FFFD>g<U+FFFD>rement diff<U+FFFD>rent. les joueurs solos et les corporations compos<U+FFFD>es uniquement d'une poign<U+FFFD>e de joueurs sont mieux repr<U+FFFD>sent<U+FFFD>s par l'appelation micro-corp.- sur la question si je pouvais changer quelque chose dans le jeu, j'ai r<U+FFFD>pondu au sujet des intercepteurs qui peuvent s'aligner en dessous de la seconde, rendant leurs d<U+FFFD>placements dans new eden trop facile. je pense qu'il y a un probl<U+FFFD>me plus important qui malheureusement ne m'ai pas venu <U+FFFD> l'esprit imm<U+FFFD>diatement, au sujet des campeurs cloaky afk. je pense que cette pratique est d<U+FFFD>trimentale pour le jeu, et le changement que je soutiendrais serait que les pilotes cloaked/invisibles n'appara<U+FFFD>traient pas en local, et seraient incapables de voir les autres joueurs en local et ne pourraient pas utiliser leur d-scan."
12/29/2014,"as i said in an earlier post, i like mike, but i do have an issue with one specific highsec activity, incursions. mike, do you feel that the rewards for incursions match the risk as well as the effort required? do you feel incursion income is properly balanced with even other highsec activities like missions or mining?what about the balance between highsec and lowsec incursions, do you feel the balance is in the right place there?csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate @two_step_eve on twitter my blog"
12/29/2014,"you woudl have to ask my fleet members how i run comms in a fleet, i can asure you comms can be horrible, outside eve it doesnt fall under any rules except what people feel acceptable. comms can be fun, rude, u name iti stand for open comms where people can speak up and where u can laugh, i make it a habbit of avoiding personal attacks and taking time to explain stuff. in providence your fleeg size is a reflection of how you behave toeards othersas we dont use participation stats, hardly any cta or anything. i fleet daily 100 people of free will for hours, u shoudl ask them, as i find it hard to judge my own behaviour on comms.if your question is if i am homofobic, racist, or anything that is not considerd common sense and behaviour the ander is i am not, i am dutch, raised by a stepdad who is gay, divorced parents i love, and a big fan of live and let live. being a father of 4 kids nad maybe a age thing at 42 i find respect important, but at the same time its a game and can be hilariously rude, as long as its not personali hope this answers your question, if not convoy me in game"
12/29/2014,again +1 for core!! keep up the good work :)
12/29/2014,"easily top 3 on my list.good luck manny, p sure you'll get enough backing though.my question: any ideas on how to pull (non-tier3) battlecruisers out of the dumpster balance-wise?just leaving these two here, because i think they're maybe worth a lookprom has an idea which i think has some merit, where you'd rebalance mjd functionality to be a script for regular mwd, only loadable if you're in a ship type that can use mjd. so bcs would not have to use an extra slot and fitting resources to get mjd functionality."
12/29/2014,the problem is t3's are better than everything in the current meta so looking at bc's and lol command ships is pointless. because when ccp nerfed nanos years ago they made it so signature radius was everything.bombers are the problem to tier 3 bcs and most sniper platforms. well in fact pretty much every concept is plagued by bombers. what ccp fails to understand is that a few things way out of balance cast ripples through the rest of the game. combat probing - it is so hilariously easy. anyone with the most basic skills can probe and get a warp to 0 result on a hostile fleet every 10 seconds. this automatically hampers fleet tactics. bombers - the literal cancer of nullsec pvp. cripples doctrine choices.tl ; dr - the word battle does not belong in battlecruiser in its current form its more like lolgethazednerdcruiser&getarealship
12/29/2014,i have been traveling over the holidays and will endeavor to respond to questions in the next day or two. apologies.

12/30/2014,"if this was the case you'd rarely even see war-decs, of course big merc corporations/alliances would still declare war on big alliances (goonswarm for example). but small corp war-decs would rarely be seen, jita would be a big theme park."
12/30/2014,"i think the op has selective reading, similar to selective hearing. i was unaware ccp decided on which of the two types they said they were considering. im not even going to both reading that massive tower of text he wrote."
12/30/2014,"shares purchase is a part of the background story even in evelopedia.serpentis took control of outer ring excavations with shares for example.it's another realistic way to take control.and not only with war power.csm, please, could you study and propose to ccp to plan the ability to :- buy/sell npc shares,- buy/sell pc shares ?thanks for your answers.best regards."
12/30/2014,given the abuse shares seem to hold i think if we drove for change the change would be removal.for the stocks to go public there would tave to be voting and non voting shares (as some corps irl have) and this was brought up at the summer summit

12/30/2014,"first post updated somewhat. i like shakira's voice, some people boycott her because of her beliefs. they are irrelevant, i feel she is good at her profession."
12/30/2014,"i don't think either jen or sabriz have any issue in dealing with newer folk who are eager to learn. any baby labeling is likely to be pointing out that a person is being difficult to work with. but this is a forum post about jenshae chiroptera, not sabriz adoudel."
12/30/2014,"oh. i might have missed his meaning.this would throw some context on his comments then.i certainly don't have anything against new people, i used to run a group in ao that was focused on helping new players; bit like eve university."
12/30/2014,"1. i think your negative voting analysis is flawed. i see it as a tool that has the potential to be used by bigger blocks to exert more control over the csm. i am willing to wager that 90% of the down votes on reddit are from people who do not have an active eve online account (reddit being the closest system i can imagine to the one you are proposing)2. if a player chooses to load racial bs 1 into a skill queue and then go and play gta or minecraft until the skill is learned in game, making the skill queue longer or deeper will not help them. providing more in game information on how ships can be used and their weaknesses and strengths to new players will be more beneficial than inserting extra time sinks.3. i don't think alpha is major problem in large scale fleet fights. fcs like alpha because it is a counter to logistics that can be used by the vast majority of pilots, where as jamming, damping etc are more specialised roles, thus forming a fleet of 250 takes much less time if the doctrines used are cookie cutter simple. nerfing alpha will mean a shift in the blob that creates a new op that suits the blob.4. your logistics absorb module has ramifications for high security space that i do not think you have thought about. 5. wormholes were designed as a niche entity - creating more and creating ones specifically for frigates will help create new niches. i think the frig holes are a counter to unscannable recons. the change allows easier hunting of loot pi<U+FFFD>atas while providing a safer option for wh newbies.6. i believe your assumptions regarding ganking are incorrect, ganking has become harder over the last 5 years with insurance removal, concord changes, while mining ships and haulers have received buffs that enable a competent pilot a greater ability to influence the outcome of any conflict. 7. i am not sure why clocking needs changing. how is it broken?"
12/30/2014,"1. it is two fold. need announcements as local ""motd"" and on the launcher of the possibility. only way to really know is to try it.2. having some skill requirements such as for t2 tank modules, would give them more of an indictator and if they are playing actively by them more time to learn.3. check fleet compositions. note how in the news whole wings and fleets of ewar are blown away.4. i have written in various places about fleet mechanics and coalitions being recognised in the mechanics.5. worm holes weren't even meant to be settled. the strength was that you could stick a growing corp / alliance in there as an incubator, control access and grow. now you can't keep the scanning ships out so all the small entities have no hope.6. look at a kill board.7. afk hot droppers."
12/30/2014,"if i only could discuss this subject let's say, i agree with most of the forum members about this subject. fyi : applications for csm10 on january, 30th and the elections themselves will happen on february, 25th."

12/30/2014,"effort and training . . . i, and a lot of the incursion folks, i have talked with would love to see incursions get a make over, more variance, updated, etc. as for balance . . . how would you suggest we compare them to l4's or mining? one cannot afk an incursion, one cannot solo an incursion, a newish player with low sp will need the support of a lot of other people with more skills to survive an incursion. so should incursion income be on par with l4's? no.i would love for scout sites to be redone . . . heavily redone. to give newer small groups a taste of what is to come, just as l1's slowly build to l2's and so on.as for lowsec? hell, yes, that needs a buff to income to balance out the same level of training as needed in high along with increased risk and the shift to t1 fits and less blingy ships which slows down the income rate. i also would like to see some mechanism that keeps the movement of the lowsec incursions from being so large from one to the next as they have a much harder time doing the migration after an incursion closes.you never specified what your 'issue with incursions is'. i presume it is that they make too much isk for too little effort?if so do you also think that we should take a serious look at other income streams that exceed that income and are shown to also be relatively low risk?"
12/30/2014,"hi mike,what are your thoughts about risk-free looting of yellow wrecks in highsec by ""laundering"" the loot using a fleet hangar? are you okay with this and if so, why? if not, would you try to push for a change?in case you don<U+FFFD>t know what i<U+FFFD>m talking about, it works like this: gankers gank a hauler/freighter and the resulting wreck is of course yellow. to loot the wreck risk-free they use 2 characters: the first one sits in a ship with a fleet hangar (deep space transport or orca), the second one can be an alt without any skills in a noobship. both warp to the yellow wreck and the char in the noobship loots the stuff from the yellow wreck by putting it directly into the fleet hangar. the result is that the noobship goes suspect, the dst/orca however does not and can warp off safely carrying the loot. given the size of the fleet hangar of a dst, even ships up to bs size can be looted without any additional risk (compared to a blue wreck).thanks,sarah"
12/30/2014,"this is funny, so obvious once it is pointed out. the easiest would be to make someone under the criminal flag unable to transfer good in or out of a hold but then that would hit the guys who refit on the fly with mobile depots.out of curiosity, what would you have happen? make the possession of the looted goods a yellow offense or make transfer of the same impossible? gold does no crimes, has no guilt. does anyone ever gank the orca that holds the stolen goods? or is the immediate presence of concord make that an impossibility?on the larger side . . . i think that crimewatch/bounties/wardecs and all associated with it are about due for a re-examination. this is the hisec equivalent of sov, after all. it is the rules hisec lives and dies by.this one does go in my book (i keep a book of things to ask ccp) but i have no idea if it will get much traction.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"
12/30/2014,"my issue is not too much isk for too little effort, but more for too little risk. especially with the complete lack of randomness in incursion spawns, the only real risk to a player in a good incursion group is the slight risk of ganking and probably the more real risk of falling asleep.i do think the reward is far too high, and especially because unlike just about any other high reward activity (wormholes, exploration, whatever), incursions don't suffer from any scarcity. if one wants to, they could pretty much run incursions 23.5/7 (unless the incursion folks are having an argument again and prematurely finishing the incursions). they are also very one-dimensional, unlike in w-space where one has to scan, pvp, fuel poses, people can really specialize in incursion running, and just do that. they don't even need to haul loot out, just stop over in a hub for ammo every now and then.and yeah, any other source of income that is high reward and low risk should be looked at very closely. if that hits w-space, fine. i don't think you can really make the argument that it is low risk though.csm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate @two_step_eve on twitter my blog"
12/30/2014,"we are indeed looking into changing the age requirements for the csm. more information about this and other changes will be included in the candidacy opening blog, which will be published on january 30th as i mentioned here. at this point i can assure you that bobmon will not have any age related issues with his csmx campaign."
12/30/2014,thank you!
12/30/2014,"see, it's this sort of stuff that makes me feel like you don't actually know what you are talking about. when you sit out-side of a pos shield, your ship itself is at risk, you can be bumped, or even another ship can wedge between you, giving enough time for a sufficient group to get into system to kill you. a sensible titan pilot can neut out a hictor that doesn't sit outside 30km, and warp off or jump, or more importantly, he can not throw himself into situations that he is wide open to be caught on his own. like any other ship, his best defence is common sense. just like how all it takes to permanently pin down any supercarrier is 2 hictors. they can't clear them 'no problem' if there is more than 1, because you can't directly ecm burst a hictor (it tries to jam everyone except the target you fire at), and you assign your fighters to one? he warps a short distance, then comes back, and your fighters are off in that stupid warp schenanigans for ages meanwhile the other hictor has you pointed, which you cannot ecm burst. or you could split 5 fighters on each, and not take either one down quickly. the reason that carriers and supercarriers get used so much is the way that their capital remote assistance modules make the fleet exponentially more powerful. by attempting to defang supers by lowering their drone tracking, etc, you ignore the real issue, leaving them as giant triage units that create invincible tanks. not to mention tracking is meaningless. when fleets have lokis or rapiers on grid, stuff is webbed and painted, to where titan guns can hit a battleship with ease. but you know this right? you're in pl, afterall. as for making fighters affected by warp bubbles, it would be interesting, but i wonder how difficult it would be for ccp to code it. every once in a while there is someone asking for fighters and fb to be affected by warp disruptors/scramblers.as for csm accessibility, why not follow sugar kyle and corbexx's lead, and actually do so? make yourself available and accessible to hear the views of others, to help put forward what the community wants, by listening to the community. have a public chat channel where people can reach you. most of the playerbase hates the forums, or hates posting on them/avoids them/treats them like they don't exist, but ingame people will mail you, or hop into a channel and talk. really, at this point, your campaign comes across as ""we need to force players to care about the csm, so that i can make these changes that i want happen"". as for the whole age schenanigans, it'll be interesting to see how ccp rules, though i think eve has a lot less potential for voting in 14 year olds that would turn the csm into a farce that quickly loses any of the respect that they have been working hard to gain over the past couple years. going back to the supercarriers issue for a moment, i think that looking at the resists of supers would be a far more sensible solution. supers should have a ton of hp, yes, but they should not have exponential tanks with the presence of more and more supers on grid. how do we address this, nerfing super blobs but not individual supers? kill their resists. i can't remember his name, 'that guy with the solo phoenix pvp videos' made an excellent post talking about how if supercapital ehp was all shifted into actual armor and shield (or structure) hitpoints, with their resists being nuked, they would still take just as long to kill in small gangs, but wouldn't become nearly unkillable in giant super/slowcat gangs. all the negativity aside, i wish you luck with your campaign. the csm is a huge time investment for those who take the job seriously, and it's admirable that you show the interest to do so."
12/30/2014,"good to hear, as being older doesn't make you any better then a younger someone. in my opinion 18+ should do fine."
12/30/2014,"everybody will have their own way to fix issues, in the end i just answerd to the question with my opinion, which remains that assigning fighters (whos tracking is horrific op atm) is just to safe atm. yes, you can be bumped off but even ''me being in pl""' will admit saying that if something on a pos shield then it becomes 100 times harder to succesfully kill. also why should a ship being able to fight without being on field itself?the reason why capital rr and such is to powerfull is become its so much better then the other ''logi'' ships. a solution would by my idea for the role of logistics. have it so that every ship size (frigates t/m battleships) have a t2 logistics variant, that support their ship size so: cruiser logi for cruiser fleets and bs logi for bs fleets. doing this will make a ladder system and so the capital mods will be less outsized then it is now. i'm currently still on vacation, will sit down and look at your ehp thing when i get home!i will be writing a full idea list on en24 later, and then i will find the best way to get in touch with people (create a ingame channel or so). everybody is welcome ofcourse to send me a mail at: bobmon.eve@gmail.com - bobmon (ingame) - twitter and ofcourse you can convo me!"
12/30/2014,"**** posterbut good man, glad you're running again. one of my top candidates for sure"
12/30/2014,"this is a pretty broad question, so if i leave something out that you're interested in talking about in more depth, just let me know!i've always been an optimist, even when it concerns eve, so i'm very much looking forward to the upcoming changes. i think we're getting some solid improvements and some interesting tweaks. recons - i'm interested to see how this is going to play out. with the shorter release cycles, if the dscan change doesn't provide fun and engaging gameplay, i'd sincerely hope that it's removed similarly to teams. i am happy to see the pilgrim get a little love. tech three destroyers - again, this is going to be an interesting area to keep an eye on, but i'm happy that ccp is taking a step into totally new directions - and how often have you seen threads about creating new destroyers? sovereignty - mostly, i'm ecstatic that corporations and alliances are being worked on. i doubt we'll have a perfect system in the first pass, but it's imperative that ccp sprinkle in quality of life changes that make the game easier to play without making the game necessarily easier. in all, eve is in a very pivotal period in its history. the game has perhaps never been better, from a potential standpoint, and it's important that we continue to push ccp towards the vision that supports exciting, dynamic, and fun gameplay. a small part of me does fear that ccp may try to cut a few corners, especially when it comes to the major gameplay elements of sovereignty and poses, but the effort they're putting into gathering player feedback on these subjects does seem to herald a bright future.if we make sure progress continues."
12/30/2014,"i love the new asset search windows, which can now search through containers.something i would love would be the ability to search through my assets that are in poss in addition to just what i have in stations. do you plan to address assets and posses as csm suzy rc mudstone?"
12/31/2014,itt: massive amounts of not getting the point.the point: slowing down any entities ability to move large masses of forces over long distances in a timeframe that directly inhibits the aggressing parties ability to cause reasonable damage before defenders arrive.the reason: because leaving space assets undefended or under-defended should have penalties. the previous mode of gameplay allowed a given capital to travel from one side of the eve cluster to the other in 12 minutes. regional defence as a concept was a total joke because any act of aggression would be met with almost immediate retaliation.the solution and why it works: the solution we received was to slow down how defending forces respond to an attack. if a given front was under-staffed by defence forces then flanking actions could be utilised to *divide* the enemy and *conquer* them as smaller partitions of their larger force. the game under the new model changed from being a super-hotdrop disco to requiring a much more indepth degree of strategy and tactics. this is why major null groups withdrew from their greater borders so quickly. because they knew that strategically the amount of space they controlled was undefendable and that tactically they would need to station their forces more locally to their income generating sources in order to defend them properly.i can't believe this basic idea still needs to be spelt out for people. if you've failed to grasp this idea and make it work then it shows that your institution suffers from very weak planning. you clearly are living in an environment that is more complex than the organisms within it (i.e. you).
12/31/2014,a succint explaination of the reason for the long distance travel changes.
12/31/2014,"did not read all... but..*flashes 10.5 year vet badge*back in my day, we had to go 15km to the gate before we could jump... both ways... in the midst of gate camps...and we never heard of this thing called a jb. you kids have it easy.remove jb.htfu-1"
12/31/2014,"now a more serious reply:as already stated, jump fatigue is just stage one of changes. we don't fully know what all of them will be, or how they will effect whats going on. if for example ccp does no sov at all, that you don't claim anything, then this changes all game play fully. if they do occupational type sov and make it so you can produce things locally with easy, then this will have another effect.what you are doing is you have your face pressed right up to the glass of one of them murual type pictures (the picture that is made up of smaller pictures) looking at a single picture going 'wow... this sucks... why would anyone pay for this pos?' where as, when ccp starts telling you what is coming, that will most likely be like someone comes up to you and goes 'dude... take like 6 steps back and then look' now you will see the whole. and go ""oh! now i get it!"" you could still yea ""yea but that's still crap, but i get the idea""that's the issue. jump fatigue is not going to go away. its part of a whole. and as the whole picture starts to take shape, ccp might modify jump fatigue till it fits into the large picture. stop playing eve like its a day game, and look at it in concepts of years, and you will shrug off jump fatigue as until you see the whole thing, you can't really judge.also... use gates. or there are these awesome things that came out in 09 called wormholes. you prolly have one a few jumps form you right now, and it might lead you to 3 from jita in 2 jumps.. and cost you no jump fatigue. who would of thought?"
12/31/2014,"please stop pretending you somehow have the 'right' to player freedom. because, like freedom of speech, if you have that right, so does everyone else. turning that around; war deccers are taking away the player freedom of those who do no enjoy pvp to benefit those who do enjoy it.this is an endless loop of biased opinions going round and round. the pvpers like the current mechanics because it gives them easy targets. the non-pvpers hate the current mechanics because they're essentially being griefed to sh*t over and over without any means of properly defending themselves (with the added note that, no, fighting back does not equal defending).but if you want to pull the 'player freedom' card, fine. if the attackers can have the 'player freedom' to declare a random indy corp their b*tch for a week. then the defenders should have the 'player freedom' to say 'f*ck you, go bother someone else' and slam the door shut in their face. if the defenders manage to achieve some sort of quota, objective, however you want to go about it, the war ends. period. if the attackers want to prevent that from happening they'll have to do more than play station games the moment a serious threat undocks.that is balanced gameplay and gives both sides the player freedom you want so badly."
12/31/2014,"you seem to have the all-too-comon misperception that there this game has pvp and non-pvp in it. this is wrong. everything is pvp - eve is purported to come from everyone vs. everyone. practically everything you do is in competetion with other players, not just direct ship-to-ship combat. you are playing in a competetive sandbox where your actions affect me and everyone else, and therefore everyone else needs to be able to affect your gameplay.what you are asking is akin to showing up to a baseball game and telling the umpire that your team only wants to bat so you can score runs, but not to take the field because you don't enjoy that ""play style"". eve has a set of rules that include you being attacked by wardec, messed with, stolen from, suicide ganked, your profits market pvped away, your asteroids mined out from under you and numerous other ways that players can compete for power and resources. you do not get to isolate yourself from the sandbox because you deem yourself a ""non-pvper"".practically all the forms of competetion in this game are ""non-consensual"" in the sense you don't get to pre-arrange your ""fights"" be them industrial production, the race for pve sites, market pvp, or a lowsec roam. wardecs are valid way to engage with other players and can happen because of competetion for markets or asteroid/ice belts, because someone ran their mouth off, completely predatory in the hunt for a ransom, or just for fun - the reason doesn't matter - if you are going to make a corporation to pursue an profit-making venture you have to defend it. that is what a competetive sandbox is all about. wardecs cannot be made completly opt-in and consensual as you are asking, or the sandbox breaks. besides, we already have duels and intracorp agressions (for now) for completly consensual highsec combat. now i am not saying wardecs are perfect - the current mechanic is far from perfect - but as a game design principle they need to be in the game. but take a look at the devblog about the most recent changes to the wardec mechanic to see how they were at least envisioned to work. you are suppose to defend your corp and its assets, either by yourself, or by hireing mercenaries to do that for you. there cannot be a way to ""end the war"" without the consent of the aggressor, or what is the point of the mechanic in the first place?eve gives a large amount of player freedom, but you are not free to play in isolation of the other players - that is what a sandbox is all about. you are free to play eve how you like, but that doesn't mean the way you like should be the optimal way to play. the game is structured to make it better to play in groups and with friends - you can play solo but don't expect it to be the easiest way. so recruit some ship pvp players to your corp, make an arrangement with another combat corp to defend you in exchange for some of your industry, hire mercenaries to defend your corp, do anything other than coming to the forums and begging for increased safety so you can make isk for yourself risk-free. play the game."
12/31/2014,"please read my posts again. never have i said that wardecs should be removed or that pvp should be a choice. all i said is that the way they currently work is stupid. that includes the notion that the agressor should have all the power to end or prolong the wardec.there can be a way for the defender to end the wardec perfectly fine. obviously it shouldn't be something that can be done from the safety of a station. the defender will have to go out and they will have to fight the enemy to accomplish some sort of objective. but if the defender wants to make an effort at ending the wardec then that option should be available as long as they're willing to work for it.this works two fold, because it gives the defender an actual reason to fight a fight they do not want to be involved in, which actually gives the attacker more to shoot. at the same time it gives the defender a shot at ending the war early if that's what they desire. it gives both sides a reason to fight instead of just the attacker, which is ultimately more fun for everyone. certainly more fun than the current situation where the defender has absolutely no incentive to even go out and fight."
12/31/2014,"i read your posts and you a proposing very ""un-eve""-like artifical victory conditions for wardecs. as i indicated this is quite silly, as there can be quite varied ""victory condtions"" for the aggressor - perhaps he wants kills, but perhaps he just wants to disrupt supply lines or to remove pocos, or just wants to be paid to end the dec, or maybe just because he doesn't like you and wants to make a point. eve is a complex sandbox and reasons for all actions including wardecs cannot be pigeonholed easily so making wardecs into some sort of pvp battleground with defined victory conditions is a poor idea. what is needed is some way to actually make the defenders want to defend their corp and assets. make more things like pocos that improve all aspect of industry and pve so are valuble but vulnerable. then intrinsically the defender has to fight or lose their assets and the bonuses they provide. besides even if you had an artificial mechanism to end the war early, a determined attacker that wanted to disrupt your corp would just use multiple wardeccing corps to do it so i am not sure what you think you will solve with this.being in a wardec is not the end of the world. your time in eve should not just be spent trying to get out of them - if you pick one up fight a bit, you might find out you like it. or if not, then just adopt ""war-time"" proceedures and adapt to it. compete with them as was designed."
12/31/2014,that is actually the point. war should cost the agressor substantially to initiate.
12/31/2014,"this is correct, ccp stated in the summer summit minutes they were thinking of either an occupancy based sov or a no sov system."
12/31/2014,"dear csm, dear mike,thanks for this answer.that are good news if csm already proposed the idea.for hostile takeovers, i think we must let it do as in a sandbox or in real corporations.in real life, there is a choice when a company issues stocks : non voting shares, voting shares, proportions, dividends.the company can protect itself deciding to issue limited proportion of voting shares and offering a interesting dividend or a price increase benefit if it works well. it's an example.all takeovers don't succeed in real life. i don't see any reason that it works differently in a sandbox. it's a complex mechanism between power and interest. you can be a rich company. but if the shareholders want to keep the power, they won't sell.in any case, it would bring a terrific extra dimension for this game.and it won't have negative cons<U+FFFD>quences on the pvp dimension. like in real life. at the opposite, they would interact. a war can have a effect on prices. a hostile takeover can provoke a war to keep the company like a ""nationalization"".a lot of fun so !"
12/31/2014,"have one of those afk hot droppers in my home system now. so, i am either going to do something else in eve, such as join a pvp fleet, (not really in the mood) or i will just go play another game. i would rather completely deny *) people like that a kill. you can argue that players should find a solution, then you will argue about how many people a null sec system can support .... and who the heck wants to keep many people on standby just to deal with one little *) child?if i have enough days like this, i simply suspend my account.i can not believe that ccp haven't found a solution to this in all these years. before one of those children says it; yes i am mad, mad as a hatter. *) *snip* please refrain from personal attacks. isd ezwal.^ ever looked at the editted post history and gone .... really?! i used the phrase ""attention deficient"" and this was deemed a personal attack. it might be in this context but i think people who plant *afk* cloaked hot droppers are attention deficient. they are buying tickets to attacks that they don't have the patience or more pointedly focused attention to hunt actively."
12/31/2014,"aw, what's wrong with having terrain? wh effects are very nearly the only terrain in the game. grand sky wizards were surely familiar with the effects in their home hole. they were probably taking full advantage of them.the difference between a high sec incursion fleet and one outside high sec is that the former can optimize for completion time with all kinds of shiny stuff, and the others have to compromise the pve efficacy of their fleets to accommodate the possibility of pvp. wormholes are null sec. if you field that kind of highly optimized shiny, you're accepting a very real risk of loss, which you can mitigate simply by flying cheaper and more pvp-capable ships, or by having some ships that can counter any likely attackers on standby at the pos for the subcap pilots to go back and get. rlmls, drones and smartbombs could all have slaughtered that fleet--maybe not before taking losses, but hey, that means a good fight instead of a one-sided slaughter.when my old corp were in whs, we never ran fleets that couldn't at least hold their own in a pvp fight until we had a chance to reship, and that was before the frigate holes existed."
12/31/2014,i have no problem with the black hole effects in whs. when i lived in a wh you could bait out a cloaky scanner or scan them down and kill them. big effort but once done it was done and system was clear.now you kick them out and they just keep coming in. no access control.
12/31/2014,"these seem like outstanding characteristics for csm representation in a game all about numbers. why are you running again? i don't judge people by their race, religion, color, size, age, gender, or ethnicity. i judge them by their grammar, spelling, syntax, punctuation, clarity of expression, and logical consistency."
12/31/2014,please refer to the first post in the thread if you are having difficulty remembering why it is i am running.
12/31/2014,"350m is pocket change? maybe for you out in null, but damn well not for high sec gankers. also, i think tengu is pointing out that going from -10 to 0 is not a ""reversal"" its starting fresh. quite a big difference there.founder of violet squadron, a small gang npsi community! mail me for more information."
12/31/2014,"im honestly putting tora and sabriz on my ballot, they can duke it out over the table.in the end ccp decides what goes on and looks to the csm for their experience and opinions."
12/31/2014,"oh sod off, 350m was nothing well before i was out in null. when you consider that the 350m isn't a recurring cost, it's a one off when you decide you want that character to be returned to legality, it means even less.and it's a reversal of the ""consequences"" if it can even be called that. i'm sure tengu will come up with all manner of excuses for why he's not wrong, but he understood what was being said and assumed that tags were expensive, because many gankers like to whine about how expensive they are so it sounds like they are hard done by.the short of it is that ganking is too easy and without consequence, hardly suited to the supposed ""hardcore"" nature of eve. gankers are just the carebears of pvp."
12/31/2014,"ganking is as easy or difficult as the victim makes it. you can nerf ganking repeatedly, as has been done over the years, but eventually you have to stop trying to blame something else for being the problem.what exactly do you find 'hardcore' about people in highsec being able to move around and interact with the game in complete and utter safety, which is brought closer by every nerf to ganking?gankingbenefit: possibility of making profit if you spend time organising a fleet, scouting a target, actioning the gank, getting lucky with loot fairy, and scooping loot successfully.consequences: can't undock in a ship for 15 mins after ganking, can't move around high sec freely without risk of being shot at, need to pay isk to restore sec statusanti-tank hauling + hauling/mining afkbenefit: don't need to be at keyboard, can haul significantly more cargoconsequences: at risk of being gankedall the people whining about code. want is their consequence removed, they can bleet on about how ganking is too easy (despite the vast majority of them having no experience on the subject) all they want, but it's basically a case of ""ccp, my activity is being impacted by someone else, please nerf them and buff me."""
12/31/2014,"bull. this is victim blame plain and simple. you people continuously state the gankees being it on themselves, and you know that's horseshit. whatever people did, you'd always find the weakest link and go for that, because you don't want a challenge. ganking should be possible, but it should be a meaningful choice with meaningful consequences and associated cost and risk. black pedro once suggested randomising concord timers for example. a change like that introduces a level of risk to ganking. you wouldn't just be able to pop a fit into a spreadsheet and say ""i need exactly x catalysts"". consequences are much harder with the existence of alts, but certainly there needs to be a downside to choosing to play the villain.i don't find it hardcore at all. i don't find any of eve to be hardcore. i hate this nonsense that somehow gankers are there providing some necessary service because high sec is ""too safe"", where realistically the whole game is as safe as you want it to be. a ganker is no more daring by using a disposable ship to gank a carebear.the loot fairy balances out over time to a steady income, as for the rest, yes, that's playing the game. believe it or not people don't log in already doing whatever action it is they play on doing. as for the consequences, you can't undock for 15 mins - so? that's not a consequence, that's a cost. if i triage a carrier i'm not going anywhere, and i'm actually at risk while i do so. it's not a consequence of triaging, it's a cost for choosing that action.can't move around highsec freely - you don't need to. a pod is effectively unstoppable, and you use alts to shift your gear around. you can eve take ships from an orca so you don't even need to undock a ship which is arguably the only time a gank ship is vulnerable.need to pay isk to restore sec status - this is the same thing as above, it's simply an alternative option to using alts. compared to how much gankers can make, it's a low price, and really only needs to be done once, when you've decided you don't want to gank anymore. as i said above, sec status is the only thing that even resembles consequences, yet it's both irrelevant and reversible.no, what they want is the understanding that just because you gank, you're not suddenly daring. you are just as much a carebear as an afk miner. most gankers are on disposable alts using disposable ships and disposable pods, so they can gank, then get back on with whatever it is you were doing on their mains. they are looking for easy, risk-free kills.when people say that ganking needs to be balanced, they mean just that. i know that the second that happens, your autism flairs up and you have this desperate need to attack people as if they are saying ""ganking should not be possible"", but that's not what's being said. ganking is far too easy and has no real consequences. it's carebear pvp. along with afk mining and many other mechanics, it needs to be balanced so the choice to take that path actually means something."
12/31/2014,"i'm going to all-but-quote something malcanis said on another forum: timers, in their pure form, are lazy design. build the delay into the gameplay somehow. he gave the example of a wormhole (which all gates/cynos essentially are) that was warped and convoluted and possibly dangerous, the more so the higher your jump fatigue is, instead of a little stopwatch ticking down in one corner. a current, in-game example: the switch from ""target ruin, wait for analyzer to cycle"" to the current minigame (which should be diversified and expanded, just sayin').for a brilliant example, albeit with very short cooldowns, watch (or play) some combat in dragon age: inquisition. your character isn't standing there like an idiot waiting to discharge his aoe buff again, he's twirling his staff and gesticulating and moving around like an active combatant. the cooldowns (more precisely, wind-ups) are built into the animations. it's very slick.if you want people to get stuck in a station for 15 minutes, fine, but at least try to pretend that there's an in-game holdup, and ideally there should be some gameplay attached to the holdup. nobody, not even the most ebil piwate, is playing the game to stare at an unchanging screen for 15 minutes while they do nothing."
12/31/2014,"well i am surprised to read what i read.my corp was a friend begginer corps who suffered a lot of a chain wardecs from marmites, i tried to spam many corps who where like insta wardecs by marmites, by you tora. we had a chat before you did it (wardec new corps we made). what happend ? 3 of my good friends left the corps after 2 months of marmites wardecs, and stoped eve slowly.so you are clearly a part of what you described. if it is an experience you made with your alilance, i think it was maybe a too long experience.i got simple suggestions about wardecs, they are part of the game and we need it. what doesnt work is : a corp can't join an alliance to get protection while the corp is wardec. this system is completly broken. you can just desable a new corp. this system has to be remooved.like every wars, wardecs has to have a real cost if you do it in the time. for exemple : you can wardec an corp /alliance, lets keep the actual low cost, no problems, but an extra week will cost : times 4 ---->200 million for the extra week. another week ? times for again : 1 billion . and so one... even in middle age (i know siege could be very long...) it was fukin expensiv. if you don't pursuit your wardec by paying the bill : then you can't wardec the corp/ alliance for 1 week. this is it. fair enough for wardecs corps who like it (and trust me i can understand it) fair enough to protect small corps.about suicide gankers i did a suggestion for making it really challenging in a post i did. simply : when you shoot someone, you loose 2.5 of ss. if you kill : you loose 10 ss. witch means you have to prepare your security status to do it. the actual system is way to simple and suicide gankers can almost chain what they do.what may happen ? less suicide gank, more poeple self confident who will transport more and more expensiv stuffs. everybody will be happy, more noob transport without too hard problems, more challenge for suicide gankers, and more loot for them, they will have to choose their targets carefully.//edit : what you propose, not being able to wardecs small corps (less than x poeple) is just the best way to protect and control small corps of poeple who makes wardecs, plus it is the best way, if you are the corp / alliance who receive the war to escape it.the best solution is to increase the cost for small corps : 100 million and same system but times 5 : 500 million the seconde week, 2.5 billion for the third week, 10 billion for a month of war.as simple as that."
12/31/2014,"that's cheaper than i've ever paid. besides, doing it once, sure that's fine. doing it repeatedly gets expensive fast. unless you wash your hands and never gank again, you will be paying it more than once."
12/31/2014,"i wish an excellent year 2015 to all capsuleers and fellow players of eve. i am convinced that 2015 will be a great year for eve, as ccp boldly moves forward with new changes (especially sovereignty changes) after showing to all that that there are no sacred cows anymore, outside of the fact that eve online must continue to remain the complex (but not just for the sake of complexity), challenging and overall captivating mmo that it currently has been for 10 years.the csm x will be in the position to accompany these changes and represent the current community in so doing. the mysteries of caroline's star, the unidentified invisible structures and roaming sleepers, the introduction of thera and non colonisable wormholes, the rule changes on clones upgrade, wormholes being more dangerous and exciting again, upgraded industry and uis, jump fatigue, graphic updates and many other recent changes have, in my mind, revitalised the game already.regardless of who ends up being elected, i salute my fellow candidates and wish whoever ends up being elected a great tenure on csm x in 2015.have a wonderful and fun new year's eve.je souhaite <U+FFFD> tous les capsuliers et joueurs de eve une excellente ann<U+FFFD>e 2015.je suis convaincu que 2015 seras une grande ann<U+FFFD>e pour eve online, et que ccp continuera de changer le jeu avec audace (en particulier les changements sur la souverainet<U+FFFD>) apr<U+FFFD>s avoir demontr<U+FFFD> qu'il n'y a plus de vaches sacr<U+FFFD>es, et que eve online doit continuer a rester le mmo complexe (mais sans <U+FFFD>tre inutilement complexe), exigeant et g<U+FFFD>n<U+FFFD>ralement captivant qu'il a <U+FFFD>t<U+FFFD> depuis dix ans. le csm x sera en place pour accompagner les changements <U+FFFD> venir, et repr<U+FFFD>senter la communaut<U+FFFD> dans ces nouvelles <U+FFFD>tapes. les myst<U+FFFD>res de l'<U+FFFD>toile de caroline, les structures non identifi<U+FFFD>es et invisibles et les dormeurs/sleepers itin<U+FFFD>rants, l'introduction de thera et des nouveaux trous de vers non colonisables, les changement de r<U+FFFD>gles sur la mise <U+FFFD> jour des clones, les trous de vers devenu plus dangereux et excitants <U+FFFD> nouveau, les am<U+FFFD>liorations de l'industrie et des interfaces utilisateurs, la jump fatigue, les am<U+FFFD>liorations graphiques et pleins d'autres changements r<U+FFFD>cents ont, pour ma part, d<U+FFFD>j<U+FFFD> revitalis<U+FFFD> le jeu (sans compter le support en fran<U+FFFD>ais).ind<U+FFFD>pendemment de qui seras <U+FFFD>lu au csm x, je salue les autres candidats and souhaite <U+FFFD> tout ceux qui seront <U+FFFD>lu un excellent mandat pour le csm x en 2015.passez tous une merveilleuse soir<U+FFFD>e du nouvel an."
12/31/2014,"a couple of things. i would love to know the metric you use to measure risk. so we could compare game styles in a objective way.you have everyone fueling pos's in your holes? you don't have people who 'take a job' and specialize in it? when i lived in a class 5 i knew how to scan but i left it to others better at it. when i run incursions i know how to do dps but i am better at logi though i will bring what the fc calls for.but why are we comparing apples and oranges? each type of gameplay is an option to choose with pluses and minuses. some choose the pvp route and complain that everyone makes more isk than them. other choose the trade which, if done properly, has little risk and huge returns. but you and i don't choose to do either of them, not because they are wrong or bad, they just are not for us. if incursions are the be all and end all why is everyone not doing them?yup, they are boring, you need skills, there are gankers and people who try to run them for 23.5/7 and fall asleep wiping a fleet, there is the migration when someone takes the mom and the dead days when nothing is available. there are days with too many in the system and competing for every site (and losing some of them) and there are days when no fleet is up. there is the politics of the various communities and all of that is effort. working for a living. there are thieves who take all of the srp funds and the burnout of command types. in short . . . it is eve as usual. as i said previously, would i like them to be more of a challenge? more variation? yes. but that also goes for pve missions and a lot of other pve content. there will always be some activity that makes the most isk. what it is does not matter, there is one and there will always be one. so do we haul it down to our level or ascend to meet it, surpass it, or do we like what we do (and do what we like) and stop making isk the reason for play.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>"

12/31/2014,"that's not the question. i've flown with people who categorically refuse to join corporations where that kind of language is used because they hear enough of it aimed squarely at them in real life, and so i refuse to in solidarity with them. it's not a question of your personal intentions or biases; it's a question of your respect for and acknowledgement of people for whom that is not just casual slang.if you'd rather keep the atmosphere relaxed for people who are used to throwing those words around than keep it relaxed for people who are used to having those words thrown at them, you've made your choice, and i appreciate your honesty in being clear about the choice you've made. but it's not about you, or your intentions, or any putative biases on your part."
12/31/2014,"i think it's somewhat unfair to pick on core given that 99% of fleets in null operate that way. there is some degree of freedom of whom you fly with and if core's fleets exclude people who don't like hearing slurs, then that's kind of his loss (and conversely my loss of not having people who like to throw slurs around from my fleets). people can find other people to fly with that suit their comms styles."

12/31/2014,"neither have i, but we wind up having to turn down a very large number of newbies because of the fear that they *might* awox or cause issues. we reject between 30-70% of applicants depending upon the particular phase of the moon, and do not accept people who have not subscribed and are on trials. these are people that could benefit from our help probably, but have things that make us not willing to let them into alliance.data time! i can't know about how many people i turn away who have the slightest thing suspicious about them that are actually bad, but fortunately there's data from my coalitionmates who are... more open :)brave does minimal filtering of new recruits, allows 0 sp recruits/trials, and recruits 600 people in a high volume month (e.g. 20 per day). there are 1-2 awoxers in brave that reveal themselves per day. so that's a 5-10% rate unless you filter fairly stringently, if you're accepting characters under a week or two old. the targets of the awoxes are not just people flying expensive stuff like battleships, but also things like pi haulers piloted by 2-3 month old characters.unfortunately, it's the 1-2 week old newbies that can most benefit from becoming part of a corp that will teach them useful things because they're likely to be on trial and clueless/needing help, but the ease with which a 10-hour trial hero alt can be spun up makes corps allergic to accepting trials with damn good reason :/i'm poorly qualified to make pronouncements about the state of w-space (see also: my response to the lowsec question). i can tell you what my experience in w-space has been, which is leading newbies in doing c4 sites a few times a month (link points to a lovely article written by my spouse). however, my views don't represent people who actually live in w-space fulltime and i tend to defer to their opinions in general on w-space balance."
12/31/2014,"this is not standard practice as i understand it for wh/null/low - there are definitely some circumstances in which trial/training corps exist with highly distinct identities from their mothership (c.f. kenshin katana, noir. academy, sniggwaffe), but my experience is that the vast majority of corps tend to give people up/down decisions for getting into the actual corp rather than using segregated corps with gradations of acceptance criteria that still live in the same space and do the same things. for w-space in particular, the lack of ability to share bookmarks between corps easily makes it pointless to have a separate 'newbie holding pen' corp if that corp is just going to live in the same chains - there's little benefit to that risk mitigation. no disagreement - improvements to corp/pos management would help substantially and i think are necessary to improve corp willingness to recruit newbies on trial accounts."
12/31/2014,"as i argued elsewhere, the actual problem with the change to in-corp aggression mechanics is that corporation management sucks. the only option available even to ccp itself is a game-wide on/off switch. so i would say that anyone who doesn't like the change, or who is ambivalent about the change, should push hard for a change to corporation management and more broadly to the types of social groups that eve supports, and contribute actively to any crowd-sourcing that ccp solicits. the better those tools are, the fewer ham-fisted changes ccp has to make.june, if you want poses to become important assets as part as war dec reform, i'd ask for that to be at least punted until corp management is fixed and, at the very least, pos (defense) modules have had a balance pass. if your proposal went into effect before then, i'd guess that the only result would be a number of poses getting pulled down preemptively.edit: also, thanks for answering my questions thoroughly and thoughtfully."
12/31/2014,"you mention being ecstatic that corps and alliances are being worked on. what do you think of the recent push by jayne fillon, mangala solaris, sugar kyle and others to broaden player organizations beyond corps and alliances? npsi standing fleets, incursions, and casual/new player organizations could all conceivably benefit, and in fact alliances could even be reworked as one of these other-than-corp organizations.also, as adam smith said, a corporation is just a union of companies[1]. what would you think of allowing more fine-grained organization below the corporation level? or even, as someone (sorry, forget who) suggested, an ldap/active directory style model?[1] not so much any more, but that's what they were when he put quill to paper."
