4/1/2009,"just wanted to give a big ""thank you"" to ankh for setting this all up. this is a genuinely useful site for when i want to check out what the csm has done in the past, and is probably the best csm information page going - oddly, in some ways it's even a lot better than the actual csm forums themselves. i hope it continues effectively(whether on your site, evelopedia, or somewhere else) for a very long time."

4/1/2009,agreed
4/1/2009,jolly good idea there chap
4/1/2009,maybe have a tab system like the overview so that we can also have different orbits for different shipsedit: forgot to support
4/1/2009,it's one of those things we're so used to but they're annoying and not logical. adding more options is a good thing.
4/1/2009,"this would be really useful.in fact why not just make the whole list editable?(with the obvious exception of ""orbit at current distance"")"
4/1/2009,"look several posts above and you will see why active scanning is not a good solution (short answer: server load).unless you want to reduce active scanning targets (the filters almost certainly change what is shown, not what is detected by the scan). and that hypothesis is with a 220 cpu probe launcher. put that in every ship if you can."
4/1/2009,"perfect, on the same vein you have no right to attack me against my will. same logic.so you get your little instance with all the people that will refuse local and play with them."
4/1/2009,"local change will not simply ""help small scale pvp"" or ""give attackers all benefits and no drawbacks""local change will change pvp in eve completely.say, i go out for a solo roam. sure, on the one hand i am better off, as ratters don't insta-warp to poses when i enter system. on the other hand, if i catch a ratting raven, i can't be sure that there's no cloaked arazu/falcon/a couple of black ops sitting just a few kilometers from it. small gangs (just as any other gangs) set up scouts and scram if the local spikes. well, guess what - if the local does not spike, who would inform you that 4 of your sorry hac-butts are in for a world of pain because 20+ gang has entered the system to bring it? no one, that's who.i can't say if i am ""for"" or ""against"" local removal, because it would just change too much, we would all have to learn pvp again. not that it would be something done the first time by ccp - cap. ship introduction taught us new pvp, nanonerf taught us new pvp, titans taught us new pvp. just don't expect 'boost' or 'nerf' to you current play style. there will be no current playstyle anymore.i think we need to see how pvp in w-space goes, if it would be too hectic or it would be just about right type of hectic. then we'll talk."
4/1/2009,it can be modified/streamlined yes!
4/1/2009,"the solution hit me. remove player lists in local, place them in constellation instead. you then know exactly who is in the constellation, but not in your local system."
4/1/2009,i'd buy a titan just to dd small gangs as i bait them with a ratting raven
4/1/2009,"proposed and struck down (in fact it came so close to implementation that we still have const. chat in game, be it delayed)no, this will again do nothing but provide an instant and free intel tool for the defender."
4/1/2009,"btw. as i understand, concord provides information about gate activation thus local intel for all. they control gates so it sounds reasonable to me. wormholes on the other hand, are not under concord control, so get rid of free intel about w-space<->k-space travelers.i think jumping from w-space into k-space should not result in (instant) local update. this would make k-space a little bit spicier without general removing of local."
4/1/2009,"are you high? if there wasn't a magical intel-tool for the alliances controlling their massive swaths of land, i would spend almost all of my time in 0.0localspy is ridiculous and illogical. the gate defense doesn't work either since concord wouldn't bother reporting data from gates in systems they don't even have control over.the only people who are in opposition to this are those who want instant intel."
4/1/2009,"reducing the informations. two times, one removing local, the other nerfing active scanning. you seem to love the thought of nerfing active scanning.maybe you missed it totally, but most ships under the bs class would be crippled putting in a extended probe launcher.you think all ships need a increase in cpu by 220 points?"
4/1/2009,"yep, pretty sure this would attract more people out there.would also fix risk/reward for blobbing powerblocs."
4/1/2009,"oh, so making it not completely counter-proof or balancing (i.e. making you be ""seen"" easier by active scanning, the advantage of which gives you a better scan.i see.no, the idea of ships having to constantly scan, hell every ship being wary. those that don't risk being caught unaware.maybe that involves having someone in gang constantly probing. they could give him a name... you know, like a member of a crew... what's that name, of those people that, you know... watch radar or sonar, to make sure no hostiles are around? but to you having someone do that is asking too much.you either want to have an excuse not to play eve outside of beginner mode, or you're trolling.i never thought people were so lazy theat they'd fight tooth and nail to keep thier precious instant-intel magic tool"
4/1/2009,"take that one step further - i accept that i have no right to attack you against your will. but when you enter low sec and 0.0 space, you willfully consent that you allow people to attack you. you will still fight them, of course, but the fact that you came to the pvp space on purpose, willingly, gives everyone permission to start a fight with you"
4/1/2009,"nice, now you want people to move always in group and always have a guy playing picket ship with a cov ops to scan for possible hostiles. i want wow stile raiding too? mandatory mass operations?this game is meant to be playable even alone. so why you are trying to impose group playing? btw: you are putting the lie to your words ""believe me when i say i'm not offended, and also when i say my ideas have flaws- i even state several posts above that any ideas of mine have issues and need to be fleshed out a bit."" every time i point the flaws in your ideas you resort to ad hominem attacks. grow a bit."
4/1/2009,"that sounds like something only the most carebear people would think of doing.the type of people who really want to keep local chat.btw, i play alone most of the time, and i really want some kind o nerf to local chat"
4/1/2009,"ad hominem attacks? because by your posts, you have implied:1) you prefer solo in an mmorpg2) you dislike pvp3) you see the removal of local as a severe threat to your safety, and are thus against it.so when i thus imply that your resistance to either removing or creating delayed local is due to the fact that you want it, not for any reasons specified by yourself, but because of your own personal preference regarding your general fear and unwillingness to even have a possibility of pvp.ad hominem? no. i'm not attacking you, i'm attacking your real reasons behind this debate. as you first said of me, how i ""just want easy ganks"" which was the first ""attack"" anyway, without realizing i'm a hisec miner who 'bears 90% of the time.as such, you take things, such as how you replied to me, and instead are resorting to straw man arguements.but i'll bite, this one time.yes, there should be one person scanning constantly. standing guard. being vigilant in unsafe territory. you can refuse to do it, at your peril."
4/1/2009,"step 1: have friend with large wallet. step 2: have friend officer-fit a ship. step 3: pop ship due to known bug. step 4: grab loot. step 5: petition loss. step 6: gm dupes loot for you. step 7: ???step 8: profit!i'm not talking about standard suicide ganking, which i'm aware is a mediocre profession at best in terms of actually earning income per unit time, especially with recent changes. i'm talking about intentional exploitation of a hp bug and this proposed reimbursement policy, which would in essence allow players to earn fantastically large sums of money via exploits in a short period of time with a minimal chance of getting caught. there is a reason that reimbursement works the way it does - if it worked like op is proposing, you would have exploits galore. it doesn't need to be a repeatable exploit if you make billions per use."
4/1/2009,"if you find a way to reproduce this bug on demand, please let us know. hell, i'll even pay 50 mil if i successfully reproduce it with your instructionshowever, i firmly believe that there must be no item duping. i'm sure ccp feels same way"
4/1/2009,"i give up, your ego is out of control and blinding you to actually have to respond to any criticism. i could not possibly care less about you or tri. god forbid i actually question what someone says on an internet forum.the only way to give you back dropped items is to dupe items or dupe isk and in doing so have a very good chance at giving said player twice the value of what he just lost.it would be nice if you got back all of your modules when dying to a bug, however not getting your dropped modules back is a unfortunate consequence of having loot drop for pvp. this is not something ccp can ""look into"", this is something that they cannot accomplish without duping items and causing more trouble and screwing over more people in the process.i would gladly support this, but it just isn't possible without adding terrible mechanics like ""locking items"" or abusive mechanics like duping isk/items."
4/1/2009,"i don't know that it can be, or even that it exists. personally, i've never seen it. however, we're not talking about a short-term thing here, we're talking about a permanent change to reimbursement policy. if there is ever, at any time, a bug that makes ship losses reimburseable(and iirc there have been several in the past), and is at least slightly predictable, then this change to reimbursement policy will result in an easy exploit for billions of isk. you're right that nobody wants duping - not you, not me, not ccp. that's the reason for the current policy - destroyed items get reimbursed, dropped items do not because then you're duping them. that is why i oppose this change - op is, at root, asking for the gms to start duping items. it's being requested with honest intentions, but that's still the proposal on the table here. hence, i oppose it. it's not a function of one particular bug or one particular issue, it's the principle that an item that drops once should not be on two ships, even if ccp screws up somewhere in the middle."
4/1/2009,i know how it is losing a expensive ship to a known bug goes. i lose a carrier to desync and was given the finger as well. then sevral days later lost a sub cap to the same issue and got it back within 24h. something needs to be done about the reimbursement system needs a rework. just thinking about the length of that petition makes me angry.
4/1/2009,"this kronos?only one that i saw, not seeing zealots some i'm just a little confused"
4/1/2009,this one.i like the policy how it is.
4/1/2009,"agreed.even though i believe a ship reimbursement should include all the modules it was fitted with, i would settle for a firm and public policy on the matter. at least then you would know where you stand and everyone would be treated the same way.at the moment it seems to be the individual gm's choice how to reimburse a loss, but there should be guidelines for different scenarios and these should be publicly available.in this particular instance, your ship was loss was down to a severe bug, and therefore i believe you should have been reimbursed entirely."
4/1/2009,"yeah!and no the empire loss one was legitimate, they had a falcon perma jamming me but there was no bugs involved so i didnt petition"
4/1/2009,sounds good to me./signed
4/1/2009,"i started playing this game over 3 years ago, and have always flown caldari, and have always wandered why i never had any launchers showing on my ships?sadly, my ships still look like they are weaponless. i totally support this change!"
4/1/2009,"i support this, i can just imagine watching a raven's missile ports opening up from the sides and missiles flying out."
4/1/2009,been thinking this since april 2004.let's do this.
4/1/2009,"this has been brought up in an older thread, though i couldn't find it due to the horrifying search engine.essentially, while they have upgraded the ships, stations, and many static objects, the planets, moons, and the stars themselves are still lacking quite a bit.i know that changes are in the works, i was just hoping maybe by starting a new thread on the subject we can either get an update, or a confirmation by the csm to push for graphical overhauls in the general space department.the best idea i've heard was for static gas clouds and the such, so that you were not constantly immersed in a rainbow. there would be more black space, and you could actually tell where you were based on your surroundings.note i'm only talking about non-wormhole space. wormhole space has some new, snazzy effects, and even some binary systems.anyhow, supporting my own topic to re-raise the issue and provide a spot for ideas. flame and discuss."
4/1/2009,supported
4/1/2009,"no, it accomplishes that objective most of the time. if you want to train a new skill, it does not. i started a new alt a couple days ago, and had to waste 3 hours training learning 4 without the benefit of logic 3 because the skill finished 3 hours before i woke up. i had to train the wrong skill because i wasn't online to switch into the right one. last i checked, this is exactly what the skill queue is supposed to avoid. finish the job, put the queue into effect properly, and let us inject skills even if we don't have the reqs. pop up a warning or whatever, but let us train properly. there should never be any bs associated with this fundamental a part of the game - it should be utterly flawless in terms of letting the player do whatever they want within the rules, and presently there is a large and rather gaping flaw that still exists. it's not as large as the planet-sucking black hole of fail that was the queueless system, but it's still worthy of an improvement."
4/1/2009,"you know, i've looked at this four or five times, and it finally hit me what's wrong with this.we can move great hulking battleships lightyears in a flash of light and a couple of seconds, and we still have to put stuff down on paper? really? especially since according to the storylines of eve training is by direct injection of knowledge into the brain. at least call them like datachips or some crap. books? honestly? we have laser guns, and we still put vital knowledge down on easily destroyed paper?for that matter, even in the modern world we can send the contents of a book tens of thousands of miles without actually moving the physical book itself. yet in the era of ftl transport and communication, we have to actually ship the physical vessel of knowledge itself.wtf?"
4/1/2009,"it would be like letting you fit mods to your ship that you didnt have the skills for. i mean, you wouldnt be able to undock, so it should be fine...if this is allowed in any way shape or form... which i hope its not. then it should have to be only via the queue system and fit within the 24hrsstill not supported"
4/1/2009,"could be useful and to prevent too much skillbook injection, why not just only allow skillbooks that only have 1 missing pre-req to be injected or something like that, so you cant just inject a whole bunch up the ladder - like t2 large gunnery skills without having any of the lower skills.then you could pick up a few useful bits. e.g. you start training small spec blasters and once thats started you can inject the medium spec blasters skill even tho you cant start it but you cant inject the large spec skillbook.that kinda thing"
4/1/2009,"actually, if the devs wanted to implement the ability to fit mods you can't use with the caveat that you can't undock until you have the skills for them, i'd probably support that. it'd let you prebuild ships for contracting, test fits you haven't skilled into without needing to install eft, and do all sorts of other nifty things. it's far lower priority than this change, because it'd likely be harder to implement and it has less overall utility, but yes, i would be in favour of that. why is it the game's job to make things hard? everything should be as easy as possible subject to the caveat that everyone has to live within the same rules and you can't cheat on actual gameplay. there's no reason i ought to have to be online to add a skill, and inject-without-prereqs is as easy a way of implementing that as any. to be honest, i don't really care how they implement this feature - add a physical book to the queue, pre-injection, get the book out of your hangar, put isk into the queue and it'll market buy for all i care. the point here is that skilling should be effortless on the player's part - you figure out what you want, tell it to the game, and the game does it for you without screwing you around. moving skillbooks and alarm-clock skill training aren't fun, they're a stupid, unnecessary burden. it's ccp's job to get rid of that crap and let us play eve, instead of having to fight with the client to advance our characters. they have a great game, they just need to get all the hilariously bad interface issues out of the way and let us play it."
4/1/2009,yes please
4/1/2009,"well if you follow that logic to its end, why bother with skill books at all? why doesn't the skill just get added to your skill tree the moment you buy it. and just sit there until you train it?they need a physical object for it to work in the games economy. that's why. you might also ask why you can trade dirt, hookers, and cigarettes, but you can.i'm out-spoken on this though, so i'll just give up on this one."
4/1/2009,"i'm struggling to get what this has to do with the discussion. information, while it can be rendered in a physical medium, doesn't have to be physical. ancient civilizations got by without writing anything down for thousands of years. dirt, on the other hand, isn't really very useful unless it's a real physical object. consider this:if i showed you pictures of the pages of a book, they have the same value as if i had shown the same pages in a real book. if i showed you pictures of dirt...well...yeah, you'd have pictures of dirt. not much you can do with those.anyway, back to the books:the only point i can see to have a skill object is if there are skills that are only available as loot drops or for transport into nullsec where there are no npc salesmen. and for that matter, you don't even really need them then. just have the skill store part of the neocom - works no matter where you are, as long as you're not inside a wh. buy a skill, viola, instantly added to your skill list.that's like saying you can't buy music(information) unless you actually sell records (the physical incarnation of that information). which itunes proves on a daily basis is dead wrong."
4/1/2009,"well that would be an interesting idea, but thats not whats being proposed here. also, the other items i mentioned were to illustrate that even with light travel humans are stupid enough to smoke.that's like saying you can't buy music(information) unless you actually sell records (the physical incarnation of that information). which itunes proves on a daily basis is dead wrong.i'm not ******ed, i specified the game's economy. the current eve economy operates without any non-physical objects. even plexes can be looted from wrecks. so while your ideas of digital mediums in game are very interesting, i'm struggling to see how this is relevant, since the proposal at hand is ""injecting physical skills"" into your body before you have the pre-requisites to even learn the information. i don't support it. i feel like the skill queue is enough.however if you propose the neocom based skill trade system i will support it de."
4/1/2009,"actually, the eve economy is based on a non-physical object - the isk. you don't need to move it, it doesn't sit in a hangar, there's no fort knox to hold all your gold. you just have it. you can be 10 wormholes out from deepest 0.0, and still transfer isk to a logged-off player in jita without jumping through any hoops whatsoever. why can't this be the model for more things?"
4/1/2009,no support. this change would break sanity check of the whole training system.
4/1/2009,"this proposal came from another thread on the forum.simply put, it seems silly to me (and to some others) that in order to acquire a new skill in this age of ftl communications, you have to actually fly to somewhere where the skill is stored in a physical form, purchase said physical entity, and then use it.even with the current technology on planet earth, we can move information far more efficiently that this. it's akin to have to fly to england to find out who the current ruling monarch is.my proposal then, is to add a skill store to the neocom. you can open it anywhere you happen to be, even in space, purchase a skill, and have it immediately added to your skill list. skills you can't train yet could be designated in some way to indicate you don't meet all the requirements both in the store front and in the skill list.i would say that it should not work if you're in a wormhole simply because the ftl communications network doesn't extend that far.now, given, this is definately not a requirement. having to fly somewhere to buy a skill doesn't offend me or otherwise make the game less enjoyable for me. but, i can think of some instances where it's useful - what if you're stuck on gatecamp duty out in the middle of 0.0 and you suddenly realize, you need a skill you don't currently have. a few seconds later, crisis averted, you can resume shooting hapless victims as they jump through your gate.the same argument can be applied for just about every other profession in the game. the only profession that problably see much benefit from it are traders, since they spend so much time in trade hubs anyway.the point behind it is it gets rid of this antiquated need to identify information with a physical medium.drawbackthere is only one real drawback that i can see, and that is that there may be skills which i am unfamiliar with that are only available as loot drops or mission rewards. if that is the case, then i could see a modified version of this proposal that would allow you to have those particular skills show up as an object (say a datachip, not a book), that could either be uploaded (injected into the skill list) or sold via contracts (edited for clarification on selling)."
4/1/2009,this is a simple support / don't support question.if you wish to get into detail please add to the ongoing discussion here in a constructive manner.it is assumed that the current bomber would need to be range nerfed and tweaked towards hitting smaller targets to fit in to ccp's current vision.if you have made comments in the above thread please don't repost them here. this is a vote about the most commonly asked for thing in said discussion thread.
4/1/2009,totally agree with op
4/1/2009,i think the 2 bomber idea is a good one :)
4/1/2009,"do we now create a topic for people who want to have the option of cruise or torps on the same bomber?as i've stated in the other bomber threads here and here i am pro choice for setups instead of putting ships into a very narrow focussed role.i would prefer one hull with the option of cruise or torp for maximum flexibility, however if creating a second bomber type would allow me to retain the current cruise bomber as a support harassment tool then i support the idea.i don't care about the cov-ops cloak either way."
4/1/2009,i support.
4/1/2009,i don't agreethey are already to much advantage with the missile.
4/1/2009,agree.
4/1/2009,agreed we have the force recon and the combat recon1. for stealth and long range 2nd for close range and full powerthis should be introduced to the bombersforce recon and a combatforce recon for the cruise and range and stealthcombat for close range torped full dmg wtfpwnage bomber
4/1/2009,agree
4/1/2009,"this; not two ships, just allow the use of torp/cruise missiles on the same ship."
4/1/2009,"leave the user free to choose between torps or cruise: both bonus can't be used at the same time, that makes the ship not more powerful but more flexible."
4/1/2009,"total agreement on this issue, as someone who has used stealth bomber's successfully in the past, a new additional frig bomber type makes a lot more sense than the current, we're just radically changing it option."
4/1/2009,"meh, you are misleading. your post states a nerf to the current bomber. change your platform to add new type of stealth bomber, leave old as is to coincide with your topic thread."
4/1/2009,"most definately. ccp simply must delay this change until they have resources to create the 2nd hull, if that's why existing hull is being rewamped."
4/1/2009,sure dude.
4/1/2009,"how about they just let the player choose whether to fit siege or cruise? if you're really insistent on making the new ship an option, split the to-hit bonus (-16.67% cruise explosion radius and +20% siege explosion speed per level), but let players use both. nobody objects to the cocd, but the removal of cruises is crazy. but yes, given the choice between the platform switch and just adding a new class of ships, i want the new class over this proposal."
4/1/2009,"we don't need a new ship. the fix is dead simple. just bonus sb's to reverse the cruise missile nerf, let them warp cloaked, without a ******ed 30 second recloak delay, and a little boost to cloaked speed would be spiffy. what's so terrible about that? the only people who think the result would be a horrifyingly over-powered solo pwnmobile of pure helldeath... have obviously never flown a stealth bomber."
4/1/2009,"no support. we have enough stealth in game.just fix what's broken, don't destroy what isn't broken."
4/1/2009,it makes perfect sense since the new stealth bomber represents significant departure from current one.
4/1/2009,"this idea also makes sense. but the only chance you have to make it happen is to push thru the idea that stealth bomber changes will be applied to a new ship, not current one.once ccp changes the current ship, the door for more changes will be closed. get your foot in the door, preserve old model first, so it can be fixed later. or it will be wiped out."
4/1/2009,"ow yes, would be sweet."
4/1/2009,"agree, we need it"
4/1/2009,oh yes!
4/1/2009,agree

4/1/2009,"you appear to be basing you calcs on the hulk mining full-time. an intensive refinery can handle the load of about 16-18 hulk-hours a day. that could very well be 4 hulks running for 4 hours. if you are trying to mine more than that, my suggestion would be to do it somewhere where there is the support you need, or with a rorqual to compress it up for you. compressed ore makes the refineries 20 to 40 times faster. if you insist on mining in w-space, accept the limitations the reduced/non-existent infrastructure presents."
4/1/2009,"please allow covert cynosural fields to be generate in 0.5 and above.you can't jump caps to them anyway so i can see no real reason not to be able to use black ops jump drive in high-sec. i think it would increase the use of this ship, both for wardecs and also for general mobility."
4/1/2009,"before they made blockade runners jumpable, i might have gone for this. at present, though, i can't - it makes highsec transportation far, far too easy."

4/1/2009,"i would be okay with this if it couldn't be used to jump freighters and haulersas someone already pointed out, transporting logistics is ridiculously safe in eve already. we don't want to make this game too carebear"

4/1/2009,"this is all about changes that were implemented in eve for a past 2 years.and, in my part - about stealth bombers changes.link for the interested:"
4/1/2009,"this is not nearly as bad as the nanonerf. it's like comparing madrid bombings to the holocaust1000 times worse, and the people just stood and watched. i can't forgive the people responsible for that atrocity against game design."
4/1/2009,"i'd be happy with a choice, torps or cruise. pretty much the devs are screwing us out of a good ship."
4/1/2009,"not that it will do the slightest bit of good because ccp devs don't seem to play the game the way we do. there is more than sniper bs fleets and pos takedowns guys...as i've stated in the game dev thread one of the best features of eve is the ability to customise the fitting of a ship and finding new ways to use a ship that some other people write off as useless.any policy change from ccp to make ships have very focussed single roles which break the options that players have is to be avoided. almost every ship in the game has the option for short or long range weapons. currently the bomber has cruise and bombs (though they are somewhat broken).so far many people have claimed that bombers are useless as is and need to be changed. others like myself would welcome the option of torps or cruise because it opens up new situational tactics.however ccp seem to be slamming the door in our faces on this and would rather take a frigate which is very useful in small roaming gangs and turn it into an anti battleship platform without the damage or survivability for that role. how can a bomber be expected to survive within point and heavy neut range next to a battleship fielding drones?range was the key to keeping a bomber alive and even then a single ceptor could get on top of a bomber with reasonable ease meaning the bomber having to warp out and back all the time. and even with these issues people found a use for them.is the current bomber overpowered? it certainly cannot be described as a solo pwnmobile. whilst it can lob cruise out to 150km they take so long to arrive that unless the target is tackled they will never kill anything.will we adapt to the proposed changes should they be pushed to tq, probably.should ccp give options instead of trying to focus ships into a single role setup, yes!"
4/1/2009,"yeah, they're doing silly things with a bad ship, that will probably make it worse in the end. who the hell wants a 3-torp sb to kill a battleship when you can just use a 6-torp raven? the cocd is nice, and the ability to use torps is fine, but taking away cruise and the ability to hit light stuff i just don't understand. these ships do not need nerfing. oh, please. i seem to recall 1600+ people voting against it when it was proposed. just because the devs did it anyways doesn't mean people were silent. also, comparing game design decisions to the holocaust? always in bad taste.edit: why do we need quotes in our url tags? stupid crappy forums..."
4/1/2009,i make that comparision because it is strong enough to express how i feel
4/1/2009,"op is not talking about speed reduction nerf, however drastic this was, hes talking about the complete destruction of a ship class. the only point of which is to enable ccp to use the existing platform for an entirely new role."
4/1/2009,"i'll vote for whichever csm representative runs on the platform of bringing a meat cleaver to their meeting in iceland, with the intention of 'redesigning' the game dev responsible for this abortion of an idea."
4/1/2009,"agreed,leave the bombers as they are: a support harassment platform.frigate vs battleship is fail.frigate vs cruiser is win.frigate vs blob is lol.cruise missiles were perfect for this balance.retain them! (boost explosion velocity a tad though)"

4/1/2009,"sorry to ruin your day, but you're nowhere near the sb pilot if you saying that.i were lobbing the co cloak for bombers, too, but with recent game changes, not only gameplay, but also the technical part, i can see what sb is and how it could be used properly without a co cloak.i've run tests both in space and on paper to see how it performing. co cloak on actual combat boat is a fail of game balance.choosing between current sb as they are and proposed changes - i choose no changes at all.i can live with half damage to the ships of my size, but i can't live with zero damage.and 10 paper ships attacking a bs, without a chance to hide from it's guns is a fail.i disagree with the way this tipic was present, but issue itself should be addressed. sb need love, not raping."
4/1/2009,new constructive thread started here.can a mod please lock one of these 2 threads to prevent obscene amounts of double posting thx.
4/1/2009,"i don't particularly like that they're switching weapon platforms from cruise to torps, this doesn't seem fair to anyone that's not caldari who's trained for cruise specifically for sb's. but i don't agree with the op's suggestions either.1. i'd like to see the current sb contiune to use cruise missiles, get the explosion radius bonus so it can better attack smaller ships and be able to use the covert ops cloak.2. i don't think there should be a 30 second reactivation delay, since if anyone who's ever flown one will agree with, uncloaking will most likely result in your death. making most attacks a suicide mission. 3. i do think they should release a ""heavy stealth bomber"" class of frigs, that use torps and are specifically designed to fight battleships. 4. i think they should introduce a special new launcher for sb's that loads the regular cruise/torp (whichever it may be) plus also can load a bomb. that way sb's can tactically decide in battle which platform they want to use. bomb's build cost should be reduced, drastically, down to maybe 1mil/unit. the current cost make's them impractical for any real pvp. they should fly a greater distance (faster) before they explode, and ideally some sort of tactical overlay/display to better judge where the explosion will take place instead of just guesswork. so basicly, keep the current sb, introduce a new ship class for the torp version, remove or greatly reduce recloak delay, and give some major love to bombs. i can't offer my support to the op's proposal, it's too much of an attack then a serious proposal."
4/1/2009,"i vote that somebody forces chronitis to actually fly a stealth bomber for a week. then he can tell us all about how a ship made of damp tissue, used in the main for its alpha strike against small targets at long range, and not its long term dps, should be shooting battleships at 30km. it's like hunting moose with a paintball gun, ffs.the fix is so damn simple... remember how you nerfed cruise missiles? sb's use only cruise missiles (bombs ya right). do you see a mother****ing problem there??? bonus the ship to fix the nerf! and if you could bring yourself to providing a little bit of extra fun, let them actually be stealthy, by warping cloaked, and give them a speed boost when cloaked. still not any sort of solo pwnmobile, nothing unbalanced to worry your little head over, just a fun ship with a very limited use, still very easily killed by anything, still a ton of counter-measures to the ship. what's wrong with that?what's wrong with giving the players what they want once in a while? why do you have to be such stingy bastards? where's the fun? ye gads, if chronitis is any indication, can you imagine a ccp christmas exchange? everybody gets a pair of socks."
4/1/2009,"2 months at least. and even then it'd be not enough. we're flying them for our lives, at the very least. he'll be flying just to fly."
4/1/2009,"let ccp make their new stealth bomber idea into a new ship. so we'd have 2 stealth bomber classes - one with cruise, one with torps"
4/1/2009,"double effectiveness is a very nice throw-in, i'd wager, especially given that nos income is doubled without neut costs going up, and the curse has enough high slots to reasonably fit a mixed group. really, i think the problem with these ships traces its way back to the nos nerf - they likely made a lot more sense before then, and now they're left with bonuses that don't make nearly as much sense. the nos nerf made sense for a dominix, but on a pilgrim it was just a bit weird in what it did. now that neuts are generally better, double effect isn't as powerful, since it doesn't fuel your ship. this leaves the pilgrim in an odd place - you can't just fly in close, pull a free cap booster out of your high slots, and use that to feed everything else and drain the enemy besides, you now have to actually run a cap, which places a serious pinch on everything else you do. i'm sure the pilgrim ran just fine pre-nerf, but the nerf hit it rather uniquely - it can't easily switch to neuts, because the enemy can evade them, and it doesn't have much else going for it - it's just an arbitrator that can warp cloaked. i know this is a bit at odds with my opnions on ecm changes(which i'm still mulling over slightly, but the tl;dr is rook, kitsune, and maybe widow as the only ships with ecm range bonuses, and ecm base ranges getting gimped significantly, with some other bonuses instead), but the difference is based on the magic number of 24km. inside 24 km(barring hic, gallente recon, officer scram, etc.) combat is forced, outside it is not. losing range outside 24 km is less relevant than losing the ability to use your weapons against anything holding a point on you. the range bonus on the curse boosts it well above 24km, meaning that it can apply 5 neuts to anything that can point it, which is enough to turn off half the weapons in the game, as well as mwds and scrams. the lack of that range bonus on the pilgrim means that it can't smack down a ceptor at 20 km, whereas it could if it had the range bonus instead. conversely, while the range bonus on an ecm ship matters greatly for fleet combat, for small-gang work where the scram is the key point, the difference between 40km and 250km isn't as big. i'd still rather have longer range, of course, but it's not crippling to lack it, since you can still sit safely at brave sir robin ranges and have an impact on the fight. also, the pilgrim's primary dps weapon is the drone, which has a ~50km range for most people. furthermore, one of its ewar types is also suited to this range, having a 60-70 km optimal with average skills. why is its third weapon type limited to 13km? that just doesn't fit with the rest of the ship. i'm not asking for 50km neuts, but the 32-38 that the curse gets would at least make more sense. i guess i have to ask your question in exactly the opposite direction - nos/neut range is short enough that a range bonus is the better bonus for anything that isn't a gallente-style mwd/blaster ship. why would i bother flying the pilgrim without it? it doesn't have enough high slots to be the primary neut ship for your gang anyways(only 3, once you fit the cocd), so you might as well let it use the three it does have effectively. an extra -36 won't cripple anybody fast enough to matter too much, but an extra 25km gives you a mass of extra tactical options that a simple strength bonus does not."
4/1/2009,"switching the bonuses instead of adding one would still leave the curse with a role, its a tougher ship, would have a neut amount bonus still, plus in normal fits it has ""onboard"" dps. the pilgrim would still be weaker and have only drone-based dps (which can be killed), which is a fair trade-off for a covops cloak.so it would bring the amarr recons inline with the other three, where the non-cloaky one is more effective at the expense of not being able to warp while cloaked."
4/1/2009,leave my pilgrim alone... as a pilgrim pilot i do not support this change.
4/1/2009,"leave my pilgrim alone.i love the pilgrim. it's one of the better ships out there if you know what you are doing.edit: haha, just noticed the guy right above me. no, it's not my alt"
4/1/2009,"this:compared with other force recons, pilgrim is a fine solo ship. its not a solo pwnmobile but still good."
4/1/2009,"never had an issue getting a pod out, unless there is a bubble or massive lag.if there is lag, having new shortcuts won't help."
4/1/2009,"in my case, the issue isn't so much lag as graphics settings. when i'm (for example) involved in a small-scale mining op in low-sec, i don't have my graphics settings down at their minimums, because sitting in a belt or site, mining, my not-top-notch graphics card can handle what's on its plate pretty well, and i can appreciate the lovely graphics the game has. if suddenly a dozen pirates warp onto us and i need to warp out asap, my frame rate falls through the floor and i can't navigate through the overview and/or contextual menus fast enough.if you think i should keep my graphics settings lower, well, you have a point there. but i don't see how making warp-to-zero (for whatever object is currently selected) a keystroke is any more controversial than keystrokes for activating modules.(still supported)"
4/1/2009,i always get podded as well
4/1/2009,"this needs to come back, as per some other replies, sometimes people arent away from the game because they want to be, but because of rl circumstances."
4/1/2009,this ^^
4/1/2009,i wrote the proof of concept code.
4/1/2009,"i'm sure eve bank is great(how can anything lvv did be bad?), but i can't write contracts or market orders where the isk flows into or out of my eve bank wallet automatically. speaking personally, i'd love to have one wallet for my direct income(missions, pvp loot, etc.) and one for my indirect income(research, manufacturing, etc.), but the game mechanics don't allow that without use of a corp wallet or funneling everything through an alt, neither of which is especially convenient. in any case, however, that isn't the topic of this thread, so i'll drop it until such time as i think i have a sensible enough proposal to be worth a thread of its own. op's idea is still a mediocre one imo, and i still don't intend to support it without some sort of concrete reason why i ought to."
4/1/2009,"there are taxes and booking fees, i dont see a reason why there should be no bank, actually it makes no sense that there is none. you would have risk vs reward. a secure bank with small payouts or a player driven bank with larger interest outcome but chance of being scammed.also being able to have more then one wallet on one character would be great."
4/1/2009,"wallet divsions - yes.passive, unearned income with zero risk: no.there is already a ""zero risk"" place to keep your isk: in your wallet."
4/1/2009,that's two people in support. i'll make a topic.
4/1/2009,"there's no reason you can't have both, really. t2 destroyers that focus on combat probes, speed, and tackle for pvp probing, and t2 bcs that focus on core/ds probes, gank, and tank for pve probing are both entirely feasible ships. leave covops the ones with the best strength bonus(10% per level instead of the 5% per level the others would get) and the only one that can warp cloaked, so that they don't lose their niche. now, that's probably way too many probing ships, but it could quite reasonably be done other than that concern. as for the op, i generally support another class of scanning ships. not sure whether the dd or bc hull is best, but this is a perfectly reasonable addition that'd make a lot of scanners' lives a lot easier. not urgent, but it could be a good idea for the next major expansion of ship classes."
4/1/2009,an idea worth looking at.
4/1/2009,"no.why is this needed? a specialist job should require a specialist ship to do well. you can fit an expanded probe launcher on any other ship, it just wont be as good.as far as 'but i want to fly a combat ship'...if you don't like flying them, find someone who does."
4/1/2009,"thank you for the feedback i will answer your questions and suggestions/critique here.i have to disagree with your idea as it basicly would eliminate the covert ops from being useful and would make plexing too easy as you have an all in 1 ship for exploration. which basicly takes away any challenge of getting your combat ship back without getting yourself killed (especially in 0.0)on a second note fotm can be easily avoided by giving it negative and positive sides, such as no cloak and a low base speed this makes people think a 2nd time before flying it.i feel that if you base my idea around a bc class that it will not work. the ship i have in mind is supposed to be a small search&hold vessel based around having bonuses for combat scanner probes (which no ship has atm). a battlecruiser type would be too big sacrificing things such as agiliy, locking speed etc.and this is exactly what i am suggesting. it should be a specialist ship, one designed to search&hold the target for a minute or two until the main fleet arrives. it should not on any occasion be a solo ship. sure you can fit an expanded probe launcher on any ship but i can assure you that you will not find anything.the problem is no sane person would want to sacrifice their pvp ship just for scanning duty since most people think they are not going to make much of a difference in a gang. the covert ops is also not designed around the idea of a ship with combat scanning bonuses, one issue i think should be adressed.this would be a buff to small roaming gang pvp yes, one i think is not for the worst.astrometrics 5 is maybe a good suggestion but i think it should stay covert ops 4 as this is more in line with the interdictor which has the interceptor 4 skill. i believe it should stick in line with an interdictor and make people actually wanting to train this."
4/1/2009,qft
4/1/2009,"they're two different ships. the destroyer would be intended to scan and tackle player ships, and pin them down long enough for reinforcements to arrive - it'd do next to no dps, but be at least a little bit survivable. the battlecruiser would be intended to be capable of fighting npcs seriously, probably at about the combat level of a l3 mission bc. the only thing they would have in common is the scan strength bonus, and even then there could be differences(e.g., the destroyer getting a bigger bonus, but only to scanning out players). you cannot mix the two roles - implement one, the other, or even both, but you're right that a tackler bc would be silly, and similarly a plexing dd would be useless."
4/1/2009,"the bc version is already available. pick a normal bc, add a sister core probe launcher, sister probes and some gravity capacitor upgrade et voil<U+FFFD>, you have a bc with a good increase in scanning strength and capable of tanking most exploration sites. with the introduction of the core probe launcher any ship can probe complexes.about the frigate/destroyer version, i have some misgiving about the balancing of it.how large will be his cpu? 220 for the extended probe launcher plus another 120+ for the weapons and tank.about 50-60 as power grid (assault ship/destroyer level).i am no eft warrior at all but what can be placed in a ship with that values if you drop the extended probe launchers?"
4/1/2009,i think that it should not receive ungodly amounts of cpu (i'm not going to give you any numbers without meanings here) just give it a bonus in cpu decrease like the pre-apochrypa cpu decrease on the covert ops and it should be fine while still keeping it balanced.
4/1/2009,"just declare war and wait 24 hours, or go to one of the 90% of systems in the game where there is no concord protection.evading concord is a monumentally bad idea."
4/1/2009,"can you imagine anyone in a cloaked tackler sitting around hi-sec on the off-chance that a black ops will show up and try some funny business? can you imagine a bigger waste of time for that pilot?the rules we have are fine; the rules we have work. if it's not broke, don't fix it.also, correct me on this if i'm wrong, but if the black ops in this scenario were concorded, wouldn't it still be illegal for anyone else to loot his wreck?"
4/1/2009,my reaction exactly.
4/1/2009,"i pondered this in another thread here about npc banks.concept: you should be able to split the isk in your wallet up into multiple piles. certain piles could be password protected, be shown to the corp or alliance in a new wallet interface, or simply be labelled for easy organization of assets.reasons:organisation of assets.""safeguard"" your isk - small protection against being scammed if you use the system correctly (ie be smart). password protected locks would provide a small bit of ingame protection against having your account looted by a hacker.easy recording of purchases to help keep track (i purchased 10 thoraxes using my ship pile this month, and 104 damage control iis with my fittings pile, for example.) this would require a small amount of coding, but i could imagine it will make the more fussy-minded ""market pvpers"" or even the purchasing lackey for a corp's life a bit easier."
4/1/2009,"i currently give my money to one alt for savings, one alt for trade and one alt for pvp spending cash.it would be nice to have personal wallet divisions with divisions reachable by all three toons on one account."
4/1/2009,"i'd like it just so i can set aside a certain amount of money as my ""crap i got podded"" replacement fund. so i know what i can afford to lose."
4/1/2009,"this would make it way easier to track what i earn from various types of pew pew versus what i earn from manufacturing. right now it's a bit of a hash trying to figure out just how much i'm making off manufacturing without loading excel and inputting a pile of data to sort out what i've made shorn of bounties and loot drops, to see if that half-billion wallet bump was because i made a profit on manufactured goods, or because i spent last weekend missioning. the code to do this already exists, from corp wallet divisions, so this should be fairly easy, and this thread certainly indicates that there's a lot of ways it could be used."

(ie. sov 1 - 5 level i sentries max, sov 2 - 10 level ii sentries max, sov 3 - 15 level iii sentries max, etc.)3. subspace beacons should have hp's that increase with the sovereignty level4. destructible subspace beacons should only exist in 0.0 - they should not be destructible in empire space5. beacons would be automatically sent from empire to replace any beacons destroyed. this would take approximately 12 hours and local would take that much time to show player in local.6. beacons would change location after being destroyed,you can expand on this all you want or just plain hate it. it's just a fair method to allow players to bring more tactics into 0.0 and not just a horrid blob vs blob. basically, it gives players the ability to blind local and make 0.0 a little more dangerous and realistic.i won't support an absence of local entirely unless there is a well thought out method of implementing it and mine doesn't necessarily need to be the one"
4/2/2009,"i don't preferr, but i play solo too, not only as part of a blob. and i wanto to be able to play solo even in the future.inexact, i found most of it incredibly boring, some small action if fun, but most of it is big group with ista win (for one side or the other) and so no fun at all. i see the removal of local without a workable alternative as a big threat. all your alternatives are not workable.i every post i replied to your suggestions. thhat was a further comment on your kind of replies.sure, but that is not you were saying.you where saying that having the need to put a 220 cpu module on a ship to scan the system was fine.that rule out as solo ship almost any ship below bs and will degrade performance for almost all ships. ask people that want to do small group/solo pvp what they think of the need of having a 220 cpu extended scanner as an indispensable piece of equipment. if local is removed every ship should have the possibility to check for hostile in a timely and efficen manner.the current directional scanner is not a solution because it will be an excessive burden for the server. but your solutions to that always include nerfing it into uselessness. so at the end we return always to the same point, you want local removed and don't want any form of alternative, working, information gathering system."
4/2/2009,and do you want to have the extended probe scanner as a mandatory piece of equipment?look the above post for the reason of this question.
4/2/2009,"venkul, please read both my posts here before spouting another logical fallacy.so, your chances of not being blobbed by people in a system because of you announcing your presence is increased or decreased by nerfing local? you tell me. so pvp is boring, there are no surprises, it's just insta win or no. ever been in a 'ceptor duel? try it.but i digress- nerfing local will make pvp, or in any regard, lowsec and nullsec much more adrenaline pumping, even when not engaged.you should read my posts more: in every post i replied to your suggestions. thhat was a further comment on your kind of replies.no, you take one thing i say, and have done nothing but develop irrelevant conclusions. an example will be shown below. you, sir, brought out using the 220 prober as a scan tool. it was your idea- not mine. i said ""yes"" to actively scanning. i said ""yes"" to having a person dedicated to keeping an eye out.i said ""yes"" to the following example put out by you: not once did i disagree with you there. it's part of enhancing the ship's base scanner.you suddenly come out with using the combat probe launcher out of thin air, and from that point on run away with it.from the very first post in which i addressed you in this thread, i politely asked you to read what i wrote. you instead wish to push an argument with a position against what you stated you wanted yourself."
4/2/2009,"part iii believe i addressed this enough. if local is removed every ship should have the possibility to check for hostile in a timely and efficen manner.are you telling me that in lowsec and nullsec, every unknown ship should be treated with caution? we can't have that here, that would be too sensible. my suggestions have been:1) enhance an active scanner2) add an additional ui scanner to essentially replace where people place the local window, giving ""at a glance"" information regarding thier surroundings. i have, in addition, opened these options to criticism and suggestion. from you, i received first an ad hominem attack, and second a complete dismissal with nothing constructive. this is the third logical fallacy you've thrown out. surely you can do better than this. i've stated several ideas, i've said if local is nerfed or removed (mind you i've already stated delayed local is ok for me) that there would need to be scanner enhancements.what i have also said, though, is that there should not be a catch all, instant intel tool to be exploited by both attackers and defenders.i've been mostly on the defensive side in 0.0 using local.a while back, in a now-dead alliance, we'd happily carebear in our barges with an alt parked up the pipe, and use local to know when to dock. from local, we would have the ability to see who was coming, thier standings, and thier intent. we would either blob or dock. both of those we agree are detrimental to pvp.when attacking, we would use local to find targets. we would just breeze through systems, if local was empty we'd just push on.see, that's the thing- nerfing local makes things harder for the attacker. they have to actually search for targets. sure, it may mean they have to drop a probe in every system which seems easy enough, but as you said.. not every ship can fit a combat scanner, or if it does, it would need to be a dedicated prober. welcome to eve, where ships work together as a team. you can't take because of falcon into a fight solo. but with a gang it's just super. you often need a tackler, even with smaller ships. you may want to have a rr gang, relying on each other for tank. so, you want to fly solo? get a t3 cruiser, with the new 4th subsystem, and now you have a dedicated hunter ship. combat probes, cruiser size, and still an offensive/defensive subsystem to spare.if you want to solo in an af or inty, you're fast enough to use the on board scanner. i've hunted down targets with it often, to great success. but it was in wh space... with nerfed local."
4/2/2009,"your suggestions:i.e. exchange a system range passive tool (local) with a 3 au range passive tool passive scan 50% range. maybe even limited to cov ops? you arent much clear here.this is agreeing with my example in post 71? for you agreeing with a suggestion mean saing stop wanting to play the game on easy mode?and again reducing the range. ad hominem attack (not the first) but at least you seem to accept the idea that the passive scan should have a good range and suggest that it will give range to detected items. a horrible suggestion, ghost images and false signals and a suggestion about detecting cloakers (one of the few good thing from removing local would be the enhancement to cloakers and you want it removed)."
4/2/2009,"and here we see where the discussion about the probe launcher started. you put emphasis on that yes. and beautiful argument about running gang and not going around solo as the system to cover the drawbacks of the extended probe launcher. links perfectly with your precedent posts, where you depict a nearsighted passive scan and a so so active."
4/2/2009,i'd say that one guy in the gang being required to be in a dedicated probing ship would be a fantastic addition to the game - more jobs to do and learn to be good at. it would also nerf safespotters who don't cloak up more.
4/2/2009,then your last posts:that clash with your precedent reply:i see a large yes to force people to use the extender probe launcher.and your yes was: to me it seem a no.
4/2/2009,but to work it require a gang. so you thing that running around in a gang should be mandatory in low sec/0.0?
4/2/2009,it wouldn't require a gang any more than operations do now. is there benefit to working with a group - yes - and there always will be. i wouldn't hesitate to solo rat in 0.0 with local nerfed. i'd feel a lot better about it because if someone comes into system they won't immediately know i'm in there.
4/2/2009,"why did you leave this out?no, i was fleshing out ideas. it doesn't have to be 50%, it could be 75%. it could be 50% of 99au, or 75% of 25 au. you assumed that i had some concrete solution- this is a discussion, not a proposal. that's where you come in. you can be constructive or not- you've chosen the latter, by choosing to debate over things that aren't even near a finalized thought. yes, it's agreeing with you. you stated (before being against the local nerf) that the scanner ui would need to be buffed. i agreed. i included two types of scan modes- passive and active. i gave you your buffed scanner. the only difference is that with each time the scan is made (either manually or an automatic scan time) it shows your presence to both passive and active scanners.passive scanners will not show on others doing passive scans unless they are within the lower range. i don't know how to make this any more clear to you. yes!a horrible suggestion, ghost images and false signals and a suggestion about detecting cloakers (one of the few good thing from removing local would be the enhancement to cloakers and you want it removed).the only issue and reason i threw this out there was because if cloaks do not show on scan, and there is no local, it will turn into eve cloaked online.it was an idea to pre-emptively prevent covops from becoming too powerful. blockade runners would be unstoppable (even though with jfs it's already bad but that's another subject)"
4/2/2009,"we're both wrong in this. i accept blame for my part because i was posting on my blackberry and the topic of that had spread over 2 pages.it seems as though you took that as every ship in a gang should have a prober to scan, even solo pilots. the obvious thing i should have said, and haven't- is that it doesn't happen now. it doesn't happen in wh space. it happens with roaming gangs. it does not happen with solo roams, unless they shoose to fit one.if they want to fit a combat probe launcher on there and sacrifice the fitting, let them. if it doesn't solve the marco problem, oh well. yes. apparently you don't actually do roaming pvp much right now. if you did you'd notice it's completely based on local- and that's secondary to just grabbing a wolfpack and heading to a known populated system.hell, in c3-0yd we'd have those roaming gangs come in and fight all the time. they knew we were here, we knew they'd come.but if you want to have the ability to quickly scan down targets anywhere in a system, get someone to probe for your gang, or do it yourself.again, there is no reason to have a ship that does everything great. in fact that's completely the opposite of what ccp wants in eve.[quotelinks perfectly with your precedent posts, where you depict a nearsighted passive scan and a so so active. i stand by my idea of having both a passive scan on the bottom right of the ui or wherever, and the buffed active scan.there is no reason you've given against it, other than the fact that you feel 3au is too short. however, i've even stated it could be 14au, i don't care. it is viable and would need to be fleshed out with testing.but an active buffed scan should signal the ""defenders,"" or in some cases it would signal the attackers.either way, by having your ops protected, being aware, and being smart, it would make un-sec much more interesting."
4/2/2009,"short version of all our discussions:- what you see as a buff to the scanner to replace local i see as a very weak and unworkable solution;- what i see as workable solution for you is too powerful;- what i see as criticism to point out the flaws of your arguments you see as arguing for the sake of arguing. only an example of the last part:you were suggesting a range, i pointed out that for me it is too short, for you that is destructive criticism. so what there is to constructively discuss for you? the idea of the passive scanner? commenting on the range and not commenting against the idea implies that the idea is at least accepted, if not explicitly supported. if this is a discussion commenting pro and against the proposed change is what it is there for (but probably then it should be moved to the features and ideas discussion forum). if it is only a way to gather votes pro the change, our whole discussion is moot."
4/2/2009,"*sigh*i've already went over this. if you wish to discuss semantics, we can do it in oope.and that hypothesis is with a 220 cpu probe launcher. put that in every ship if you can. who said that, me or you? .01 isk says ""not me!"" my god, this is getting annoying.i say i want a buffed scanner.i say i want local nerfed.i say i want a ui passive scanner that is not as strong as the active scanner.i say i want the active scanner to show an active scan on passive scanners.i say if you want instant intel, get a buddy in a covops frig or whatever.i say, yes venkul, a buffed scanner would be necessary. i then say, i do not want a scanner so strong it tells me everything about what's in a system and what is going on. i do not want to know standings based on the scan results. i do not want to know if that ship is moving at 300m/s or 3000m/s. let it involve some guesswork. tactics. sweat. fear. i can use smaller words, but honestly if i need to spell it out anymore i'm going to go all eom nutty. gf."
4/2/2009,"right, your reply to that was only a bigyes!"
4/2/2009,i'm impressed. you managed to make ratting even more mindnumbingly boring (a feat i thought would be near impossible) and at the same time make it even less valuable compared to just doing missions. good stuff.
4/2/2009,"i'd rat away in 0.0 with no local, relying on my trusty directional scanner to spot incomming hostiles any day of the year before i'd ever consider running missions. to each thier own i suppose."
4/2/2009,"the point, lost somewhere on page 2, is that the current scanning system can't be supported by the server if every guy in 0.0 and low sec hit the scan button every 4 seconds.on the other hand nerfing too much the scanner and removing local will remove all risk control from the and of the players. all the argument between grimes and me is what is too much nerfing and what informations are indispensable and useful when you remove local. while this post don't explicitly say that the directional scanner alone will degrade server performance i think that it can be taken as a granted."
4/2/2009,gaines
4/2/2009,"in 0.0, you should be in a gang or have friends to back you up at short notice. i don't recall ever saying that removing local from lowsec would be a good idea."
4/2/2009,"your opinion. i'm inclined to disagree. he was talking about actual deployed scanning devices. not improved on-board scanners.other than the performance answer, which can only be answered by ccp, i haven't seen a valid argument against it so-far."
4/2/2009,"i've seen this ship in action. the regulars in pure blind know darknesss' kronos as ""the big teaser"" and while jumping into a camp just to say ""nyah nyah nyah"" and jump out might seem a bit lame, when you're putting 5bn isk on the line each time, you have to respect that. watching it tank a moderate hac fleet is pretty cool.however the only bug i am aware of that relates to this type of situation is the killmail bug. recently i've seen many killmails where ships are just missing from the km, and damage is flat out wrong. i wouldn't trust the km to represent the engagement. i don't think you were dd'd, and i don't think you'd be using a broken km as an excuse to get reimbursed. in any case on the basis that ccp agreed it was an unfair loss (and this replaced the ship) yes, there is no reason to penalise the player by not reimbursing the items. supported. the potential for intentional item duplication would rely on being able to convince a gm that the bug was at fault, and you'd expect that if this policy was changed, gm's would become even more reluctant to agree to reimbursements. but assuming gms know what they're doing, and the logs are adequate to determine whether the game play was as intended, then ccp should be able to reimburse correctly. agreed that the volume would have negligible economic impact.i hope you are able to replace the parts and come trolling around pure blind again soon."
4/2/2009,"i believe that darkness's position is correct, that losses the direct result of a serious bug should be complete, as in all modules returned. it is unfair to excessively punish the player who experienced this bug by not returning billions in modules that they wouldn't of lost if the bug didn't exist. the flip-side is that this could be exploited, discovering a serious bug like this before it's patched would allow people to purposefully have a friend destroy their ship and then file a reimbursement and duplicating some of the mods. such exploiting should carry a punishment of being banned for all involved parties. i doubt it would take much investigation to determine if the players are doing this or not. of course you couldn't eliminate all the people who could take advantage of this with remote aquantices in enemy alliances/corps but just the threat of banning for trying it should deter most peoplei don't think the remote off-chance risk of people exploiting this policy change is enough to justify not reimbursing the loss of the modules to a serious bug.this isn't about tri or darkness or if this was the result of a bug or not, or even anything about his situation. this is about the general policy for reimbursement being changed for losses from serious bugs. such bugs become quickly public knowledge, and are quickly patched."
4/2/2009,no valid reason they shouldn't add themedit: i fail at typing
4/2/2009,would be nice to see wat they come up with for designe of the launcherssupported
4/2/2009,"i like the idea, would be neat to have more stars in the background such as the ones we can travel to. as well as space objects op is talking about."
4/2/2009,"well they had discussed having other stars visible in space, that you could set destinations to. that would cause way too much lag. but having them visible, and having the clouds static and stationary would be nice. right now they are just varying versions of the same hubble pics... kind of needs an update.edit : adding support because of stupid forum glitch."
4/2/2009,supporting
4/2/2009,"yes to new backgrounds, i have been loving the wormhole backgrounds so far so the normal systems really need some love."
4/2/2009,"assuming rare skills, and existing skill books, are transitioned into ""datachip"" format - and yes, there are a lot of drop-only or no-longer-seeded skills - this seems reasonable. the whole concept of skill hubs has always seemed weird to me. it's not a matter of benefiting people, it's a matter of reducing player workload."
4/2/2009,"on the rp side of the house, this is technically a bad idea.. allowing direct access to your brain over a communications network seems foolish at best and down right suicidal at worst. anything that could get into your brain through such methods is just opening doors to hackers of the mind.on the non rp side of this, no, go take the time to pick up your skills just like everything else."
4/2/2009,bad idea. no.--isaac
4/2/2009,"excellent idea, reduces hassle."
4/2/2009,giving support as promised.
4/2/2009,"and rp-wise, plugging in an implant is safer....why? you're doing exactly the same thing.since i already said that i didn't have an issue with picking up my skill books here... the non-rp argument you offered really doesn't make much sense. frankly, the whole idea is that, from a game immersion point of view, it makes zero sense that you can't transmit information as efficiently (if not more so) 20,000 years in the future than you can today."
4/2/2009,"on the rp side of the house you already do plug your brain into a network, or the cloning operation wouldn't work. you also learn the skills via injections directly into your brain.the only reason skill books are physical is because thats just how the initial economy was structured. theres no reason that there can not be a seperate neocom based store to buy your skills. i think it's a novel idea anyway."
4/2/2009,"agreeing to a certain point.but another ship wouldn't hurt. although this old cruise bomber shouldn't use cov up cloaks, since it is way out of reach and out of dangour"
4/2/2009,"i think the change would be great for a black ops boost, but i don't really use the bomber for much anything else so i am not sure exactly how this is going to affect other applications of this ship.so i am not entirely sure how to vote given i have not explored all possibilites of the bomber."
4/2/2009,"jesus christ you people are dumb.ccp are merely throwing out ideas and will then test them on their internal servers and then on sisi and then make concrete decisions. we should be very grateful that ccp is allowing us into their balance/development process and not over-react and start petitions and useless threads when ccp hasn't announced any final changes yet.if you want to keep a version of the old bombers, then do so by giving feedback in the correct thread. ah is not for emo-filled threadnaughts, go to shc if you want to emo-rage."
4/2/2009,"new ship, while giving the old one a boost to explosion velocity. (as stated in the 15 page thread in the assembly hall from people who actually fly the boat!)otherwise please refund all the points put into frigate v, covops and cruise missiles for all the pilots who ask for it. there's quite a few pilots who trained these skills solely for the stealth bomber. they will now be as worthless as training multitasking."
4/2/2009,"changing the sb's is a joke, a little used ship will be used even less. offer us a choice, or is ccp changing its mind about eve being a sandbox?"
4/2/2009,"i agree and support this, although i still want my cov ops cloak without a recloak nerf"
4/2/2009,most definitely.
4/2/2009,"local spam doesn't increase lag, never has."
4/2/2009,"okay. so say you fit 3x damage mods, 1 dcu. then what? about everything else is strictly inferior to a midslot version. the nano-nerf (all those low-slot nano mods no longer worth fitting) unfortunately broke low/mid slot balance as a side-effect."
4/2/2009,"refining arrays have one purpose, to refine ice. a bunch of small ones on a large tower can refine insane amounts of ice quickly at 100% efficiency. for ore, they've never been worth it. if any decent system with high-end ores was way to far to fly hauling as you go to a station then a new outpost was built there. with the crazy amount of loss (25% i think is crazy for the intensive one, and the mind boggling 65% loss on the small one, coupled how slow they are make them never (in the past and even now) a viable way to refine ore. personally i'd love to see pos's get some serious love, redesigned from scratch with the ""flogging a dead horse"" design idea, a unified corp hanger (mods just increase size of it) and refining array mods that you can add that will get you 100% refine ability at some serious cost (like doubling or more the fuel costs of the tower).in reality this the whole pos system needs scrapped and redone. just trying to repurpose refining arrays for w-space pos's isn't really something i'd want them to waste time on. i'd love to see the next fall 09 expansion to be entirely about sov mechanics, outpost and pos redesign. guess i went off topic there."
4/2/2009,"i spend a couple hours a day digging through the market, posting buy and sell orders, etc. it's nothing different than thousands of other players do everyday. however, as the years have passed there is one improvement that stood out in my mind that could be made that would truly streamline market interaction -idea - add an option under market settings that allows us to highlight our own buy/sell orders.half of the time i spend going through the market is spent finding my own orders and making comparisons. if my own orders could be highlighted then visually parsing all the info would be magnitudes easier."
4/2/2009,"nothing wrong, and sure would be convinient."

4/2/2009,"i'd like to see the following improvements to faction warfare to make the system more fun, and less not fun.a ) less plexes that are worth more.-- this makes plexes more valuable and more relevant to fight over. you don't want to cause blob warfare to occur, so you have to balance this with other issues.b ) more difficult plexes-- with less plexes and more difficult plexes, they will take longer to contend over.c ) harder defense plexing-- defensive plexing is too easy. it requires no skill. and can be done by an alt account. what's the meaning of this? sitting 10-20 minutes doing nothing. by making plexes more valuable, you bring more contention to them, meaning that it's harder to defend because offense will be looking for more of them to do. also defense plexing is worth more than offense plexing. 1 defensive plex is equal to at least 1.5 offensive plexes taken. what sense does this make for the system? offense is impossible. if you just wanted open warfare, remove the dam stupid plexes. you wanted spots of contention not centered around stargates, however, you didn't create anything of interest to fight over? i think that there should be invading opposing npcs that join in combat when a player is defense plexing so that they get the same challenge that offensive combat gets. also, make defensive and offensive plexing equal in value. you have only made things frustrating, not entertaining. you want people to move on from faction warfare, but you present to them nothing more than absolute boredom as a first opportunity to experience pvp and the game??? try again.--sorry, really stupid game design here. you literally made fw boring on purpose. great game design... ya... brilliant. i'll be sure to buy the next hot boring game on the shelf when i'm in a game store.d ) escalating plexes-- have plexes escalate from minor plexes at the start of the contention process and work up to ""major"" plexes at the height of the contention process. rather than total randomness. this allows players to guage better the contention of the system, and to bring more forces to bear on the more valuable plexes, and still lets new players feel more valuable working the plexes to the higher contention levels, while veterans work on building up for the heavy battles.e ) allow multiple entrances into plexes to allow for combat variety. camping an accel gate, then a warp in point to a plex to try and catch targets is just dumb, it allows for no variation in strategy or engagement.. there's no opportunity to assemble other strategies rather than, ""warp to 0km and pray for the best."" if you create fewer more relevant plexes, then you can allow for multiple warp in beacons on a plex that allow for fleets to pick different entry points to create better combat strategies.f ) make it fun. try that instead."
4/2/2009,especially agreed with the defensive plexing problem.
4/2/2009,"a rigged occator gets over 10k, and you can also use a dozen of them with one black ops/recon pair as easily as a single one. i can easily see someone setting up an instant-movement business between, say, jita and rens for anyone with a blockade runner and some isk. that is not something that ought to exist."
4/2/2009,"first, occators cant just to a covert cyno, viators can, and they get 10k m3 rigger and expannded. although 10k m3 of trit isnt alot in isk 10k m3 off snake omega's is. ok, not the best example, but you get my drift. its not nessaserily the volume of the goods that makes it valuable.i however, think its a good idea, but i just wanna speed up the occasional hauling i do :p"
4/2/2009,"you're right, that was a typo, i meant the viator. i remembered it being at the top of the list in eft when i checked it, so i assumed it was the one that was alphabetically first - i don't fly transports myself, and i can never remember which is which. the occator can get 35k+, but can't bridge.however, name issues aside, the number was correct - 10k+ m3 per ship bridging. people won't be bothered for pure trit, but for reasonable items(named goods, say), then there's more than enough money to be made to justify the transport costs, and it's money that can be made far too easily."
4/2/2009,"yes i will grant you that its a possibility, but i'm sure ccp can code around preventing high-sec covert cynos being usable by transport ships.additionally moving high-value stuff at the moment is pretty safe, transport ships are damn near uncatchable as it is, plus if you want to move larger quantities of valuable stuff you can put it in the corp hanger on an orca, which neither shows up on cargo scan or drops if you are killed, and is considerably more hp to suicide gank."
4/2/2009,"i don't see the problem of the trading shortcuts which seem to be the main issue. a black ops jump bridge has such little (tiny really) range that you probably never be able to jump from one trade hub to another and that while using expensive fuel.the one problem i see here is that you can avoid low-sec gate camps.say you are delivering something in a system 3 jumps into low-sec and you have a black ops in a high sec system and one in a low-sec system you can make an easy jump bridge between the two and get all of your ""add expensive mod"" in (i guess you can already do this) or out there without any risk, especially if you make this bridge near a station or pos.i like the idea but i think the above method i stated removes risk from low-sec way too easily."
4/2/2009,considering the extreme short range; and insane training time it takes for covert cynos. i cant see this as unreasonable.well obviously nobody will be bringing the black ops into pvp. so worst case you're moving other ships around and such.pff. wardecs are so broken and such. i cant see why you even bother tbh.
4/2/2009,blockade runners can get through bubble camps easy. let alone empire. they also dont really haul much. so essentially speaking. the insanely short range jumpbridge and fuel costs. pretty well balances that idea.right now to basically go from oursulaert to amarr. using a sin. it'd take roughly 6 jumps.that's alot of fuel because of how short range the black ops are. all for blockade runner sized cargo?on top of that. it's going to take 1000m3 of fuel just for the black ops. add in the blockade runners and you have to pigyback a few blockade runners for fuel.if someone wants to do this and be competitive on the market? ya right.
4/2/2009,no. no cynos whatsoever in high-sec. i see no reason nor purpose for this use. --isaac
4/2/2009,"wait until ccp finalizes their bo changes. they are going to make bridging easierand anyway, no more boosts to logistics. it is too easy and safe now. if anything, it should be nerfed. no cov ops cloaks on transports, reduce jump freighter range, increase pos jump bridge costs 10x. force people to actually fly thru the damn gates. and maybe, just maybe, we'll see people organize escort duty, which would provide fun for everyone.if you played this game since 2004, you'd know what i'm talking about"
4/2/2009,"if you were around in 04 then you know good and well you didn't need an escort in 0.0 or anywhere, players were rare to see in 0.0, and you should know that, so dont bring up your silly bull.people dont need to fly and use gates all the damn time thats why the jump bridge was made, past that having them in highsec would be no issue as they cant move any large ammount anyway, it was be much easer to move the stuff with the trasnport to a lowsec system 3 jumps out and jump to a different lowsec system near the other hub, use your brain."
4/2/2009,"i think this would bring an interesting dynamic to high-sec wars, also increase demand for these ships since high-sec corps/alliances would find them useful and not restrict their customer base to just 0.0 dwellers. pros:-more options for fighting 0.0 wars-increase the customer base for black ops thus increase sell volume and price (good for producers, they're already very nearly unprofitable to invent).cons:-might make transport of mega-value cargo ""safe"" in high-sec, but as already pointed out putting cargo in an orca's corp hanger makes it 100% safe since it can't be scanned or looted from (if this is true).so for a con that isn't really a con, because already exists ways to move mega-high-value cargo 100% safe in empire, over making empire wars more interesting and possibly making a nearly unprofitable and nearly unused ship-class more profitable and used?all i can see is win with this proposal."
4/2/2009,"since just treating all 0.0/low-sec local like w-space local would likely be unfeasible without some serious ui/scanner changes to replace that functionality. i propose that we just make it so stealth ships not show up in local if they are cloaked.this will only apply to the following ship types: covert ops, stealth bombers, black ops, force recons and blockade runners. this will apply to all k-space systems, null, low and high-sec. they only appear in local if they're uncloaked. what this means is they will flash in local when they switch from the ""just entered system cloak"" to their active cloak module. giving people a chance if they're really watching to see them for a second before they dissapear off local again. these classes of ships should be suited to such stealth approch/ambush methods. it will change aspects of pvp, but it wouldn't be as game-changing as every ship not showing in local like w-space. discuss."
4/2/2009,"not supported. the change to local should be for all ships in all 0.0 space. better scanning tools would be nice, but i do not consider them necessary for this change to happen. the directional scanner works well when used properly."
4/2/2009,"until massive changes happen to the current scanning system, i'm not supporting this. --isaacp.s. and yes, even i fly 3/4ths of those ships."
4/2/2009,"ccp has expressed great desire to remove local's intel value at some point. i get the impression that no matter what they do, or change, a sub-set of the population is not going to support it and throw a fit. this proposal only increases risk in so much as a setup trap (you can't be sure if that ratter has support cloaked next to it or not). you'd think carebears would like the proposal i made as it stands.if your paying attention to local you'll see the quick de-cloak/re-cloak flash (extend that to maybe a full second or maybe two seconds) of someone entering the system, so you get pre-warning to safe up. it will also greatly increse the risk factor for roaming gangs wanting to gank ratters/miners. since they can't be sure it's not a trap.all this proposal will do is bring, i think, a very interesting new dynamic to 0.0 small gang warfare. if anything it will increase the safety of ratters/miners."
4/2/2009,"i am only support this because i want a cov ops cloak without a re-cloak timer. that's it, no more, and i will damn sure not be happy with anything less. the whole torp suggestion is way out of line. i seriously believe that these guys in charge have never really played this game, yet they are the ones providing all the changes. if they want a heavy bomber in the anti bs role make a t2 tier 2 bc ""heavy bomber"" and **** that up.... give me my untainted cov ops cloak and leaf meh be"
4/2/2009,"i'd rather ccp accidentally delete all database entries for stealth bombers, and accidentally delete them from the backups."
4/2/2009,"not supported.i think the last two years have been the most improvement to the mechanic in the entire eve history, and the most improvement to balance issues.and the new bomber will be as it was supposed to be, a class cannon with stealth, that you need to fint the correct targets for.have you actually tested it out? i have and i think it is out preforming the old bomber on every turn"
4/2/2009,"no support. the stealth bomber has had no real role up till now. now that ccp has finally declared one, i see why its such a good idea. think of it in a real world setting (oh noes, he put it in real world settings. no!!!). we have stealth bombers that come in, stealthily, delievers a big payload and then gets out of there. (have you ever seen a bomber stick around after hitting its target?)this role seems good and i'm willing to give it a try. --isaac"
4/2/2009,"you think a volly thats 3/4 of that of a raven as a ""big payload""...dude...."
4/2/2009,"*sigh*. this is a frigate and once again, comparing it to a battleship...seriously? you all are too drunk on the original idea of the stealth bomber kpwning all the frigates. to be honest, the original had a pretty bad role. at least now they have set a role for it and then we can improve on it. which is a hell of a lot better than a non-role. now, you have a very agile and mobile dps monster that can cloak and surprise people. which is a pretty decent role. no, you won't be able to single-handedly destroy ships and never die. which imo, was stupid in the first place. now you are at least viable in a gang. more small gang than large gang i suppose. btw, while we're comparing the frigate to battleships. we should buff all hacs so they do more damage than a battleship. /me end sarcasm. (see how stupid that comparison is?)--isaac"
4/2/2009,"there has been huge arguments over ninja salvaging, and i think we need to settle it.as it is now, when you salvage (not loot, but salvage) someone else's wreck you do it without consequence, and there is little to nothing the victim can do.now as a fan of eve's dark side, i even say this isn't right, it is plain outright stealing.what i propose is that when you salvage someone's wreck, it gives you the same aggro timer countdown to the victim and his corp as if you were to steal their cargo container (the corp can shoot you for 15 minutes).the main argument by the salvagers is that a wreck is space junk, and isn't worth anything. well, if it is junk why do you want it so badly? and what concord may see as junk can be seen by the pod pilot as treasure. and if enough people sign a ""petition"" then that junk will be defend able from thieves.sign below if you want salvaging to give people cargo-container style aggro."
4/2/2009,i support salvaging giving you aggro.
4/2/2009,"lmao this has been discussed for ages and i dont support it.u want to be sure u keep the salvage profits, u get rid of 1-2 high slots for a salvager and a tractor beam"
4/2/2009,"bump, supporting own topic"
4/2/2009,"iirc the grid is 250km, not 100 km. so, there is no reason you shouldn't be able to look at anything on grid."
4/2/2009,"i disagreeif you go to a busy market street, you are bombarded by people selling their wares at the top of their voices and competing with eachother.this is the way i look at jita. it is a busy market, full of people selling their wares, some scamming, some selling bargains, but all plying their trades in their own way. local chat was not designed for everybody to use as a sell channel. the fact that you are trying to compete with many others is just a fact of life you will have to live with. yes, the only think you can do is block the spammers.so i suggest you do what everyone else does in eve. create contracts, sell on the markets and if you make your prices competative, you will sell your stock.grz"
4/2/2009,no no no! you have failed to apply the what-would-goonswarm-do with this feature test.
4/2/2009,"this, as well as the fact that i can't take any proposal too seriously coming from someone named ""taco torpedo""sorry but there aren't any viable solutions offered here."
4/2/2009,would be nice with a real in game bank (although there would be a huge problem when some one deposits 1 trillion isk and you can just think of the interest this will generate ;)
4/2/2009,we don't need to counter the few isk sinks we have by isk generators. should not ever happen.
4/2/2009,"^^this. if you want to earn money without ""work"" then buy shares of corporations and hope they do well."
4/2/2009,"true, core launchers make this a lot easier, and as such the bc model is far less relevant than it used to be. i'm used to it obviously being a good idea to add, but i suppose with the addition of core launchers it's a lot less relevant. as for the destroyer, i imagine it'd have even less offensive capability than an average destroyer - probably 4-5 turrets, maybe a couple utility highs, and an increase in mid slots(and maybe some low) to compensate. this would be intended, more or less, as a ceptor that trades a bunch of its speed for scanning, and just uses a dd hull. that woudn't take all that much grid, and i don't know what exactly a frigate could fit even with a whole lot of cpu that'd be really scary. remember, it'd have to be a better combat ship than an af or a ceptor to be even a little bit broken. i don't see that happening."
4/2/2009,"sorry, a ship that fulfills the role of tackler and prober/scout is not a specialist ship.you already can hold a target down with a covert ops. you wont last long, true, but you shouldn't in a damn probing ship. problem lies between keyboard and chair. i love probing/scouting for gangs. no, i don't get to wave my epeen by showing off my epic killboard statz, but it's a useful and fulfilling role in any good gang.you not wanting to probe does not not mean that there's a problem.no, it's a buff to lazy players who can't be assed to get a covops."
4/2/2009,"may i suggest a recon ship? fit a probe launcher and you can probe and pvp. brilliance. granted most recons have the dps of a wet kitten, but it's the utility they bring not the dps that is important."
4/2/2009,"and how is this not a specialized ship? it should be designed to search people and hold them down for a limited amount of time with no capability of really killing the target. with added bonuses specifically set to combat probes it is fully designed around searching and holding.i never stated that i don't want to probe. i love probing it's the main reason i have taken up exploration as a main profession. with the new scanning mechanics i love it even more since i am actually doing something while scanning and not going afk for a minute.also whenever i scout for a gang i grab my trust cov ops. why? well so i can scan down people for a gang and i can't be arsed myself about killboard stats if it were up to me killmails would have been removed a long time ago.so stop accusing me of false facts thank you very much.and how is that? you still need this certain ship don't you? the added benefit of it is that it can hold targets down for a limited time. this ship would be an expansion to the cov ops line up. also the increased size would mean it is more expensive than a cov ops, risk vs reward right.also if you have read my main post properly it states that it has to give up cloaking this removes one of the benefits of cov ops ships and in exchange it gains another.what brilliance, i am in awe. probably didn't think about the fact that if you take up 220 cpu (about 50%) you will end up in a instantly destroyed ship because you had no space for the tank, which is paper for most recons already."
4/2/2009,"well, it's a party in the sense that an individual can only run twice for csm, and after that it's over. i did not want my experience to be lost, and thus used the network i had built from my terms on the csm to find a replacement candidate to pass on my knowledge.we all know how important continuity is, and it was sad to see that the second csm had to learn everything from scratch. to prevent this i will be personally travelling to berlin this weekend to inform erik and make sure he'll be good to go right from the start.it's an open structure, and not a party or clique as political parties are in the real world. i personally don't think politics have any place on the csm, after all we're all supposed to serve the players."
4/2/2009,he gets my vote ;d
4/2/2009,"due all respect, i suggest you do your homework.we already have had ccp commit to revamping the sov system. diversitydiversitydiversitydiv... wait, that's what i have been saying all along! what do you suggest is done then? the csm is already working on looking into the loot gathered from missions. we have also discussed the isk faucets and how they work. what can you do to make a difference?(please don't take offense if my tone is harsh. i think that you are qualified given your history, however i think you might have missed a few things)"
4/2/2009,"okay. i have not found much specific except for ""we are looking into it and will change it soon"". however, most of eve wants this changed asap, not next year.this is like saying that ecm is balanced, because it is so diverse compared to other ew. this is like saying that the gankageddon was balanced, because it was so diverse compared to other battleships.this is like saying that 12,000 m/s vagabonds was balanced, because it was so diverse compared to other ships. this is bal... wait, three out of four of the above is nerfed, one is pending. for one, reward should be balanced to risk. making insane amount of isk in high security is really unacceptable. you want to make isk safely? than it should take you more effort than mission farming.i am straight-forward and allergic to bull****. good qualities to have when you want something done, bad if you want to ""please the masses"". i can make a difference with just being myself, with no lies or facets. simple, realistic and very straight-forward, either you like it or you don't."
4/2/2009,"i doubt that it will be next year. but i have no control over that. not really, because the problem you were all about was diversity. again, i beg to differ. by using that argument, you ignore the problem. once again, i get the feeling you got me entirely wrong.i think everybody agrees with that. but you don't exactly put any good solutions to the table. even ccp knows that there's a problem, so just saying that to them is a waste of time.come up with clever solutions. it will serve you and everybody else much better"
4/2/2009,"what exactly did you mean mate, because to me it sounded like you're just saying,""oh some things (regions, ships, mechanics) are worse than others for diversity""and ""diversity"" - that sounds completely intentional, so from what you're saying i extrapolate that you mean some things are intentionally unbalanced for diversity. which is completely bonkers in my opinion, and obviously also that of iceblock."
4/2/2009,"the universe was generated using a simulator. so everything we see is, supposedly, how the creation of an universe would take place in the real world.everything is generated by random too. moon resources etc. is by random too.so because of the diversity of regions, you do have un-equal regions. for instance, kia settled into geminate because it has crap moons, making it safer for them. that makes space more interesting. you have regions which are fought a lot for, because they are worth a lot, and some to a less degree. i think that's fine, because else space would be static and all the same.in regards to ships, i laughed a bit when you mentioned ships. during my time on the csm, people have tried to tell me that the pilgrim is awful and should be buffed. it just so happens that i more or less fly a pilgrim only, as of the last 6 months. i think it's the most awesome ship out there.it's extremely subjective what is good and what is bad. because of the diversity of bonuses and the options you have with it, you naturally have ships which are worse than others on a subjective level. you can't define what's good and what's not, because it comes down to playstyle.the exact same goes for the kia example. they wanted a quiet region where people wouldn't try to take their space. that's their playstyle, they just wanted space where they could settle in and have a bit of fun. for a large alliance who wants to become rich, that's not desirable. but that doesn't mean it's bad space.tl;dr: it's extremely subjective. you can't define what's good and what is bad."
4/2/2009,"i dont really like what you stand for so you won't be getting my vote. your just a clone of most alliance jerks who think they own eve. i don't care for 0.0 space, its full of alliance jerks. if you have something positive to say about us carebears who like empire then maybe i will check out your campaign in more detail, until then my vote goes some other place. but good luck ****ing ccp off, that on the other hand, does get my vote."
4/2/2009,"i am from the soon era, sceptical to anything without a date. the problem is that the ""diversity"" you speak of is not really diversity, it is imbalance.that may be. in my eyes there is nothing clever about it. just make it so, plain and simple. change a few attributes and it is done. /whinage may commence after this.diversity does not equal two, rich and poor regions. i want depth and meaning, more than just ""this region is poor and people do not want it"". if a region is poor, it should have other attractions besides ""people does not want it"".a car salesmen does not advertise a car with ""this car is slow and people do not want to steal it"". i would not be particularly interested. even then i at least want an air conditioning and decent mpg. else i would want the seller to show me something inbetween a lada and a mercedes slr. surely there must be a good spacy car with good mpg if i sacrifice acceleration?--i guess one could call me a jerk.i don't care for high security space, it's full of carebear jerks... mocking aside, i have nothing against carebears. they are a part of the game. however, i have much against total security and ""safe havens""."
4/2/2009,"at the risk of stating the obvious, a car salesman is trying to get money off you by selling you a car. ccp aren't trying to sell a region to you, that's not their job (an alliance might want to rent out or sell space, but then its desirability or lack of is that alliance's problem). having both good regions that everyone wants and poor undesirable regions is a good thing, because it produces rivalries and competition. if every 0.0 region was of more or less equal value, there would be very little point in waging war with others to take their territory off them just to get more of the same, and 0.0 would quickly stagnate into lots of compact isolationist empires quietly minding their own businesses.there already are a number of variables in the value of regions - some are good for ratting and mining, some for r64 moons, some with useful npc hubs, some because of their proximity to empire, or their strategic location, or because their low mooncount makes them easily defended... some for several of the above, and a couple are terrible for everything - and that's a far better situation than having all regions ""balanced"" into uniform blandness. that's not to say that new mechanics couldn't be added which introduced more variety (random example off the top of my head: planetary mining for tech 4 materials) and that might have the side-effect of making some previously undesirable territory more valuable, but that should be a random side effect of introducing a new fun system, not a calculated effort to make all the regions 'fair'."
4/2/2009,i woke up all happy and twinkly i'd and what do i see? thiz. now i am all deprezzed.
4/2/2009,"good delegate, was pleasure working with michelle in csm 2, and i hope we will continue our work together in csm 3."
4/2/2009,"it was a tough decision to run again knowing this would upset you ""stuff"". i think with some counciling and a keyboard with a healthy ""z"" key you can get through this largely intact.issler"
4/2/2009,ok i'll play. but i don't do bake sales. do i need to find my copy of roberts rules now? i kid.
4/2/2009,so i should have a web page and forums up some time this weekend.issler
4/2/2009,"everyone in foom is a fried alt.he gave all of us a cap ship to join.and we all get free lollipops on fridays.and he promised to paint our space ships with a hello kitty pattern when it was available.so learn to love us issler, isn't that the kind of eve you are looking for?"
4/2/2009,"a balance of judgement member who fails to deny the deception and attempts to derail the situation with a stupid comments that don't address the issue at hand.so i think it is significant when someone that was high profile with all the good and bad that implies runs for the csm as an alt then denies it when someone calls them on it. it goes the issue of trust. i would have been happy to see freed run out in the open as a candidate. he was the head of one of the biggest alliances and would have valuable insight he could add to the csm.instead, we see voting for happy/freed is voting for the sneaky liar spy failed assasin alliance backstabbing candidate. since there are already ""crime and punishment"" candidates i expect happy-freed was late to the game to garner that segement of voters.still, with his all his alts and his 150-ish member alliance he might have enough votes to get a seat if the voter participation is low.so to potential voters, ask yourself if you can believe anything this candidate tells you?issler"
4/2/2009,"i think you better check your sources again. that post doesn't say who made it, in fact i can assure you it was not made by fried. besides, if fried were running we'd have spammed the living crap out of this thread by now with our supportive drivel and silliness. it's all part of being in the cult, we don't get our scheduled beatings if we don't comply."
4/2/2009,"i think readers can go to the link i provided and make up their own minds. besides, the csm rl identities are posted on the csm pages and it should be pretty easy to prove they are the both characters of the same person since freed was anything but shy about who he is in rl.if someone wants to come forward and say who happy is an alt of if not freed (since it is clear from the quote in the leaked forums happy is an alt of someone else) maybe that would clear things up. at any rate it is clear happy was not the primary of the person running for csm, appears to be an alt of freed based on the leaked forums posts and this bit of ""sneakiness"" makes me wonder what is trying to be keep behind the curtain.looks to be a fun election!issler"
4/2/2009,"so i went back and reread that leaked forums several times before i posted the link. i think when you look, the person that linked the posts made it pretty clear when the quoted person posting wasn't freed. also anyone but freed saying the stuff in that post wouldn't make much sense coming from someone else.so again, the voters can go to the link and read for themselves, then decide.issler"
4/2/2009,already seeking to discredit another candidate with spurious statements. it certainly didn't take much time for this to happen again.
4/2/2009,"well if you read it a few times and still feel the same way then you must be right. of course you aren't which is what makes it so funny. it's also kind of funny what you think is appropriate to be said by fried and people who aren't fried within foom. i think you are letting your own delusions cloud your judgment.in the end, if happy wins, you will ultimately be proven wrong when you see the csm profile you spoke of. in the meantime thank you for displaying your brilliant powers of deduction out here in the open where the voters can see it."
4/2/2009,"you should read the (fixed) link and then explain how it doesn't say what i say it says. because it does.again niskin, statements with no references to support your position.issler"
4/2/2009,"due all respect, i'd argue that there's a difference between stating facts, for the benefit of the public, and then judging people.it's easy to see when either is the case.in this case, it's obvious to see that the former is the case."
4/2/2009,"every post by fried is attributed to him at the start of the quote. the section in question is the only quote on that page not attributed to anyone. the section in question was indirectly attributed to somebody other than fried simply by following a quote which was attributed to somebody else.you said that they were pretty clear about attributing things that weren't fried to the proper person, but what you are missing is that they were even clearer about attributing things to fried only when they actually came from him. so following the format of the thread, anything not directly attributed to fried is actually not from him.i'm trying to save you from yourself here but apparently that's a futile exercise. there is even a clue in the paragraph itself which answers the question of who owns the happy character. i'd give you the answer but honestly it's much more fun to watch the train wreck that is your thought process."
4/2/2009,"happy is not an alt of frieds. frieds alts are rather easy to pick out, even for issler... when it comes to foom leaving bruce, the corps left behind (of whom i was a member at the time), did not really have alot of issues with foom. after bruce eventually folded, alot of ppl went to foom, welcomed with open arms. there was no animosity what so ever."
4/2/2009,"i stand corrected, it looks to be that spacey cadet was at one time happy's main. sad, really, having freed with his cult behind him would have been more fun.issler"

4/2/2009,"first off, the people saying that t2 bpo owners make bpc's and sell them know nothing about t2 production, or production in general so any opinion they may have on this is pointless. second when your paying billions (tens of billions for some) for a single print, i think you deserve to make a little better profit per run. after all your one print can only produce a finite amount of product/day, and a single inventor can easily out pace you in profit/day with invention.all the people crying out for t2 bpos to be deleted fall into one of the following categories:(a) ignorant about how t2 production actually works.(b) wants what they perceive they can't have, likely because of (a)."
4/2/2009,"not sure if it's an issue or whatever so going to slap this up here. what happened to the corp shop? i couldn't of been the only one that was actually looking forward to this new feature. managing corp contracts is a nightmare that are beyond evil and is a poor substitute to an actual corp market. so i guess my question is, was this feature swept under the carpet along with other broken dreams and tears of the developers or is this still a work in progress?"

4/2/2009,"i am reasonably certain that is not the case as our corp shop mother tried the corp contract technique recently and emo raged after the 2 weeks were up and decided that technique was not valid. it also wasn't the case in my last corp when i tried the contract system. luckily i am but a peon in invicta and thus don't have to deal with the functionalities of such a system anymore, but the corp shop made me more excited than the introduction of t3 by far and now i am a sad emo"

4/3/2009,"and i, as a member of a non-prick alliance would humbly request that ccp ban goonswarm and the former gbc so that we can all be rid of them trolling forums and necroing old threads."
4/3/2009,veldatar to amarr
4/3/2009,i am zach hepp and i approve of this message.
4/3/2009,"to be honest this is what the pos's should have been like from the start!whilst i am happy the ccp implimented the starbases back in the day rather than holding it until something like this sugestion was possible we are now a long way down the line and given that pos mechanics are being looked at and there are the homesteads (oh god i want these) on the long term list can this all not just be rolled up together??i guess the issue is how do you change something that is out there in such heavy use...so how about a reboot of the pos system by implimenting the new ideas as a whole new system along with the changes to pos machanics and some 'candy' so that the playerbase would naturaly move over from one to the other then retire the old system some time later??anyway, just wanted to add my support to an idea that is fundemental win on so many levels.-cj"
4/3/2009,missile nerfing was a direct result of nanonerfing; not suported!
4/3/2009,"the devs really do need to take a second look at missile, you have a weapon system that has too many negatives (sig, speed, etc etc) and the only positive is it ""always"" hits."
4/3/2009,"losing half my damage to a bs going at base speed is getting very annoying. i mean, most things about missiles are fine, but someone screwed up on the explosion velocity of the bigger varieties..."
4/3/2009,"the missile nerf was heavy handed and clumsily made to cater to whiners, if not repeal it then alteast revise it"
4/3/2009,"change the nerf, it fails and just cuases missionrunners to earn less isk and destorys a whole combat system"
4/3/2009,"failnerf, fix it ffs"
4/3/2009,quick! everyone make amarr/minmatar/gallente alts!
4/3/2009,all these changes to these ships any word on the nag yet.
4/3/2009,"as a naglfar pilot i would very much welcome any changes that fixes the flaws it has.it is a sweet looking ship, shame it is lacking in comparison to the others./signed"
4/3/2009,/signed
4/3/2009,"supported. i originally wanted a nag, but it's just not worth the effort as things stand. learning another race as a result, and that's just sad."
4/3/2009,"yup, they suck.not 100% sure the op's ideas are perfect, but they are ideas at least. supporting because minmatar caps do need some attention.oh and make the phoenix go vertical when it goes into siege! :)"
4/3/2009,"deffo a good idea!!i think an expire day and time on the skills page would be good - under the birth date perhaps.also, when you login and it loads up your ship in station or where ever, a pop up message like the downtime alert might be a better way to alert someone?giving them 7 days warning of account expiry - something like it will expire in xxxx on xx/xx/xx at xx:xx the same was as the dt message says you have 45mins until downtime if you login during that 1 hour period etc."
4/3/2009,"nice idea, simple clean solution, no drawbacks, sold!"
4/3/2009,o/
4/3/2009,"i have been screwed a few times times with gettng the ship back but no droped modules.. but i understand the ccp pov.when you drop those billions of isk mods into your ship, you knew that if a bug got you, you would not recieve reinbursement for them...you made the choice to equip.. as we all do. i see no reason to change things."
4/3/2009,"the fact that this thread has so few supports and so many replies, proves to me that this is a whine thread with a little extra glitter.do not fly, what you can not afford to lose. that is supposed to be the cardinal rule in eve. whether you lost your ship in a ""fair"" fight, or somewhere in that fight your ship exploded. it doesn't matter. you should be able to re-coup the loss. they replaced the op's ship. i don't know what all the fuss is about."
4/3/2009,"i have no doubts that darknesss can afford to replace that ship 3 times over.the point is he shouldn't have to, he lost it because of a bug, no bad piloting or enemy fire."
4/3/2009,"example.solo roamer in a hurricane comes to our home space this morning. he roams about a bit and we respond. soon as he sees more than two in local he logs, then uses the ctrl q repeatedly to get a postion with eyes on the gate we are camping with bubbles, he logs again.we move to the other side of the gate and wait, he logs back in, he jumps, he ctrl q's again.pvp has gotten so lame i think even wow is looking good now.zos"
4/3/2009,"supported!for the ones who are scared of pvp in a game that is made for pvp, just quit or grow a pair."
4/3/2009,see my signature for a way to gank the next ship that pulls that.
4/3/2009,"the more i think about it, the more i like the original idea. if you are agroed then you die, you do not warp away you do not collect $200 how is it even logical to think that pilot can log off and simply does not exist anymore to the players that are still logged in, even entire fleets.eve is not a compassionate game, you die you lose everything. so why should we allow this type of thing to happen just because people are scared to play the game."
4/3/2009,good call mate.
4/3/2009,i like the idea of showing some attention to the backgrounds.
4/3/2009,never been to a wormhole....i still support anyway. i grow weary of the same designs.
4/3/2009,scan one down and pop in with a cloaking frigate. it's worth just seeing... the moment you go through you feel like you're in another galaxy....thanks to the new backgrounds.
4/3/2009,"mr. sir substance - i totally aggree with you on this.war dec mechanics needs to be changed. it should be possible to say no to a war dec, or maby it should not be possible to war dec corps with less than 10 members.those of us enjoying manufacturing should have equal oppertunity to set up a pos if we want to - without having to engage in pvp (not fun)."
4/3/2009,"possible solutions to the war dec fix effort.still a newb, so bare with me if i mix things up.1. cost - this should directly be related to the size of the alliance, and increase the further along the wardec goes. a. scale based - 100 members less than yours = 400% cost, near equal number = normal cost, 100 members more = 400% cost. b. length - each week add 10%.2. get the military - a corp that has been wardec by another corp should be allowed to hire the local police/military, within the systems they wish to operate. this can be npc police/military, or player corps.this would work 2 fold. the aggressor would be able to challenge any corp they wish, but pay a penalty, if the corps differ in size. no small corps getting picked on by large corps.the aggressed would be able to protect themselfs by paying the local police/military, on a size basis. paying premmium to an npc police/military would provide npc gate camps, and station protection. where if your cheap, you may get one/two npcs per gate. the hired npc/players would become red to wt, and the wt would be red to the npcs.this would allow aggressed corps, that may not care for pvp, to still operate, and it would allow aggressor corps to to still do what they like to do.in short, both corps have to pay to do what they want to do."
4/3/2009,"ever since the new patch forcing the new shaders. my trusty computer at work has slowed down to a crawl while docked.all i do is change skills, look at the market etc, and i find this is much faster out in space at a moon or planet zoomed all the way out. i find it rather silly that while docked the interface slows down to a crawl, and while in space it's moving along at normal speeds.i am requesting the re-add of the option ""load station environment"" have it checked as default, however if it's not checked it simple loads a screen shot of the station and doesn't render anything.i'm in high-sec so i don't have to worry about being ganked in a empty ship orbiting nothing out in space, but i find it annoying that the one speedy station environment has been removed and replaced with something that deliberately slows down the interface."
4/3/2009,supporting my own thread!!
4/3/2009,"since after the first few weeks of gaming you never actually look at the station environment at all while fitting, browsing market ect. i fully support this. i dont have station lag often, but it happens sometimes."
4/3/2009,i personally dont have this problem but it doesnt mean others are in the same boat. anything that makes the game less resource dependant when it doesnt need it should at the very least be an option.
4/3/2009,"there, much like anti aliasing, used to be an option that did this, that for some ridiculous reason was removed. there used to be an option 'load station environment', that if you unchecked, it would render a single frame, and display that statically as the backdrop.removing anti aliasing was an even worse feature nerf..."
4/3/2009,"another option that would help would be ""disable space background"". seriously, how often do you have to move the camera about to see ui elements because of the shiny nebula plastered everywhere?"
4/3/2009,"fully supported. i couldn't care less about station backgrounds, but i care quite a lot about how slow my computer is at the best of times with eve running."
4/3/2009,"i install the game on comps at school when i'm at the university, and the station background option is what let me run the game on any computer. it needs to come back. supported."
4/3/2009,"yes please!!hell i would even like to see a toggle to disable the space enviroment, i dont need to see all them non interactive, static background graphics slowing down my machine."
4/3/2009,"/signmy machine is quite as a mouse in space, running missions, making pew pew..in station the fans rev up and it sounds like it's trying to take of!"
4/3/2009,yeah this would be a nice re-addition.
4/3/2009,"how is that even relevant to my post, plugging in an implant is not the same thing as transferring information directly to my brain for a long distance outside network. the best comparison would be betwen cctv and wireless network cameras.cctv's require direct manual/physical access to the network, such as directly injecting a skill into your brain, or directly plugging an implant into your brain. wireless networks only require anyone who can pick up the datastream and break into it between the originating data and the target data, i.e. your brain and this global databank you're trying to get skills from, making your brain susceptible to outsider intrusion.the pod network argument is also moot, the cloning process only takes effect during a pod breach, i.e. the moment of your death, only then could the data be intercepted between it being sent from your failing pod to your medical station. otherwise any sort of hacks into your brain would have to come from someome basically cracking into the neural network of your ship while you're controlling it, but something physical like that (again cctv reference) would be noticed by you since they'd have to manually breach a physical part of the ship, such as a node or other device."
4/3/2009,"and what stops some malicious employee at the implant factory from adding code to the implant to wipe your brain or something? you plug in the implant, and splat.for that matter, discussing your analogy of the cctv network. those aren't really that hard to disrupt either, especially if you have a malicious helper on the inside. you don't even need to disrupt the network - you can use the network against itself by looping video back to the monitor.the fact of the matter is, no form of security is perfect. but that doesn't stop people from using the internet to make purchases, or do their banking. and somehow, with 20,000 years to work on it, i'm guessing they've made them somewhat more secure, you think?"
4/3/2009,"the issue is there are large sections of space that there isn't a school a couple jumps from you. if all of eve consisted of high-sec space, then you'd have a point. but when you can be 20-30 jumps away from the nearest school, you shouldn't get instant access to new skills.the rp reasoning can be quite simple, the skill isn't just pure data, but a physical object that one must insert into your brain/pod computer or whatever. just as any other physical object in eve, you have to physically transport it. skills being this way is this way for a reason. transporting books to deep 0.0 is a money making opportunity and one that lives in deep space needs to plan accordingly and buy books ahead, use jump clones (putting you a full 24 out of commission) or find some other way to get their skills or work on something else until they can.eve isn't about conveniences, it's a hard game to play and that means physical travel. if you hug empire your travel time is brief to the nearest school, so it's a mild inconvenience."
4/3/2009,"make them all orange again, white flashes just look out of place on a minmatar ship.autocannons should be back to numbers 2 and 4."
4/3/2009,"i would like to have to have the option, having the choice of ships is never a bad thing.plus, if i didn't want options i'd go play that other mmo"
4/3/2009,ability to import/export blocked corporations/alliance/members could be very handy too
4/3/2009,"i'd much prefer regex based block lists for names, corps, alliances and messages."
4/3/2009,refining in deep space needs an overhaul:a) ref. array capable of refining modulesb) industrial core capable of refining mins/loot
4/3/2009,"agreed, would be very useful. being able to modify our order from the market detail screen would be extremely useful."
4/3/2009,"its been asked before, but why not put it forth again.supported"
4/3/2009,yup
4/3/2009,"yes, i mentioned this a while back. your orders should be highlighted blue."
4/3/2009,"would be very useful. thumbs up.most importantly, it would prevent me from doing dumb things like beating my own offers/demands when i have more than one and am tired."
4/3/2009,"this would be a life-saver. not sure what the technical side of it looks like, and it seems like the type of thing ccp may deny us, but i want this, and i want to see a reasonable attempt made to get us this.edit: this too."
4/3/2009,"an obvious ui improvement, especially with 'right-click > modify' added to one's own orders on the market details screen."
4/3/2009,"if i'm not mistaken, we already discussed this once or twice.and it's not possible."
4/3/2009,"ifiled that proposal years ago. no result yet.atm i need 2 screens open when doing market work. changing the own orders in the market screen would reduce the load on the server (300 permanently open, constantly updating wallets in jita are some load)second proposal: make it so that the change order and cancel order buttons in the order-context menue are a little more separated. i quite often hit the cancel order button accidently"
4/3/2009,"i highly doubt its not possible, might take a lot of work and be inconvienient.i support it :)"
4/3/2009,supported
4/3/2009,"gr8 idea, also add choice of doing the same for buy/sell orders for corp, alliance and people with high/low standings."
4/3/2009,would be much more useful than having to sort by price in order to do comparisons.
4/3/2009,genius.
4/3/2009,tbh i don't think this is the best idea ever. it's pretty obvious which buy and sell order is mine. maybe because i like to work with numbers so i can easily identify my numbers.
4/3/2009,tbh i don't think this is the best idea ever. it's pretty obvious which buy and sell order is mine. maybe because i like to work with numbers so i can easily identify my numbers.
4/3/2009,"i'd one up that. sorted by price, you could have a drag and drop structure that allowed you to move your order higher/lower, by a penny isk, than the one above/below it.this would be ideal.example:buy orders look like this:320013200019057 (mine)19000180001000i drag mine to the top of the list, the little modify orders prompt appears with the price of 32001.01 already in the price line. i confirm this is what i want by clicking ok, or enter a different price if there's a mistake.this would be most powerful when reviewing orders of different ranges, as you might decide to move your 5 jump order up to a point, but maybe not up to competing directly with the motsu station order, etc."
4/3/2009,"well la vista vista is former csm, and pretty good with coding.... so... i dunno.vista can you elaborate?"
4/3/2009,would be nice
4/3/2009,"even if that's what you were told, it's a ludicrous claim, and it should be reconsidered.at worst from a server-impact perspective, the current market details window would have to additionally gather all the data that is currently selected for the orders window. since active traders today have no choice but to work with both windows at present, if they switched to one window pulling the same data, this wouldn't actually add any data selection.and you can already see for yourself that the key to matching the data on the market details screen with the data on the orders screen is already being selected: 'orderid' is in both types of exported tables."
4/3/2009,"it's not safety i'm concerned about, it's speed. this would be a tremendous multiplier in how fast things can be moved, and that's not something i want more of."
4/3/2009,"i have.and i couldn't give a toss about transport ships, quite happy for them to be excluded, or even the jump portal altogether. i just want to be able to use black-ops in empire wars."
4/3/2009,"unsupported.i feel, with no programming knowledge, that adding in specific code to filter local based on not only shiptype, but state of such shiptype, might be even harder to add in than just making a better ui."
4/3/2009,"lol,yeah it is realy humanly possible to pay attention to local constantly and never leave it with your eyes even for a sec... only bots will be able to do that just like now --> huge advantage for macroers, not good for ordinary ratters/miners.it wont realy increase the risk factor for roaming gangs. do you think a small recon fleet would just wait for an enemy roaming gang to show up and watch one of their members killing the npcs? sounds very boring to me.what i think would be: cloakers would be in most systems waiting for ganking lone ratters."
4/3/2009,"nope - there hasn't been an arguement. there has been a clear statement of intent from the game designers stating that ""this is how it is supposed to work"" and a bunch of whining from people who don't like it. creating a new post doesn't change it and it doesn't make this thread any different than the previous threads on this topic. and - not supported."
4/3/2009,ccp has stated before it should not draw aggro.salvage is just that... salvage.
4/3/2009,"technically, if you want to get right down to it, the wreck should belong to the same corporation as the pilot flying it when it blew up. i mean, if some drunk guy runs my car off the road, he doesn't get my car, even if i do die. it goes to my next of kin.so if you look at it from a certain point of view, all salvagers are thieves.don't you just loooove semantics?"
4/3/2009,"i'm kinda new to this game, but isn't this what this forum is for? i thought the idea was for people to raise issues of importance to them, regardless of what might have been posted in the past or what ccp's current policies are.just sayin.'"
4/3/2009,"no, the csm is a way for the player-base society of eve to bring forth issues pertaining to ccp.it is not the forum for whiny arrogant carebear pricks to whine and tell ccp what the rules for their own game should be.salvage is for everyone. this is how ccp deisgned it and intended it to be. if you don't like it then go play hello kitty online.btw, welcome to eve-o. always remember if you don't like it then you can gtfo."
4/3/2009,"you know, its funny how many insults fly around this issue. being a ""carebear"" myself, while i'm not fond of the fact that salvaging doesnt flag ppl, i prefer not to rant on something that's relatively minor, since ccp has stated that its by design. i think ppl should be flagged because it would encourage pvp.. a stated intent of eve as a whole. i guess ccp doesnt want to deal with ppl crying about getting ganked by the fleet a salvage thief may have waiting for the salvager to get aggressed, and i think the ppl who get attitudes every time this is brought up are mostly ppl who wouldn""t have such a fleet available. if someone takes the time to scan down a mission i'm running solo.. more power to them. they made an effort and its paying off. if they scan down a mission that i'm running in fleet, then its a race cause we usually have someone salvaging as we go. i really dont see why ppl get so worked up about this issue time after time, i dont really care which way it goes, so for the moment i'll just agree with ccp on this one. sorry to my fellow carebears for not feeling this is worth supporting."
4/3/2009,"working as designed, and i see no reason it ought to be changed. it's less annoying than a whole lot of other game mechanics out there, and with better reason and more effective possible countermeasures."
4/3/2009,no.
4/3/2009,"no. it is junk. you want it so badly, salvage it first."
4/3/2009,no.
4/3/2009,"i think it should, that way those 'salvagers' actually have to fight for what they want. yes it is junk, but if there is a ship in the area you should have the option to engage them. since when did adding more pvp to a pvp game become a bad thing.if you notice it's not the pveers who are against this, it's the thieves who are not willing to fight and just want easy isk. i say make them fight for it, just like looting a wreck salvaging should give agro."
4/3/2009,try not running your missions in high-sec.as to the proposal. no.
4/3/2009,^^ this - just in case anyone misunderstood my first response.
4/3/2009,"there are two counters to ninja salvagers.1. get a friend to salvage for you.2. kill the wrecks if someone appears in your mission.no need to nerf ninja salvaging when there are easy counters to it, thumbs down."
4/3/2009,"i'll support this only if at the same time they also add....if i'm mining an asteroid in space, and someone else comes along and starts mining it, they become agro to me allowing me to attack them without concord intervention.you manager to get that passed and i'll support agro from salvaging."
4/3/2009,"interesting that so called ""ninja salvaging"" is allegedly intended by the developers, yet, i don't think there's actually a mechanic for scanning out wrecks other than scanning down the guy doing the mission. i could be wrong."
4/3/2009,"3. fly a ship with utility highs(dominix, raven, marauder) and salvage as you go."
4/3/2009,"not supported.this keeps coming up and keeps coming up and keeps coming up. look, salvage is meant as a mini-profession in order to generate the raw materials to create rigs. let's think through what would happen if you introduce salvage aggro:1) pirates will bait mission runners much the same way they bait miners and the next thing you know the same mission runners will be complaining about how pirates are baiting them and blowing them up and boo-hoo, make it so only the wreck owner can salvage.2) the risk associated with ninja salvaging will increase resulting in an increase to the value of salvage resulting in an increase in rig prices which you will all then complain about.seriously, get over it. mission in a less crowded area. salvage your own wrecks as you go (i have seen plenty of mission runners do this and i generally leave them alone). bring someone along to salvage for you. there are 3 solutions to your problem that do not involve screwing up the entire salvage/rig market.[edited for clarity]"
4/3/2009,i forgot counter #3. dangit.
4/3/2009,"i run missions in high sec and i say no to aggro from salvaging the wrecks from other chars.i like the way it is now, so the salvaged parts go to who gets to them first."
4/3/2009,i'm not following. are you saying that ninja salvagers will stop ninja salvaging if there's a chance they could get banged up in the mission? and then you're saying that there's enough ninja salvagers that will actually stop the behavior that rig prices will sky rocket?
4/3/2009,"iirc, i read somewhere once that the eve online salvage system is based around the real world naval salvage. in international waters, the first person to get a chain around the wreck gets to claim it as salvage.however if you do that to a military vessel you will most likely be shot..."
4/3/2009,"right. but like you said, do that to a military ship, and you're likely going to have a tough time. i think i *get* why you can't just scan down a wreck with a combat probe---as there's probably a good chance that there could potentially be so profitable that everybody and there brother would be dong it. although, i don't understand that other thing where somehow associating risk with ninja salvaging will cause mass market hysteria."
4/3/2009,"because additional risk means i have to compensate for that risk by increasing my prices. right now salvage is cheap because there is essentially no risk associated with obtaining it. if we implement a new aggro mechanic, i am now risking my ship when i go out to salvage, i have to have some way of off-setting that risk, so i increase my prices to cover my potential losses.i'm not saying ninjas will stop, i'm saying they will increase their prices."
4/3/2009,"there already is risk.the only reason you think there is no risk is because you mission in high-sec. if you want to make more money anyway you will have to run missions in low-sec.this doesn't take much brain power to understand. if you want to shoot at people - leave high-sec. if you want the safer but cheaper end of the verse, you stay in high-sec.this isn't an argument, it's a lack of understanding on your part.edit: also stop posting under your alt."
4/3/2009,"thank you efrim, this actually proves my point. look at how much more expensive t2 rigs are. this is because t2 salvage is extremely valuable due to the risk associated with obtaining it. what you are suggesting will bring this risk to t1 salvage, thereby increasing t1 rig prices."
4/3/2009,"what you're pointing out about the rigs is true, but to me this thread belies a deeper stupidity between the ops keyboard and chair. high security space is high security space. this thread smacks of a whine by someone who has never run missions in low-sec or 0.0."
4/3/2009,/thread
4/3/2009,"agreed. currently, hi-sec missioning is way too safe. this change would bring dozens - if not hundreds - of eager pirates into hi-sec, each working full time to try and tempt missioners with juicy faction/officer fits into fighting. this would add some much needed risk to balance the high rewards, just as happens with miners.meanwhile the large increase in ninja salvaging would drop the price of rigs so that they are more affordable to the average player. double win!"
4/3/2009,rigs would get much more expensive.90% of pvpers couldn't care less about salvage.not supported.
4/3/2009,yup.
4/3/2009,"we all know shield tanking is quite limited in pvp cause the shield tanking modules share slots with important other ones.now buffer shield tanking sometimes somehow works but what about active one? the introduction of rigs made active tanking a bit easier but armor/shield buffer tanks are mostly superior, especially when more pilots come into the fight.the idea is now: introduce a weaker shield boost amp (10% t1, 16% t2) as a low slot module additionally to the mid slot one. we already have something similar, the shield power relay and the shield recharger (both improving shield recharge, one more one less) and i dont see why not? doing some math you will realize that xlarge + 16% low slot amp would be a bit below dual large armor rep setup performance.we dont actually need a new module, you can modify the old one maybe. instead of adding a low slot mod you could just modify the shield boost amp that you if you fit it in a low slots it gives 20% less.best regards*edit*i dont think it is even when it comes to tanking.you get more ehp with armor buffer tanks, more base resist and you have more slots for tanking in general. on shield tanking ships, if you are gonna active tank it, you have 2 epic slots left for your tank if you are fitting your ship for serious pvp and not for comedy killmails. adding a 16% (t2 version) low slot amp would actualy bring active shield tanking a bit below active armor tanking for pvp.some numbers:common pvp setup has 2 mid slots left for tanking. using resist rigs, invul, xlarge booster and a imaginary 16% low slot amp you can tank shooop da woop ~375dps.you get 1.93 hp/cap pointnow a 3 slot dual large amor rep tank with armor rigs tanks ~400 dps and gives 2hp/per cap point."
4/3/2009,btw i support my own idea :>
4/3/2009,"i don't know about pilgrim, but guristas faction ship bonuses are broken atm; giving a turet bonus to a ship that don't have the powergreed to fit those turets, that is incontestably broken."
4/3/2009,"yeah, the guristas ships are horrible. split bonuses, but no split weapon system and no pg/cpu to support it anyway? urgh. the rattlesnake is just a raven with a few more hp and an extra lowslot. pointless.give it a proper 4/4 split weapon system and the fittings to fit torps and blasters. then give it a decent (~175 m3) drone bay and a drone bonus. now that's a proper gall/cal hybrid. skill-intensive, yeah, but worth it."
4/3/2009,"i had this idea halfway through watching clear skies.say we have a new 'agent' added to almost all stations, called ""charter board"". speaking to this pseudo-agent would bring up an interface similar to the market details sub-window. it would contain a list of randomized npcs with level, pay, jumps, cargo, and time limit columns.i.e.name - level - pay - jumps - cargo - time limitmr smith - 0 - 12k - 1 - 0.1m3 - 15 minutesright clicking on an entry will give only one option (the only one this interface would ever need), ""accept charter"". when that is clicked, 50% of the pay is added to your wallet as a ""charter prepayment"" and two items appear in your hangar. a placeholder for ""mr smith"", and a sealed cargo container (""mr smith's cargo"").incase you're thinking: ""wait, so it's nearly exactly the same as a courier mission?"", it isn't. level ""0"" would basically just be something for new players; short distance and no risk (unless it's not in highsec). at level 1, some risk is introduced; at each stargate you warp to after accepting the charter, there is a chance that hostile npcs will spawn. naturally, level 1 would be nothing more than a couple of frigates, but each one will warp scram and trigger a session change timer when you encounter them.""but won't the gate guns, concord, faction npcs, and other players take them out?""no. these npcs will only be hostile to the person that accepted the charter (and anyone else in fleet, corp or alliance with them). in effect, you taking the charter made you a war target for these npcs, and vice versa.now, obviously, you'd have a choice about how to handle the situation. you can kill these npcs, or you can tank/kite them until the session timer runs out and you can jump. they will use two point scrams, so it won't be as easy as strapping a mwd on a quick frigate though.the emphasis for these npcs will be that they have no bounty, drop no loot, and only give scrap metal from salvaging (so farming charters like you can missions wouldn't happen). even at level 4+ there will be no more than 3 npcs; at level 3 and higher the ships they use will be identical to the ships available to players, and fitted similarly.when you arrive at the destination station, the placeholder for the npc and their cargo will be automatically removed. the ""charter postpayment"" will appear in your wallet also (the other 50% of the pay). it would cause next to no overhead to have a simple check run once when a player docks to do this;if (playerid.charter==true){..if (playerid.location==playerid.charter_destination)..{....set playerid.charter false....[insert however removing items/adding isk to a wallet is done here]..}}that's a single call to check a boolean variable (fun fact: the average computer can do millions of these checks in a second) upon docking if the player doesn't have a charter open.i think i covered everything (even need for speed compliance ), let me know if there's any gaping holes (my mouth doesn't count).[/wall]edit: from a coding aspect, a single dev could do the whole thing. no content would need to be created for the game; it could all be randomized and parented to the owner of the charter."
4/3/2009,"i like this idea. it's kinda like a courier + kill mission but without the mission. if these were available at every station i could imagine doing a bunch of these in a chain, leading you on a journey. this seems better than the whole ""grab mission, do mission, turn in mission, repeat"" having to drop back to the mission hub creating congestion. this would allow players to choose where they want to go next in the chain of charters.supported."
4/3/2009,"i forgot to support my own idea! while playing dead space the past little while, i thought about how the pay would be calculated. i came up with this;p=pay , l=level , os=origin sec status , ds=destination sec status , j=jumps , c=cargo m3p=((l*50000)+10000)*(5-(os+ds))+((j+1)*(l+1)*5000)+(c*1000)with that formulae, the bare minimum pay you can get is 30,002 isk (for a level 0, 1-to-1 sec, 0 jumps, 0m3 cargo).edit: on the flipside; a level 4 going across 12 0.0 systems with 840m3 cargo pays 2,215,000 isk. maybe security status should be a bigger modifier...edit2: m'kay, that didn't work... 44bil is a bit much. just a bit. edit3: ack, i think i'll leave that up to someone better at maths than me. my head hurts now."
4/3/2009,o_o
4/3/2009,that's one fugly equation.
4/3/2009,thank you tesseract =)
4/3/2009,"hi all,i've been playing eve for sometime now and the one thing that has frustrated me the most is the logging out in enermy space and in combat.basically i'd like to see a change here, for if eve is to call itself a pvp game it must address this issue.i propose any pilot in space lower than 0.5 that logs out or/is disconected are ejected from their ship, leaving it behind, pod can then warp off and disappear.this would give a more realistic feel to the game, more consequence for actions.if some is disconected in a bad spot, say in combat, well then at least the implants are safe.if a pilot is in a capital at a pos, then that ship will stay at the pos, under its protection.p.s instead of players having to petition that someone has ninja logged, i'd like to see this turned around, the ship stays no matter what, it is boarded or blowen up, the kill is logged, if there was a actually link dead, then pitition is laid and ccp replaces, it is not the killers fault you disconected/went link dead.p.s.s force recons should be able to turn off cynos whenever they want."
4/3/2009,"so when i rat in 0.0 i ofc have to be in a pos or docked ??you do know most corps/alliances with pos have a rule that ships have to be left at sma, doing this would overload the smanot supporting"
4/3/2009,really what would the point to this be??. all it would do is cause frustation with players who cant get to a station or have to do someing irl and do not have the time to fly to a station. and i do not see how this would be realistic in the least bit. who would want to fly though eve in a pod??? no guns not much protection better to stay with the ship if you can.thumbs down.
4/3/2009,"no way. not everyone plays the same way. i fly with a nomadic crew. we almost never end up in a system where we can dock, so we log off in space the way others log off in stations. we're not avoiding combat, we're just logging out at the end of our flying time. this is a completely imbalanced and not well thought-out idea."
4/3/2009,please use your brain before posting ideas
4/3/2009,because you know how eve can't call itself a pvp game until your little issue is addressed the way you want it.
4/3/2009,no.i lose enough drones due to my flaky internet connection. i'm not going to start losing ships because of it too.
4/3/2009,"lol are you serious!what about at down time when everyone is forced to leave the game.. oh sorry you where not in a station docked up you lose your ship..if this forum had a "" i would never support this idea "" option everyone thought out eve would check it."
4/3/2009,"i think it's a good idea. as long as it only happens if you use the client option to log out ie: escape> quit or log offyou can still close the instance of eve from the operating system but that would be the only way to do it. i don't see the difference in logging off while you are being attacked and logging off right before you are going to be attacked. because think about it, the only reason you're going to log in a situation like that is because you are going to lose. cry some more!the only reason i can see why people would complain is because they are lazy or they don't really want 2 sided pvp. ninja logging is very one sided to the person who only wants pvp on their own terms. as far as rl issues preventing you from docking or getting safe, that's your problem, buy a cloaker or don't go into enemy territory if ya can't get back out.i agree with op, i support pvp"
4/3/2009,"my strong disagreement with this idea has nothing at all to do with pvp. some pilots roam all over the galaxy - this means sometimes being many, many jumps from a place where we are able to dock. what happens when we want to log out for the night? what happens to ships who are exploring in w-space without a pos?everyone just loses thier ships at the end of the day?"
4/3/2009,"so what you're saying is that in your opinion, ctrl-alt-del is a good gameplay mechanic? if you make people log off via os, they'll just do it that way - you're left with present mechanics and an obnoxiously bad ui. this is a terrible idea."
4/3/2009,big no. if i get disconnected from the game because of something my internet provider did i don't feel like paying for a new ship.i got to say this is an idea that was not thought out very well.
4/3/2009,"no it's not a good idea. it would be the only way to work around it. ccp can't stop people from opening up task manager and stopping eve without installing a keylogger - which is illegal. i, however, do not support ninja logging in any way. even for explorers, bottom line is eve has risks and if you don't like them then maybe it's not for you, regardless of your career choice within the game."
4/3/2009,"to those complaining about my idea, please do come up with something better or modify my idea to fit, ninja logging is rife. loging off alts in enermy territory is a common strategy by some alliances. i have seen many times a hostile roaming fleet all log off to avoid capture. rat ai does not have to inclued blowing up unoccupied ships and uncontroled drones.if you are disconected for a short time then once back in the game your pod warps back 1 au to your ship, you board and carry on. perhaps a 2 min invul peroid can initiated for all disconects. either way, your ship remains.if you like to roam and log off in space then those are the consequences, perhaps you need to take an extra small pos with you, perhaps small poss only take 5 mins to set up.perhaps in space you can do a camp out procedure that takes 5 mins so that your ship will dissappear with your pod.ninja logging is bad.ps, cloaking should negate power regen thus you can only cloak for as long as your power holds out."
4/3/2009,"you log off in the safety and comfort of your pos or station on a daily basis. i log off in the deep space of an unexplored system. you stick close to home so you can always be back home in time for dinner and bed. i roam for months at a time through hostile 0.0 and now w-space. who is clinging to safety? who is avoiding risk? i fully agree that eve should never be non-risky. i completely agree that logging off to avoid combat is weak and if log off mechanics can be legitmately fixed to punish abusers of the ""logofski"" the fix should be implimented. i don't agree at all with this proposal that would force us all to tuck our ships safely into a dock at night."
4/3/2009,"anyone who has ever scouted knows this all too well.scout: hey the enemies are speeding up, i think they are aligningfc: where are they aligning to?scout: i dunno, i am 250km away and they have bubbles up, i can't look and zoom in on themfc: so you are telling me you are looking at the enemies but can't tell me where they are going because you can't look at them, awesome.support!"
4/3/2009,"yeah, this has bothered me a lot too."
4/3/2009,"grid size is quite a bit larger than that, max locking distance is 250km.setting max look range to the same as target range would be great. trying to find online pos mods in a cluster from 100km+ is a massive pain. especially how the incapped/online note is so helpfully offset from the actual mod ><"
4/3/2009,"100km limit is completely unnecessary, and a pain in the ass."
4/3/2009,fixed that for you
4/3/2009,"alright i'm a man with many ships, for example i have 2 drakes - 1 for pvp and 1 for ratting. now how about making it so you could add little notes to the ships, without having anything to do with names, and notes only you can see ? that way i don't have to worry about the name of it or constantly entering the wrong one... get my idea ? it was just a quick idea... maybe you have a better idea on how to add those notes etc etc...."
4/3/2009,"i don't know, there is this feature called the notepad in eve...but that's totally not what your talking about right? p.s. it is. no change necessary.--isaacp.p.s.s. please don't post here unless you have an actual change/suggestion you would like to add to this forum."

4/3/2009,"was not so ""forum-savvy"" at the time you first served, but good luck.i like your ""fix empire war-dec"" standpoint"
4/3/2009,"this thread has 3000 reads, the most of any 'so and so for csm' thread on the front page or second.i hope this is being noted by ccp"
4/3/2009,i thought that was obvious when i wrote my post arguing about the very same thing.but thanks for writing it out so that everybody understands it.
4/3/2009,"just to be clear to somebody who knows nothing about sov, which part of sov allows this ""pos grinding"" and what was the original intent for the mechanics that had this unwanted effect of pos grinding.also, how would you remove this, what would be the effect of removing this, how are these effects good instead of bad and what mechanics should be introduced to offset any of the bad stuff?"
4/3/2009,i think that iceblock means here that he wants unique-ness of each region (diversity) without some 0.0 regions seriously sucking.in my opinion the same problem exists in empire...
4/3/2009,admiral iceblock campaign poster
4/3/2009,"lmao admiral iceblock, the all-american-norwegian hero!"
4/3/2009,"pos grinding means one have to ""farm pos"" for sovreignity. some systems have hundreds of moons. *gg*my ideas and discussion is located in the thread in my original post.for the rest, shinnen described my intentions correctly. i am foreign kid on the block."
4/3/2009,"was going to write a attacking post, but you are not worth the text so in short:failed-pvper runs for the pvp csm?anyone who ever came in contact with these know what i mean.*sigh*"
4/3/2009,"so what do the 'carebears' you represent not have that you and your party think they should, and why are these things important for eve to be more fun while being profitable as opposed to just simply making life easier in general? (note, i'm not saying making life easier is bad, just that it's the fun and opportunities that's important and not the lowering of risk in general)."
4/3/2009,"carebears don't need anything specific, mainly because they get everything that everybody else gets, they just choose to avoid the many risks that are available in the game. heck sometimes i go carebear for a month or so and putz around in empire with almost no risk. the difference is that when something is on the line, like a reinforced pos or an offensive operation i do my best to be there. what is the point of making money and buying ships if they just sit in a hangar for a rainy day that never comes?of course everybody is free to play how they want to, but if people are going to avoid portions of the game then i don't think it gives them a well rounded opinion that is conducive to giving input on improvements. i like the idea of political parties, but i think a carebear party is going to be about as popular as, well... carebears."
4/3/2009,"so it isn't always about ""not having"" something currently. it is often about making sure what exists remains. ccp is buried in the shouts of hundreds of different views of what eve should become. this party seeks to make sure the voice of the ""carebear"" is clearly heard by ccp as they shape our futures.thanks for the question!issler"
4/3/2009,"lots of folks like to think carebears won't fight if they are attacked. i know that isn't true. many of them can defend themselves. they just choose not to be agressive towards other pilots in a combat sense. now many of those same carebears will smack around other players in the markets without blinking, which is a whole other discussion. :-)it's funny you imply carebears aren't popular. maybe not among the vocal minority that posts here in the forums, but carebears are the majority in eve. something folks tend to ignore.issler"
4/3/2009,"i really can't fathom why their is so much resistance to this idea from people who, i assume, wouldn't be part of the represented demographic anyhow......"
4/3/2009,"to which i would ask, what is the point of making money and buying ships if it's just a +1 to your hangar? i can see stocking supplies for the random empire war dec situation but otherwise it's just more stuff they spent time earning and have no use for. we've discussed that before, market pvp might provide some excitement and definitely is good for making cash but in the end it goes back to my first point. what good is having 10b or 50b when the end result is the equivalent of being ""all dressed up with nowhere to go"".it's possible they could be the majority but it's also possible they are all in a coma from boredom and that's why they don't post here. this thread has been particularly quiet after all.so let me ask it directly, why do carebears play this game anyway? what are they getting out of it? i mean if all i ever did was mine and mission i'd go crazy. it would be the same if all i did was pvp. it's not about one or the other but that one supports the other. i mine and mission to buy ships to pvp with, then i lose them and repeat the process."
4/3/2009,"niskin,you trolled the last thread issler was active in for quite some time, and had all the room to ask as many philosophical questions as you wanted there.i do not believe it is isslers role to explain her definition of the people who will support her. whether a ""carebear"" describes themselves as industrialist, high sec dweller, or simply someone who refuses to pvp, does not matter.all that matters is there are those with whom isslers words resonate. they may choose to vote for her, as we know you shall not.if you have a specific issue with something issler has pushed forth to ccp, raise it by all means. if she has done anything contradictory in her term to what she said she would do while running, bring that up as well. i see no reason for anyone to waste their time convincing someone who disagrees with them that one way or another is ""right""."
4/3/2009,"niskin, you show clearly why there needs to be someone that is the voice of ""carebears"" in eve. the fact you can't imagine how someone could enjoy eve in some manner other than how you enjoy makes my point. lots of folks find life in eve wonderful doing all those things you can't appreciate. so i want to make sure they get to continue enjoying what they enjoy, and just as importantly, that you get to continue to enjoy what it is you enjoy.thanks for the civil discussion of important questions. hopefully others will take the time to offer opinions or pose questions about points already made.issler"
4/3/2009,because their ideas are more likely to prevail if they can suppress another demographic which is likely to oppose them.
4/3/2009,"because at some point isslar said something about ""suppressing"" those who oppose them?"
4/3/2009,"uhm, no, i have never suggested suppressing anyone's voice. i think what max is trying to say is the folks that would not be represented by the ""voice of reason"" party are commenting negatively about the idea of a party as an attempt to suppress the voice of the members of the party.issler"
4/3/2009,"ok, i'll rephrase then... what are the things that you are afraid people will try to take away from you?all i'm saying is that i can't possibly understand how somebody who just ice mines all the time doesn't go mad with boredom, not that i'm saying you do or anything, that's just an example. i've continuously stated that i don't have a problem with said ice miner doing so to his/her hearts content.i'm simply asking you to explain what you plan to accomplish with this party, more specifically than ""to protect the carebears""."
4/3/2009,"qftissler please go back to your own campaign thread, this should be about csm elections not something that happened over a year ago, and the only people who are even vocal about it any longer are the leaches we gladly left behind.get a grip, take your meds, stop taking crack or whatever your issue is please.i want to hear about the issues in this election not your delusions."
4/3/2009,"technically, happy made his ""sneak in to our alliance as a spy and try to assasinate me in the pvp tourny fail"" recently planning with freed, so i think any issue i might have with happy could be described as ""recent events"". seems to me it is the ghosts of bruce that seemingly couldn't leave things in the past.if happy actually has a ""position"" to run on he could certainly be taking some time to post more about it. as i said my direct experience with happy makes me think he would be part of the folks from the ""crime and punishment"" parts of eve. there are already several better (imho ) candidates representing that portion of eve. i nm certainly within my rights to comment on what i believe are issues of character in the context of any campaign thread. issler"
4/3/2009,issler has lost my vote.
4/3/2009,"ya well, she just doesn't get it.glad to see that your eyes have been opened. hope more folks get the same oppurtunity."
4/3/2009,"issler dainze, bringing 'stoopid' to eve since forever.happy gets my vote.issler was much more of a spy from what i remember of bruce. backstabbing was also quite common from her. bad feedback, seller does not do as it says on the tin, avoid at all costs. vovgo happy. \o/"
4/3/2009,"oh noos, more people not voting for me that never would have voted for me anyways!me a spy! what a crack up. i'd love you to provide any support for that statement. i think you are getting that backwards, since bruce puts spies in my corp, not the other way around. freed philisteen put the ""p"" in paranoid.issler"
4/3/2009,"heh, well it seems this unknown alt of a known player has his followers still.but to get back on topic, can you write a little more about your csm plans?the main post is a bit vague.oh and stop with your attacks on issler, she did good her csm2 period."

4/3/2009,"could i get some clarification on what you mean by ""opportunities"" in some context?i'll give an example:it is lowsec. there is one miner, one hauler and a generic combat ship at a belt. they take precautions against being found. there are two or three small gangs of pirates (all independent) in the constellation looking for a fight. all ships are out to gain profit for the smallest amounts of loss.1. do you believe that it should be easier to get into a fight than to stay out of a fight?2. do you believe that since there are more pirates than miners (in this hypothetical situation), that the game mecahnics should allow a greater chance for them to fight each other?3. once in a fight, do you believe that warping away should be possible/diffucult, given necessary precautions are taken? should there be ways around these precautions? should there be actions that can be taken as a precaution against these ways?4. do you believe that once somebody has escaped from a fight, that it should be easier to find them again compared to the amount of effort needed to find them the first time?5. say two of the pirate gangs found each other. how should they react, and how should the game mechanics be changed to facilitate this?6. same as (5), except pirates vs miners7. same as (5), except pirates vs pirates vs miners. if there are more ships (such as if there are two groups in a battle), should it be easier to find them?edit: one final thing, i realised i was trying to get ask this one thing with my above questions: what are the ideal probabilities for the game mechanics used to find a fight?"
4/3/2009,"get action on ccp's promise to provide opportunities for solo and small group pvp. opportunities for them to fight it out with each other, instead of getting swamped by giant blob fleets.yes can you elaborate on this?do you mean like a wow battleground deal?i kind of like it as it is.. there should always be a bigger fish!(lone frig -jumped by small fleet -jumped by bigger fleet -gets mothershipdropped! :p)if you could get ccp to raise the ""lure of low-sec"" to get more targ..err players there i<U+FFFD>d vote for ya!"

4/4/2009,"free minmatars! lol mini bs and caps need some love! it's been some time now since versatility has become sinonim with faill, today eve is based on ships with specific rolles, and mini faill to deliver;oh, but yea, they are versatile"
4/4/2009,"supported, even though i think ccp are too busy making stupid features like combat simulator (wtf) and ambulation."
4/4/2009,"it might not equate to removing or replacing the current pos - but id still fully support ccp introducing a ""modular station"" system.c."
4/4/2009,"heh, next time when most of you ppl ask for a nerf... remember this! missile are fine like they are now, no need that raven to become a solopawnmobile, or how it was vaga called not suported!"
4/4/2009,and how again would you accomplis that with the old missiles? the torps are the only thing making a raven usefull in pvp right now ;)
4/4/2009,a nice simple answer to the annoying problem that i suspect we have all dealt with from time to time. bravo
4/4/2009,"well, this proposal has just entered the realm of silliness by becoming something that it wasn't.scanning might have some problems but it works.roaming is a *fast* job, no time for complex probe work unless *one scout* in the gang likes to do it *and* does it fast.now, the ratters and miners and wanderers have a huge advantage over the rest, that is, they are not in warp.so you have to use the directional scanner, pray for the tackling ship not to be a covops/recon that you will not see coming.this local change might make you have to be always ratting/mining/whatever in a mixed gang of scouts/pvpers/farmers, no lolfits allowed, and basically make survival a question of *teamwork* much more than it was before.soloing will be for the brave a strong hearted individuals.it opens up a new awesome amount of possibilities for having fun, socializing with your corpies/allys, be it you are the pray or the hunter, and i sincerely can't see the problem with that.please, leave the scanning whines and problems/ideas to threads where that may belong, this is for supporting the removal of local.in the end, people just forgets about local, and carries on what what they are doing, i know that because i've been in w-space a few times."
4/4/2009,"removing local just to replace him with somthing much more complicated....thx, but no thx.this will just result in most of the ppls moving alts to mission runing in already crowded empire hubs,nothing else;there is a word: if somthing works fine, fix it! or not?"
4/4/2009,yeah and he got it back. from ccp. so why are we on page 4-5 of this whine-fest?
4/4/2009,"lots people people not reading posts properly and adding their own take/crap/agenda/trolling, per usual. it really comes down to this; if the pilot is reimbursed because of a hickup/bug/whatever ccp deemed to be reimbursable, that means the player lost the ship to an issue he had no control over. that means the player should get the whole ship back, not just the empty casco. that would be the same as the insurance company replacing your car but leaving out the engine as that had bits stolen from by bystanders when the crash happened.i do understand the possible exploitation of this and the fact that giving back modules without removing them from the new owners inject goods/isk into the economy but this is not the concern of the petitioner. he lost a ship which ccp deemed to be replaced, so he should get the whole ship.any aftermath is ccp's problem, not the petitioner's."
4/4/2009,issue was raised by csm and voted for.
4/4/2009,"signed, and championed at the next csm meeting (not the one in less than 48 hours, but a future one)."
4/4/2009,signed
4/4/2009,"don't need it, don't use it but it's a valid request and there's no reason to had it removed in the first place."
4/4/2009,"dont really consider skill books as book, but a very precisely programmed set of nanobots that ""write"" the skill into your brain, the ""book"" represents the controller/cpu of said nanos. i would not want them controlled by remote control, as then my brain would be at the mercy of interference in the transmission. a corrupted transmission in say, heavy missiles, might mean that i'd be in combat and suddenly wondering why my own missiles are hitting me. the corrupted skill means that at the critical juncture of setting the target for the missiles, i punch in a bunch of garbage commands, tht in that particular fight i targetted myself. that example is a bit convoluted, but you get the idea. modules failing every time you use them, reactor explosions, the ""what's this button do?"" accidental self destruct if your ship skill is corrupted."
4/4/2009,"if skills are removed as physical transportable items that are sold on the market system, then there's several effects.e.g. in gallente space, the school stations do not sell many of the missile skills.if you want those skills, you either have to buy from a player that transported them, or travel to regions that sell them.this creates player choices, and opportunities. spend money to save time, or spend time to save money. as well as the opportunities to buy and sell for profit.if the skills are moved off the market system, so as to be available from anywhere, then that removes that decision from the players - skills will always be available at base npc prices. there is no choice between money or time.if skills that you need are not available where you are, then you have to ask why your corporation does not have a system in place for this sort of eventuality? there's a personnel manager role for corps. it should be their responsibility to ensure that the corps players can develop their skills as best they can."

4/4/2009,"this is actually something i was unaware of. i had always thought the npc stations were all more or less the same, with a few minor exceptions. it never occurred to me that there were entire regions where these skills weren't seeded as a matter of course.that does change my perceptions slightly.i'll have to give that some more thought.as for the ""you're making it too easy"" argument people keep espousing, that really isn't swaying anyone. making things harder doesn't always make them better either, you know. frankly, what i am aiming for is an immersive game experience, and paperbacks in the 200th century seem to be very out of place to me."

4/4/2009,"this is in no way, shape or form a whine... but a simple response to a previous post, furthermore nham looking at kill boards didnt you get your self spanked by nex a few weeks ago, and used to be in nex? no wonder your response is b!tchy.second you cannot compare this to high sec as in high sec capitals are not allowed, plus if you choose to live in low sec some danger needs to be there, hence why its low sec... as for war declarations, you can simply surrender to end all forms of fighting which means no more danger in high sec for people wishhinf not to fight..."
4/4/2009,"have you looked at kill boards. posts, and other sources... its all very easy to access.however i will admit i am in favour of nex in this post... as they live in low sec and a victim of what i am describing..."
4/4/2009,so your just taking a special interest in this then eh?...your not making a strong case for yourself...like i said before...post with your main
4/4/2009,"in other words...it's perfectly acceptable for a 'bully' to push the little guy around, but it's not fair for that bully to get his butt handed to him by someone bigger.we are an industrial corp - we do not harass our neighbors, but we will defend ourselves. call me whatever names you want, but your statement boils down to this - you can dish it out, but you can't take it. you don't seem to have a problem calling in all your pals to constantly harass us, so why is it wrong for us to call in friends?pardon me if i don't believe your statement about 'no relation to the parties above,' and your simply getting this info from the killboards. i on the other hand was there; and i saw all the pilot 'bailouts' from the 'mighty warriors' of the hun attacking fleet, when pl jumped in and showed them 'what time of day' it was. they did not even try to fight back, they simply started self destructing. so we were outwitted huh...?"
4/4/2009,"heh no, personally i didnt, i've never lost a single ship to nex. and its hard to fight them in a war when a majority of them wont undock in their home systems when its 9v2.as for your comment about capitals in high sec, its irrelevant, because the only point of this post is ""huge alliance shouldn't be able to pick on medium alliance, but medium alliance should be allowed to pick on small alliance."" that is the end result of your suggestions.you also forget to factor in coalition forces, most of omega was/is part of the gbc and therefore because of their affiliations shouldn't be allowed to use siege either. you can't put a limit on a group of players just to force them to do it with alts or pets.and your surrender option, doesnt work unless the war declarer accepts the surrender, its a two way street."
4/4/2009,"before help... yes, secondly have yu people never researched anything... no the bigger can still bully the medium, as can the medium still bully the small. but not in the outragous way as the 0.0 elite are doing... its called balancing game play?"
4/4/2009,you could always retain a little dignity here and just accept that no-one realy cares enough about youre losses to unbalance the game in such a way... quit with the whine threads it`ll never happen think this thread is goin off topic now maybe time it was locked?
4/4/2009,"just as a statement from me personally.the wardec against vva was a retaliation against them destroying an offline pos tower which was bugged and unanchorable (we'd tried to unanchor it several weeks before). the tower was subsequently reimbursed. the wardec went well, we suffered one loss; an afk guy who'd been ill and fell asleep at his comp.nex's engagements against i.e. are not random, there is a goal(involving a particular moon). the drop by pl was no less than expected, we'd seen them in abath with approx 20 caps prior to the engagement. we knew they were in the area and all capital pilots knew the risks before deploying. my dread itself was insured when i undocked it just 40mins before.we made the decision to deploy, i made the decision on behalf of my pilots after and i quote 'if we are going to do this, then we'll commit to it. if you wanna get things done, then go the whole hog' we knew what was coming as we saw them 3 jumps away, but tried to go down fighting, primarying one of the enemy naglfars. i was primaried first. overloaded hardeners and shield booster. my shield was stable as the first dread started shooting. i popped less than 10 seconds after.i can confirm that the alt 'sugar rush' is not an alt of nex eternus. you'll have to take my word on that.i'd also like to clarify i have no personal issue with nnamuachs or his corporation; while his corp differs greatly from my own he's a good guy, that just has different ways of achieving his goals to the way me and my corporation do.changes are needed to the way capitals are deployed. the thread came at a bad time for us publically, as it does make it look like a whine. nonetheless, changes are needed; as yet however i have no answer as to how it should be done.please let that be the end of discussion on my alliance's activities and politics; i have no wish to keep writing sermon's for atheists.edit: @ bd concerning the self destructs. the self destructs were to deny them kills, you'll find that we were shooting back. in cap fights when its 70 vs 15 you dont have much of a chance, we did all we could.regards.-rx."
4/4/2009,"it was raised on csm 2.0 meeting on iceland, you can read it in meeting minutesthere were lot of ideas floating around, but sadly not solid solution, tho ccp showed desire to solve this issue."
4/4/2009,"system doesnt need to be fixed. mechanics are ingame already for fixing this issue.and on top of all that. the only excuse for ""reserving a moon"" in highsec really is only a lack of moons. there's no reason you need to reserve a moon in hopes of being able to mine it in the future as it's basically certain they will never let us mine.lol what?war is like 2mil. you retract soon as the objective has been completed. easy. you're suiciding cans in highsec? lolz!"
4/4/2009,"if you're right on the doorstep of your supplier, sure. try living in paragon soul or omist and importing a month's supply of pos fuel for 100 or more towers or the amount of low-end minerals needed to keep supercap production running, and then see if you agree that logistics is too easy and needs nerfing.i remember freighter escort ops between detorid and empire, 40 or so jumps each way in the days before jump bridges, and 'fun' isn't exactly the word i'd use. escort duty is rarely exciting because by its very nature you're moving something you're not willing to lose and so either you have a big enough escort to scare away would-be gankers, or the hostile gang is too big to safely get past and so you ctrl-q your valuable freighters until they leave."
4/4/2009,yeah - thats why it's called high-security space.high - security space.seriously. the rewards aren't as high as low-sec and 0.0... no balancing needed.double fail. if ninja salvaging acquired aggro - that would put the salvagers in danger as well. i.e. they would be less inclined to ninja salvage. what crack pipe have you been smoking??
4/4/2009,no.
4/4/2009,"correct me if i'm mistaken, but the game of salvaging is a game of chance? what loot lies in the holds of the wrecks is actually there, i don't think the same can be said about the not-yet salvaged materials from ravaged remains of one's enemies. if something doesn't certainly exist, how can you say that it has been stolen?"
4/4/2009,"this discussion can go round and round and round with the lot of you whiners, but anyone who understands eve's game design has to admit that wrecks need to cause aggro if salvaged by someone other than who created the wreck. both missioneers and carebear pirates don't want this, both sides. but that is how this game was designed. high sec is supposed to be secure allowing pve players a place to enjoy the game without harassment. low sec and nullsec is where the pirates are supposed to hide. salvaging has bridged the gap allowing carebear pirates to harass players without consequence. this must stop. this game was designed to allow for consequences so ccp saying this is intended is a contradiction!we already have enough troubles with carebear pirates can trapping newbs in high sec space, do we really want to do everything we can to scare off new players? obviously those of you that like to make me people mad won't care, but quit being a bunch of richards and think about eve, not your epeen."
4/4/2009,everyone who understands eve's game design except apparently the designers of eve you mean?
4/4/2009,"let's take a poll of all of the employees at ccp, shall we? instead of the one dude sitting behind a desk that puts checkmarks in boxes."
4/4/2009,dont like this idea.
4/4/2009,"is this about salvaging npc wrecks?or player wrecks?cos if it's only about player wrecks, then that's a lot more interesting a proposal."
4/4/2009,"it was a dark day in ccps history - the day they left ""harrold"" the box-checker dude in charge of the salvage design. all of the employees of ccp wanted salvaging to work just like looting cans, but harrold had other ideas. he secretly plotted in the dank celler of the ccp offices to thwart the grand design. and one day, he got his chance. while the rest of the staff took a lunch break, he acted. he checked the box! oh how the other employees rued the day they decided to go out for pizza! though ccp has now instigated a rule that no more than half of the staff may leave for lunch at any one time, and despite several high-level developer meetings, the damage cannot be undone. the design team is at a total loss... no one can figure out how to uncheck the box."
4/4/2009,"never had a real job, have you? people do disagree with corporate policy that is often decided by one or maybe a handful of people. i've already stated why this policy contradicts previous ideas presented by ccp in the form of eve content. it's ok for them to be wrong."
4/4/2009,"you might just be the single most pompous ass i've ever seen on the eve forums - and that's not an easy feat. plenty of people, myself included, have accused ccp of variously being lazy, not understanding how normal people play the game, or just generally screwing the pooch. i don't think i've ever seen any who insisted that they knew the game's design principles better than the people who actually designed the game before, though. it takes a special kind of ego to make claims like that."
4/4/2009,"you do realise how overpowered shield tanks would become in both pvp and pve right?.but i am all for this new module, a module for shield that is in low slots and one for armour that is in the medslots, and 10-15 % decrease in shield and armour booster duration.this would make you have a effective higher dmg socked, but at the same time keep the balance since your cap would die 10-15 % faster, which would in effect have a upside and a downside.although i think for this too stil not be too overpowered it would also need to decrease the maximum amount of cap by 5 - 7,5 %.since looking on some ship and with cap injectors they would be able to tank 3k+ dps for around 10min + (which would be a insane amount of dmg socked).this stil doesn't solve the problem in fleet though since even if you could tank 5k+ dps, in a fleet where you are alphered and killed by 1 hit kill it wouldn't matter, and it would properly quickly become too overpowered in small gang warfare."
4/4/2009,no. shield tanks are already too strong. more effective than armor tanks by a long shot. no support.--isaac
4/4/2009,"they already have modules that decrease cycle time on reppers - nanobot accelerator and core defence operational solidifier rigs. there's no need to add another off-slot one. besides, active shield tanks work way better than active armor tanks as-is, trying to improve them more is unnecessary."
4/4/2009,"what are you smoking? 3kdps tank for 10minutes? show me a pvp tank with web,disruptor,cap booster, shield booster, hardeners and a low slot 16% amp t2 fit that can tank 3k dps for 10 minutes on a sub capital ship? also to alpha a buffer tanked bs you would need more than 150 bs and you realize that there are also smaller gang fights? have you actually read the title? can you tell me how it would make active shield tanking more effective with a low slot module that does not stack with its 36% counterpart and can you show me your super duper active tank setup that has all its mandatory slots for pvp and still is effective? oh wait you cant :>"
4/4/2009,"active shield tanking in pvp is very strong, albeit expensive to do properly (crystals).you get a stonger tank at the expense of not having mid-slots for other things. seems perfectly balanced to me, therefore:not supported.edit: typos"
4/4/2009,"cosmic, the problem here is that you're assuming that everybody has to fit a solo pvp setup. you're right, if you solo, there aren't a lot of ships that can fit an active shield tank effectively. if you're in a gang that has tacklers, however, you don't need tackle gear on your battleships, and can fit a pretty good shield tank - 724 on a mael or 720 on a rokh, both of which have a mwd and large cap booster fit. that increases to 1091 and 1076 if you fly with a full crystal set, which means that you're fully tanking a decent gank battleship. and that's a four-slot tank - if you drop the mwd, and add a third invuln, you add another 150ish tank, or 220ish with crystals. if you start adding shield rigs, it gets even sillier - a mael can tank 2112 dps for over two minutes if you fly with full crystal and take off the mwd. admittedly, that's a hyper-focused setup, and unlikely to be good in actual pvp, but it's something that is simply impossible for armor tanks - a hyperion can only hit 1103 dps tanked with a full 6-slot tank and rigs, compared to 1392 for a maelstrom. armor does buffer tanks and tackle better, shield does active tanks and damage mods better. that seems like it's balanced just fine to me."
4/4/2009,pretty much what he said.--isaac
4/4/2009,should limit the cynos max 10 capital can passing trough /cynofield in lowsec to prevent blobbing
4/4/2009,lawl. 8/10props i didnt even think of this one first.instead cynos in low sec should be jumpable by anyone. so what might be only 1-5 capships jumping. 50 might lock on and jump in.low sec needs way more capships. get rid of these annoying cynoship poppers. today i traded a cynoheron for an arby. it is just so silly.

4/4/2009,"heh.. devil, are you posting this because of that pl fleet that hotdropped you guys yesterday?"
4/4/2009,"to quote devilofthehell.. `bring a bigger blob` seems what you are realy saying is that you think you should be the only ones who are allowed to blob (vs carebears might i add - and often with capital faildrops) double standards are not an endeering character trait, mind you neither is the disgusting way you talk in local. youre smacktalk and whining is like a lamp to a moth.. ps most gratefull to all the guys who took it upon themselves to help a peacefull aliance. you made me lol so hard my face aches helping the little guy = mucho khudos"
4/4/2009,i got a better idee.making the station centry just so smart like the sleeper drones so they attack drones and fighters first.it would contrebute in gameply and reduce the lamenes of camping low sec stations using a carrier or mothership.
4/4/2009,"this!and boost the sentry guns dps to around 1500 dps per gun (6 guns =9k dps all in all, making them focus fire if tanked more then 15 secunds)"
4/4/2009,just shut up carebear go back to hisec
4/4/2009,"meh, i think its reasonable, but i dont reckon having cyno's lockable by anyone is a good idea. just dosent work. and only stupid people would jump thru them anyway.also, nnam. >>""why wardec a 0.0 alliannce""<< ; sorry, couldnt resist."

4/4/2009,ok so basically if you self-destruct your ship. it makes it so u drop nothing. all modules and stuff dies. cool.killmails on the otherhand should be accessible. everyone who dealt damage to the nyx should get the killmail; or even have the killmail available via api.having no killmail isnt good.
4/4/2009,"so this should only apply to the nyx and no other ships? interesting idea...anyways, no, self destruct deprives the killers of their most valued prize, the killmail."
4/4/2009,pretty much what he said. there is no reason to change current mechanic.--isaac
4/4/2009,"we discussed this with ccp and while i argued in favor of granting killmails, the general consensus was that it was working as intended and that no changes to the game mechanics should happen 'just for epeen reasons'."
4/4/2009,it really isnt that big a change tbh. why should there be killmails at all if there's no real consistency.also in 1st post. i didnt mean just nyx.
4/4/2009,"if we want it to be consitent then the pilot who dies and the pilot who got final blow should be the only ones to get the km, in this case that would be the same guy, i agree with this idea just to hear people having to go cap in hand to the guy they just failed to kill in time for the km."
4/4/2009,"well, since self-destruction is a deliberate attempt to rob the enemy of intel and the spoils of war (and a valid tactic, i might add), i feel the killmail would go against this. the killmail is often used as an intel tool to determine a pilots fitting habits. self destruct should prevent this intel, and as such, is working as it should. now, if they did hand out killmails without the destroyed/dropped section, i guess i can see it, but seems a big change for not a whole lot of gain."
4/4/2009,this.
4/4/2009,"as discussed elsewhere in the forums, a significant portion of users are unhappy with the current in-game font, as several characters are quite indistinguishable from each other. so a simple option in the game settings to change the font to something better would be really great feature and shouldn't take too long to implement and test."
4/4/2009,"there's a thread on the front page called ""the eve font"". please don't make duplicate threads."
4/4/2009,"while the balance team would have to look at this under a microscope, i see no reason why it couldn't exist. the variation in missions would be a welcome change, and running couriers in combat fitted ships would be a great concept. supported, and championed."

4/4/2009,i am running for round 3 of csm and will be glad to be interviewed.
4/4/2009,"this could be a very nice feature. eg. you will probably use way different window configurations for just chatting, high-sec market operations, mining in low sec, pvp (and here very different for interceptors, drone ships or say ecm vessels). having these at the click of a button would save some hassle with the ui.could be quite tricky to implement. eg. you have a policy issue on how this works - what is done to all the windows that are open when the settings are recorded, and to all of the windows when a setting is selected? initially i'd think they could be sort of an archetype - you record the settings as a minimal configuration - close all the windows you don't want (to touch) and it records everything you have open at the moment. when you activate this recorded setting, it will make sure that you have all those windows open with the recorded tabs, positions and sizes - leaving the rest you might have open as they are.perhaps this should be copied to one of the ideas forums?"

4/5/2009,"i already posted some responses in support of the idea, but i want to add some examples of how local is bad from the last few days. - hostile roam comes to defended space, their scout sees our defense gang enter local 1 jump away and they all log. - hostile fleet is hitting a tower, we and our allies form up and when we are one jump out the hostile fleet safes up and logs. i appreciate that in this instance they will have agression, however unless we have a several probers we will not catch many. - hostile roam enters one of our dead end systems, we jump in to hold the gate, hostile fleet logs.instant local in 0.0 is turning this into logoff online at an alarmingly fast rate. removing instant local in 0.0 will dramatically reduce this problem. as for ideas on what to do in it's absence there are many suggestions in the thread, including a couple of my own.local is available to the alliance holding sov in the system, update is from a modified system scanner anchored on a pos. this gives some security to mining ops for people operating in their home space. this does of course place attackers at a significant disadvantage if it is instant, so perhaps making the delay a couple of minutes would help. this would place some importance on an alliance using it's occupied space for the purpose of reporting intel as hostiles move through. tracking the hostiles would be possible, but require the use of active scouts for current information rather than delayed. the hostile gang can ""evade"" being tracked via local so long as they move fast, again placing the emphasis on using a fast and capable scout.end result, more non-consensual pvp and less logging off.zos"
4/5/2009,"allrighthere is my proposal.dont remove local globally, atleast without supplementing it with something that acts as a comparable early warning system or threat detector, otherwise some very unfair situations will present themselves.instead, introduce new k-space regions with no local. this way the current alliances will keep the early warning networks. but they will have to be clever for these spaces. of course youll have to supplement this with some form of detection or warning system anyways.quite put, without local, there is literally no way to know if there is hostiles, save for scanning them down/scan probes. and if there out of range in a large system. you will never be safe again. do not remove local. but create a new localess region, perhaps with tactile environments."
4/5/2009,0.0 and lowsec.or at the very least have local act as the constellation channel; that is to say everyone in the constelation in local.or combined local for 2 jumps in every direction.
4/5/2009,people need to read the posts badly rather than assuming that its a whine for mods replacement. hes not asking for any reimbursement but rather a change in policy.i support.
4/5/2009,the problem is what if the petitioner got the loot himself and then got duplicate fittings back. he could have made billions. honestly there can never be a fair solution to this problem. it sucks but thats life.
4/5/2009,"at present, it's possible to get to a point where your standings with a faction simply cannot be recovered. if you're -10 to the caldari state and everyone who they like, and you've used some of the one-time-only tag offers already, you cannot ever recover under current game mechanics. this is an even bigger problem with pirate factions, which do not (i believe) have similar tag offers and are thus simply unrecoverable. there have been a lot of ideas brought up in the past for how to fix this problem, but the recent addition of epic mission arcs has brought up one that seems more satisfactory than most of the others. for each faction, have an epic mission arc based in lowsec(for empire factions) or 0.0(for pirate factions) that has as its overall reward a 25% boost to faction standings, enough to recover from -10 base to a missionable -2 with diplomacy 5 trained, and make it so that there is no standing requirement whatsoever to do the missions. this will of course produce penalties to opposed faction standings just like any normal storyline mission. it will require an investment of time roughly equal to the time required to rat yourself from -10 sec status to -2, and with smaller cash rewards. ideally, these will also be highly dispersed missions, perhaps even randomly located, so that they can't simply be camped. also, it should not simply be a succession of l4 combat missions. i want to see manufacturing, mining, courier, and combat at a minimum, with it starting with low-trust missions(obscene collateral on couriers, manufacturing missions where they give you next to nothing so you can't just steal it, etc.), and then working up to the point where they actually might trust you a little bit. the exact issues of plot and mission construction can be left up to the devs, but that is what i'm thinking of when i propose this. i believe that this will both expand the rather nifty idea of epic mission arcs to a point where more people will make use of them, and it will allow players to recover serious negative standings, as has been requested for a very long time, in a way that is reasonable both in terms of game mechanics and storyline."
4/5/2009,"would this not mean that certain alliances would have complete and utter control over that recovery option? if you control xy space, you practically control the xy epic recovery mission as well, since almost nobody would be able to run lots of high level missions on your turf without getting ganked over and over and over again. even if the missions are spread out, you will still have to go to some specific agents, sooner or later."
4/5/2009,"you're right that this is a genuine concern, but i think it can be addressed. for one, the most popular of these missions will be the ones for the four empires, and those will be in lowsec which nobody exercises effective control over large swathes of - the only groups that even come close, the fw fleets, will presumably not object to people trying to improve their standing with their empire of choice. for pirate factions, this is more of an issue, but remember that pirate-owned 0.0 regions, where these epic arcs would be taking place, are not player-owned, and thus don't tend to attract nearly as much fire from alliances. also, that would be where you'd have to go in order to use those high standings - if you can't get into curse to run the angel epic arc, then where exactly are you going to run your angel missions? if someone controls the region with all the agents, then they control the ability to use standings, controlling the ability to recover standings is minor by comparison. people who don't like you controlling the space where the missions need to be run will be a problem, of course. i don't think it will be an unmanageable problem, but it will be difficult at times. that said, recovering standings is currently impossible - even if it is difficult after this change, that's still a lot easier than at present. i don't want it being too easy, i just want it to be a possibility, and this seems the right way of getting there."

4/5/2009,"i absolutely support this idea.plexes are sometimes seen as a hotspot for fights, but i've seen more fights happening around gates, stations, or on the acceleration gates into the plexes themselves. if factional warfare is really about taking territory, should we not have most of the fights happening in plexes?love the idea of escalating contested status. work from t1 frigates and be forced to bring an entire battleship gang to defend/attack a vulnerable system to take it over./signed."
4/5/2009,"this. i especially like c (though it has been proposed before), d, and e."
4/5/2009,lawlactually i commented on this before any of it happened. the devs said no no no. they didnt want to make the plexes hard. the other militias are there to defend them... and make them hard.pretty sure this is wrong. unless it has changed since empyrean. though true it's much easier to just sit there and defend. as you have rats as defense. then again when they blob u. the rats dont matter.maybe no escalation mechanics... but surely it's already there. t1 frigs-dessies only to open ended.that smartbomb deal was pretty funny and kind expected to happen. what i want to know is how many vagabond pilots fly from the gate to deadspace for these t1frig plexes. then camp the entrance. ought to be pretty good stuff.anyway. failwarfare is fail. you fail for doing it. failwarfare has nothing at all to do with anything factional or pve.
4/5/2009,what he said.
4/5/2009,this doesnt even make sense.if they want to make low sec more populated... they arent going to say to 0.0 people that they cant go there. that makes no sense at all.also... how are you even going to get to 0.0? there's all of like 2 highsec to 0.0 bridges. unless you suggest we are allowed to keep titans in highsec now?so what? your capital fleet suddenly sits in a holding corp outside the alliance from now on? just so they have the option?no?seriously though... it isnt hard to screw around in low sec and be completely safe. i'm a 1 man corp with capship logistics and i have never had any trouble yet.
4/5/2009,"or you could just use something called ""scouts"" when deploying caps in low sec, even when you know you have the biggest cap fleet in the neighbourhood. seriusly, im just in intrepid because they seem to attrack a delicius amount of wardecs, saves a bit on the corp wallet.but i could still see the pl drop comming miles away even though i didnt know a thing in advance and stil dont know whether they where just out having fun or where helping some friends in the alliance.you seem to want to have the rules tailor made for your current circumstances rather then acutally playing smart."
4/5/2009,"from time to time there are reports about npc corporation activities, in particular their financial status, agms etc. what if we could take part in this and buy their shares (that are tradeable on market, the ""price history"" in the market tabs could serve as a stock chart/index). by buying those npc corporation shares (or getting them in another way), we could participate in their well-being, and their times of crisis by not getting dividends when they stumble financially.the dividends they'd pay could be either random or depend on how much isk the corporations generated at their outpost (part of the trading-, repair-, cloning- and reprocessing fees). when there are news that a corporation of our faction is in financial needs, we could help them by massive investments, using their stations, buying their products, doing missions for them etc. or caring in another way for the corporation, that we invest our isk in.since shares already exist in game (ishukone for example has 19.893.328.259 shares) and the voting and dividend payment mechanics are already implemented as well, this shouldn't be too much work, but could result in level of market realism, that has been never seen before in a mmorpg."
4/5/2009,would be a cool idea if someone figured out a way to do it. supported.
4/5/2009,"the difficult part of this proposal is having computer-generated share price fluctuations that feel real while not being overpowered as an investment tool. i don't want a ccp employee to have to create fake financials for a hundred npc corps, and i don't want a rate of return that beggars the player banks. if it can be implemented well i'm for it, but i'd rather not have it at all than have a mediocre implementation."
4/5/2009,"when you open a saved fit in game, which, maybe your friend or corpie sent to you, i think there should be a button ""buy fit"" which would attempt to buy the fit from the market all at once.this would save a lot of time."

4/5/2009,"its not a horrible idea, although i wouldn't use it in case they cheapest neutron blaster cannon ii on the market has been put up for 5b...supporting none-the-less."
4/5/2009,it could before you press buy pull the price info for the market from you? or pop up a warning message with all prices on it.something along those lines shouldnt be to hard to make
4/5/2009,this idea just need a bit of tweaking into a new and highly useful tool..have hotpad work more like fittings or bookmarks.. with the option to inject multiple buyorders at once using these presets.with a nice ui this would make a nice upgrade to easy order placements and grant the mentioned feature using presaved settings.
4/5/2009,"something along these lines would be nice, yes. hit buy, have a popup saying ""this fit will cost you 123,456,789.10 isk - are you sure you want to buy?"", and then get the stuff."
4/5/2009,"that sums it up very nicely, thank you"
4/5/2009,i was going to suggest this!
4/5/2009,"you do realize that the fitting bought this way will almost always be prized weirdly and most importantly scattered all over the region?how exactly should that be limited?there is almost no single place in the whole of eve, where diverse fittings can be bought. so the only things this would do is increase the importance of psychedelic trade hubs like jita even more. any concepts how that should be avoided? after all, once you need to check everything manually anyway, the concept is useless. how do you know whether or not you are buying grossly over price? you'd likely check the most important items manually...also, i have never seen any fitting so complex that it would save that much time to buy it manually, get the stuff and fit it, compared to what this suggestion would likely do.if you can actually think of a way that this could work reasonably, i'm all ears."
4/5/2009,"jita, ammar, agil are 3 that i use where you can buy a fit for any subcap ship.you could limit it to ""system"" if it makes you feel like less of a lag-generator"

4/5/2009,"you got it all wrong... what they must do is nerf blobs. how do you do this? diminishing damage per increasing hits (like a stacking penalty on damage).random number for example:8 guns hitting you = 100% damage16 guns hitting you = 75% damage32 guns hitting you = 50% damage64 guns hitting you = 20% damage>72 guns hitting you = 5% damageetc.this way you fix: blobs, increase tactics and reitnroduce skills. and active tanking may be an option again."
4/5/2009,"i.e. make titans immune to sub capital guns and any ship immune to a group of ships that use weapons 2 tiers lower than the class of the ship. brutix + drones = 12 weapons (alone, nerfed to 75% damage)drake + drones = 12 weapons (alone, nerfed to 75% damage)total 24 weapons, nerfed to the equivalent of 12 against a bs."
4/5/2009,this.
4/5/2009,"*facepalm*so you can tank a bs if you fit your ship for it and use expensive implants and really that is all you can do than, experts are calling this an epic fail argument oh well then lets nerf guns and other things because you are only allowed to do one thing on a ship. i guess this is the kind of zombie braindead stupidness that made ccp to nerf falcons"
4/5/2009,oh hi mr bitter caldari. you lost your overpowered falcon so now you want other overpowered ships right? no.and just to make this clear: a rokh can fit a tank better than most armour tanking ships while doing blaster dps at 20km... name one armour tanking ship which can match this?
4/5/2009,"you are missing many points there, like capacitor problems and lack of tackling ability there... not to mention missing damage bonus and drones... average hyperion or megathron will pretty much kick ass against rokh in most cases... that will of course depend on fitting, but still.anyway, shield tank itself isn't so bad, but it's weak against neutralizers/nos (heavy capacitor usage) and you cannot really fit proper tackling modules or sensor boosters etc. while shield tanking. that's the real problem, which has been there like forever and hard to see any changes about it really..."
4/5/2009,"off course is not as simple and a lot of things should be taken into account, probably makign certain classes more vulnerable etc. what i mean is the underlying problem with active tanking (and there is no difference with armor tanking) are blobs, so if you want to ""fix"" somethign fix acumulative damage, don't artifically add unbalancing mods."
4/5/2009,"no, you can active shield tank a bs more effectively than you can active armor tank a bs even without the expensive implants. also, note that the mael tank was 5 slots, while the hype tank was 6, and the mael still tanked more. the use of crystal implants just raises it from being 20% better to being 80% better. also, since when is the common damage modifier not an essential piece of pvp gear? armor tank ships have to gimp their dps to fit a tank anywhere within a mile of what a shield-tanker can fit. in a mixed gang, you can outsource your tackling to frigates, but the damage mods need to go on the battleships. try to fit up a hyperion with a 3/4-slot tank once you fit the 2-3 damage mods you need to make a blaster ship anything other than a bad joke, and you'll see that the rep bonus is for missioners only, since +37.5% on a single lar omnitanking is a rounding error. yeah, you can fit all that pretty tackle gear on your resident slow-moving, slow-locking tub, but your tank is hilariously awful, which is why armor tankers just go for a buffer. you can't fit and run enough lar to make a difference, but you can run enough 1600mm plates to give you a fighting chance, which is why armor tanks are all buffer tanks. and of the active-tank types, you say it's shield tanking that needs work? please."
4/5/2009,"considering there are vids of maelstroms tanking loads of guys, gettings lots of kills, and getting away. i just cant see why you need to improve shield tanking.the reality is that neuts are fairly common. meaning active tanking anything is just bad somewhat."
4/5/2009,"a bit of over complex but needed. i might add, allowing adjustment to drone orbit distance out to max controlable distance. it might come in handy to catch a cloaked ship. if drones proximity can de-cloak a ship as well."

4/5/2009,"since i know ccp do not listen from previous expirences i will try here! this post is aimed proposing a sequence of changes for the dreadnaught, i have tried to ballance my changes with other game aspects.siege module:625% damage increase:no comment.-75% scan resolution:pointless negitive bonus.. whats the point of delaying the enevitable?2 max lock target: increase this number to 1... no even better increase it to 0... when it takes 1 1/2 min's to lock something without sensor boosters who the hell cares chances are your team mates have killed it before you get on the killmail right? and even then chances are your going to miss every shot.100% shield bonus -50% to shield activation / 100% to armor, -50% activation: remove the 100% armor / shield bonus:capital ships some time ago received an incredible bonus to existing armor and shield sizes, the fact that a dreadnaught can repair so much armor in a short space of time makes 1v1 dread fighting irrelevant, as in large dread scale fighting the bonus is once again doesnt do much, i would propose removing one of the 2 bonuses from each shield and armor.immune to ew:remove this affect on dreads (more to follow), let them be scrambled, jammed, dampened, whatever there is a greater flexibility for the defender. carriers will then have a role of also remote repairing dreads giving carriers a more definitive role in small fleets and more flexibility large scale fleets.no movement allowed, no jumping, no warping: remove these affects on the ship, if a dreadnaught is in siege mode and it can move, jump or warp there is huge flexibility for an aggressor i personally believe this to be the underlining factor to why people do not use dreads in smaller amounts vs. larger targets. unless youre a caldari dreadnaught chances are you will not be able to jump because of capacitor constraints, also take into account the new cap neuting pos module. this will also open up more long range bombardment options off poses to snipe out deffensive modules and then move closer... also range is a tool vs. loging on dictor pilots and the allsorted options available in the eve environment.-92% tracking speed.if the ew bonus is removed, remote target speed enhancer modules would need to be looked into, i dont see how it should be allowed that 625% damage enhancement and awesome tracking should be allowed on any battlefield, everyone would fly pure fleets of dreads and it would become a ship that does a great deal in current eve mechanics.pos modules:the pos started off as a dream idea of being a tech2 essential component, a dream that turned into a quick way for alliances to secure space so that these large alliances could have stability form economy (whatever person made this idea i hope they got fired, stability is in militant force and presence, not ones ability to shove fuel in a tower and shout ""im better than you because im rich and can afford to run 20 poses""), all this for the good of eve so that we could all carebear in peace and harmony... then came the sov leveling system... and it just goes to pot land conquering warfayre turns into a job and not a game for most people but its a matter of perspective i guess.if a dread can be jammed, damped or whatever else, pos modules should in turn be jamable... poss do have ew modules so there should be no complaints really. if an attacking fleet can jam pos modules as well as deal with the enemy aggressor fleet there is allot of flexibility now between the aggressors and the defenders.the defender fleet will be able to delay sieging dreads whilst killing the enemy on poses whilst the attacking fleet focus on killing off the enemy fleet and jamming pos modules or enemy ew that may be jamming your dreads it would be a new challenge which would generate more fun for everyone and new game dynamics will ultimatly form from this."
4/5/2009,"the changes might make people think twice about loading a pos with pure fire+neut power and maybe people willinvest in ew modules, meaning that the removing of the tanking bonus is negated by the proposed change in pos dynamics.fleets vs. cyno jammers:it is a stupid concept that you need a ******ed size fleet to be able to attack a pos in a jammed system, when you have 1 eve freak sitting with his 5 accounts on 1 pos, manning 10 large guns having a hell of a time insta-poping your fleet while an fc is powerless to do jack about it. and not to mention even more hardcore eve freaks sitting there with there double titan accounts pressing the i win buttons when your fleet enters the grid and dies in a ball of lag. being able to jam pos modules should make the game very interesting an enemy would need to invest more then a few titans to actually defend a system you would need a proper fleet to defend.desired outcomes of changes:increase team play and create a secondry viable (being timely) pos shooting hit and run role for dreads (remember that dreads will still need there own logistics even in hit and run tactics, so this isnt a ""i win"" tactic by any means.increase flexibility for small time capital corps, as well as giving the larger alliances more ability to attack a cyno jammed system and change certain aspects of capital fighting which may make certain alliances more elite then others. players in eve need to be judged by there skill levels and abilities not to be a sitting duck on a battlefield with no ability to utilize the wide range of available fleet support to there advantage in todays fleet fights.open potential for 1v1 dreadnaught fighting (ie. not sitting there both for 30 mins running out of siege mode then saying hold on mate just going to jump back to empire and grab some ammo or something stupid)empire noobs need to see more capital action, ccp advertises this capital fleet action crap everywhere over the internet, noobs generally stick close to empire, there may be more opertunity available to pirates to hit and run random poses and anoy people, but more importantly the noob stands a chance at getting in on some capital action at a younger eve age maybe.the economy of eve has grown to a point where it can produce a great deal more then it could, there are clearly to few true combat capital classes in eve or maybe it is finally time to develop a capital destroyer type ship (8 turret points, normal capital weapons call them gun boats or flak ships or ship o death) lots of hell ye die fun basically."
4/5/2009,"having read your idea, i now understand why ccp ddint listen to you.tl;dr = no"
4/5/2009,"i don't fight in 0.0 myself, but i certainly try to listen to those who do, and try to get an idea of how 0.0 combat actually works, what about it is good, and what about it is bad. and from what i've heard, one of the few parts of 0.0 warfare that is actually working exactly correctly, and is in no need of change whatsoever, is the siege module. you get damage, but it's damage that is only useful against poses and capitals, and you're prevented from jumping or living inside an unkillable ball of rr. the siege module brokers fights, provides interesting tactical decisions, and makes it so that capital ships can, in practice, actually die. and furthermore, the numbers are balanced nicely. your suggestions, on the other hand, seem entirely based in a worldview not particularly well-grounded in any form of reality. the immunity to remote rep is an essential part of dreadnought balance. for that matter, you're not even internally consistent - a scan resolution penalty is ""pointless"" and should be removed, but then you say ""who the hell cares"" about extra targets because it takes too long to lock. and all this why - so that capital ships, which are explicitly designed to require a support fleet, can get into a 1v1? you're destroying a well-balanced part of this game in service of a role that not only does not exist, but that could never, ever conceivably exist. it's people like you that make the csm necessary, as a way to filter out this sort of garbage from needing to actually be considered by ccp."

4/5/2009,i am also running website will be running soon and will be posting my eve-o page shortlyshatana csm thread
4/5/2009,deadline to register was april 1st
4/5/2009,my eve-o thread -
4/5/2009,"it shouldn't be a surprise that i will be standing again, for the 3rd csm session. it's been a great pleasure to be chairman of the council and respresent eve's playerbase over the last 4 months, despite all the hard work. i fully intend to continue that hard work into the next session, which is set to be the most critical csm session for the 0.0 endgame in years to come.i know many eve players are convinced that the csm is simply a ccp marketing tool, or a sham designed to appease for their past mistakes. it isn't so. they have been deadly serious about treating the csm as a key link to eve's community, and have listened properly to us even if sometimes they're forced into comprises by other factors. i wouldn't still be putting so much time into the csm if this wasn't the case.it was particularly impressive:a) the way the csm was included in the handling of the starbase exploitb) the effect our input had on the apocrypha expansion (this is largely under nda but trust me, we squashed some big would-be mistakes)c) the key role ccp is giving the csm in the 0.0/sov focused winter expansionmy policies remain:1. customer support (timely, consistent and unbiased desicions on petitions and reimbursements)2. 0.0 warfare problems (overhauling sovereignty and starbase warfare)3. super-capitals (doomsdays, titans, and motherships)details of all are here in my original candidacy thread: candidacy for csm 2.0i will again be representing 0.0 players and, more importantly, those who aspire to 0.0 but find the barriers too high. there's a very real opportunity to open up nullsec gameplay to a wider audience in the next expansion and i will do my best to make that happen."
4/5/2009,oh hi edit: yup
4/5/2009,vik luk for president :d

4/5/2009,"go vik luk, why wouldn't you take a man who posts nude pics of himself on forums."
4/5/2009,"i only recently joined mm.i am already very impressed with how everything is managed by the officers and administrators (or whatever the correct term is :p).if that is a sign of how you will take on csm, then you will no doubt do great things!you have my axe!!"
4/5/2009,i have only been in morsus mihi a short while but vu lak has been supportive of all in morsus and his organisational skills are second to none. he is dedicated to eve and this shows in his enthusiasm and participaion. i vot for vu lak for csm

4/5/2009,<3 vuk
4/5/2009,vuk is a valuable csm to vote for (and i would like to work with in csm 3.0)
4/5/2009,i think vuk is doing a great job to all of us and the most important thing is i have the feeling that he is really concerned with the players issues and not only a person who slobber over his csm-position.
4/5/2009,vote 4 vuk. honest. fair-minded.committed to eve.sounds right for csm.
4/5/2009,yess !!vik luk for csm again :)
4/5/2009,vote for vuk
4/5/2009,i pledge my vote for vuk.
4/5/2009,vuk lau for president win win
4/5/2009,we need a person who will be the voice of the 0.0 crowd and who better then vuk.
4/5/2009,"tell me, what hard work are you referring to, you have only raised three issues, and the only 0.0 issue you have slightly been involved with was raised by darius. in addition you've assumed the mantle of chairmanship without putting it to democratic vote, and i think this has done the csm more harm than good.so how exactly do you plan to represent 0.0 when you've done nothing in the last half year, and why exactly should people vote for you?"
4/5/2009,"if you read any of meeting minutes both from regular or iceland meetings you will notice the work of all csm delegates. i am not lonely in my work but share more or less equal ammount of it with all other csm delegates. beside regular issues csm was heavily involved into discussions about apocrypha features and even more into upcoming 0.0 expansion for the winter. when it come to raised issues it is true that csm 2.0 raised less issues then csm 1.0 and it was discussed internaly. there are two main reasons for this. first is that sometimes there is really not good issues, and 2nd is that there is already like 20-30 or even more issues that passed csm and went to ccp but are waiting for future times to be implemented. its much better to have 5 good and important issues implemented then to bombard ccp with hundreds of semigood ones just for the sake for being active. csm 2.0 and myself included still have more then month and i fully intend to keep all promises i made at the start of my csm 2.0 campaign. i am personaly not happy it had to wait, but regardless of priority i am giving to my csm duties i had both real life to take care off and carebear alliance of 2.7k people to lead.when it comes to chairman position by rules ccp made, the person with most votes gets it. i dont see why should i throw all the votes i got by giving chair to someone else. also i cant see how 8 other delegates can decide who should be the chairman. there is not similar case in real world elections, so it shouldnt be here aswell.for the end, next time when you want to troll, atleast grow cohones to post with your main, and not 1day altthank you"
4/5/2009,down with the kapitalist mahshine! vote 4 vuk.
4/5/2009,"vuk, vuk, vuk, vuk !"
4/5/2009,vuk the best. vote vuk
4/5/2009,yeh vik luk gets my approval
4/5/2009,vote vuk for a bright future!
4/5/2009,vik!vuk!vik!
4/5/2009,vuk has much experience about the 0.0 warface and will support ccp well in the next candidature periode.vote for vuk
4/5/2009,you got my wote vi... vuk lau
4/5/2009,trolling removed. navigator
4/5/2009,don't know much about history don't know much about biology don't know much about a science book don't know much about the french i took but i do know that i love vikand he loves me cause i have big ships!btw. vote for vuk lau
4/5/2009,"as said before.vuk lau is one of the players in eve you could trust in. a man of integrity that will do his out most to ensure that all player issues will be raised and discussed with ccp. he also has extensive knowledge about the game mechanics of eve. knowledge that are imperative for being a csm. i'm absolutely sure that vuk is your man to vote on if you want not only your questions raised, but raised in way and with the follow up knowledge that would make it heard.it's one thing to be a csm, there's a totally different thing to be a competent csm. vuk is a very competent csm, and i'm sure it will be reflected even more on his next upcoming term.of course, as i am a member of his humble care bearing and role playing alliance, it sort of throwing a rock in a glass-house (or whatever the right english word for that is). but take my word as it is, it comes from the hearth.edited minor typos."
4/5/2009,"i like him, he likes banjaluchi chevap and vanilice, i will vote for him"
4/5/2009,"obvious troll is obvious. that said, i find it impressive how the people who claim it's a free vacation tend to be the ones who not only have never been, but who don't even know very much about those who did go. everyone who actually looks at the business transacted, and has the slightest clue about how meetings function, knows that they weren't at a club med. i've been at a lot bigger and more respectable events with a lot less demanding a schedule than the ones set for the ccp/csm meetings. there's been one other alliance leader of an alliance of comparable size on the csm, and darius has brought up like two issues in the last year, and zero of any importance. the other alliance heads have been smaller by a huge margin - star fraction, hun reloaded, and honda accord are all 100-150, ministry of information is under 20, and while the alliances hardin has led probably number in the tens of thousands, i doubt that really counts. none of the others have led alliances. the last chairman didn't step down and allow a vote either, to be fair. personally, i think that the chair should be determined by an internal vote and not an external one, to make sure that the person running the meetings is mutually agreeable and can do things with a minimum of fuss(i.e., i don't want to see what happened with jade in charge happen again). that said, vuk's position is a perfectly reasonable one - we disagree, but i don't think it's at all undemocratic or evil to think that the voters should determine the csm chair. no, acting like a jackass towards someone who doesn't deserve it on a day-old alt is trolling."
4/5/2009,"vuk lau for president!in my experience with vuk lau, he has always gone out of his way to help all the capsuleers around him. he helped/saved me on numerous occasions. he especially makes sure that it is easy for all of us to have what we need in 0.0.and besides, i heard somewhere he has nudiepics on the interwebz. he's got to be great!i approve this message-gv"
4/5/2009,personal friend i would share my bed with (if the need occurs)last term was the first time i felt csm can do something other then waste everyone's time. vuk is the man to continue this job. you got my votes.
4/5/2009,"he smells like freshly baking cookies.vuk is a responsible and dedicated person, and still maintains a high level of fun in the game. these key attributes, from my time with his alter ego in the game, make him a wonderful asset to the csm for all players."
4/5/2009,vuk for king \o/
4/5/2009,why is this not being shouted from rooftops?!?
4/5/2009,an excellent candidate who has my full support.
4/5/2009,vik luk is tha man!vote vuk!
4/5/2009,vote for vuk! 0.0 needs some love and he will surely bring it on.
4/5/2009,"i love vik luk.errr, i mean vuk lau!"
4/5/2009,vuk lau vuk lau vuk lauthis guy rocksvote for him!!!good luck vuk
4/5/2009,"i to can confirm this,vote vuk lau!!!"
4/5/2009,vuk has all the qualities to do that job right. my vote for vuk.
4/5/2009,"hi. my name is shatana fulfairas and i want to be your representative on the council of stellar management, to represent more of the commerce and industry side of eve online.i have many reasons i am playing this game i love the game and ive been playing for almost 5 years. i've seen many parts of the game from living and working in empire to being in a major alliance working and fighting to keep a home winning and losing throughout many fun times.for the last year or so ive been working back into empire been running some missions mining building etc, i like to see all the way people live and survive in empire as it has the most amount of players.since the most recent expansion apocrypha ive been playing around with the scanning for wormhole's gravametric's etc on them being in the wormholes.. fighting sometimes with success and finding out how nasty they can be losing 2 battleships from the fleet in less than 22 sec'si mine, build do some research ive played many roles since starting the game and would love to be apart to make some changes that benifit everyone.i see an important part of eve is it's industry. without this backbone to eve pvp wouldnt take place in eve without their ships and modules. from the smallest frigates to the mighty titan's and stations are all built by the players of the the games. some take the cooperation of all member corps of an alliance to build and other who are on their first steps to building bigger and better.to get the ships to play in we all need the basics to go into it which comes from the mining, the one ship i am pleased about is the orca it does work very nicely in its role which can be varied not just a carebear ship but the probelm with empire is it's over mined. and access to 0.0 for some is still a long wayoff. i hope in the future we see good changes where you dont have a 6 member corp holding nearly entire regions so it will give the smaller allinces a chance to live and work in 0.0.i am putting myself forward as a candidate for the following reasons:i believe in fair discussion and i am always ready to listen to opinions that may be completely opposite to my own.i have played many aspects of the game and understand the effects a change in one area makes on others.commerce and industry seems to be a neglected area of expansion - if slightly more influence was placed upon it, this would enhance the game for all players.i see a lot of imbalances in eve online and would use my time on the council to help the player base, to show up all the pros and cons of all the issues that seems to bug every player.factions should not play a part in any decision or recommendation made by the council. the council is elected by and for the players and all members should be completely impartial. i believe that i am the right person to do this.i believe in fair discussion and i am always ready to listen to opinion's that may be complete opposite to my own, it all needs a fair and impartial ear to listen to it. within this i would like to represent more of the commerce and industry side of the game as this seems an area that ccp have fewer resources to apply to it and my belief is if there was more time and effort placed here it would improve the gaming experience for many of those players.as i mentioned earlier i have played my part in many fights and battles over the time they have been played from small roaming gangs to huge fleet battles where you have more than 1200 people in a system fighting each other and ive enjoyed them both equally. this is known that the developers of eve put a lot of emphasis on this part of the game and it is why many people play in the larger alliances or in smaller pirate corporations or as some say the bane of low sector playing but most of the time it is all in good fun, and many battles are enjoyed.in conclusion to this i will say i love this game and love the community surrounding the game, and i see in years to come the scope and grandeur of the game extending an bringing in more of a player base, and i hope to be a part of it within the eve council as a representative for you the player to those at ccpshatana fulfairashonour and servecandidate for csm"
4/5/2009,vote iceblock!official portrait
4/5/2009,"this post has been cleared of inappropriate content.regards,the eve online moderation team"
4/5/2009,cleaned.changed images to links. please post with respect.
4/5/2009,admiral iceblock's csm campaign is now the first and only to be dev-team endorsed.
4/5/2009,"i would just like to say that this is just a ""sneak-peak top three"" that i will mostly focus on if you guys vote me as csm. i picked the three to be more real and not to drown you with walls of text with all kinds of rubbish, where you have to read several pages to actually see what i stand for.so, to make a standpoint, i picked the ones that are the most important to me and (as i feel it) the eve community. but mind you, i stand for (and against) much much more."
4/5/2009,"good day. i'd like to announce that i'm running for csm this term. i'd also like to announce something else.i hate the vast majority of you.my platform for this election will be primarily geared toward serving the interests of griefers, pirates, spies and thieves in eve online. it will also be geared toward serving my own interests, just because. if elected, i will strive to implement measures to make the lives of carebears in eve online a living, screaming hell.some of my campaign ideas include:- proposing an in-game ransom mechanic for pirates. something like, when target is down to 25% or 50% hull, you get the option to send them a window requesting a ransom determined by the pirate. no more carebears trying to be clever by sending 10 million when the ransom was 100. if it's paid through the window, your lock breaks and the victim is given a small window of escape.- giving pilots the ability to jettison their modules. this way, a pilot who is hopelessly scrambled can bargain with any faction gear he's got fitted, as ransom - now pirates don't have to worry about that gist x-type xl shield booster blowing up when they murder a filthy mission-running navy raven.- introducing corrupt concord officials, who can be bribed to fix your security status. the lower it is, the more you pay.- introducing events where the security level of certain populated star systems is randomly reduced to 0.4 for a day, due to ""concord logistical problems"" preventing the deployment of law enforcement to the system.- asteroids will now scream in pain when mined, as well as beg for mercy. this will cause a horrible moral dilemma in the minds of carebears throughout eve, causing many to contemplate suicide.- the implementation of badass pirate modules and gear, obtainable only via pirate factions. carebears get mining lasers and cargo expanders, it's time we got something cool for pirates. ideas include exotic gear restricted to players with a -2/-5 or lower corp sec rating; items such as ecm burst missiles, minefields (not mines, i know they caused lag, i'm thinking of something new - think warp bubble, except it hurts) and ship-to-ship tractor beams for dragging fleeing prey back into bubbles and such. really fun stuff.- addressing the blaster imbalance. i've always considered these to be piratey weapons. under my cruel lordship, the csm will see to it that blasters become the most terrifying short-range weapon in eve. what i want to do, is boost the tracking to a point where missing becomes highly unlikely at any range, even against targets one class smaller. if you're getting that close, there better be serious benefits to the risk involved.- destroyed ships will eject more corpses. these corpses will become a valuable resource in my proposed generation of booster drugs, as pilots are encouraged to harvest thousands of vacuum-blasted dead, and rend them down into exciting new narcotics and boosters in bizarre chemical vats. the carebears got their salvaging profession, it's time pirates got something similar for a little extra payout.- better ship destruction effects. i'm getting sick of the current deal, where all we get is a blue flash and some particle effects. i want to see whole decks blowing out, i want to see explosions rocking the length of the ship before it blows up. the empyrean age video of jamyl blowing up the minmatar fleet is exactly what i want to see when a ship dies.of course, i have no idea how many of these are feasible, but you should consider these suggestions as an idea of my mindset, rather than concrete plans i want to see implemented. my supreme goal is to hurt as many carebears as possible, and i am a rather creative individual - if elected, you can be sure i will find a way.vote shogaatsu in 09!"
4/5/2009,i endorse this.
4/5/2009,"this guy is an ass. he thinks very highly of himself, and won't blink at stealing, double-crossing, or selling his grandmother. he's also likely out of touch with game mechanics, and will only drive for the things he cares about - things he may lose interest in a week afterwards, as a new shiny thing turns up. this man is a murdering bastard and a magpie. that said, if you want someone who can write long sentences and is at home with polysyllabic construction, he's definitely your man. a verbose criminal, if you will."
4/5/2009,hear hear!
4/5/2009,got my votes tbh.
4/5/2009,interesting candidate.i'm looking forward to seeing how this will turn out
4/5/2009,i've heard enough.i'm voting.
4/5/2009,vote for istvaan! or else!
4/5/2009,"i'm voting for istvaan because he'll make the csm less terrible and boring, also he's famous <3"
4/5/2009,"intresting!!!!istvaan, are you really prepared to release you ""real life"" name to the eve public as a whole? i suspect a fair few of your past ""victims"", would use such information as your rl name and location to return a favor or two....not speaking for myself, since i have never been knowingly directly affected by you or your corps activites, i just wonder if you had considered the ramifications of going public with your rl credentials.--btw as a self confessed carebear myself, i would enjoy seeing many of the ideas you put forth in your intial post, introduced to the game."
4/5/2009,"you still owe me money, istvaan."
4/5/2009,"his name's also in most eon issues, and the credits section in the manual people got when they bought the original box set ;oplus he goes to eve meets in toronto, and has been to fanfest in the past..gh-sc isn't really about keeping a low profile"
4/5/2009,you totally have my vote.

4/5/2009,"i've had death threats before. didn't stop me from going to fanfest, didn't stop me from meeting local players on many occasions. i still hope and pine for the day when i am finally murdered by an enraged nerd. can you imagine the headstone?actually, promise me this: if i am murdered soon, make sure my headstone message is in the form of a killmail."
4/5/2009,"lets be honest, lark is the better candidate and having half a dozen people clamouring for a shot on the csm and fracturing the c&p/piracy/pvp vote isnt going to help matters.roll out a proper manifesto op."

4/5/2009,"my specialty in game is corporate and alliance/ management based.i know most of the eve players are not directly involved with this part of the game and so think this is not an important/interesting part to vote for...corptheft, mailsystem, communication, security issues, sovereignty and so on are topics that you need a csm for that have a long time experience and know how with the game. during my period as 1st alternate csm in the 2nd council, i showed i can also discuss and vote for general issues (currently populair are empire, industrial and new player issues).and on a sidenote;the coucil should represent a mix of the total players community, currently i think around 70% of the csm 3.0 candidates want to represent the new players, that is not a good development in case they all would be in the next csm 3. therefore its important to vote for me, an allround and experienced player, able to represent the total community"

4/5/2009,"when a ship's assembled from repacked things of sortsbe it in a hangar or in other forms of portsthen you tell the game to make an object from an object classand repacking it removes it and makes items you can stackso in theory what your asking could be done, but it's a shame,cause the database one which eve lives would be in such a painand for sales, well the market would become much more insaneto the point that, if the list loaded, the speed would be quite lame.so the next solution would then be to repack something new!make that object from a class with the same rigs installed, too!make the object match the base size, and i'm sure it'd be a sinchthat your fully rigged up domi could use up less per square inch.but the problem is in planning: did that domi cost a lot?did your corp and/or alliance get kicked from the space they got?i'd be angry, ****ed in theory that my domi has to rotbecause then, for all my effort, i have not for what i bought :(but then all the strategy and consideration, too,would be quickly stripped away if i could make a repack-stewand set it up on jump freighters and send it all that day,just so i can hop aboard the ship 40 jumps awayno, i'm happy with the place we're at, and that's how i feel, mateit's a consequence for actions that even small guys can relatethat if a corp or alliance loses their space to fatethen that ship is getting contracted (which to be honest, i hate)but that's just how the cookie crumbles, that's how we pay our dues:if you rig a ship and need it moved, you're gonna sing the blues.dr. seuraph"
4/5/2009,/thread
4/5/2009,they added a major one with the last patch: battleships are supposed to spawn in lowsec.
4/6/2009,old jump effect = winnew jump effect = rubbish.
4/6/2009,omg i agree so much. fraps of cap ships kinda sucks now. it's meh at best. how many cases of beer must we as an eve community send to get this sorted?
4/6/2009,"support. absolutely.the gallente recon ships used to have a role, and actual usefulness prior to the rsd nerf that came with ewar balancing. this probably needed to be done, as the op mentions, rsds were being used in all sorts of ridiculous places. however - the arazu and lachesis in particular are not even pale ghosts compared to the other race's recon ships. the falcon is the ubiquitous pvp condom, and even with nerfs, the rook will likely take up its position in most fleets. the minmatar ships, i'll admit i don't see much of (then i don't see many minmatar ships), buff webbing, perhaps one of the most useful game mechanics there is. the pilgrim and curse are simply vicious little ships, that for their size and price are nearly without equal.the arazu and lachesis - why even fly them?"
4/6/2009,supported.
4/6/2009,i approve of this
4/6/2009,supported.
4/6/2009,"great idea, i was thinking about that the other day.let us edit what the pull-down orbit ranges are in a series of text boxes through the escape menu, and setup hotkeys to use them."
4/6/2009,unupdated clones hurt who?newbs who dont have a clue?do i want the game randomly updating my clone for me? not really...but how about if i try to undock from a medical station without an updated clone. it gives me a warning?i get a warning if i'm trying to goto low sec; aka risk. how about a warning for unupdated clone?
4/6/2009,no.
4/6/2009,"i could support an evemail notification of clone expiry, to allow the player to better make their own decision about what to do. i cannot support the game spending what can be a fairly large sum of money(at least, to a poor player) automatically without the player's action or knowledge. i personally don't care if 8m disappears from my wallet(like it did yesterday, actually), but i know enough people for whom that would seriously screw up their finances that i don't want an automatic upgrade option to be the solution proposed here."
4/6/2009,subcaps need to be smaller so capital pilots can get more e-peen
4/6/2009,"or at the very least and for a start, enable black and covops ships to not show up on local. these ships were supposedly designed to go ""behind the lines"" hell, it may even spur some smaller fleet fights"
4/6/2009,"the current system is fine, as it provides both options for 0.0 inhabitants. if you like local, go live in known 0.0. if you don't, go live in a wormhole./ben"
4/6/2009,"that's not quite fair. if you want to make even options, then make half of the 0.0 regions with local, and half without. then people go real options. 0.0 npc regions should be split as well.tho i'd prefer to wait until ccp finally makes a step toward nerfing all of local in non high sec empire, i think they'll come around eventually, as is the the most logical step forward in evolving game design"
4/6/2009,"totally in with this. low sec is a lot more risk then 0.0 atm, out side of a main war zone anyway. as for the cloaky stuff.make them detectable, but you cant get a 100% lock - you just get a spot within a 100-150km range of them but not allined to them so you cant just fly forward to find them.its also really hard to get that lock when scanning ect. taking maybe 10mins on average. lots more u could do to rebalance the issue, but that is for another topic."
4/6/2009,"first off, the premise in the op is flawed. wormhole space is a completely different arena to new eden space, sleepers are designed to encourage (loosely speaking) pvp-esque fittings and small gang work to take them on, which means in theory a sleeper ratting group that gets jumped by gankers has at least some chance of getting out alive or fighting back. the fittings required to run l4 missions or rat 0.0 belts, let alone mining ships are completely different from pvp/sleeper setups, and leave the pilot a sitting duck to any ganking ship that finds them. saying that 'not having local works fine in wormholes, so it would work in new eden too' is like saying 'not having concord works fine in 0.0, so we should get rid of concord in empire'. they are different environments with different requirements.second, why are you all so insistent on ccp spending development time reinventing the wheel to get us right back where we started? ""hey guys lets get rid of local"". ""hey guys lets rewrite the scanning system to emulate the effects of local"". we already have a system which emulates the effects of local, its called local, and for the most part it works fine.third, the solo and small gang advocates in this thread seem not to realise that they rely as much on local to find things to shoot as their targets use it to look out for things shooting them. i've done my share of scouting for both small gangs and full fleets (insert lol blobbing goon nubs no skills no honour comments here) and being able at a glance to see that a system is empty and i can move on is the only thing that allows a roaming group to cover a decent amount of ground quickly. imagine if on your next roaming op you had to wait several minutes on every single jump while your scout warped around scanning to see if anyone was even present, rather than just jumping in and saying 'ok no-one in local here, system is clear guys, jump in and get to the next gate'. removing local is a token gesture which merely creates the perception of lowsec and 0.0 being places where you'll be suddenly and unavoidably ganked if you undock (and so scares all the ratters and miners back to highsec to lag out the mission hubs even more and leaves fewer things for the rest of us to shoot). it has little effect on the ratter with his 6 accounts and macro programs set up to auto-scan constantly for new signals and ctrl-q at the first sign of anything coming in. its most significant actual consequences for the most part would be to obliterate the reconnaissance and intelligence gathering side of the game, vastly increase the power of cloaking ships and login traps, and cripple the ability of pvp groups to find targets because it takes them an hour or so to check and move through 20 systems. the net result? small to mid scale combat consists entirely of recon gangs stumbling around blindly in the darkness and occasionally bumping accidentally into each other."
4/6/2009,"ehhh i would say no.if you ****ed a state off so much that any citazen of that state would beat you, **** you, **** on you, kill you and **** your dead body, then there is no way in hell you should be able to recover that standing, if you made that choice in the game you shouldn't change your mind.edit:and getting -10 to a state is actually a hell lot of work, so you can't say ""i didn't know what i was doing i am just a noob""."
4/6/2009,"their is only a very few stations which cannot be player owned in the different pirate area's and around them.and effectively they are owned since if you got bad standing to whatever faction and need to improve it you will need a station to dock and the only stations you could dock with your standing, well they are now player owned ;)"
4/6/2009,"angels: 4 corps, each with 10-20 systems settled in curse and fountainblood: 13 systems settled in delveguristas: 7 systems settled in venalsanshas: 2 corps, each with ~30 systems settled in stainserpentis: 16 systems settled in curse and fountainto the best of my knowledge of the game mechanics, you can always dock at these stations, even if you're at -10 to the owners. they're still npc stations, not outposts. blood and guristas will be hard - blood because you're right in the middle of...active, shall we say, space, and guristas because they're genuinely short on stations. angel, sanshas, and serpentis will be just fine, though, as will the important ones - amarr, caldari, gallente, and minmatar. and if you're blocked from blood and guristas by whatever difficulties their space provides, you do have the option to use sanshas as a workaround - stain is a lot more open, and you can run your sanshas standings up without having to mission in the middle of the delve war. again, i'm not sure how it helps you to have good blood standing if you're not willing to mission in delve, but if you really want it, that's a way to get it. at the end of the day, though, pirate faction standings are secondary. yes, there are people who'll want to run up serpentis standings and get snakes for their lp. there are a lot more people who spent a year missioning in dodixie(or who were intending to balance their standings but ran one too many missions for one faction and lost access to the others), realized that now they can't fly in the good half of highsec, and would really like a way out of their hole. this proposal is aimed mostly at them. as for the ""you shouldn't be able to recover if they hate you that much"", i have a few things to say. one, i said in my original suggestion that it should start out with truly bad missions - couriers with collateral 10x the value of the goods, manufacturing missions where they tell you to go buy a blueprint and give them stuff, and the like. in rp terms, you're working your way back into their trust, and it should be long and painful to do so. two, this is a game, and hard limits on things tend to really annoy people who play games. ""never"" is a word you should try not to use - actions having consequences is fine, actions having unfixable consequences is less fine. three, this sort of thing is hardly unprecedented, even in real life - go look up people like alcibiades, talleyrand, or von braun(to pick three of many). if you're useful enough, and pod pilots are quite useful, former enemies will forgive you a truly great amount."
4/6/2009,"i think its a well thought out solution to the standings problem, and i support it."
4/6/2009,"and the abillity to remove almost everything in the background. why does my ""dark vast nothingness"" need to be coulorfull as a freaking rainbow, in every mission i need to turn the cam around untill i find a dark spot i can stare on so my eyes ain't annoyid by all the annoying background stuff :("
4/6/2009,"well the point is if they implement static backgrounds, you would mainly have a black background with different colored stars.. there would be gas clouds. but not one that envelops every single system.i agree though, there should be an option to turn off complex backgrounds."
4/6/2009,do this naow
4/6/2009,"we can assign a hotkey to attack and to return and orbit, but we don't have one for launching drones. it seems pretty obvious this should be included with it."
4/6/2009,supported. for drone boats i'd like to see options to launch drones by group with by hotkey.
4/6/2009,hell yeah
4/6/2009,"i assume we don't have it because there's more than one drone group on many ships. that said, having the ability to set a default launch group for the hotkey would fix this just fine. supported."
4/6/2009,i barely ever use drones (im hard core caldari) but even i think this would be an incredibly convenient feature.
4/6/2009,yup
4/6/2009,supported.i was wondering why i couldn't find it and then realized that there wasn't one. stupid me
4/6/2009,yes
4/6/2009,"as a dedicated drone specced gallente, i fully support this idea.i do wonder though, which drone group the hotkey would launch, can you change that group, and so on?"
4/6/2009,excellent idea!would be easy to implement into the ship interface with group icons around the shield or something. each button would show the name of your respective group. awesome idea!
4/6/2009,"i'd like to see two separate bombers:1st: old good stealthies able to fight small ships. could be done just with a little boost to old bonus-map, expl. speed or expl. radius.2nd: the new bombers on destroyers hull. 6 siege launchers etc."

4/6/2009,why not have some fluffy weak npc ships floating around the galaxy?sounds like perfect cannon fodder for a -10 sec player.
4/6/2009,i'll support only if i can kill them without getting concorded.
4/6/2009,hell yeah!!!
4/6/2009,nobody cares about rping.(unless they can be killed for loot or something )
4/6/2009,make them fluffy
4/6/2009,"hello!i could not find this, so here i go.many times i find myself just whanting to sell stuff to avarage market value or have them slightly over or under avarage price. this lead to alot of clicking wich i feel can be avoided. therefore i like to see a function that you can sell a bunch of items at the same time and with just one click. i like to see the following options:sell all things to equal or x procent over or under average price.all the stuff that dont have a buyer at avarage or x procent over or under according to settings will be put on the market for x procent above or under the avarage priceoption to save the above in diffrent present with one user set default to speed up the selling proccess.you should ofcource still be able to sell stuff one buy one.i am aware of the problems this can generate if someone for instance tweak a bit and make a macro trader. however i still feel this is something ccp should look into to implement, and am comfortable that they can minimize the risks and make the selling experiance alot easier for people. thank yoump337"
4/6/2009,"so highlight a bunch of items, get a ""mass sell"" option on the right-click menu, and then have a sell-order-type window pop up and give you the choice of selling to buy orders or selling at x% of regional average? i can dig it. wouldn't use it(i'm too much of a penny-pincher), but i know quite a lot of people who would, and all of them would absolutely love this."
4/6/2009,"siiiiiiiiiiiiiigneeeeeeeeeeeet :pyer would love this :d takes forever as it is now :(although i would like it lined up as the reprocessing window, telling me how much i will get for each item so i can click it off, if the price is rediculess (due to no other buyers or sellers).but then it would be perfect:d"
4/6/2009,sure would be nice ^^
4/6/2009,me like.

4/6/2009,"research the kms: check - nex+friends is still missing several cap losses on their failboard. you count hun kills, why not hun losses?terrorized? not hardly. sure an industrial corp is going to have pilots who fail to recognize the threat of war and lose an orca. what you don't see is that corp or its alliance whining about it on the boards. fail whine is epic though, and makes that spanking you all took all the sweeter. thanks suger :)"
4/6/2009,i lol'd.
4/6/2009,"yes, an appropriate implementation is very important in this field. but i think most of the required components are already in game. as mentioned in the op, the share system (voting, dividends etc.) is already in game, although only for player corporations so far. the amount of outposts a npc corporation have, the number of shares, the isk paid by capsuleers in those outposts are known as well. the ""price history"" window serves perfectly as a stock index, the market system, the auctions contracts all that are components that already exist and have to be put together.the shares could be given out in ipos (if ccp decides that it needs an isk sinks) buy market orders or contract auctions. or in trade for loyalty points, for tags, or other things. poksu mineral group could give a share to a person of good standing for 10000 units of veldspar for example. unlike other new things it wouldn't require a lot of extra work, just a good economical balancing, but i think ccp has qualified people who can do this properly (thinking of dr. eyjog here in particular). while many other mmorpgs have auctions and item markets, a stock market and player-owned npc entities are afaik unprecedented in the mmorpg genre and suit perfectly into the eve philosophy of a player-driven market.just imagine what new aspects this might bring to eve. if for example people can have some basic influence on corporate policy by voting (e.g. 1 vote per share, on things like small changes in tax rates, hiring/firing agents etc.) this could motivate corporations or alliances to strife for supremacy within the corporation, buying all available shares in order to become a major shareholder and, getting the share price up, manipulating the market etc."
4/6/2009,not supported.the hostile shown in local is very nervous to residents. this is a part of sthealh-ops harrasments.and as shown above this will make imbalanced hit to the isk-gaining process.
4/6/2009,"it is interesting sov pilots are so defensive about this topic. more interesting is sov pilots who are too ***** to follow me into w space.""gasp"" - something less than a blob fight? i think sov pilots don't support this because they need the local crutch.supported, for black ops and covops ships only in null sec."
4/6/2009,"true. so here is a solution to that: when they cloak to vanish from local, they remain showing in local for a few minutes.to make tracking them even harder, maybe have this echo remain when they leave system so you can't be sure if they cloaked, logged, or left."
4/6/2009,there's still some people flying non cloaking ships! we must end this!(no)
4/6/2009,"it's something you'd do in jita. you're right that it's not useful too many other places(though if the message was ""this will cost you x isk. missing items: a, b, 2x c"" it'd be useful in some other hubs too), but when you're in one of those hubs, it'd be a lifesaver, especially midafternoon on a sunday. if you don't care what the buy orders, or the overpriced sell orders, are at, then this will reduce database calls and just get you the bit you care about. it's low-priority, for the reasons you identify, but it'd still have some use."
4/6/2009,yer although a window with the prices should come up so you could decide which of the items would be too overpriced at the station and click them off
4/6/2009,almost supportedbefore the deal the popup should show the pricing table with summary. it wouldn't be hard to code that.
4/6/2009,"generally supported, but rather than mindlessly buy just add ""view market details"" to the context menu for fitted module and maybe have a button to add all fittings to your market hotbar. a way to search assets for modules used by a saved fitting would be nice too."
4/6/2009,could just have a popup come up with...missing module 1 x x | quick buy x | view detailedmissing module 2 x x | quick buy x | view detailedmissing module 3 x x | quick buy x | view detailedtotal | quick buyhave it autorefresh with any market transactions while the window is open. would make it pretty easy to avoid a bad purchase and still get everything efficiently.
4/6/2009,in my mind it will tell you the prices and locations of each item you are about to buy
4/6/2009,"as the title says.as it is now the drone tracking is rediculesly high compared to their size, a large gunned drone /heavy drone have no problem tracking a frigate sized ship.this should be rebalanced to get in line with the weapon size tracking of all close range turrets."
4/6/2009,"the main disadvantage of the larger drones is less flight speed and ease to get hit themselves.regardless of size, even the largest drones are still tiny compared to a frigate. it makes no sense to compare a hammerhead to a medium turret or an ogre to a large one. the drone speed already takes care of a good deal of that. try shooting down an interceptor with ogres for an extreme example. doesn't change that much with an as on ab."
4/6/2009,"this. try actually using heavy drones on a frigate, and you'll find that lights kill it faster. that seems like tracking is balanced just fine. seriously, crest, i don't know where you get some of your truly strange ideas about game design from. an ogre is not a blaster cannon any more than a torpedo launcher is. the weapon classes are different, and should be viewed accordingly."
4/6/2009,i thought this thread was suggesting a skill that boosts tracking for drones. i guess op is just ignorant.
4/6/2009,"the main problem with drone speed is that they don't mwd all the time when trying to catch fast target a large drone moving 1,5k+ is not slow when it is designed to hit bs's.and comparing it too a large turret is more then elegible, since the drone is actually just a mwd with turrets and if you look at it it's turrets ain't really small at all.it is more then silly that their dmg which is balanced on a bs tank, can be laid upon a frigate orbitting the bs with 1k speed, and it will kill of the frig very fast.these are bs weapons and would as so be balanced as such.although i know this is not a tread that will be supported much by the players, since it will be a nerf to every one except dedicated frigate pilots, it is a much needed balance issue which should be corrected even if people don't like losing the ""pwnage of doom"""
4/6/2009,"just because your caldari and dont use drones, the opposite actually most of the times its drones that kill you sono"
4/6/2009,"try orbiting the ogre drone next time and it wont hit you, just like the bs can't hit you when you orbit it.however, now that you're orbiting something else, the bs can track you and shoot you with its bs-sized guns.just because you're orbitting one object at 1km/s doesn't mean you have high transversal with everything on the battlefield. no support."
4/6/2009,"people seem to post all kinds of things in local, wich should usually be encoraged.however if people post a link (to a contract, a website or something else) in local they are advertizing. in my opinion advertizing should cost isk.so i suggest a simple isk payment to post a contract link in local for a fee i think the fee should be in relation to the contract amount or starting bid (something like .1%) for contract links and a flat fee for website and other links. perhaps the amount should be ajusted for the amount of people in local. the confirmation box for this isk fee should of course have a disable warning option, and perhaps as it seems to be included elsewhere a seperate warning for excessive fees.to me a modest fee to post an advertizement link to a contract in a public channel does not seem unreasoneble.i think this would cut down on unwanted spam in trade hubs, language channels and elsewhere in eve, especially if the fees are scaled based on population numbers.do not forget, a fresh alt only starts with 10k. even a very modest fee would limit them to s single post with such a link, and posts without links are not taxed so most players playstyles would not be hampered."
4/6/2009,"an interesting suggestion, but i think it'll result in too many false positives, and not enough actual impact on jita local."
4/6/2009,"i do not understand what you mean with false positives.eve links are always recognized and typed as such (becoming yellow) in local.i admit that ocasionally after linking something for your own use the chat box tries to link whatever you type to what you linked before, but that is easy to avoid if you want to.if you hide a link to avoid the fee then the 'ad' will become less usefull as people will have to make an effort to resolve the link mauallyto be honest i think the people hit hardest with this proposal would be isk sellers and contract scammers.it does not prevent them from doing it, but it would reduce their amount of spam in local and other public channels.in addition it could work as a tiny isk sink, if the fee is chosen correctly.(of course i support my own proposal)"
4/6/2009,"you're right, i should be clearer about what i mean by ""false positive"". here's the sort of thing i mean:(noob system local chat)noob > hey, it's telling me i don't have enough cpu on my ship. how do i fix that? vet > train the electronics skill, or fit a (link)co-processor i(/link)(help channel)noob > my agent is offering me the mission worlds collide, and i've heard it's hard. what should i expect to face?vet > visit"
4/6/2009,"if we're talking about the primary bomber's role as a terrorist actor that lives in the enemy's deep rear lines, hunts haulers and other shiptypes, so the bomber should be able to perform a solo action. the current sisi bonuses allows solo-hunting haulers only. i dont see the way to kill even cruiser. the ""old"" bombers did allow frig/cruiser/bcs solo-hunting.if we're talking about the anti-battleship only role, then bombers definitely should gain the real devastating firepower. because 15 seconds recloaking delay makes impossible to hide after the decloaking what means death in 5 seconds after being targeted. for example, current bonuses on sisi shows me that manticore needs 30 volleys to kill fleet-snipe megathron. this is epic fail.probably, as was offered in one of the already closed discussions, bombers should hit directly the structure, ignoring the shield and armor. in this way they will definitely become the nightmare for the battleships.upd: all this was wrote down to make clear, that stealth gang of 5 bombers still isn't such effective as gang of 5 cloaking hacs against any shiptype. even with all the penalties gained from the cloaking devices. give people the reason to fly stealthies."
4/6/2009,"the scarcest resource in combat is the pilot. a bomber takes one pilot, a raven takes one pilot. the second-scarcest resource is cash, and after insurance it costs more to lose a bomber than a raven. and for all that, the bomber does less damage and dies about a billion times faster. people fly hacs because hacs do things that battleships can't - speed and agility, mostly. make bombers able to do something that battleships can't(like applying battleship-sized dps to frigate-sized targets, to pick an example completely at random), and people will fly them when they want to do that thing. when you make them a pale pink imitation of a battleship, people will just use a real battleship. i'm not saying a bomber should always be better, but it should be better under some reasonable circumstances. i can't see what those circumstances would be for the proposed torpedo bomber."
4/6/2009,"why i flew the purifier before it was nerfed:good damage in a frigate package. (and now that's being upgraded)has the ability to cloak (and now that's being upgraded)is very agile and quick (and that's being slightly upgraded and downgraded. oh well, i'll live)makes a decent scout (and that's being upgraded slightly)could surprise my enemies (that's being upgraded)pretty explosions (even better! lol)and now with the upgrades, this only makes me want to use the stealth bomber more. now that it can be used with the black ops better, that just makes the class better. the battleship cloaking (not including the bo) idea simply doesn't compare to the stealth bomber. you lose lock time and speed. oh and the ""it doesn't do different damage than the bs"" is simply, bs. lol. we already have frigate-sized frigate killers. (assault frigates) why do we need another platform for one? my 2cents.--isaac"

4/6/2009,"oh rly? i bet i can make a hype setup that outtanks and outdmgs any active shield tanking ship and complaining about not have not enough low slots on a ship with only 6 is fail because that is the point, not enough slots and you have other armor tankign ships with more slots, shield tanking ships have a maximum of 6 slots of which 3-4 are used for mandatory pvp stuff :> yeah armor tanking bs buffer tank because it is better in most situations but shield tanking ships also cant do this rly well.in short: shield tanking ships are baits nothing else :>typhoon anyone? awesome dps out to 20kmalso i cant fly falcons but i enjoy having some in my gang :>"
4/6/2009,"you simply don't get it, but i'll give this one more try. hyperion, 2 lar, dcu, 2 eanm, explo hardener, 2 nanobot accelerator, aux nano pump, 1103 dps tanked, 862 dealt. rokh, xlsb, sba, 2 invuln, 3 solidifier, 1140 dps tanked, 1078 dealt. now, that hyperion is better in some ways - the cap lasts a bit longer, it's a bit faster a ship, etc., but the rokh has somewhat more tank and noticeably more gank. or maybe you want to compare it to other ships. well, the abaddon gets a slightly worse bonus for active tanking, but has a seventh low slot. and sure enough, it gets a touch more tank - 1165, specifically - but it only does 653 dps. the armageddon loses the tanking bonus altogether, but gains an eighth low slot, and this puts it in a worse place overall - 967 tank, and it's not even capable of fitting a full rack of battleship-sized guns. it's not about not having enough slots - i've yet to see any ship that couldn't be made better with more slots - it's about the fact that there are important modules to fit both low and mid, and they both place a pinch on their respective form of tanking. so what, exactly, is this mythical armor tank setup that results in you having an active tank that makes the ship better as an active-tanking pvp ship than a rokh? i don't want ""i bet i can"", i want an actual fit. again, you're making the mistake of assuming that your shield-tanking battleship is flying solo and fitting all the mandatory gear that implies. yes, if you do it that way, your tank is going to suck - i can't seriously suggest an active shield tank on a solo pvp battleship, short of a faction-fit golem or nightmare or something. but for small-gang work, where you can have a ceptor beside you to do the tackling, then your shield tank kicks the crap out of an active armor tank without even trying. drop the whole ""mandatory"" concept from your head, and try to build a functioning gang without preconceptions. a typhoon with no damage mods and the massive pinch on pg imposed by fitting 2 lar actually doesn't do that much dps - only 910. and it tanks 762. and it has 28k less hp than the rokh, moves at half the speed, and is in some ways even more range-dependent because one of its weapon types is a falloff-based weapon. the typhoon is the worst active tanker of the lot."
4/6/2009,"i think that the point is that if the answer to ""how do i make a viable solo pvp fit for my shield tanker"" is ""fly an armour tanker"" then there's something wrong. this would at first sight seem to support cosmic's argument - but there's a key point that's missing, and ultimately why this isn't supported by me (and this is from the point of view of having a real soft spot for ships like the drake - just don't ask me why) - eve is not a solo game. every stage is designed to encourage you to team up with other mal-adjusted societal rejects like the rest of us and go forth and multiply your isk/fun/ganks. in that spirit, having ships that require teamwork in order to be effective fits perfectly within that paradigm. the conclusion must therefore be ""works as intended"""
4/6/2009,"i disagree, but i'm glad to see someone here at least arguing rationally. the answer to ""how do i make a viable solo pvp fit for my shield tanker"" is to fit a buffer tank, just like the armor pilots do. you can get a raven up to 1206 dps on 100k ehp, while fitting a mwd, disruptor, and web. it's not quite as buffered as a megathron doing the same dps, but it has a 20km range instead of a 5km range, and you can also adjust damage types. it also fits a second medium neut and is much less cap-dependant, both of which are nice features. a solo rokh can fit 1078 dps on 129k ehp while fitting a mwd, cap booster, and scram. the solo torp raven is a perfectly viable pvp battleship, and the rokh isn't bad either(inferior to a mega, but not dramatically so). i just didn't mention these before now because this is a thread about active tanks, and thus i was trying to tell him that active tanks are fine if used the right way. if he's a solo pilot, though, the buffer tank will almost always be better, just like it is with pretty much every other ship going."
4/6/2009,"proposal is an adjustment to the damage formula for cruise missiles, torpedos and citadel torpedos. these classes do lackluster damage against non-stationary targets they were designed to hit, and should be adjusted to bring them in line with other weapons systems. this could be achieved with a boost to their respective explosion velocities, but i'll leave the implementation details to ccp. the boost should be done in a manner that preserves the survivability of smaller ships against these weapon platforms.heavy missiles, assault missiles, light missiles and rockets are fine in their current iteration and needn't be adjusted."
4/6/2009,i agree. the missile nerf for cruise missiles needs to be adjusted.
4/6/2009,must agree. the missles have seemed to have been overly nerfed. some type of adjustment would be a welcome change.
4/6/2009,agreed... please examine the heavier missile mechanics as they are way out of alignment.
4/6/2009,"yes, it would seem to be out of alignment."
4/6/2009,"actually all missiles need revising. in real world anti-aircraft missiles uses very advanced explosives that almost eliminates the target's velocity factor. but target can use missile-defence systems and anti-missiles maneuvers to avoid the hit.i'd like to see missile damage ""variator"", doing almost the same job as tracking variable for the guns. in spite of actual absence of the ""anti-missile"" maneuvers in the game, it is could be a special variable for missile explosion cloud hitting which actually would present the effect of such maneuvering. this could place some real logic in missile combat.upd: but, please, don't forget about delayed damage delivery!!!"
4/6/2009,no support. op lacks actual suggestions to change mechanics. --isaac
4/6/2009,"i agree with op that the mechanics are overly nerfed. i disagree however with the above post saying no support because of no suggestion on how to fix the mechanics. there are, i'm sure, dozens of variables. we as players won't know the full impact of those mechanics. but it -is- fairly obvious to us that something isn't right."
4/6/2009,unnerf my babys !!!
4/6/2009,i think missile nerf for the cruise missiles and torps is a little harsh as other posters have said these missiles are designed to hit a target hard and do alot of damage.other weapons platforms can still do far more damage then the larger missiles even with target painters and various rigs to increase the damage.
4/6/2009,/signed.missiles desperately need an un-nerf.
4/6/2009,"judging by the title of your thread and half of your post revolves around citadel torpedos, i detect that what you really want is to drop a caldari dread into seige mode and start insta popping bs's?"
4/6/2009,"signed on one condision.drones wouldn't be able to attack anything that you haven't targeted.the whole idea with drones being able to hit any size ship and auto attack without you being able to target is just so out of bound and should be balanced first.besides that, awesome idea"

4/6/2009,lets go with that pilgrim
4/6/2009,pilgrim is fine don't touch it.pirate faction ships in general need a lot of work. so i'll support that. the ashimmu is completely useless since you can't fit anything worthwhile on it.
4/6/2009,pilgrim is one of the most perfect ships in space. suggestions to change it are based on ignorance or envy. leave my pilgrim alone!

4/6/2009,vuk lau is a great person in general. he has great leadership skills.<3 vuk
4/6/2009,"honestly, anyone that can run an alliance and even have even a little time to do csm is incredible. the work and dedication that it takes to do both is a huge investment. to have some on the board that is truly apart of the 0.0 community, in more then the ""i went to 0.0 once, its scary"" crowd, is pretty crucial.vote for vuk. hate him, love him, doesn't matter, he makes a damn fine leader."

4/6/2009,you definitely have my vote...if i didn't vote for you...you would do naughty things to my stuffed cat again.
4/6/2009,"yeah it does sound a bit boring but then i see how it would be exciting to people who are interested in that stuff. the part i was looking for was ""what do you do with the resulting pile of money?"" to which you answered ""hire mercs to grief people i don't like"". i don't see a problem with that, it completes the cycle. you are using your money to cause ships to explode which feeds the economy and keeps it going.the reason i asked originally, and in this thread specifically, is that issler takes a more non-combative approach so i was curious what the point of having all that money was from her perspective."
4/6/2009,"ok that's a little more descriptive but i still see an issue. in your list of things to do to not go crazy, only one of them is exclusive to carebears... bantam ball. in addition to that i don't see much on that list that is actually fun in a repeatable sense. role playing could be a genuine source of fun, so could bantam ball, but those other activities will get more boring with each execution. running a mission or two is fun, running 10 gets old fast. the same goes for all that other stuff, most people do them to make money to do something else with that money.that's kind of a tangent though, not the actual point here. the point is that there should be no fear of any of those activities being messed with by ccp because those are things everybody has to do to exist/survive in eve. that is what i'm trying to point out to you. we all participate in those activities and then take the money and do something with it. i buy ships, that guy above buys merc contracts... i'm still trying to understand what you do with yours.maybe you truly love mining or managing pos's, maybe the money means nothing to you, you just like delivering fuel and dragging ore/ice into a can every few minutes. i'll say it right here, i can't understand how, but maybe you do.see i'm back on the tangent again, because it is actually that unfathomable."
4/6/2009,"i beg to differ. i also dare you to try and find any political movement or party or organisation that has ever existed irl, or has ever been concieved of in a piece of fiction of any format, that does not have a clear definition of its goals and what constitutes the parameters within which one needs to be to be considered part of that party/movement/ideology. i think youll have a very hard time of it. if issler desires to form a psuedo-political bloc amongst the eve community, then she needs to provide a manifesto of its aims, and what constitutes the limits of its membership. it is also utterly irrelevant who is right in an argument regarding political ideology.issler stated she wants to give carebears a voice (or words to that effect) to mediate the disproportionate influence of the pvpers on the eve-o forums, for fear of said voice having a negative influence on the non-combative aspects of eve life. as such what we need from her, if we, and she, are gonna be able to post constructively or act constructively, is a working definition and plan of what she intends to do, how she intends to work, and what exact qualities she is looking to provide a representative body for.imho, the group of people im assuming she refers to as carebears do not need any kind of political representation beyond a voice regarding the economic aspects of eve, say, for example, petitioning to balance certain market forces which damage the experience of eve as a whole (wouldnt know what they are myself, as im not an industrialist). this idea i have no problem with, as 'bearing is essential to the way eve works. without miners and industrialists this game would be deader than aristotle for want of isk flow and material. as it is right now that view wont change simply because issler and you have not, as of yet, provided enough meat on the bones of your idea for me to make an informed opinion."
4/6/2009,"feel free to ask her specific questions if you want to make a more informed decision. i believe she said a website was in progress, and she has a voting record out there already from csm 2.0.also, her ""voice of reason"" party is not all that far fetched, because i believe most ""reasonable"" people whom she wishes to represent, hold ""reasonable"" complaints with most other candidates.take for example the overwhelming trend this time around for every c&p celebrity to try and run, promoting game breaking mechanics often.a small example:istvaanasteroids bleeding? bribing concord? this doesn't get much more one sided, and if looking through isslers voting history has told me anything... it's that not only does she have an interest for people who arn't c&p regulars, she also has a clear idea of good game mechanics for everyone.i see a problem with forcing definitions on people, ""if you don't mine more than 20 hours a week you're not a carebear"" ... or is it ""if more than 50% of your time is spent in high sec"" ... or ""if you havn't collected 20 killmails in the last week"" ...? the definition is meaningless, when the goal of the party is to protect a wide range of activities. what activities exactly?i believe if you refer to post #1, point #3, she asked for collaboration on exactly what these core ideas could be."
4/6/2009,"for csm, my plan is fairly simple. i intend on having only two areas of significant focus while i am on the csm. first is the ability to keep the sandbox as open as possible. this is harder than it seams, as often one style of play conflicts with another style. i would like to work with ccp on maintaining a balance so that many players can experience the game in ways that they enjoy. additionally, i would like to work with ccp to make sure that they dont inadvertently close off a style of play though the introduction of new content, without at least realizing what they are doing, why they are doing it, and what, if any, new types of play can be made to help replace those that may have been altered. eve is, and should remain, a constantly evolving game. keeping and maintaining the sandbox style options open, so that many different players can enjoy the game, is important to eve as a whole.the second area i wish to focus on is in emphasizing to ccp that they have a lot of content in the game that is incomplete or underutilized. i have quite a bit of experience in faction warfare, which in my opinion never went beyond the 80% complete stage. ccps failure to complete the system and balance it out has resulted in a system that is experiencing significant decline, and within the year i expect it to be a virtually dead game mechanic. this is, in my opinion, a gross over site on ccps part that needs to be addressed. of secondary import are such things as cosmos missions, that were terribly implemented and have such potential that is in essence wasted. in this regards, i would ask ccp to dedicate resources towards rectifying these areas of the game, from small things such as the ui (hmmm, why dont i put the turn off this pos button right next to manage the pos button. ya, thats a great idea.) to medium size (cosmos) to large issues (faction war). from my perspective, ccp tends to release content at 75% complete, balance it to 80% about 1-3 weeks later with a small patch, then drop it off their radar completely."
4/6/2009,"what is your position on gold farmer ganking? would you bring at least bring it up? with all the nerfs to suicide ganking and other mining boons, you can't steal or kill these guys the way you used too. today i saw 70 mackinaw farmers having at an ice belt, and there isn't a damned thing i can do about it anymore.~s~"

4/7/2009,"that would be a cool option - it would give a different look to the interface of ships of different races. i think the variants, like khanid ships, should also get additional font options."

4/7/2009,agreed.
4/7/2009,supported...not mechanically important but for a game that pays so much attention to very little details this is a good idea.
4/7/2009,"supported, however i don't think its very feasible.think about what a pain it is to maneuver capitals around each other now and then imagine trying to fit your cap fleet in a pos bubble when all the ships are 5-10x bigger.titans wouldnt fit in a pos bubble period if they were properly scaled.i'd love to see properly scaled ships (and planets!) but i just dont think it'll happen without breaking the game a bit"

4/7/2009,"well, wormhole space is 0.0 as well. but seriously, would the differences between wormhole space as it is now, and known 0.0 with the same delayed local mechanic, be so great?/ben"
4/7/2009,"yes because its much easier to resupply, and much easier to roam. and you know where your targets will be.without local you will have some of those multiple account people sitting in cloaked ships for weeks, effectively locking down systems from ratting as there is simply no way you can defend against it. the attacker has all the advantages as he can decide when to attack. the defender have to fight against boredom."
4/7/2009,one of the rules of war is know where your enemy isnot supported
4/7/2009,"i was gonna say that this is so far the dumbest post in this thread and tell you that you are a dumbsh#t, but then i remembered that children also play this game.you see, ""knowing where your enemy is"" is indeed one of the most important pieces of info to have during a war. which is all the more reason why this info shouldn't be provided for no effort, instantly, and at infinite range. this is because you always have to work to get something that's worth anything. i hope that's clear enough.it is also important to note that those who propose a delayed local also propose that the ship's on-board directional scanner gets additional features to mitigate the issues that a delayed local would create. such issues include the lack of auto-update function in the current scanner, and the need for additional functionality to replace the current local."
4/7/2009,supported greatly!!!!

4/7/2009,tbh this thread is just about black ops basically. which has nothing to do with logistics. it's about moving the glass cannon defenseless crap ships.i disagree. i think blockade runners are perfect the way they are.jumpfreighters are frighteningly long jumpers. they can survive a nerf that's for damn sure. jumpbridges i'm not so sure about. i like how pods are essentially free to move around. on the otherhand i dont know how much fuel is used relative to other ships. though generally speaking those pos are very sensitive. a blue could keep jumping back and forth and get that pos busted up. not to mention you require sov 3. so i think you deserve that sort of deal.
4/7/2009,"the caod forum is pretty ridiculous, you try to read any posts or topics and it ends up nothing but 20 pages of goonswarm trying to show off their 12 year old e-peen. i propose a simple, forum ""jammer"" which will allow forum users to place certain alliances/corps/members on auto jam. call it the forum falcon or something, but i think it's pretty clear there needs to be some moderation in there. caod is absolutely useless when every post turns into 20 pages of useless goon-dribble.btw i have nothing to do with the whole goon/bob thing.. i just like to read the forum to keep up with what goes on with all the big alliances.. i'm quite sure i'm not the only one that is tired of reading all the useless posts that the caod has become because of 2 or 3 alliances."
4/7/2009,"has my support..i'm all for goons fighting bob and vice versa, and i wish either side the best of luck, but constantly seeing the same crap repeated over and over and over and over, by goonswarm, its just painful.when they finally have to deal with people's complaints they're always like ""bob did the same x amount of years ago and we didn't see you complain about that!"" first of all, wow..what a kindergarden argument. second of all, yes people did complain. thirdly, be as that may ...they dont do it anymore, see the difference??"
4/7/2009,"what i support is a block feature. so you can choose to block people yourself. i dont support having the mods banning or whatever.ps. i cant post in, nor do i read caod."
4/7/2009,yea that's all i'm talking about.. just thought i'd be cleaver and call it a forum falcon. the tech ii version could block whole corps or alliances to make it easier.

4/7/2009,"there was a news thingie once with share prices of an npc corp in it, and the whole corp's worth was around 10 bil or something in that area. i can't remember the details but it was interesting regardless.what if an invididual buys out all/majority of the shares? or will only small parts of the shares get circulated?anyway, i like the idea, and the details can be let to ccp."
4/7/2009,"heh.. cloak favoritism, anyone? i think a better change to make is to change local for any ships that dont enter system through the jump gates. the whole point of a covert cyno is to jump in undetected, i believe. so why would any group thats gone to the effort to cov cyno in, then announce their presence to the system? it's like we are getting permission first and then the ppl we ask are telling everyone that we are sneaking around, so its like concord is ratting out anyone that jumps in system all the time. i think a better change is a modified local that only adds players who are on the same grid as a gate, station, or pos. at most someone entering a system by non standard methods should show up as ""unknown"" in local until they approach one of the aformentioned structures, after all, why would you turn your transponders on if you're cloaked? you also shouldnt recieve fleet bonuses while cloaked, since the whole point of cloaking is to have zero detectable emissions, how would the fleet transmissions continue without giving away your location?"
4/7/2009,"i'd be just as happy if you didn't show up in local at all (anywhere) until you said something, and then you showed up for 5 minutes after your last post or something like that.but then, i only use local to watch for blinky red things anyway. i appreciate that the interstellar communication bandwidth exists to advise me when people i can shoot are close by."
4/7/2009,"i'm just doing some thinking right now and i believe that black ops ships would be incredibly more useful if they could get the same kind of recon ship bonuses, like the caldari black ops ship (widow). why not apply the same to the rest of bos? i think that would give a whole new level to this class of ships.wtb comments :)"
4/7/2009,not really. it would make them dry and dull and overly-priced force recons. (or combat recons in this case).no support.--isaac
4/7/2009,"they're already dry and dull overpriced ship jumpers. why not give them a new functionality that would make much more sense? just like assault ships - hacs - (command ships) - marauders, which all have the same function: to deal damage, have electronic attack ships - recon ships - black ops, all following the same kind of bonuses. at least they would be dry and dull overpriced ship jumpers/better recon ships. i'm just seeing one conflict of ships here: between what the redeemer would turn into and what the bhaalgorn is. altho, the frigate and cruiser class pirate ships that follow the same path as the bhaalgorn also have a conflict with the sentinel and curse. but i still think this idea is viable.this thread needs moar comments :dedit: i approve of my own idea."
4/7/2009,"the fix to black ops, in my opinion, would have to revolve more around black ops. but this is impossible until the in-game intel system is changed. local nerfs black ops.. and that's just ridiculous."
4/7/2009,except that black ops do not connect to eas/recon ships in any way. its a class of its own. until ccp changes it's role. --isaac

4/7/2009,if you reinforce a tower that holds a cyno jammer. the cynojammer continues to run. this must change.cynojammers are why 0.0 is so unchanging. at least give the cynojammer cpu requirements such that if the tower is reinforced. it goes offline.problem: incap the jammer. bring in dreads. reinforce the tower. enemy force reps up the jammer quickly and easily as it has fairly low hp relative to the pos; also can be repped up at any time. as opposed to reinforced timer disallowing rep.fix: incapacitated arrays that get repped up will come back as offline.
4/7/2009,correct me if i'm wrong...but isn't it easier just to shoot the jammer and then reinforce the tower? no support--isaac
4/7/2009,ok. i see you lack reading comprehension. so let me explain it.1st. incap the jammer.this means we shot the jammer.2nd. bring in dreads. reinforce the tower.this means afterwe shot the jammer. we reinforced the tower. you are wrong. this is exactly what we did.the tower remains reinforced. thusly not repairable. also all cpu modules are offline.they repaired the jammer. which is fairly easy. also they cant repair the tower. so essentially this creates a situation that people with sov 3 can easily keep out most people from their space. unless you camp them 23/7 which isnt plausible for any alliance except the largest of them.
4/7/2009,"and i still see no reason to change current game mechanics. they could just as easily setup a new pos with a cynojammer. your change changes nothing. you'll still have to camp the system 23/7. also, your statement that ""it takes a really big alliance to take down sov3"". depends on who your shooting. if your trying to kill bob/goonswarm/rzr/etc then yes, it will take quite a bit of firepower to take them down. this will never change. get used to it.--isaacp.s. nice stealth blob-whine."
4/7/2009,you are ignorant of game mechanics.cynosural_system_jammermax anchoring amount per solar system1 they cannot unanchor due to reinforced. therefore they cannot anchor a new one.
4/7/2009,"i like the knowledge you bring to discussio... oh wait.seriously, these aren't threads to troll.i support the op. cynojammers should go offline if they are on a reinforced pos!"
4/7/2009,"unfortunately, he's right. many alliances use the pos guns to pop incapacitated cyno jammers and then anchor new ones, as it is quicker and easier than repping it."
4/7/2009,"catching up, i read the most recent notes from the csm meeting and came across the pos subject. the issue being abandoned and offline pos having an effect (towards sov) and also taking up space and resources.why not add a small npc scouting operation to moons. if they come across an active defended pos, they would simply be destroyed, if they come across an abandoned or offline pos, they could destroy it. the owners (if there still are any) could be alerted their offline pos is under npc attack and they would have to turn up to defend it."
4/7/2009,"i would be much happier if offline pos were tied into the same 30d counter that anchored cans are now. if not onlined for 30days they just goo poof.ccp has been made aware of this idea, and have indicated they are mulling it over."
4/7/2009,"i noticed there is a features and ideas discussion forum and also this forum.i did not see sticky regarding rules for this forum and would just like clarification because i proposed an idea in the ""ideas and features"" forum which has garnered a lot of support and several people who have had the same or similar idea even before me.there has been no negative feedback on it and i think it really is something that the devs would benefit from hearing. not a nerf or buff idea either?"
4/7/2009,"features and ideas is more to get the idea to mature and gather feedback, once the idea is more or less final, you can bring it here and we may then raise it to ccp."
4/7/2009,"thank you for the explination. is there any specific format the posting should be in? such as links to the ideas and forums discussion, votes, anything like that?"
4/7/2009,"why shouldn't a drone be able to track more rapidly than a ship's turrets? it can surely turn a lot faster, since it's a) very small, and b) doesn't have to worry about pulping the crew with a ludicrously high-g maneuver, so even if the turret tracking is actually the same, the effective tracking will be higher because the drone can turn the entire weapon platform more rapidly."
4/7/2009,"as with every other similar proposal that's crossed this forum unread by anyone in a position that could even try to do anything about it...none of them much care.anyway, we should all have a little button available when we click on a person's name in chat:the spam button. when you click the spam button that person is blocked to you while you remain in that system.if enough people click the spam button in a certain time (say, 15 or 30 mins) that person suddenly finds themselves gagged for say... an hour or two. if they're gagged more than x number of times in a day they'll recieve a temp ban of say... a day or two. if this happens enough they get a long term ban that ccp will have to investigate to unlock or permaban."
4/7/2009,"i know what your saying in heart, but i cant support what your proposing"
4/7/2009,"as much as i agree that jita local needs a good cleansing (i'm still pushing my supernova idea), i'd be hard pressed to support this, for a lot of the same reasons that herschel illustrates in his own post."
4/7/2009,"i say make a new class for there ""rebalanced"" bomber"
4/7/2009,change it so supercaps have a sensor strength of 9001.
4/7/2009,"just my two cents on the matter; if you think about it, the opportunity for hi-sec pirates and griefers to go after mission runners is already there, they just need to steal from the mission wrecks like they steal from the miners and wait for the desired response. as for the impact of salvage aggro on the market, since the salvage is sold at the end anyway, the only difference is who gets paid for it, either way the some kind of salvage is going to be sold. most guys doing this are smart enough to not pick a fight if there's several ships in a mission, they aren't going to risk losing a ship over some contaminated nantite. a more balanced idea would be making it more difficult to track ships in deadspace zones. to me there is a difference between salvaging a wreck in open space (near a gate, asteroid belt, or station) and scanning down a guy to rob him in the middle of a mission.thank you."

4/7/2009,"how about a local comms scrambler? which would allow a 5 minute window where you dont appear in local, giving time to scan/probe out your target (not sure how the mechanics would cope with a module that gets deployed before you jump in, unless it would need an alt or gang member in sytem to do it). maybe balanced out by your (or your gangs) location appearing as an icon in space when the timer expires, so you have to get out or fight, or even it could mean getting stuck for 1 minute like what happens in a cyno. skill level could determie amount of time you can scramble local and reduce amount of time you get stuck.voting for you just cos it will make thing interesting if you get in.rev"

4/7/2009,"you have my vote.here's my suggestionintroduce a npc that (for the right price) will hack a corporation's or alliance's friend or foe indicator by changing their respective standing towards your corp. these changes will last up to 24 hours or until the victim changes their standings manually. the modification to the standings will fool pos defenses, stations (and some of its services), and potentially give you the jump on your enemies.feel free to use that idea, but i expect a cushy cabinet position in your administration."
4/7/2009,"why do you say fracture? and i hope that my ""voter"" isn't only considering what happens and who talks on c&p as the only source for constructive arguments about many many ideas. the idea behind my candidacy is to represent not ""pirates"" or ""c&p"" or ""anti-pirates"" or ""carebears"" but to focus my efforts to make pvp better for everyone."
4/7/2009,"i would say that istvaan in no way represents pvpers. to my understanding the vast majority of pvp is alliance/fw level, wether it be small gangs or multiple fleet engagements the likes of which where seen during the max campaign and the 2 assaults on delve (dine in nol and all that) what the likes of istvaan represent are pirates/griefers etc, which afaik are a small proportion of the pvp community. i also doubt very much that istvaan is in any way serious about applying to the csm.and ultimately, i would still disagree on the definition thing. not only is it infact necessary (as i said, you cannot have a political bloc without definition, even the politically apathetic can be defined as not giving a damn) but its an innate mode of human understanding. we define and limit and construct opinions almost before we consider the object of that definition.and as a complete aside, i would think a voice of reason party would, in honesty, be looking to create a mediated political organisation, representing all different views as equally as possible, but that would be horrifyingly democratic, so i wont go there"

4/7/2009,"no kuzim's have taken the presidential oath. the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. yet, every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. at these moments, eve has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the pod pilots have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers, and true to our founding documents.so it has been. so it must be with this generation of citizens.that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. our universe is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare eve for a new age. regions have been lost; pets shed; alliances shuttered. tech ii is too costly; our clones fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use veldspar strengthen our adversaries and threaten our solar systems.i ask you, kuzim blaky'all, what can you do to fix these problems?"

4/8/2009,needs another bump.
4/8/2009,"ccp mentioned a year or so ago that they plan to redistribute agents and add more at some point. with that in mind there are a few factions that could use some improvements.agent problemsmordus legion- only has agents in one system in 0.0 pure blind- suggestion: put some in placid, after all the caldari occupied intaki and pure blind is next door- should be the safety-net for amarr/caldari faction as the standing profile has a lot in common with soesisters of eve- general lack of highsec agents (only 2x l3, and 3x l4, half of them in solitude and/or with lowsec around them)interbus- still needs storyline agentsociety of concious thought- no agents at alljove empire- only one storyline agentore- general lack of agents (3x l3, 2x l4)level 5 agents- most of the factions don't have them, the larger pirate factions really should.standing problemsthukker tribe- liked by two factions- hated by 13 factionsblood raiders / sansha / guristas- unable to recover standingpirate factions / concord- pirate factions lower concord faction standing- inability to raise concord faction standinggeneral- wishes for an amarr/gallente and minmatar/caldari (thukker?) aligned factiongoals- encourage players to spread out more- improve roleplaying opportunities- improve standing recovery options- more interest in the non-empire factions"
4/8/2009,"as this is a wish list, add:better balanced high sec/high quality agents between the factions.one of the reason why most of the mission runners play in caldari space is that the largest concentration of high level kill mission agents present in space is of the caldari faction.similarly the number of level 4 kill mission agents present in high sec members of the caldari faction is larger that the sum of high sec level 4 kill missions agents of minatar and gallente."
4/8/2009,"caldari also have the benefit of a l5 agent next to two high-sec systems, guess where 90% of the l5 missionrunning happens."
4/8/2009,"it's fine. soe have some valuable, unique lp store items. it's one of the few incentives to mission in lowsec.they don't want people getting standing with all factions at once."
4/8/2009,"i wouldn't mind low quality agents. and non-pirate low-sec/0.0 missioning in general could be somewhat better.actually that's not the reason. ccp has already sorta agreed to add an interbus station, it just needs to be implemented, that's why it's on the list.and with the extremely low caps (+0.25 with amarr) it's not like people will get any significant faction standing. it's more of a last resort standing recovery safety net, as using it for getting empire standing is extremely slow.there are far better alternatives if you want to get high standing with everyone. just look at mine, i'm positive with everyone except minmatar, and even that is being fixed as we speak. i certainly wouldn't use interbus for that reason."
4/8/2009,somewhat? you think that people who risk expensive ships should only get somewhat better rewards? no. lowsec rewards should outstrip hisec rewards by a largemargin.
4/8/2009,running for the pirate factions can earn 60-80m an hour i'm told. not too shabby.
4/8/2009,ignoring the fact that that's still not nearly enough relative to hisec; there are no pirate factions in lowsec.

4/8/2009,"totally agree with this, missiles in pvp combat are now useless."
4/8/2009,"this was a topic that generated considerable support, especially in the rp community. it was discussed with ccp on several occasions, and ccp's response was that alliances would be allowed into fw in some form (probably by allowing individual corps to join fw without leaving their alliance) and that this issue would be addressed in the first quarter of 2009.it's now april ... and assuming i've not missed an anouncement somewhere, ccp seems to have entirely forgotten this issue. and as near as i can tell, so has the csm. this is incredibly disappointing to those of us who actually care about the backstory of eve and are interested in the rp potential of the mmorpg.don't let this issue die."
4/8/2009,"i haven't forgotten.but it's ccp that said: ""it's the first thing we put in empyrean age 1.1!""""err sorry not 1.1, well later this year okay!""""yes we'll patch it into quantum rise""""we got the game mechanics sorted, won't be long, january 2009 it'll be in!""""right we're busy with apocrypha, but please wait a little longer, q1 2009, promise!""i personally asked them about this in iceland, and they were like ""uhhh **** yes we still have to do that too, but we really have more important things to do and don't care about it.""then again i don't see why you guys want to join fw in the deplorable state it is in, but meh.edit: with q1 2009 expired, i've raised this issue for the third time."
4/8/2009,"moved to "" assembly hall ""."
4/8/2009,"because they're rpers.meh, supporting just because ccp said they would and it doesn't matter to me."
4/8/2009,yes yes yes yes yes yes yesyes.
4/8/2009,"i agree here. maybe it wouldn't have been a good idea to let alliances in at the beginning, when we had like double the numbers in militias compared to today (8k in the caldari militia at one point for example). in a time where our militia was having 150 man fleets on a daily basis the whole region was sufficiently populated, there were enough targets and fights at any given time during the day.today the activity is only a fraction of that, an increase in participants would benefit everyone. i don't see a reason anymore to deny alliances entering this role-playing aspect of eve. they can't use their titans doomsdays to erase militia fleets, nor are capital fleets particularly suitable for plexing or dynamic low-sec fights. as they are role-players, this could have a positive effect on the plexing instead, since capturing systems determines who wins the war in the region, we'd have some more legitimate plexing wars going on (compared to only pvp and the attitude that plexing doesn't mean anything when non-role-players dominate the scene)."
4/8/2009,"i disagree with the adding alliances to fw idea. all i can ever see is super alliances just coming in and steamrolling everyone for lols. also, we don't need another place for these alliances to have their warzones. the lag is bad enough... lets face it, fw is supposed to be the stepping stone before going into 0.0. it shouldn't be the other way. no support. --isaac"
4/8/2009,"ccp plans to add a pretty hefty standing requirement to entry, thus just steamrolling over things for lolz wouldn't be easy. this feature would be mostly intended for roleplaying alliances (cva, ushra'khan, etc)."
4/8/2009,if this is the case then thumbs up.
4/8/2009,"well, as long as ccp wants this to be a vote, then i'll add my vote in favor.as to the questions raised above, if the goons wanted to mess with fw, they could do so at any time, with or without this change. and while i can't think of any other ""mega-alliances"" that would care, this goes for them, too.the alliances that might care include, for example, ushra'khan, em, vv, cva and other like us. we want to participate in fw not because the mechanics are great (they aren't, and dramatically so) but because we enjoy the rp of eve, and have involved ourselves in the faction war (lower-cased) since before faction war was even thought of by the devs. and despite the fact that the largest proponents of the faction war concept were these same rp alliances, ccp in their wisdom locked us out of fw, thus making a mechanic that had a great deal of potential into little more than a means for legitimizing piracy. oh, and a new sort of complex that nobody cares about except for the handful of diehard rpers who left alliances to pursue our rp war.i realize that fw has a great many weaknesses, and i wish i believed that ccp was motivated to work on improving it. even so, it's unreasonable to lock rpers out of the mechanics designed to reflect the rp war."
4/8/2009,i would love to see this being possible for those alliances who have a long history of supporting one empire or the other to be able to show their support in this way.
4/8/2009,"continuing to support this very important topic. the arguments have been made, the suggestions have been raised to ccp in csm 1 - ccp have accepted the principle and promised to implement this for faction warfare. it was also highlighted as something that is vital for the continued health and growth of the faction warfare concept at fanfest round tables last november. this is no longer a question of debating the principle - its about asking ccp to do what they have the technical capability of implementing right now. we were told at fanfest that the technical fix is ready to go and just requires a simple implementation to rollout. lets make it so."
4/8/2009,"sure, while i think the organizational options (character, corp, alliance) should be looked at and depth added (fx character, corp, megacorp, alliance/faction, coalition), allowing the player alliances that have been fighting faction based wars since their forming to take part in the part of the game designed for it just makes sense."
4/8/2009,"i think the whole ""clone sp-loss"" concept is outdated.it never really worked and it doesn't work any more at all.it is obvious what the intention of the clone system was. however, the older eve becomes, the more it turns into a total gerontocracy. this is part due to the training times of the highend skills and the almost non existing risk of losing them. if a player is careful, he will never ever lose a single skillpoint to this. there is also no real choice in it, as there is nothing to be gained by not having an up-to-date clone. the amounts of money involved are of no significance, compared to the amounts we constantly lose in the form of ships and implants. those with so many skillpoints that it would really affect them financially would have to be totally incompetent if they had any trouble at all to raise that trivial amount of money.the whole clone level concept could be dismissed completely and nothing would really be lost to the game.in fact, i can think of more things that could be gained. players that don't get frustrated due to an outdated and disfunctional game mechanism, for example.thus any mechanism that compensates for this shortcoming is something i'd welcome. if this useless mechanism remains out of misplaced feeling of tradition, any improvement to it would be a gain."
4/8/2009,not supported if you forget to update your clone and get poded its your own dam fault
4/8/2009,"why not have them offer a ""clone subscription""?if you know you're going to die a lot in the next two weeks, pay a fee up front, and you'll get a new clone(at full cost, of course) every time you die - within a time limit.choice is still there, as well as an additional isk sink, and those who want to automate the clone process can do so."
4/8/2009,"there also doesn't seem to be any real reason why i am limited to 1 clone. why can't i just buy 2? or 5? or a dozen? or hundreds if i like?background wise, the clone is just the container. all my ""skills"" and memories and so on are transfered the moment i actually die. just one clone has to be hooked up to the system all the time, but there is no reason why i should not have the spare clone in the shelf right next to it."
4/8/2009,now this makes good sense.
4/8/2009,i think thats intentional.
4/8/2009,agreed.
4/8/2009,"one of my mates lives in a flat with a window all the length of the living room, my living room has 2 smaller windows but the room is the same size.maybe the merlin is fitted out for a more ""open plan"" flight deck space with nice shelves from ikea.not supported sorry, lots of more important stuff to fix.zos"

4/8/2009,"it's time they started putting some real effort into fixing all the odd errors they seem to hang around forever in eve. sure it's graphical, and doesn't ahve to do with game play, but at the same time i spent good money on hardware and want my pretty lights."
4/8/2009,"hahaha... im serious thoughidea:i think it would be cool if you where able to cusomize the color of your ship, draw on it! and/or have the corp/alliance logo on it.basicly just make my ship not look like everyone elses :p"
4/8/2009,"i can go with corp and/or allaince logo's but hell no to custom paint jobs!!!i dont want to see a bunch of neon green trimmed, checkboard with alternating nipple pink and powder baby blue squares ships.besides it would just be more data the server would have to send to the client each time you load a grid. imagine how much laggier busy systems and fleet battles will become then.tl;dr = no"
4/8/2009,would be cool if you can paint ur titan as a shark to scare ppl (a titan scares ppl anyway)supported
4/8/2009,"maybe not actual custom paint jobs, but changing colours would be nice also stops the 'lol lag' whiners as the server just needs to send 'colour1 = #000000' etc. also, if your pc fails that hard, just add an option that lets you disable it on your client."
4/8/2009,"there is no reason you couldn't offer a small selection of colors, emblems, and a small area for logos. warhammer does this to great fanfare. honestly, if it's from a small selection of colors, it wouldn't add anything to server load, and it would add a greater feeling of customization to ship building. the paintjobs themselves could also offer a small isk sink.but no matter, thats not whats being proposed here, and so i won't support."
4/8/2009,"having a preset range of colors, yes.applying corp or alliance logo, yes.freeform customization, i.e. pink and yellow ravens, no."
4/8/2009,"i would definatley support applying the corp (and/or alliance) logo to the ship.i might even go so far as to support something like homeworld, where you have a main color and a trim color that can be set independently from a fixed selection of colors (black with black trim for that 'stealth' look).but fully customizeble paint schemes - no, sorry. i just can't take any ship that looks like an explosion at a crayon factory seriously."
4/8/2009,"this is what i was talking about. games like homeworld or warhammer let you choose from base colors, you can't go ipaint on the hull or anything.this would be acceptable, and the lack of randomization would make it easy to program."
4/8/2009,no. since the game designers were too lazy to create more models for the t2 ships this painting would eliminate the visual appearande of t2 shipas at all.
4/8/2009,of course 0.0 carebears and blobers wont suport this idea
4/8/2009,"they get get rid of local as soon as poses in sov holding systems can track enemies. i.e. if you own the space you can actively see who is in your space(like current local), if not you have to probe or scout the old fashioned way."
4/8/2009,"that skews the balance too much in favor of defenders and mega alliances - they already have a lot of advantages. the local nerf should primarily benefit the small guy.it does make sense to let pos modules that improve intel, but it shouldn't be just like current local. and those pos modules shouldn't be hiding in pos shields"
4/8/2009,"i think we all should have to scout the old fashioned way. if a mega alliance can't field one dedicated scout/watchmen per system, then you fools deserve to lose them.end of story."
4/8/2009,"im not sure if this has been brought up already i havent browesed this forum often.idea: only cov ops, recons, and black ops can fit a modual that can detect cloaked ships with in 100k distance or so.like when activated it brings up an infrared box overlay that can see the ships heat output that is cloaked.and thats it. it cannot lock on to the ship it can only see it."
4/8/2009,"not a terrible suggestion, but still. every fleet would have one of these, making cloaked scouts much less useful. not supported."

4/8/2009,"okay rather short idea but why not.it would be nice if there was some pirate npc demand for illicit goods (drugs, slaves, ectoplasm, toxic waste, etc) in the empire space where they are outlawed, either through some semi-random missions or repeatable cosmos like structures. succesful completion could eventually translate in a standing gain, thus giving players the opportunity to repair pirate standings.it would be nice if exposing contraband with a cargo-scanner would allow players to shoot the smugglers, even in highsec."
4/8/2009,"i`m going to add a random brainfart here... maybe there should be a way of people preventing hot-drops.. i`m thinking some kind of cyno-field disruption device,chance based and with severe penalties. perhapse- can only be used on heavy interdictors 30 second cylce time, cannot be re-used for 5 minutes,removes all capacator power for said 30 seconds. very short range.. say 1500m, prevents all movement and uses ozone like a cyno field. possibly blooms sig by 500% or such like a mwd would. and as i said has a chance of jamming a cyno. maybe should also have very high fitting costs so as to gimp youre tank also. basicly it would alow a last ditch,near suicidal attempt to prevent cap drops temporarily at least..... thoughts please?? even whine threads can be food for thought i guess..."

4/8/2009,"if you want to check out if you've encountered certain people/corps/alliances before you'll have to manually search the whole combat log (which doesn't update all the info first time you open the page either). why not have a simple search function so you can check on name, corp, alliance or whatever you want.sure you could post all km's on a killboard and search there but this shouldn't be neccesary. i'm proposing a (simple) search function, doesn't have to be fancy in any way, as long as it does it's job."

4/8/2009,maybe the share fluctuations could be based on fw happenings?
4/8/2009,"that's an interesting thought. in fw news there is an announcement related to this: colonists flock to war-torn sectorreported by: isd aberlaine tepis | 2009.04.03 18:13:59saisio - amid still-raging hostilies between militia forces, caldari interests are looking forward to harvesting the riches of the black rise region. kaalakiota, lai dai and other mega-corporations within the state announced large-scale projects last week, followed by equally determined independent ventures. so if we secure the space, help our corporations to settle down, they might reward us with stocks - or at least their stock price could rise. apart from that militia corporation stocks and their profits could rise, the more systems are occupied by the militia. only problem i see here is that the opposite faction could buy those stock and then lose on purpose, in order to make a profit, like in those boxing movies."
4/8/2009,"i can speak to the buying out of shares, the way many corps in the real world do it is they have reserve shares or shares that are worth more voting rights than others (different classes). hence, they never make more that 50% control available for buying.in this case, an npc corp could make 49% of the shares open for purchase and retain 51%. accordingly, somebody could become a major investor, but actual control would never be lost."

4/8/2009,"if every 0.0 region is worth (made up figure) 100bn a month, it doesn't really matter whether that value is from ratting or moon minerals or mining or whatever. it still removes an incentive to compete for a particular region.the current war in delve and querious is a good example - nobody in their right mind would simply abandon all the regions that goonswarm previously occupied in the south east in order to occupy delve, let alone drop geminate and scalding pass as we did last year, if every region had the same value. the fact that delve is one of the crown jewels of 0.0 and worth as much as 4 or 5 other regions combined is one of the major catalysts behind that conflict, and for that matter having that wealth concentrated into a small area is probably the key reason why bob was a major power in the last 3 years or so."
4/8/2009,"i'll have to disagree. this war is because of bob, not because of ""delve"" being ""superior"".i am not saying that every region should be worth the same, but every 0.0 region should be better than anything in empire space at least. diverity and uniqeness should be applied to all the regions. just random idea out of my arse; different agent missions in each region, more agents, more difference in ore, larger difference in moon materials, larger difference in system looks, larger difference in complexes, etc. etc. a lot could be done to make each and every region in eve truly unique and better than empire space.for example, take a high security agent starsystem. it can host and support hundreds of players doing lvl4 agents making isk. most 0.0 regions can not host and support hundreds of players making isk."
4/8/2009,a man for the real working classyou sir have my vote.
4/8/2009,"i really like this idea, one viable way to do this would be to allow ships to carry more pods or pilots internally. cruiser 2 bc 3 bs 4 and so forth. but anyhow yeh the idea of using corpses as a raw material is a good one. only problem is it's quite easy to create corpses, perhaps the materials gained from a corpse could be based on the sp and the cost of implants installed."
4/8/2009,i like that. it gives extra incentive to find out who's wearing what implants. killing vets would thus become more profitable than killing useless alts and newbies.

4/8/2009,"let's please keep this on track, i am not here to hijack this thread and i don't intend on helping anyone else do so either.the bottom line is issler represents a point of view which many people appreciate. she opened up this thread to suggestions and discussions. attacking her for not defining specifics at this point seems counter productive to her own currently defined goals of open discussion."
4/8/2009,"yes there is, grab a few friends in smartbombing bs and go and disco them. you still have the tools at your disposal. ccp made things harder for the 'casual' ganker but if you're determined then you can deal with it.*edit* i will add that without these brave legions of chinamen (and southern cross alliance members) we would probably see a spike in the cost of pos and cap fuel, which may or may not be a good thing. currently ice mining is not worth it for 'real' people, and if you eliminate macros/farmers then there might not be the slack in the production chain to keep supply going at even a reasonable level for some time. like it or not, a lot of us don't like these farmers but right now we probably need them. i would say the bigger threat to the economy is the mass number of farmer ravens in mission hubs throughout new eden."
4/8/2009,"i'm a bit meh about this proposal. although i do probably around 80% of my fighting on gates, taking sentries, i still believe that you shouldn't be able to engage with small ships in order to give the little guy or the wily player a chance to get away. by all means scale down the dps for sub 0.4 systems but by no means should it be scaled up."
4/8/2009,"council of stellar managementmeeting minutesdownload: minutes | logsunday 5th april 2009present: ankhesentepemkah, darius johnson, issler dainze, lavista vista, omber zombie, tusko hopkins, vuk lau, meissa anunthiel, extreme, sophie dagneau, ccp xhagen, gm grimmiapologies: bunyipabsent: pattern clarcdiscussion1. discussion with ccp regarding name change policyin raw text from [ 2009.04.05 16:12:28 ]gm grimmi wanted to discuss the ccp naming policy with csm.gm grimmi started by explaining that they wanted a system that wasnt too rigid so they could help anyone as needed, but be consistent in their application of the rules. they have recently been considering a new way of doing this and are looking at the possibility of allowing organizations to change their names for isk, limited to once a year (an example).lavista was vehemently against this idea.vuk couldnt understand why the gms changed kenzokus name and was totally against changing names for isk or real money.ankhe thought bob should get their name back as organizations should have the name they desire especially if they had historical rights to it, however changing the name months after and then changing it back was stupid. she thought that the ability to change names would be a good thing as people should be able to call themselves whatever they like.tusko did not like the idea of allowing people to change their names, eve is single universe and identity is a very important aspect of the game. should ccp implement this type of system, it would be very important to let players easily access the name history of the entity.issler wanted it noted that ccp needs to realize that any action taken with bob that is slightly different than normal is doomed from the start. as for name changes she felt that there needs to be a mechanism, as she knows of some cases where players have started eve, picked a stupid name, liked the game but due to the investment in skill training time they would be stuck with that character name and quit. she also didnt see how bob had a right to claim a name they lost to a legitimate game mechanic.omber asked for people to discuss the issue, not bob, and on the issue of changing names, he thought there should be a hard policy, no renaming unless the name violates the rules or is asked for within the first week of creation.extreme had nothing against a name change mechanic, but would like the addition of a naming history and for the fee to do so to be high, and even higher if done again.darius did not have any feelings either way about name change mechanics; if it was operationalized then it would be set in stone and applied evenly across the board. in response to issler, ccp should not take into account peoples perceptions of bob as individuals, they deserve the same treatment as everyone else playing the game and it only becomes an issue when there is an appearance of special treatment.gm grimmi thought that a system for name changes would have to keep records of prior names.meissa thought that character names were more of an issue than the names of organizations, you can recreate a corp you cannot recreate a character. tha said, hes happy with renaming organizations for a fee.vuk still didnt see why it should possible to change your name. no-one was forced to take those names at creation; it was their choice so they should live with it. if you want another name, start over. he also wanted to know who made the decision to rename bobr.continued next post"
4/8/2009,"lavista wanted it noted that just because ccp burnt their fingers on the recent issue, it doesnt justify the need to change something as fundamental as what ccp is suggesting. to him it is clear that this is a move to compensate for a mistake that was made, nobody asked for it and it is a bad idea.omber was worried that with the ability to change names, exploiting names could be possible.ccp xhagen wanted to bring the discussion back to discussing the internal exception that was sent to csm to look at. he wanted to know if that rule was considered fair.the internal rule:""we have had an unofficial rule that we will change names less than a week old, since quite many players come out of the character/corporation/alliance creation process with a misspelled name. ""secondly, regarding the possibility of a renaming feature, this discussion was to see what the reaction to it would be, there has been no technical feasibility tests done. if the csm thought it was a good thing, they can move on to seeing if it is possible.tusko was worried about the reputation side of things, people keep name and shame type lists and he is afraid that if people or organizations can change their names at will it will be extremely difficult to track. he would only allow name changes for very new entities, maybe in the first week or so but not later on. maybe also the possibility of allowing changes to people that have lost names due to policies.issler didnt think there should be a time limit or other criteria. something tied to a fee makes more sense. a good idea for a name today could be something horrible in the future. as an idea, why not do it in way similar to the real world where there is a public notice about it.omber thought that if the internal rule was made an official rule he would be happy with the naming policy as is.vuk wanted grimmi to answer his question about who was responsible for the name change.ankhe echoed vuks request and also noted that having name changes available for everyone. an example given was traded characters.gm grimmi answered that the change was debated for a long time and was then decided by the lead gm as well as many others. it was not a unanimous decision.issler wanted to know why ccp still didnt understand that they cant just do things like this involving bob. the csm exists largely to keep things like that happening.tusko wanted to know that if they a consensus among the gms why they backed off so easily.ankhe answered issler that bob doesnt deserve special treatment in a negative way either. she also noted that the backflip was the most damaging aspect of this and wanted to know why it happened.extreme wanted to stress that the policy should be kept simple or people wouldnt understand it.omber wanted to know what the basis was for changing the name in the first place as it seemed to go against both the public and internal naming policy.gm grimmi responded that three really wasnt much more to say than what was said on the forums, it was a human error that proves once again that assumption is the mother of all f***ups.omber wanted it to be made clear that the gms as a group decided that they should ignore their naming policy and then thought there would be no backlash.continued next post"
4/8/2009,"a small off topic discussion followed about what is and isnt game mechanics.ccp xhagen noted that what they were trying to say is that a mistake was made with the renaming, a mistake that was corrected for better or worse. he felt that from the discussion that the naming policy is good, following it is now the important part. he also thinks that csm could forsee a name changing mechanism within eve, however it would always keep a public record of those changes. he wanted to know if ccp should move forward in assessing whether it was technically possible to do this.the csm generally agreed to ccp seeing if it was technically possible.and because ccp xhagen asked (and hes scary)this is a check of technicality. nothing has been decided about actually implementing anything2. right click - repair"
4/8/2009,"other business1. from now on, csm will be using the evelopedia to store issue documents and meeting minutes. omber will be mailing out instructions on how to do that during the week.2. issler pointed out that the new player guide csm link only shows the 1st csm. vuks name is also spelled incorrectly. ccp xhagen will be notified about the errors.3. omber pointed out that technically neither of the issues vuk raised should have been discussed due to them not being raised by the wednesday prior to the meeting. this breach of protocol wont happen again.4. due to a lack of time in vuks busy schedule, omber zombie is now going to create and maintain agenda threads on the forums instead of vuk.meeting end."
4/8/2009,ask oppenheimer how he felt about exploring the technicality of a thing. essentially this idea would devastate part of what makes eve online unique. that being identity in a single server environment.i am hawkblade. i am not hawkblade (server#8) or hawkblade (server#42). i am not sometimes hawkblade but also known as honestscammerguy1205 nor am i anything but the toon known as hawkblade.eve has enough troubles with alt neurosis and the rampant paranoia that has spread from it. is it not enough already?i could be coy but i'm not going to be: this is a very very bad (and clueless) idea. dumb even.ps: i'm actually shar tegral. add that to the confusion of the matter and you'll start to get an idea of how bad this further destruction of identity may damage eve online.
4/8/2009,"regarding the name changei support being able to change names 100% but so would you if you had my name. i honestly selected this name in an attempt to mock the person who suggested i start playing the game. and then i got hooked. now i am stuck with this ridiculous name.i would gladly pay into an isk faucet (or even $us) to be able to change my name. i'm not trying to obfuscate anything, and support an identy tracking system, but this shame is a heavy burden to bear."
4/8/2009,"this was a topic that generated considerable support, especially in the rp community. it was discussed with ccp on several occasions, and ccp's response was that alliances would be allowed into fw in some form (probably by allowing individual corps to join fw without leaving their alliance) and that this issue would be addressed in the first quarter of 2009.it's now april ... and assuming i've not missed an anouncement somewhere, ccp seems to have entirely forgotten this issue. and as near as i can tell, so has the csm. this is incredibly disappointing to those of us who actually care about the backstory of eve and are interested in the rp potential of the mmorpg.don't let this issue die."
4/8/2009,"i haven't forgotten.but it's ccp that said: ""it's the first thing we put in empyrean age 1.1!""""err sorry not 1.1, well later this year okay!""""yes we'll patch it into quantum rise""""we got the game mechanics sorted, won't be long, january 2009 it'll be in!""""right we're busy with apocrypha, but please wait a little longer, q1 2009, promise!""i personally asked them about this in iceland, and they were like ""uhhh **** yes we still have to do that too, but we really have more important things to do and don't care about it.""then again i don't see why you guys want to join fw in the deplorable state it is in, but meh.edit: with q1 2009 expired, i've raised this issue for the third time."
4/8/2009,"moved to "" assembly hall ""."
4/8/2009,"because they're rpers.meh, supporting just because ccp said they would and it doesn't matter to me."
4/8/2009,yes yes yes yes yes yes yesyes.
4/8/2009,"i agree here. maybe it wouldn't have been a good idea to let alliances in at the beginning, when we had like double the numbers in militias compared to today (8k in the caldari militia at one point for example). in a time where our militia was having 150 man fleets on a daily basis the whole region was sufficiently populated, there were enough targets and fights at any given time during the day.today the activity is only a fraction of that, an increase in participants would benefit everyone. i don't see a reason anymore to deny alliances entering this role-playing aspect of eve. they can't use their titans doomsdays to erase militia fleets, nor are capital fleets particularly suitable for plexing or dynamic low-sec fights. as they are role-players, this could have a positive effect on the plexing instead, since capturing systems determines who wins the war in the region, we'd have some more legitimate plexing wars going on (compared to only pvp and the attitude that plexing doesn't mean anything when non-role-players dominate the scene)."
4/8/2009,"i disagree with the adding alliances to fw idea. all i can ever see is super alliances just coming in and steamrolling everyone for lols. also, we don't need another place for these alliances to have their warzones. the lag is bad enough... lets face it, fw is supposed to be the stepping stone before going into 0.0. it shouldn't be the other way. no support. --isaac"
4/8/2009,"ccp plans to add a pretty hefty standing requirement to entry, thus just steamrolling over things for lolz wouldn't be easy. this feature would be mostly intended for roleplaying alliances (cva, ushra'khan, etc)."
4/8/2009,if this is the case then thumbs up.
4/8/2009,"well, as long as ccp wants this to be a vote, then i'll add my vote in favor.as to the questions raised above, if the goons wanted to mess with fw, they could do so at any time, with or without this change. and while i can't think of any other ""mega-alliances"" that would care, this goes for them, too.the alliances that might care include, for example, ushra'khan, em, vv, cva and other like us. we want to participate in fw not because the mechanics are great (they aren't, and dramatically so) but because we enjoy the rp of eve, and have involved ourselves in the faction war (lower-cased) since before faction war was even thought of by the devs. and despite the fact that the largest proponents of the faction war concept were these same rp alliances, ccp in their wisdom locked us out of fw, thus making a mechanic that had a great deal of potential into little more than a means for legitimizing piracy. oh, and a new sort of complex that nobody cares about except for the handful of diehard rpers who left alliances to pursue our rp war.i realize that fw has a great many weaknesses, and i wish i believed that ccp was motivated to work on improving it. even so, it's unreasonable to lock rpers out of the mechanics designed to reflect the rp war."
4/8/2009,i would love to see this being possible for those alliances who have a long history of supporting one empire or the other to be able to show their support in this way.
4/8/2009,"continuing to support this very important topic. the arguments have been made, the suggestions have been raised to ccp in csm 1 - ccp have accepted the principle and promised to implement this for faction warfare. it was also highlighted as something that is vital for the continued health and growth of the faction warfare concept at fanfest round tables last november. this is no longer a question of debating the principle - its about asking ccp to do what they have the technical capability of implementing right now. we were told at fanfest that the technical fix is ready to go and just requires a simple implementation to rollout. lets make it so."
4/8/2009,"sure, while i think the organizational options (character, corp, alliance) should be looked at and depth added (fx character, corp, megacorp, alliance/faction, coalition), allowing the player alliances that have been fighting faction based wars since their forming to take part in the part of the game designed for it just makes sense."

4/9/2009,supported
4/9/2009,"i am definitely for the idea, even if i think that some of the details need to be ironed out. as with the raising concord standings, they used to have agents a long time ago, but to many pirates would standings back up quickly with concord. the other thing i would like to see is a greater distribution of 0.0 agents throughout their own faction.also, right now the jove like both minmatar and caldari while disliking amarr/gallente, so if they were to get a storyline agent it would kill two birds with one stone."

4/9/2009,"ankhe, while the minutes still haven't been released (where the f**k are they xhagen), you brought this issue up with ccp in the last meting and they told you it was still in the list of things to do. what part of raising this issue again (for the 3rd time) do you think you are going to accomplish? ccp know about this, it's on their list, and you are wasting both their time and ours bringing this issue up again.sorry if that sounds a little harsh, but as we have a limited amount of time in the next meeting, i'd rather spend it on issues that they don't already know about."
4/9/2009,"could make fw more lively, lets see."
4/9/2009,this topic has my support.
4/9/2009,supporting this once more.
4/9/2009,"if its as simple as ""hey guys you promised to do this last time and we were told the technical fix was already designed and just needed to be implemented - well how about implementing it already."" then its not going to ""waste"" much of anyone's time. how about you schedule this issue on the agenda as a request for a status update and timescale commitment. now apocrypha is out of the way and released it must be time for this essential change to make it into coming soon patch.well delivery of promises is important too you know. i'd count it a personal favour from you omber if you can make sure this issue doesn't get forgotten about and ccp keep getting reminded to implement this every meeting up to the point it gets done.sometimes you have to push"
4/9/2009,"exactly what jade said.it wouldn't take more than a minute of ccps precious time if they just gave us a status update. the last one we got was in januari, and the new meeting is scheduled for may - that's four months later. if we're lucky it will already have been implemented before the meeting, if not, well, then we'd better remind them."
4/9/2009,supporting an important topic.
4/9/2009,"i'm not on the csm, and have no great insight into it's inner workings. however it's nearing a year since fw was implemented, and i think about a half year since ccp said that they would address it early 2009. the rp community has been actively agitating for this for closer to a year and a half, ever since we were asked to playtest the early prototype ... before we were told we'd be locked out of the final version, of course. and really, even longer than that, since fw as a high-level concept has been floated for a number of years, and the rp community has been pushing the concept since before ccp began laying plans.so at the risk of sounding harsh, i think we have a right to be just a bit impatient -- and given that ccp has given every sign that they are trying very hard to forget about this issue, i don't see why the minute spent asking for an updated eta would be a 'waste of time'."
4/9/2009,"you say issue like its a problem. there is a very specific reason why alliance are not allowed to join faction warfare. that would be like an alliance within an alliance. all it would take is one 0.0 power block to join and the opposite faction has no hope of ever winning anymore. the whole idea of faction warfare was to bring pvp to the empire based players who want to ease into pvp. allowing alliance to join faction warfare would break that aspect of the game completely.one of the worst suggestions ever brought forward.voting a giant hell no!!!if you really wanted to get involved then join one giant corp, i believe they can hold over two thousand members, so stop being lazy if its something you really want to do."
4/9/2009,"spoken as someone who's thought very little on the subject, nor read any of the many threads that were posted and that had already decided this 'issue'.tell me, what do you believe would motivate your hypothetical 0.0 power block to abandon their holdings to chase complexes in fw space? i'll answer for you: nothing at all. if the goons, for example, wanted to hot drop a capital fleet in to blast noobs in t1 frigates ... well, what's stopping them as is? nothing at all. what advantage to joining fw would push them into forcing their entire membership to run missions for months just to get the standings required to do so? the vast untold wealth that is showered on every member of the militia? the stupendous fame enjoyed by being a part of the few, the proud, the militia? to my knowledge fw is hemorraging active players, which makes me wonder just how significant a draw it is...unless, of course, you give a flying excrement about the backstory of eve, as we rpers do. i understand that the concept of rp in an mmorpg is wildly unpopular with the gankbear crowd, but it's still an interest to a number of people, most of whom are in a relative handful of rp alliances. and all of whom were, in effect, told by ccp to dissolve their alliances or kiss off.oh, and anyone who thinks that the 'one giant corp' option is feasible has clearly never been in even a small alliance. suggest to the alliance formerly known as bob that they should reform into a single corp and see what sort of response you get."
4/9/2009,"yes. thank you.we should completely do away with the entire clone system. you see, it's antiquated and silly, and requires you to keep track of something that should be done automatically.all the keeping of clones does is hamper pilots who want to get back in the game anyway, so heres my solution. if you die in the game. you never ever revive. seriously. you have to start all over, make a whole new character. clones are freaking dumb anyway, and who wants to bother docking for 30 seconds and spending an incredibly insignificant sum to insure against the loss of skills you downloaded anyway?am i right? supported. screw clones.i'm off to go cry in a corner."
4/9/2009,not supported
4/9/2009,"i'd actually support this. it would certainly change the nature of pvp in subtle, yet significant ways."
4/9/2009,supported.i think the scaling should be fixed. and i think ships size should be made more obvious. it is annoying to me when people think the merlin window is a cockpit window meant for one. frigates can hold 25-100 people if i'm not mistaken. the only thing that are single person things are fighters. eve ships are big. and i wish they reflected that more.
4/9/2009,"supported. i had written a wall of text about why, but windows accadently the whole ting."
4/9/2009,"i'd be for this if instead of making things bigger ccp instead just made everything subcapital smaller. in my mind it makes more sense that one frigate would take up no space coming out of a station, but say a titan would be almost the same size. the other issue is if ccp remakes the size of everything then lots mission might need to be tweaked depending on how the ships are changed."
4/9/2009,"reviving this with the idea of bombers. not stealth bombers, not some long range fighter size drone but an actual bomber, flies to the target high alpha good for one shot before it has to redock with the ms(or at least orbit it to simulate reloading) and specializes in killing bs or larger. obviously the refresh time wouldnt be anything fantastic but the high alpha would make it significantly different from fighters."
4/9/2009,fully agree.

4/9/2009,"currently the only way to detect probes (combat) with the directional scanner is have the 'use overview settings' box unchecked, as there is no overview setting for probes.this wasn't a huge issue before the last patch as you could filter out most stuff (poses etc) by reducing the scan range. however the last patch added wrecks and containers. when running a exploration site or mission the directional scan now quickly gets swamped with wrecks and probes can easily be missed. currectly i'm popping anything i'm not interested in to avoid the clutter.so i'm suggesting a probe category be added to the overview settings so that we can filter out wrecks, containers, poses etc and still be able to tell if we are getting scanned down."
4/9/2009,"wrecks and containers have shown up on the directional scanner for a loooooong time. they were just missing when apocrypha went live, which was fixed. this is nothing new. it was new that they were missing for a week. doesn't change much about your request, of course."
4/9/2009,it is pretty stupid to wade through all the stuff on the directional scan when what interest you are only the probes. supported.

4/9/2009,more background that is not a colored nebula si good.
4/9/2009,i like
4/9/2009,good idea
4/9/2009,eeek! don't shoot my drugs mule!actually would make smuggling more interesting so i'm in favour of both parts of your idea. one problem with the cargo scanner idea though is standard practice for smuggling involves using a fast aligning ship like a frig and warping manually to 0 at every gate so you probably aren't going to get the time to lock and scan.
4/9/2009,sounds fun :d
4/9/2009,"dunno if this is a good idea or an epic fail but it just came to me one day. ive heard a little about the walking in stations thing and yer it might be pretty cool but another little idea which night work, i dunno, would be to walk around certain ships. certain being a new brand of transport ships which could be npc or player flyed. instead of warping massive distances sometimes to go and pick something up or setting on autopilot which is horrible anyways lol a new idea could be to have to pay a small fee to be taken aboard these new transport ships and taken to your destination. players could take on the idea as a way to make a little isk. like what you see in star wars where anakin is accompanying the queen back to naboo (if thats how you spell it? :p) and there sitting on the ships having a drink, maybe that kinda thing could be introduced as a way to furtur boost the walking around thing. and maybe say the ship is going through low sec, then the on board people have to get to escape pods or something and then are launced into their pods to make an escape? i dunno just a thought that might be worth posting :-)"
4/9/2009,"i doubt the gaim would gain anything valuable from that concept. i am sure it would cost a lot of developer time, though. that makes it a loss-loss deal.that is only about walking on ships.now what you suggest is more than that. you suggest more or less inhabited transports. who has any need or use for something like that? when was the last time that you've seen large clouds of pods flying from a to b, with the players complaining how it would be so much more fun if they could see their avatar during that time, instead of just the pod? never happens. people go from a to b with their ships and unless they are in a fleet, they will rarely agree on what a and b actually is. so this would have no use at all."
4/9/2009,"not sure if anyone has mentioned ""unanchoring drones"" yet?yes... they haven't been added. but they are in the database.and while there are a great many items on the database that aren't added to the game yet... take a look at your overview settings. there's actually a block to display unanchoring drones specifically."
4/9/2009,"supported for hacking of offline pos's. it should require hacking 5 though, and take a very long time (think about half an hour). maybe implement an 'advanced codebreaker' for hacking pos's, and make it have a 5 minute cycle time with about a 10% chance of success. once hacked the pos would then display an 'unanchor' option only to the person who hacked it, and this would take the normal time."
4/9/2009,wallhax!
4/9/2009,"if anything, an offline pos should not have its x million shield hit-points"
4/9/2009,i like this idea. one thumb up.
4/9/2009,"reason and purpose were given in the thread. if you do not see them, you have not read the thread and are just being contrary.if you disagree with them, you should contribute your opinion instead of doing what you did.a lot of things in the game exist as attempts to balance the players instead of the game itself. not allowing this, among other things, is ccp trying to herd the players instead of work on the game, thus, i support this."

4/9/2009,"update: voting link is upclick on me to vote for memy website is www.mazzilliu.comit has links to the campaign central forums, and everything else relevent____________who are you?hi, i'm running for csm. please vote for me. i'm a 0.0 player interested mostly in the pvp aspect of the game, specifically guerilla warfare and alliance combat and seeing that they both have a place in the game. i'm also a girl(vote for me). i'm not one for unnecessary words so i'll get straight to my platform:my platform-pos warfare. why does it make everyone want to quit eve? i will push for ways to make it more fun-minmatar. they have some of the worst ships in the dread, battleship, recon, carrier, etc classes. i want to fix this.-the system of nerfs and buffs. the way it has been in the recent year is that something becomes overpowered(range rigs, falcons, speed, etc), and it stays overpowered long enough for everyone to train for it, and once that happens ccp nerfs it. i'm sure a lot of you readers have wasted sp on your skill sheet you used to use until they got nerfed.-isk farmer issues. i don't like the current system that makes people who receive money vulnerable for years afterwards of losing that money again. dirty isk should not be usable as a weapon against legit players. we need account activity/behavior monitoring to detect isk farmers without the need for player reporting. especially with wormholes out now, the best and only way to detect farmers is to monitor activity and watch for activity patterns that would indicate someone is a farmer. if i go to iceland i will try to find out what ways they use to monitor isk farmers and improve on them.-(sort of a part of the isk farmer issue) macro haulers: a very simple way to end massive abuse of macroing hauler missions is to increase the resale value of the mission item to make it profitable to shoot macro haulers(and of course, increase collateral and moving the most profitable hauling missions to low-sec). currently the only people shooting macro haulers are killmail *****s and people who just hate macros. if profit were introduced to the equation player policing of the macro problem would effectively wipe out the most flagrant abuse of the system.-getting shot at/scrambled should cancel self destruct.-corporation roles, specifically director, needs to be re-worked so the ability to grant standings does not have to be tied with the ability to disband alliances.-whatever issue i see presented to the csm that i think is awesome-remove term limits for csm!eve experience:i've been playing for 3 years, and almost all of that has been spent in 0.0, doing pvp in groups sized from one to one thousand. i have experience doing 0.0 logistics, using capitals, eve intel and have done just about anything this game has to offer. i got in on the ground floor of pandemic legion and would like to think i helped cause some of its current success. i run a bunch of renters in fountain and have to deal with isk farmers on a semi-constant basis. i also perform diplomatic functions for pl when pl doesn't want to be diplomatic.real life:i'm a girl in real life, a real girl. if you vote for me i will post pics. i'm also not fat or ugly.campaign website: coming soon, may or may not include pics."

4/9/2009,"the war itself is because of bob, sure, but the 'delve gamble', goonswarm abandoning the south east completely to take delve for themselves, would be absurd if it wasn't for the fact that delve has the moon mineral worth and high quality ratting space of several regions combined. most likely, if delve was 'just another region', we'd have treated it much as we did geminate in the smash smash campaign - gone in, obliterated their capyards and towers, handed the region over to whoever wanted it and gone back home to feythabolis.plus, separating 'bob' and 'delve' as causes of the war is not so simple, delve's vastly superior wealth compared to most other regions is a big part of what made bob into the power they were in the first place. on this part, i pretty much agree, 0.0 should be the arena of high risk, high reward, and the fact that many of its regions are little better than highsec is something that should be fixed as soon as possible. my feelings are that the better way to approach this would be to reduce the value of highsec (by which i mostly mean l4s), but i'm sceptical that ccp is prepared to stand up to the storm of criticism this would attract from the legions of mission farmers."

4/9/2009,"hi, i decided noone spoke for 1 of the biggest group of us eve-players, so i will candidate and hopefully speak for us.1: we need more stuff to do when we are docked.what i mean is, seasoned shipspinners like me, need more stuff to do, or we leave the game. i<U+FFFD>m not intressting in walkin in station. need more exciting stuff, examples: more angels to look at the ship, paint the ship, feed our crew or just pick up an xbox360 and play pro evo 2009.2: better musicthe eve music is sheit, we need more hardrock music.3: the titan dd overkillthis is the only question regarded the game outside the station. doomsday in itself will not change, but here is 1 solution to fix multiple doomsday. if a titan get hitted by a doomsday it gets disabled like an emp-bomb. this makes dubbel or multiple dd on a grid impossible. this means only 1 titan can dd on the grid and have to warp out before next 1 can dd. to even make it spicer a titan cant use a normal cloak, it have to use a special titancloak that is affected by a dd. so this mean a titan cant sit cloaked to be safe. i even thinkin off makin the dd effect other titans within a certain ammount off au<U+FFFD>s so they just cant sit out of grid. this also has the exciting affect you can hunt enemy titans with your own titans firing dds in middle of nowhere to disable them.disable= uncloaked unwarpeble cant cyno out and cant fire its main weapon, but can move and use secondary weapons plus tankace over and out =)i feel comfortible to get atleast 1 vote"

4/9/2009,"could make fw more lively, lets see."
4/9/2009,this topic has my support.
4/9/2009,supporting this once more.
4/9/2009,"if its as simple as ""hey guys you promised to do this last time and we were told the technical fix was already designed and just needed to be implemented - well how about implementing it already."" then its not going to ""waste"" much of anyone's time. how about you schedule this issue on the agenda as a request for a status update and timescale commitment. now apocrypha is out of the way and released it must be time for this essential change to make it into coming soon patch.well delivery of promises is important too you know. i'd count it a personal favour from you omber if you can make sure this issue doesn't get forgotten about and ccp keep getting reminded to implement this every meeting up to the point it gets done.sometimes you have to push"
4/9/2009,"exactly what jade said.it wouldn't take more than a minute of ccps precious time if they just gave us a status update. the last one we got was in januari, and the new meeting is scheduled for may - that's four months later. if we're lucky it will already have been implemented before the meeting, if not, well, then we'd better remind them."
4/9/2009,supporting an important topic.
4/9/2009,"i'm not on the csm, and have no great insight into it's inner workings. however it's nearing a year since fw was implemented, and i think about a half year since ccp said that they would address it early 2009. the rp community has been actively agitating for this for closer to a year and a half, ever since we were asked to playtest the early prototype ... before we were told we'd be locked out of the final version, of course. and really, even longer than that, since fw as a high-level concept has been floated for a number of years, and the rp community has been pushing the concept since before ccp began laying plans.so at the risk of sounding harsh, i think we have a right to be just a bit impatient -- and given that ccp has given every sign that they are trying very hard to forget about this issue, i don't see why the minute spent asking for an updated eta would be a 'waste of time'."
4/9/2009,"you say issue like its a problem. there is a very specific reason why alliance are not allowed to join faction warfare. that would be like an alliance within an alliance. all it would take is one 0.0 power block to join and the opposite faction has no hope of ever winning anymore. the whole idea of faction warfare was to bring pvp to the empire based players who want to ease into pvp. allowing alliance to join faction warfare would break that aspect of the game completely.one of the worst suggestions ever brought forward.voting a giant hell no!!!if you really wanted to get involved then join one giant corp, i believe they can hold over two thousand members, so stop being lazy if its something you really want to do."
4/9/2009,"spoken as someone who's thought very little on the subject, nor read any of the many threads that were posted and that had already decided this 'issue'.tell me, what do you believe would motivate your hypothetical 0.0 power block to abandon their holdings to chase complexes in fw space? i'll answer for you: nothing at all. if the goons, for example, wanted to hot drop a capital fleet in to blast noobs in t1 frigates ... well, what's stopping them as is? nothing at all. what advantage to joining fw would push them into forcing their entire membership to run missions for months just to get the standings required to do so? the vast untold wealth that is showered on every member of the militia? the stupendous fame enjoyed by being a part of the few, the proud, the militia? to my knowledge fw is hemorraging active players, which makes me wonder just how significant a draw it is...unless, of course, you give a flying excrement about the backstory of eve, as we rpers do. i understand that the concept of rp in an mmorpg is wildly unpopular with the gankbear crowd, but it's still an interest to a number of people, most of whom are in a relative handful of rp alliances. and all of whom were, in effect, told by ccp to dissolve their alliances or kiss off.oh, and anyone who thinks that the 'one giant corp' option is feasible has clearly never been in even a small alliance. suggest to the alliance formerly known as bob that they should reform into a single corp and see what sort of response you get."

4/10/2009,supported
4/10/2009,"yeah, it seems odd that everyone's highest faction standing should also be one that's virtually impossible to work for. sure. this sounds intentional - +standings to everyone means that they probably won't ever get one. this sounds like a lot of work to fix, then - you'll need to give them a custom lp store, probably complete with new faction items. you know of anyone desperate to work sct agents? and the fluff i've seen on them makes me think they're not the type to start handing out missions, anyways. the jove have a storyline agent? ore should pick up a pile of mining agents - its agents in other fields are fine, but this is a faction that should be built for crazy people who want to run l4 mining missions in 0.0. agreed. yeah, that's a bit extreme. i've got a solution to this in another thread, that i think would help with this problem specifically, and some others generically. basically, create an epic arc for each faction(possibly just each important faction) that lets you recover standings up even from -10. concord standing = sec status. if you want to raise your concord standing, rat. you mean in terms of pirate-faction ships, or in terms of standings? the former is nifty but unlikely, the latter should already exist, i'd think. i'm for all of these. and while i don't agree with everything you've said, i agree with enough of it to support this."
4/10/2009,"bump, best pos idea in the game imo."
4/10/2009,has this been taken to ccp by the csm's?i looked at the csm wiki and do not see any mention of it (perhaps i am missing it).would be a big let down if a 24 page thread that has been opened for a while now seems to be overlooked by the csm's.
4/10/2009,supported
4/10/2009,the reason i said no was because it might make it too easy to get extremely high standings with all factions.i'll run some further calculations on this.
4/10/2009,"you are incorrect and have somewhat missed the boat on the discussion. ccp already agreed with csm1 to implement this after we carried the request from an overwhelming proportion of respondants across the rp and fw communities. no, militias are not alliances. they are designed that way with intention. won't happen or they won't really be a 0.0 power block anymore. and if it did happen? so what? this is eve, this is the giant political sandbox and such things should be able to potentially happen. its against the ethos of the game to rail-off and deny involvement to players interested in faction warfare and affairs of npc empires.in any case this issue has already been successfully escalated and presented to ccp during csm1 and we are simply awaiting the implementation promised by ccp."
4/10/2009,also toss in that gaining occupancy should bring about rewards and hurt the losing faction.make it mean something.
4/10/2009,this needs to be done.
4/10/2009,"yes, please. do it. just do it."
4/10/2009,"i agree completely. there have been a number of fine issues set forth involving improvements to fw, including:* redesigning complexes so that the best tactic involves one or two frigates.* making occupancy more meaningful in terms of actual game effects.* adding a system of rewards in such a way that allows the militia to fund itself while pursuing fw goal, yet doesn't draw farmers.* fixing the badly broken complex spawning mechanics.no doubt there are other ideas slipping my mind, but there's a few. improving fw is a worthy cause ... but one that is seperate from this one, and will likely require a bit more thought to do right. this issue is far more straightforward to fix; ccp has indicated that it could require as little as removing an inhibit that currently prevents corps that are in alliances to join fw (under the same conditions that must be met by every other corp joining)."
4/10/2009,"i've personally raised all of those things, some of which repeatedly.large document has been handed over to ccp a month after fw was released which covered most things. then there were two general issues with fw improvements, and roundtables at fanfest where the same things were repeated. in january we had another of those discussions, and recently i've sent an urgent mail about the complex spawning (due to the gallente/caldari event), again.i've just brought up the alliance problem for the third time (was also mentioned in july 2008, just to indicate).rewards and career sustainability was one of the core problems with fw.ccp is aware of this all and you can see how high a priority fw has. fw was the issue i worked hardest for, unfortunately my time is almost over. vote erik finnegan if you want to continue the struggle.now, lets not discuss this further."
4/10/2009,like making pvp non-existent.
4/10/2009,"been an idea i've been toying with posting for a while. might need a couple of other tweaks to make work but i'm not entirely certain how things work.simply put: add the corp ticker of the trader to the visible parts of the buy and sell order.i believe it could potentially add a little bit more depth to the market trading, instead of simply going to the lowest or highest order, the reputation of the corp involved might play a part on a buyer or seller's choice. this in turn adds the potential for actual advertising or similar.could also add a potential economic impetus for war decs. if you can see who the competition is more easily why not wardec the guy cutting heavily into your profits?"
4/10/2009,"no, it will then create issues with the market as people won't buy from goons/cva/bob/whoever because they hate them. currently, market keeps it quiet. it also will prevents griefers from attacking corporations due to market activity. it will also drastically change the market as it is and just make t2 go up. (because lets face it, t2 is controlled by the super alliances)no support. --isaac"
4/10/2009,"only if people value their principles/how much they hate super alliances over their isk (and how much they want t2 gear rather than t1). the ability to make the choice adds depth to the market, i can't see it changing that much, the old adage ""beggars cannot be choosers"" springs to mind.that was somewhat the point. why not jazz it up a bit and create a little bit more interaction with the rest of the corp game?in what sense? surely they can tell who is online via local and scans should they wish.in fact the name of anyone you buy or sell from turns up in your corp wallet so you can potentially do this anyway if you have isk to burn."
4/10/2009,"why, the megathron i buy from one corp/person is the exact same as the one i buy from someone else. if they were customized then sure, i could see this.traders already purchase 1 unit of the item to determine the seller. most people simply use npc corps as the trader though.i had an idea a long time ago about the ability to tie market orders to standings, ie, price an item higher to someone that you don't like, and give discounts to your allies, or even get into trade embargoes. i think this *could* add a whole dimension to the game and take wars to a whole new level, but as it is i doubt that it would have any effect as everyone is only looking at the roi % and therefore would probably be complex for ccp to implement and would not be used.i don't see harm in your idea, but the points you bring up in support of it i don't agree with either (yet)."
4/10/2009,"some people might choose to not buy from bob/cva/goonssome people might recognise the corp as an ally of the 'cide ganker that did for their last cnr.some people might not want to buy from an fw corp so as to not support one of the sides.maybe the buy order was set up by a corp they are at war with and in fact quite possibly consists of the components of their last ship loss.a corp someone is at war with might make a good deal of money trading a certain item. so undercut them. maybe at a loss? maybe the economic impact it has upon your wallet is less than the one upon theirs.large scale pvp/war comes down to economics, you cripple your opponent's ability to buy ships and you ""win"".no way round npc corps at current, i just don't really see why the identity cannot be known before the purchase is made rather than just after. thanks for reading regardless"

4/10/2009,"maybe because we're paying customers and would like to? that's a pretty legitimate reason.no, nobody speaks for everybody, sorry to disappoint you. the way to do this is that if a player changes their name to something else, all previous names are associated with them. if you search for any of the names, current or previous, you will find the correct person, along with a list of their names and when they were changed.to handle the issue of corps and alliances keeping kos lists and the like, ccp could keep a running list of name changes available via the api, so those who develop these lists can accommodate name changes and still keep their lists accurate (or at least as accurate as they were before...)to deny all eve players this ability because it makes background checks a little harder for the handful of big corporations is silly. and before you argue that there are lots of corps doing this, how many corps do you think there are that recruit multiple people per day? there aren't that many compared to the overall number of players.not to mention, anyone who does serious background checks asks for the limited api info, and all previous names would clearly be marked there. it's not like you could easily hide from your past actions simply because you changed your name.finally, if we can change our bodies and faces, why not our names? seems a bit odd...in the end, it comes down to the convenience of the many outweighs the inconvenience of the few."
4/10/2009,"you are incorrect and have somewhat missed the boat on the discussion. ccp already agreed with csm1 to implement this after we carried the request from an overwhelming proportion of respondants across the rp and fw communities. no, militias are not alliances. they are designed that way with intention. won't happen or they won't really be a 0.0 power block anymore. and if it did happen? so what? this is eve, this is the giant political sandbox and such things should be able to potentially happen. its against the ethos of the game to rail-off and deny involvement to players interested in faction warfare and affairs of npc empires.in any case this issue has already been successfully escalated and presented to ccp during csm1 and we are simply awaiting the implementation promised by ccp."

4/10/2009,this needs to be done.
4/10/2009,"yes, please. do it. just do it."
4/10/2009,"i agree completely. there have been a number of fine issues set forth involving improvements to fw, including:* redesigning complexes so that the best tactic involves one or two frigates.* making occupancy more meaningful in terms of actual game effects.* adding a system of rewards in such a way that allows the militia to fund itself while pursuing fw goal, yet doesn't draw farmers.* fixing the badly broken complex spawning mechanics.no doubt there are other ideas slipping my mind, but there's a few. improving fw is a worthy cause ... but one that is seperate from this one, and will likely require a bit more thought to do right. this issue is far more straightforward to fix; ccp has indicated that it could require as little as removing an inhibit that currently prevents corps that are in alliances to join fw (under the same conditions that must be met by every other corp joining)."
4/10/2009,"i've personally raised all of those things, some of which repeatedly.large document has been handed over to ccp a month after fw was released which covered most things. then there were two general issues with fw improvements, and roundtables at fanfest where the same things were repeated. in january we had another of those discussions, and recently i've sent an urgent mail about the complex spawning (due to the gallente/caldari event), again.i've just brought up the alliance problem for the third time (was also mentioned in july 2008, just to indicate).rewards and career sustainability was one of the core problems with fw.ccp is aware of this all and you can see how high a priority fw has. fw was the issue i worked hardest for, unfortunately my time is almost over. vote erik finnegan if you want to continue the struggle.now, lets not discuss this further."

4/11/2009,"simply displaying the ticker would be a bit of work for not really much gain. however, the previously proposed idea of sliding prices with standing is what i really like. it would add 4 numbers to a market order, and require a bit of calcs when sorting the market prices, but i think it would be worth it. that's what the new ramsan's are for anyways.. ;-)4 new numbers to market orders:min standingmax standingmin standing pricemax standing pricethe standings are the lister -> filler standings. the price slides linearly between min and max."
4/11/2009,these ideas would ruin the highly effective market we have.so that's a no.
4/11/2009,"i personally think adding these in addition would potentially be rather clunky to implement and might well actually seriously damage/affect the balance of the market.selling is effectively automated, buying requires actual input from the player and in my honest opinion choices are best made when the player is online and at his keyboard doing something rather than automated by the database in the background."
4/11/2009,"the corp ticker wouldn't acomplish much, but other ideas would be good, such as:""corp only"" markets - as to only buy from or allow to sell to corp members, instead of the annoying contract system""alliance only"" markets - sames as above, but w/ alliance""sell to x.x standing and above"" enables one to sell to only people of your liking.just a thought"
4/11/2009,this.
4/11/2009,"that is the point! that isn't an issue; that is a disliked megacorp hiding behind the fact that its name isn't attached to its products. basically your argument is that people should be forced to shop at walmart because it is the 'cheapest' even if they don't like walmart's policies.so the fact that a super-alliance might have to drop their prices to make up for the fact a large % of their potential customer base dislikes them is going to raise prices on t2?lavista vista, how about some dicussion on how you think it will 'ruin' what you think is a highly effective market system.i think it would strengthen the market system. players might become more inclined to buy from an actual player corporation rather than npc corporation player, making the move to a player corporation beneficial. it would lead to more ""pew pew"" as corporations fight to drive up competitor's prices and lower their own. it would improve the game and the 'negative' effects of having your name attached to your product would be a good thing.if i don't want to buy goon products because i don't like their general philosophy and am ok with spending a bit more on a cva or mm product, why shouldn't i be able to see that in a quick look at the market versus having to purchase 1 unit from all the market orders to determine it."
4/11/2009,"well, if you don't trust me.."
4/11/2009,"dude, get a clue. that's all i'm saying. this is a freeform market place. contracts allow you to buy stuff with full knowledge of who your buying it from. why do we need to put it into the market place? this allows people to sell their stuff without any bias. what your proposing is to allow tycoons to form in the market place. this isn't needed. we don't need more griefers attacking corporations to ""drive up competitor's prices"". that's silly and quite honestly will ruin the market.this is unsupported for a reason. use contracts. end of story.--isaac"

4/11/2009,"it is a frequently suggested idea, and it is always considered a pretty low priority. in the past, i would have agreed it's not worth it, but now that so many items on the grid are loaded dynamically after it is up and running, it might work okay. i don't agree with much more than a single accent color selection (would basically end up just being like the paint stripes on caldari ships, and such, plus the corp logo should be standard. changing the basic color of the ship, i believe, would remove a lot of the <U+FFFD>berness from the tech 2 ship appearance.to sum it up, i support:- load accent color and corp logo dynamically, as server/client load permits- limit customization to accent color, just for some flavor- ability to choose none/corp/alliance logo to be displayed on ship"
4/11/2009,"not supported. it is a great idea, but current tools and battle models do not allow for such changes to occur just yet. if ccp gaves us tools to identify which ships in system are actually piloted, and which ones are friendly / hostile, then yes. scanning atm is already boring and annoying enough, i certainly dont fell like doing more of it. and not to mention that it would make ratting / plexing / minning in 0.0 nearly impossible, as well as too stressful, in anticipation of a waiting attack.to put it simply, more things would have to change then just the local chat to implement this.[thumbs down]"

4/11/2009,"i think that would take way too much time, besides. the jovian technology for getting out of your pod has not been developed fully yet. however, not a bad idea. there are parts in the eve book that tell of a captain in a pod looking at displays of what is happening inside the ship, as well as communicating with crew members. i would love to see ship interiors, especially my megathron. but i really don't need to walk about the ship i can control via my mind. and it would be hella risky to do so in flight. as the backstory says you can only be a demigod in your pod so your mind will be transmitted to your cloan. if your ship explodes with you in the cargo pit, sorry.. but your gone.the chronicles and eve book tell of a ships crew that work inside the vessel also.. so every time you explode you kill people. so even screen shots of ship interiors would be challenging as it cant show people working onboard. i propose instead having a link on the ships info to screen shots of interior spaces after the ship has been built, for example the oasis of the seas cruise ship in usa, fl. online are screen shots of interior and construction one set will work for every pilots ship of that type, and could be available online.for everyone to see"

4/11/2009,so if the program lasts long enough you want them all to turn into csm bureaucrat historians and nothing more? logic defeats you. bbbbooooossssssshhhhhhhh!and there for............
4/11/2009,"logic defeats you too, because your logic sux.the csm4 doesn't have to know exactly what csm1 did, because it's irelevant to their job, most likely.however with the csm3, csm1 is still relevant, because they raised issues which are relevant to what csm3 will be doing.for instance, the candidate in this thread wants to talk about pos. however we already discussed that on the csm and there's a solution coming up, as a result of that.thus, it's crucial that candidates knows what has been going on for the last years time. it's extremely obvious who has done their homework and who hasn't. don't be one of those guys/girls who haven't done their homework."
4/11/2009,"in my humble opinion, it the onus of passing knowledge should be on the out going csm, part of the job upon exiting if you will.to many bureaucratic monstrosities are made from people who concentrate only on what the government before them did.i would even venture to say that whatever csm1 talked about matters little at all, as its been a year and pos warfare is still the same old grind that it was when you took office, and nothing changed after the fact. if every csm were to address pos warfare, maybe ccp would finally get the picture that it literally is worse than masturbating with a cheese grater."
4/11/2009,"irrelevant. in other words what you're saying is that a ""valid"" csm candidate should necessarily be aligned to one of the former delegates, which in the end, will just create ""csm parties"" (something already happening with the carebear-aligned block), creating a political oligarchy instead of getting new voices and opinions heard.the so-called problem mentioned by you can be solved by just reading the current documentation and logs left by the csm, something i'm sure mazz will have plenty of time to do in case she's elected. or do you expect her or any other new candidate to spend hours reading inane irc logs just to please a eve-o forum celebrity?"
4/11/2009,"i think it is very important that the experience and work of ankhesentapemkah will be passed on so to speak. not long ego i have written a rather complex proposal which would introduce a kind of player controlled law-enforcement system in lowsec. by adding both story line and pvp experience while creating more security for lowsec industry etc. at the time i knew little about ccp's approach to player proposal's and initiatives. however after a few conversations with ankhe i realized how complex and challenging is the process of introducing even the best of ideas. not because ccp is closed to good ideas, but because the best and most creative one's require a lot of development work and careful prioritization. therefore, player proposals can only be taken in small steps. this is why continuity of csm ideas is so crucial. i realized that the take care party's views are often not so popular with the hardcore pvp player's, and they are often dismissed as a ""carebear party"". regardless our differences as to what the eve experience is all about, their effort and dedication to represent different play styles and not their own subjective views is something to be respected if not admired. of course, the idea of ""player party"" automatically implies a certain amount of partiality, nevertheless i believe that understanding the importance of a careful compromise and open-mindedness is ultimately one of the take care party's strongest attributes, which i think they share with the game developers. on the surface ccp may seem, rather conservative, it is only natural that they want to protect their faithful customers, however if you watch their leaders and their speeches, one can clearly see that at heart they are bold visionaries not afraid of venturing into the unknown. slowly but surely this game will evolve into many new directions, regardless of what some of the hard core players say.it is my believe that the success of the whole csm concept will ultimately depend on their ability to listen to both players and ccp, only in that way their proposals can be balanced. so far, the record is good and lets hope that it continues this way and not too much politics enters our parties.thank you ankhe for a job well done!enough said, erik you will definitely have my vote"

4/12/2009,someone bring out the picard facepalm. you arent aware what hes currently flying in amarr are you?
4/12/2009,signed
4/12/2009,"there should be a similar turret nerf. turrets werent changed with speed nerf ,thats why amarr laser ships can hit too far and track too fast.balance turrets,it is needed !!!"
4/12/2009,"sure, we'll do that as soon as you nerf tracking disruptors and energy neuts. --isaac"
4/12/2009,"if you want to take down a pos or conquer a system you need dreads , tytans can dd and bridge ships around , carrier is used for repairing the pos and using fighters, mothership...well can slightly better perform the same tasks as carrier.with two carriers you can do a better job than with mothership for 1/12 of the price plus you have the ability to dock to the station. give them some sort of a special bonus that would make them much more different/better that a regular carrier (much better or different than it is now).people will stop using them if nothing is going to change (they are already dramaticaly loosing popularity )"
4/12/2009,no support. op has no actual suggestions for changing the ms. --isaac
4/12/2009,"making motherships not suck any more would be a welcome step, but there's nothing in the op to agree or disagree with beyond 'make them not suck any more'vv"
4/12/2009,"at present, this proposal will do nothing but frustrate people and make people spend too much for items. this seems to be a little-known fact, but it is literally impossible for you to buy from any order other than the cheapest. the game mechanics simply will not allow it. you can pay extra, but the person getting the money is the one who posted the lowest sell order. your proposal is useless - or worse, a trap for the unwary - would cause insane lag, and wouldn't really solve any problems. that's not intended to be harsh, mind you. i understand why this proposal was made, and why it appeals to people, but it is a proposal rooted in ignorance. it simply doesn't work in eve."
4/12/2009,"which should be changed.performance will be drastically impacted if they display the name and change the broken mechanic of matching any buy order to the lowest sell order regardless of the price paid? are they talking about server/database performance? the performance of how much is bought and sold? it is already loading the buy/sell orders; add another column of information.my corporation does and was looking forward to storefronts, but that was canceled! and doesn't appear to be coming back.tycoons can already exist in the 'unbias' market place as those with money quickly purchase those underbidding them if they want to maintain a monopoly. there is no reason that a monopoly should not exist in eve, and likely regional monopolies exist.it isn't griefing, they are playing part of the game and already do so to some extent. as a basic example: indy a hires merc 1 to attack indy b, its local competition. indy b hires merc 2 to help defend it, cutting into either its profits or causing it to raise its prices. a prolonged war may actually also effect indy a, especially if the link is determined or merc 1 starts charging more.so perhaps the csm should address getting the functionality into contracts so that they are easy to search and use for everyone; such that it actually competes with the market.either way, the basic point is this.individuals, corporations, and alliances sell products in eve, either via the market or the contract system. individuals, corporations, and alliances have in-game reputations which might cause some consumers to not buy from or sell to them, not necessarily linked to their market presence or performance. in the market system there is no means to determine the seller before you buy and even if you try to buy from a particular seller, you are forced to purchase it from the lowest seller.this is neither an open or free market system, but something else entirely.if ccp wants to protect a market system that simplifies to basic supply & demand, so be it. but this issue will continue to come up."
4/12/2009,you already made your own point moot.
4/12/2009,"but this is the place to make the point, even if ccp and the csm are going to ignore it."
4/12/2009,"i realize why you are asking this, however, if people want to support a certain corporation over another, then corporations can sell via-contracts. i see no reason why a corp cannot do this. to add the ticker to the market will ruin the economy and not allow corps/individuals to sell quietly. so until you give me a concrete reason to add a feature that is already in contracts to the market, i won't support this idea and neither will many others.--isaac"
4/12/2009,"fact! it is know that ccp griefs minmatar for the reason to hear the lamentation of our women and drink their tears and touch themselves whilst drinking said tears, on a more serious note is the crap ship know as the craplfar ever gonna get fixed?"

4/12/2009,"funny thing is that, having trained into a nidhoggur, it'll take me less time to crosstrain for one of the other three racial dreads than it would for a naglfar because of the need to train up both projectiles and torps. given the opportunity to spend more time training just to get into an inferior ship, i'll pass, thanks."
4/12/2009,supporting this proposal
4/12/2009,all it needs now is a csm with the balls to take the matter up to ccp in a meeting
4/12/2009,pink thorax nah we got that already :d
4/12/2009,"that's the whole point though - we shouldn't instantly know every ship in system, who is in it, how old they are, thier employement history, and whether they are friendly or hostile. it's absolutely awesome in a w-space system when you first pick up and unkown ship on scanner and you have to try to figure out who they are, if they have also spotted you, and whether they are friend or foe. it's far more realistic/immersive and has a deep space feel that is lacking when the local window automatically gives you an attendance roster of everyone in system."
4/12/2009,"somehow i think that removing local will hurt the little guy the most.the mega alliances are the ones that can afford dedicated scout accounts, and have the possibility to create big intel systems.the multi account players can place their isk-generating chars in empire space and keep their pvp'ers in 0.0 like they do now, and the few that get their isk from moons wont really care either way.its the alliance grunts and small time players with *shock* 1 account that actually lives in 0.0 based on ratting income that will get hurt. especially if they are in smaller alliances."
4/12/2009,i support a thumbs down option so i may use it here in this thread.
4/12/2009,supported.
4/12/2009,should have been added a long time ago in my opinion.
4/12/2009,like this idea a lot. add a right click option on the button for attack/return etc.using drones annoys me death atm with the drop down menus and such. adding the buttons would make this much easier and also remove the necessity of the drone window.zos

4/12/2009,"with ccp declaring cosmos dead and the epic mission arc system as replacement, perhaps it would be nice to have some agents that require dogtags, effects and wormhole materials in return for a standing gain or some loyalty points.the problem with these items is that there are npc buy orders on the market for them, which is an isk faucet. in case of the dogtags some hand-ins are broken and give less standing than they should, plus they can only be handed in once. overseer effects just translates into isk.there should be a player demand for these items, and alternative rewards upon handing them in than just plain isk being pumped into the economy.some special lp shop would be nice in case of the wh stuff, with some items useful to r&d and production orientated characters but that is probably too much to ask for. datacenter-like agents that award standing with r&d corps in case of wh stuff and some lp and faction standing in case of tags and effects might be more realistic.advantage of the epic mission arc system is that the missions can be made repeatable (with an x month delay of course) creating continuous player demand for these items. it might also be yet another way to repair pirate faction standing."
4/12/2009,"in another discussion (that is an old one that will continue to arise), it was pointed out that ccp would prefer ""[r]ather than changing the market, improvements should be made to the contract system. the csm will submit suggestions for this in a future meeting.""well, an improvement to the contract system that we got to glimpse prior to qr coming to tq was storefronts. they however did not get introduced on tq and appear to have fallen by the way side.storefronts provided an opportunity for corporations to do a number of things more effectively than is currently possible.1 - branding:yes, a raven is a raven is a raven, but that doesn't mean players/characters don't have a preference of raven construction inc. over indyalt123 of sak - even if they are the same price. on a larger scale, players may have a preference of not buying finished goods from one of the major 0.0 power blocs and would prefer to fund their competitors (ie don't like bob, buy from goons or vice a versa).2 - packaging:contracts allow for more than just single items to be sold and a 'new' market could arise where corporations package together items commonly used together. whether this is a particularly effective setup for a mission raven with modules required or all the fuel required for a certain pos to stay on for a week. this provides the opportunity for product variance between corporations be it a kestrel with t1 fittings versus a kestrel with named fittings or a navy mega with t2 fit versus faction fit.3 - consumer choice:this is related to both the above by providing consumers (other players) with a choice when they are buying goods and who gets the money. the current market system (most players likely do not try to use the contracts system) forces people to buy from the lowest bidder even if it is someone they would rather not support, removing choice from the consumer.this was all from the basic functionality we had all of a week to experiment with and does not include such possibilities as:- integration with igb to allow for player created webpages linking to their stores*- standings based sales, shutting out those you don't like from buying from you- secondary player 'industries' related to advertising.so the basic question is, when will we see storefronts on tq?*requires igb to be fixed so that it doesn't take 5 minutes to load a page. may create a second 'issue' concerning igb."
4/12/2009,and i of course support it.
4/12/2009,"wrong forum. your not suggesting anything, your asking a question aimed at devs. please visit features and ideas discussion.--isaac"
4/12/2009,"storefronts are related to wis, qr did not have walking in stations so it does not have storefronts."
4/12/2009,"so you are saying that trying to get ccp to introduce to tq a mechanic they have worked on and presented on sisi should not be put to the csm which is supposed to address player concerns to ccp?the csm is a means to bring to ccp, the devs, attention a concern we players have. it is not a features & idea, they have already demonstrated the feature & idea. based on your comment, this forum should be dissolved and everything moved to features and ideas. one of the threadnaughts in this forum is for ccp to address something in the features & ideas forum.i am suggesting that ccp revisit qr storefronts and develop them further.i am guessing you don't support them addressing it.half right; storefronts as an extension of the current contract system, were in an early qr build released to sisi, they were later remove. i am asking for the csm to bring it to ccp's attention and something to raise on their priority of things to do."
4/12/2009,not sure if i'll support raising an issue but i'll ask around to see if i can find out more.
4/12/2009,me approves!!! 300 is way too small
4/12/2009,"why is it so hard for you people to understand this?it is incredibly relevent to follow a previous csm's work, because they have extremely limited facetime with ccp. running on a platform to do something which was already brought forward to ccp, and is in the pipeline, not only demonstrates a csm candidate who is wasting ccp's time but also shows the unintelligence of those who voted that representative in.either do *some* homework, or run solely on the vote for me, i'm female! platform. from the looks of this thread, you have a pretty good chance either way."
4/12/2009,"it's painfully obvious that you haven't read a single bit either.first of all, we don't use irc.second, the meetings which matter, there's no logs for, afaik. there's 5 pdf files which people should read. that's not including the original csm paper, which describes how the csm works.if you haven't even followed what the csm has been doing, even if they were cross-linked in general discussion for an extended period of time, then you are wasting people's time.and if you are running on a platform which is totally obsolete already, then it's evident that you haven't done your homework either."
4/12/2009,"edit : this post is mostly directed at lavista.fresh minds, fresh thoughts.at this stage of the race, its more about what a candidate can bring to the table and less of how technically qualified a person is.if you want to parallel your thought and standpoint to 'the real world' you are saying that academics should be the people making choices and that industry should follow their lead. the abstraction of towards knowledge vs practicality is extremely important in this case. just because you have spent >9000 hours reading forums, documents and talking to previous members does not make you any better of a candidate than someone like mazz, it almost certainly makes you worse off - as you have a lot more preconceived ideas, thoughts on others and an 'elitist' complex (like it or not, thats exactly how you come off).expecting people commenting on threads to have also read procedural documents before commenting in a thread - why should you expect people to (potentially) waste 10-30 minutes of their life to make a comment? this is exactly what csm are not meant to be about. i consider my self a 'good' voter, i however have never seen one of these linked threads you are speaking about... why? because in reality a small portion of the player base cares to continually read the forums, i am in this general population and you are doing a bad job of identifying with us.""for players, by players"", if i can rephrase the razer/interplay motto's - something the csm and a lot of candidates are failing to take to heart. players need to identify with you. to do this requires good communication(see : 'tl;dr', the concept that you are missing). you talk of pdf's and threads - but how many players are you communicating with? the csm have completely failed to engage players for the most part - we know very little of the developments within or what you are actually doing when not in a meeting. how would you address this? though i know you will have already disagreed mentally, lavista - you might ask why? its because i have read your posts and realized you are quite arrogant and inflexible... note how reading things has coloured my picture of you.in short - don't look like a jackass elitist because you spend a lot of time reading forums and think it somehow makes you entitled to a place on the csm."
4/12/2009,"i'd tend to agree. but when the csm thus far has pushed hard for a new sov/pos system, and then a person who has no idea about this progress so far, comes and wants to the exact same, then it's a damn waste. there needs to be continuity. that's because what we do eventually reaches a meeting. everything that is done is brought up to a meeting and then passed onto ccp.granted there's lots of player-communication. however the csm has historically not been intrusive in that regards. there's a channel where people hang out and talk to us, for instance.we can't engage players who don't want to be engaged. if we did, we would be accused of trying to relevant, when we supposedly aren't.how? we need to spread the word of the csm. i talk to people really regularly, who never heard of the csm, yet are really interested. we are working with the wiki team to make things more transparent so that things are easier to find. we had a sticky with the latest ccp-csm minutes, where we had a full a4 page worth of the future of the sov system, in the general discussion forum, for instance.i'm not entitled to a place on the csm, because i have been on the csm for a year now.but i think that in order for you to be entitled to a place on the csm, you should have read the minutes from the ""major"" meetings. that's really no big deal. it's a small pdf you need to read every 2 months. i'm sorry if you think that's unreasonable to expect. but the csm isn't a right, it's a privilege. we have built up so much trust with ccp now, that if a whole new council take over and screw up because they didn't do their homework, then there's people who has spend a year on the csm, who then suddenly have had all that time wasted because of these people.i can obviously see why you find that extremely elitist. and it is, to a degree. such is politics. eventually there's going to be a lot of people who's put their trust in you. if you don't even want to put in a small amount of time in advance of you getting elected, then you aren't fit for the job. chances are that you are going to spend at very least 2 hours each sunday on sitting in a meeting. that's not even mentioning the people who's going to be convoing you all the time, as a result of you being on the csm.the csm isn't a free holiday. it's hard work.politicians in real life has to know history too. exact same thing goes in eve. if you don't know the history of things, then you aren't fit for the job."
4/12/2009,so what you took 3 posts to say trying to make mazzilliu look foolish and be an arrogant **** was do your homework? could have been that easy eh? i know maz and she will do her homework and is the kind of person that i would like to see on the csm.
4/12/2009,"i'm not at all. if that was my aim, i'd have done it right off the bat.i really hoped that for once she would be a candidate who would have done a bit of homework. i tried to at least make her read up on what i thought was important for her to know of. but that didn't work."
4/12/2009,"there is such a thing as being too serious, ankh. heck, i'm only running for the free trip to iceland. my primary csm agenda is to sleep with as many luscious icelandic women as possible. i'll frankly be surprised if i attend the csm meeting sober, seeing as my mighty canadian dollars will buy a good deal of drink in the shattered icelandic economy.mazzilliu: if i weren't running, i'd vote for you. perhaps we should form a political party to counter the rising carebear voice of reason power-bloc. i propose we call it the call to war party :|edit: my first choice was chainsaw hate**** party, but my political advisor suggested it might not fly with certain demographics."

4/12/2009,"(once again, mostly for lavista)so besides not answering the questions - which you pretty much confirmed everything said. firstly, lets address a key problem you seem to be suffering from;q: what would you do about global warming?a: yes.the above example shows how with simple rules of logic and linguistics, the answer falls outside of the domain of applicable replies and is such 'nonsense'. when conducting interviews, getting feedback or doing research this is a very important thing to look for, as it indicates that a person is either not listening to the question or unable to understand it (both of which are fair), or that they dont have an answer, have no opinion on the matter or feel you are probing for a specific answer. in the latter case, you would have to conclude that the question has not been answered at all - generally bad, however sometimes 'grey'. so take some times and actually answer the questions.secondly, engagement occurs betweem two parties. i like examples so here goes: i'm sure you have been in a class or series of lectures where an educator has been unable to engage the class and just conducts his/her performance at the front, hoping that you are watching and writing down notes etc. then i'm sure you have had the opposite, where an educator has actually engaged and intergrated the classes feedback and while you may not have taken as many notes or stared at the board for as much time, you absorbed much more and actually didnt wish you were somewhere else during that time. the first is an example of what the csm in its current state is : passive. sure you interact with the few people that give an idea, but the majority of the class is bored and uninterested.expecting people to be interested is a design flaw. in a resturant your food is not made and then left in the kitchen for you to wander in and find, sure after 2 hours you might go busting into the back and find your cold food, but by a large margin the resturant would have failed, instead they have waitrons(how pc of me), the faces ands voices of the service. different in your case as you have to be less 'in your face', but since the internet offers many different ways/mediums...lastly, you say that the csm has done all this fantastic work on talking to ccp about changes to the pos grind etc, in your post... and then you go and mention how even a candidate has no clue about it. see what i'm getting at? if not, read this post again.(once again, sorry for having to dump this in your thread mazz, but i think these concepts and questions are quite important)"
4/12/2009,"it's like asking how the world started, and then expecting a clear answer.i see what you are saying. but the question thus far has been of a such nature that there is no definite answer, just ideas.i disagree with the example. in a class you are there because of the teacher. in the csm, only a small minority cares.how we can catch the interest of players at large is always a topic for discussion. there's a few things which i understand are being worked on, in order to address that exact problem. but once again, there's no definitive answer as for how to fix it. the csm can't be intrusive in it's approach, and that's the fundamental problem. the average joe has no clue about the csm.as for why you seem to claim that the majority of the class is bored and uninterested, well. sure, a few vocal people have expressed to me their dislike of the csm. but i'm yet to hear from an average joe who could explain why he was bored or uninterested. guess why.that's exactly why we are always working towards making the csm more visible. however it relies a lot on ccp to actually reach out to the average person, because the csm as an entity can't do that within reason.i know it's vague. however, there's really not much more to it. government entities are always working towards stopping global warming. but because of the nature of what is being done, it's not possible to go out and not seem vague. that's just how it is i'm afraid.well, the information and the concept has been widely available for over 2 months. if the members of the csm had the csm as a full-time job, then i might have agreed entirely with you. but we are volunteers. there's a limit to what we can do, within reason."
4/12/2009,"you are completely missing the point.also, i really do hope you never answer questions like that during a job interview"
4/12/2009,"what else exactly annoys you? i was told to troll you because you are supposed to be an easy target, so i think i'll refrain from saying that this campaign has just started, that i wrote the op in 5 minutes and haven't yet had the time to throw out all the points that have already been covered and rejected.but i will say that you seem to be so wrapped up in bureaucracy that you forget the point of the csm is to fix broken game mechanics, getting ""the average guy"" interested in it does jack **** really. its too bad that i dont have your support though. it really meant a lot to me that i could get the ""lavista vista"" seal of approval and these posts you have been making on the internet are really hurting my self esteem. however since you have already been on the csm for two rounds, surely you will support my desire to remove term limits?also since you've been there so long, what are the odds i can get ccp to buy my return ticket a couple days later so i can see the countryside?signed, ~*~a real life girl~*~please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
4/12/2009,"you and i, we must band together and push through issues like the ability to set all entities in eve red by default(this helps with station taxes) and the entire removal of concord.the only way to defeat the menace of carebearism is through violent revolution. i propose burning haulers on the jita undock as a symbolic protest."
4/12/2009,"well, my best advice would be to skim trough this and get a sense of what the csm has been doing of importance during the last 4 months. the first few issues are the one that is about your fields of interest. i see your point, but i disagree. the csm won't work without the support from the average eve citizen. if the average joe isn't involved, the csm will become a way for the elite to influence the development of the game. the term limit could be damaging in the long run due to the a decreasing amount of candidates, as result of the most active candidates having spend their terms.however, i couldn't run again for another 3 years anyways. but i support the idea of raising the term limit, or maybe make a rule that you can only do 2 consecutive terms. that should mix it up a bit.i guess you'd have to pay for the extra night at hotels."
4/12/2009,"this isn't real life. who are the elite in eve? it's the people that play the game the most. they know what ways the game is broken in the best. the ""average joe"" are only involved in the process up to the point the candidates are elected. beyond that, they cant really do anything except offer suggestions the candidates can accept or ignore as they please.that's like 2 us dollars, right? i can cope."

4/13/2009,no. drones and fighters should just automatically get warped into your drone bay when dc'ing.(if not scrambled)
4/13/2009,"oh god, then theres the drones that fly past your ship when recalled and go dead several km away... at the very least, recall mechanics need to be looked at."
4/13/2009,"perhaps , an increase bonus to the number of deployed fighters from 3 to 8 per level plus increased bonus to deployed fighter`s damage from 5% to 10% per level...orif you reach lv5 carrier you can deploy additional 20 fighters...it would be like some sort of specialization , like salvaging lv5 ....i know it looks like a massive increase but then that is how mothership should be like. with those bonuses it would make sense to have few of them with you on those massive engagements.anyway,i agree that motherships badly need some changes and like someone said in a post before me right now they do suck...oh yea , one more thing isaac starstriker you seems to have some opinion about changing the motherships. however so far i only read what you dissaprove or don`t like about other people suggestions in that particular topic . how about for a change you give us some suggestions , because criticizing everyone else`s ideas is an easy way to go but do not help to solve that problem at all."
4/13/2009,"this can be said about any class ship.the mom is more like the t2 version off a carrier.2 bs's will take out a golem (fitted right), 2 cruisers will take out a t2 cruiser (fitted right), 2 frigs will take out a t2 frig (fitted right), in all cases you are looking at 1/5 too 1/25 of the price to out preform the more exspensive ship with more ships.

4/13/2009,"you have a point here but still it is a difference if that is 1/20 of 60mill or a 17b but like you said it is not about the price only...it is rather silly to compare bs class of ships (or frigates) to capital class of ships (i don`t think you know much about supercaps production and i`m not saying that to discredit you here because not many players knows about it or even need to know about it), to which ship would you then compare the tytan and dread class of ships? look , to build a carrier you just need to be in some npc station in 0.4 system jump away from hi sec = not much stress (you can find one 7j from jita) , to build a mothership you need pos with capital ship assembley array (that itself cost 1.8b) plus what is far harder to achieve your need your own/alliance system with sov3 (and if you are into alliance wars then you know how hard it is to get one)then try to transport the minerals there...and what you get for all that trouble a better carrier?so you say cost effective part is not important here? common pull yourself together.i also think that mothership was not intend to be a t2 carrier (well,i agree with you it sort of is right now...) , well at least i would think it should have some more specialized role that would support the price tag and production effort.also what i think she meant is that even golem with it`s specific bonuses which are slightly different than normal bs can performe a more specialize roles in some parts of the game (for example missions).right now i cannot figure out that specific role for a mothership that`s all."
4/13/2009,"this can be said about any class ship.the mom is more like the t2 version off a carrier.well how can u call a mothership t2 verion of carrier?? it's a different class of ship - super capital...i agree with my fellow corp m8 motherships should have a little bit more to say on the battlefield than so far, it is sad that ccp didn't think about it yet.they love to nerf, not to boost"
4/13/2009,"i agree in principle, but i can't support this without a concrete proposal of some sort. also, it ought to be noted that they do have some special things carriers don't get - immunity to ew, the projected ecm burst, and the clone bay, namely. they have things carriers don't, those things just aren't worth the cost of the hull at present."
4/13/2009,if your going to critique.... bother to do your research first... or kindly leave.
4/13/2009,bob know people hate them because of they cheat so they use alt corp(or alliances) to do empire stuff. as long as alt corps exists their is no points to put corp ticker on market
4/13/2009,"^^ what he said.also, if you want to do this, use contracts.the fact that most of eve chooses to use the anonymous market demonstrates that nobody cares."
4/13/2009,"in the real world those are called front companies/organizations. terrorist, organized crime syndicates, etc use them. so if you want to hurt the main organization you will have to do some intelligence gathering to figure out where the front company is getting its goods.so it doesn't remove the point of having a corp ticker next to the market order.some of us do use contracts to sell our products; but we aren't asking for this as a product provider, but as consumer.most of the population chooses to use the market vs contracts because it is currently easier to search, moves more volume of goods, and is what they are introduced to using to buy things in the first place. the tutorial doesn't send you to the contract system to buy something, it introduces you to the market. it is hard for people to care about it if they don't even realize an alternative exist.as for it being anonymous, this isn't true. after you purchase something you know who you purchased it from. it is possible to determine who is selling what, given sufficient money (and who is buying what). so the anonymous component only exist until you have made your purchase.a real life comparision could be buying a used car; only thing is you purchase the car without knowing who it comes from: an authorized resaler or some front for offloading stolen cars."
4/13/2009,"*updated*1. add a jump bridge to motherships, but limit it to sub-bc/bs so ms could be used to deploy small gangs into enemy turf2. increase the sma bay size, bigger than titans or just enough to fit a small gang of cruisers/frigates inside.i just came up with this: make them able to transport pods w/ clones insidebut it really isnt usefull if you have the jb on the mothershipsafter these changes: ms jumps into a system bordering enemy territory or is near it. inside it it's carrying about 5-10 man gang pods and ships inside it, it deploys the ships and the pods outside it, people board their ship. now cyno alt pops cyno and ms bridges the romaing gang inside enemy territory, later this can be upgraded w/ a special ms module, kinda like a triage module making it immobile and transforming it into a mobile base that bridges small gangs inside enemy's belly.just an idea, really."

4/13/2009,"for the last year or so there has been a serious problem with the value of various ores. ores should move up in value as you go from mining in highsec to lowsec to 0.0, but lowsec ores do not fit this pattern at all right now. using mineral base prices(the prices which were originally used to balance the ore values), highsec ores would be worth 60-156 per m3, lowsec ores worth 168-225, and 0.0 ores worth 200-767, which creates a nice progression in value as you move to less secure space. however, using market prices, highsec ores are worth 66-126, lowsec ores are worth 50-84, and 0.0 ores are worth 139-410. highsec and 0.0 are still fine, but lowsec is worth half of what it should be. this can be fixed by making jaspet, hemorphite, and hedbergite better than veldspar, by introducing new ores, or even by doing both. given that highsec and 0.0 both have 6 ores, while lowsec only has 3, i believe that the best way to fix this would be to add three new ores to make lowsec mining better than highsec again. here's a rough proposal for what these ores could look like, subject to further balancing on ccp's part:ore 1: 2m3, 500 units to refine, 15000 trit, 1000 mex, 300 iso, 100 nocx, 10 mega - 155 isk/m3 market value(234 base)ore 2: 2m3, 500 units to refine, 3000 trit, 2500 pyer, 2000 mex, 20 mega - 157 isk/m3 market value(254 base)ore 3: 2m3, 500 units to refine, 2500 trit, 500 pyer, 500 iso, 250 nocx, 50 zyd - 153 isk/m3 market value(303 base)these ores are about 25% richer than veldspar at current prices, and are still reasonable even if prices shift closer to base value in future. this will hardly make lowsec mining the next flavour of the month, but it will create a suitably increased level of reward for those who are willing to risk mining in lowsec, and will hopefully help draw a few more people into lowsec."

4/13/2009,actually most of the players do not run missions that just give dogtags because of the immense standing hits you get with the opposing factions.most tags come from ratting or factional warfare.effects come from plexes.so why are we discussing mission payout? this would provide more income and an alternative way to get standing for lowsec/0.0 residents that might not like to run missions.

4/14/2009,"here we go.reasoning:--motherships need to have some sort of unique use. currently to build a mothership you need a safe sov system, csaa, and parts, lots of parts. motherships run around 17-20 billion isk, due to the long process and massive amount of resources need to manufacture one, let alone the blueprint copies or originals needed to complete the project. you can't dock, so a safe sov system where you can plant your garage pos is also a neccessity, unless you have a mothership alt for it. currently there isn't any real reason to justify fielding motherships, except for the fact that you own one and it's gathering dust. this is a long, dedicated investment, whether it be by the manufacturer, or someone who is purchasing one, (hopefully through chribba's service for safety)issues:--i'm sure the first thing on everyone's list when approaching the issues with motherships is that we don't want to see the invincible lowsec monsters they were before the introduction of hics.--fighters need expanding in general, mothership's are not fielded into fights with cruisers and frigates primarily, anti support is always a plus. but mothership's should have access to heavy hitters of some kind that would be effective on an enemy dread fleet, but not on enemy support, allowing the ms pilot to adapt to environment.key questions that need answers:--what should a carrier be primarily used for? let's define that, should they be on the field to rep dreads and poses with a dash of anti-support in there? okay, so now we have a super capital carrier, the mothership class, should it be a better carrier? or follow more of a super-cap role as a mobile operations platform?personally i vote for the fleet support role, as a mobile station, meaning a clone bay that functions, more ship capacity, defensive ability but not designed to be an offensive weapon, still requiring an escort of support, but at the same time able (if prepared correctly) to support it's own support pilots. either way, motherships need to be worth their value, at present there's no real justifiable reason to field a nyx over a thanatos or a wyvern over a chimera. they currently both do the same job about as effectively but losing the carrier is something you can repeat about 20 times (carrier 800mil/ms 18bil/without insurance) before equaling the loss of the mothership."

4/14/2009,great idea
4/14/2009,"limited, preset range of colors: yes.corp / alliance logo: yes.free full paintjobs: no."
4/14/2009,"logo: yespaint shop: nobase color: nohere's why on base color. many of the ships in eve [t2] are specified but subtle hull modifications, as well as their variation [ishukone, khanid, etc..] even tho for the majority we rely on the type column and the scanner to identify ships, seeing a redish thorax means hic, seeing a black ferox means nighthawk.also any logo additions/color changes should remain optional in the client. ie: if pilot a wants to see the ships based on what has come to be standard known associations he/she should be able to disable pilot b's black vulture from being black."
4/14/2009,"i'm not sure the specifics are perfect, but i like the general idea of the ddd proposal to make it more of a massive debilitating effect instead of just a giant smartbomb. also i have been saying for a long time that motherships need to get an even larger sma and either the ability to have pilots dock for jump, or rework the clone vat bay so they are a useful instrument for delivering pilots to the ms after a jump so they can board the ships in the sma. and the no movement penalty while triaging also sounds nice."
4/14/2009,colorful post.i suggest you just stick to no and spend more time thinking before you react.personally i agree... but this should only be in npc areas where there is faction sovereignty... doesn't make much sense to have this take place in territorial areas.piracy is a concern for sure... but that's normal for eve.
4/14/2009,"that would only cover half of the problem. as it is most people are not stupid enough to log while they have aggro. instead they either jump through a gate or warp around for 15 minutes to clear aggro, then log. when logging without aggro it needs to take a bit longer so someone who already has probes out and is hunting you has a chance to find you in time. reading comprehension for teh winz. the problem is not with logging off at a gate, but rather at a safe spot."
4/14/2009,"its still an idea and very fresh but i agree that the wardec needs some changes because imo it has no purpose anymoremake the war dec use the victory condition but only in low sec and zero sec only. for high sec, the war dec has to be agreed for both parties only.so, for low and zero sec, since we got sovereignty system thing going on, how about mixing it with the wardec system.this is how it would work- if you got sov in a system, your pos or outpost or whatever needs fuel will cost less. on a second note, you would get upgrades to your pos (just like the sov level with an outpost).-(optionaly) no sov in a system, anchored is allowed but fuel cost more.- since the upgrades (improvements) exist for output why not do it with posin other words, if you want access to the ressource in that system at low cost of course since its more profitable, you would need to setup a pos in there. you would need sov in there to do so. i know a couple of corps or alliances would kill to do that. on the financial side it would make sense for the sov system.i'm pretty sure lots of corp would go wardec other corps in low sec since its more profitable to do so.so that in place, theres the victory condition. very simple. when you war dec a corp in low sec you put your conditions (which will not be easy i suppose) in order to win. just like factional warfare(well the basic principe behind it), you need to win multiple times in order to change sov to your corp or alliance just like fw. for the victory conditions.. mhh, not sure on that part but it must not be easy...or way too hard.. could be dynamic though. perhaps on number of corp members or such. like the more members you have the more ships, isk value or, kills or pod kill you need to get or something although it should be in relation to the sov level of the system and number of members of ""defending"" corp or alliance..like i said dynamic.for high sec.. give them a break, its already freakin boring in high sec anyway, just missions, mining and such.. all static liniar stuff. isk can be made but not like low or zero sec. so with that in mind, both parties have to agree to fight... seems fair. if you stay in high, just rot with your poor ship anyway.this would seems to be more balance that way if you ask me.of course, its just an idea, it can be tweaked. this one gives a whole new meaning to the word wardec.pros- goals, objective based wardec system- reward system (upgrades, low fuel cost,etc)cons- no more war dec'ing a corp or alliance in highsec since both have to agree (less freedom)- cost more fuel or resource if you don't have sov in low sec and you got a pos in there."
4/14/2009,i support this 100% as well! bump for corp-mate!
4/14/2009,/signedbut my problem with this is not the speed at which im in the station but rather the time to undock and dock...its way too long (unless im impatient). either find a way to speed it up or let me speak to an agent whicle outside the station.
4/14/2009,bunyip has already put this on the agenda for next sunday.
4/14/2009,it's a good idea.
4/14/2009,"the restriction is extremely annoying, but also necessary to preserve the role of the jump freighter. maybe there is an alternative solution that solves both problems. a while back they put in a check so that if you have one pilot with higher skill load up a ships' hold then have another pilot get in the ship and can not hold all the cargo with his skills, you can not enter warp. perhaps something like this could be done with smas. this way you can have a spare module or three that you find convenient to keep on hand in your ship and get it in the sma, but if you try to fully load an iteron 5 with cargo, once there is no pilot inside, it will be overloaded and thus, prevent the carrier from jumping/warping with it in the sma."
4/14/2009,"agreed, there is no point whatsoever in using dsps now when cores are just as good, and it is absolutely absurd that the faction variant is no better.they should have fixed the horrible deviation to work properly so you could not get an accurate warp to even with 100% str rather than nerfing the str. this would allow you to quickly identify what sites were there and approximately where they were before switching to cores."
4/14/2009,"even if every ccp dev was uber rich in game, it doesn't matter. because there are many many many many many many many more players with loads of isk. not to mention that the people that really swing the market, generally, only play the game for the market. many of the player's i've spoken with over the years in this area or profession of the game generally don't have much they can spend their isk on anyway. you can only lose so many ships, or sink so much isk into something before it becomes boring.look at eve as it stands, even in my own situation, isk is not difficult to save up. especially if you know what kind of person you are. as an example, i fly hulks, mackinaws, orcas, viators, freighters, ishtars and a kronos. i understand that to be entertained in this game i do not need to have large amounts of isk. but the way in which i make that isk needs to be varied or i begin to lose my mind, get bored and play less.this is all because i understand that 90% of eve is the process of making isk, 10% of eve is spending that isk. if you have unlimited isk, everything loses it's value and becomes stale and boring. if you have the ability to fly every ship, none feel like the right fit anymore.so all of this leads up to....ccp devs most likely do not cheat or act inappropriately because,1: ia is watching (this is a stated fact)2: after t20, i'm sure ccp won't be very tolerant of any other shenanigans3: they would lose interest after a short period of timeever played a game, enabled the 'god mode' and then suddenly realized the game was no longer entertaining?edit: also eve is about the people you play with, if you play by yourself all the time you're missing the majority of the game. the best aspects of the game are done through team play, be it pvp, exploration, manufacturing, or anything. isk does not equal good people to play the game with."
4/14/2009,"they're not allowed to do that or have any major roles in player corporations, if they get caught the characters are deleted and they're reprimanded.so your whole scenario is extremely unlikely."
4/14/2009,"the problem with ores atm is that there isn't a harmonious balance. doing what you propose doesn't fix the problem, it actually compounds it. you're basing your statistics off a static price. but by inflating the amount of isogen, or nox mined, you're actually making their price drop, thus reducing your calculated profits.what needs to happen is an increase in the rarity of ores like isogen, nocxium, and mexalon by reducing them by 20, 30, 40% in rocks. this would ultimately create more demand due to their scarcity which would drive prices up more than the actual reduction in ores.at the same time, trit needs to be increased in these same rocks. the problem with trit right now is that it's supply is slightly higher than it's demand. by increasing trit by maybe 10-20% in low sec rock's that currently already provide trit, it would help rebalance this ore at a slightly lower price. idealy, trit needs to be trading closer to 3isk rather than it's current 4-4.5isk. keep in mind, none of the low sec rocks spawn overly large quantities of trit in the first place, it's more a byproduct of mining for other ores.nocx used to trade around 300isk per unit, isogen around 120isk per unit... you can see how they've drastically devalued as of late."
4/14/2009,"i have already talked with ccp about this during our first ccp/csm meeting in reykjavik. they're looking into how to make low-sec more appealing to industrialists, as well as 0.0 space. they tried to get it in the latest patch to accompany the prettier asteroids, but it didn't make it with so much on their plates.i expect the autumn patch to include this if they come to a good concensus, but trust me when i say they are putting effort into solving this problem. they're probably also going to change the way mining works, like they did with exploration. for now, it's a wait and see kind of thing."
4/14/2009,"you're making some pretty serious assumption about the scale of this new mining that i don't think are justified. remember, all mining combined makes up less than half of the mineral supply, and lowsec will probably remain the least attractive place to mine even after these changes, because it doesn't have the concord protections of highsec or the alliance-space protections and raw profit of 0.0 space. this is designed to make life a bit easier for casual lowsec miners, so that they can earn better money than highsec without having to scan out gneiss belts, but i am under no impression that tens of thousands of pilots will flock to these ores and wreck the mineral market. as for your concerns about mineral distribution in these rocks, i think they're rather unfounded. the proposed ores have more trit in them than most other rocks(they'd be #3, 5, and 6 for trit concentration out of 18), and their isogen and nocxium levels are fairly low. those markets may be weak, but they're not so weak that a lowsec isogen roid less than half as good as omber will crash the market. you're right that the crash in mid-range prices, especially nocxium, is what has led to this problem, but i don't see any of these changes making that appreciably worse. the goal is to make lowsec mining less dependent on high nocx prices, not to crash those prices further. even if they change the way that mining works, value/m3 will still be the defining characteristic of how worthwhile a particular roid is to mine. there are some ways to buff lowsec without changing those roids, but they tend to involve putting 0.0 ores in lowsec instead. also, this proposal isn't intended to just be a list of three new asteroids - the goal is to make lowsec mining worthwhile by whatever means, the suggestion for new rocks was a secondary part. double the mineral content of lowsec rocks and i'll probably be happy, but this solution seemed better. if they have already decided to fix the problem then this thread is just advice on how, but if they haven't then i'd like us to see that they do."
4/14/2009,"i've never been too adept with the formulas involved in calculating this stuff, but my best idea is that since the reason low-sec ore is less valuable is that it weighs more than high-sec ore...then wouldn't leveling the size of the ore fix this problem?they still yield the same mineral content, they are just easier to haul?i'm half in mind to go dredge up the thread calling for a complete mining overhaul because i liked some of the ideas propositioned there."
4/14/2009,"basically, (volume mined per time)*(value of refine)/(size of refine) = (value mined per time) = profit. so yes, simply lowering volumes or increasing refine value on the existing lowsec ores will increase profits in the short term. the reason i'm not fond of this approach is that lowsec ores are very nocx-heavy, and nocx values are horribly depressed right now. if we buff lowsec ores back to profitability by simply doubling them and if nocx ever rebounds(say, with a change in minerals from mission loot), then they'll be competitive with arkonor and bistot, which is bad. better to add new ores, less dependent on nocxium for their value, so that even if the mineral values change in future we don't ruin 0.0 mining inadvertently. also, if we're thinking of the same thread regarding mining changes(basically, make each roid contain multiple ores, and mining crystals let you focus your output on the minerals you want), then i rather like the way it would work, and would be in favour of implementing it. however, this thread is intended to be a fix that can be implemented relatively quickly without prejudicing future plans for the development of mining mechanics. that plan can still be implemented if this thread gets passed, but it'll take a lot longer to get rolling, and i'd rather fix the unprofitability of lowsec sooner than later."

4/14/2009,.
4/14/2009,agreed
4/14/2009,would it be such a bad idea to give a freighter's access to the corporate hanger on an orca?
4/14/2009,"hm, interesting idea.it might have potential to being a bit overpowered.but the idea has merit to it. lets see what others say."
4/14/2009,other than the hilarity and possible piracy fun things that could happen... the only reason i'm asking is an orca is supposed to stay on sight and provide mind links to the fleet.if the orca is too full... a freighter would be ideal for pulling the rock out and dumping it into its hold.of course i'm assuming that a freighter would be able to open up the corp hanger on a pos just like it does on a station.i'm not asking to give it any more than just simple corp hanger access... no cans no funny funny stuff.
4/14/2009,"unfortunately, i don't agree with this. the role of the freighter is to pick up a load from one station and drop it off at the next station. nothing else. more or less a freight train of rl. to have it pick up from a ship doesn't make sense. yeah, it would be nice as it'd certainly make my life a little easier, but that's why we have the smaller industrialist ships. no support.--isaacp.s. according to ccp, it doesn't have an actual item on the ship that allows it to pick up things in-space. the tube...thingy."
4/14/2009,"but it can use corp hangar arrays. if you want a fluff explanation, the orca is capable of loading freighter cargo like a pos or station./supported."
4/14/2009,"the only reason it can use corp hanger arrays is because those are attached to a station. as such, it doesn't violate its role. the orca <-> freighter idea does violate that role.--isaac"
4/14/2009,imho the orca is a mobile micro station.... in the sense that it has its own corp hanger.i'd figured there's no real reason to say no... but yeah i figured there would be some issues with it.and note i'm not being an ass about it either. : o p^_^;
4/14/2009,not going to happen.the number of variables involved in such a tracking system would be an utter nightmare.your just looking for the lazy mans method of selling a ton of junk.fine... i would likely use it as its convenient... but i'm not going to hold my breath for it.i would be more inclined allowing people to sell faction items without contract requirements over mass selling.
4/14/2009,totally support. especially after a long day of ratting and you just wanna unload all your junk to best possible buy order.
4/14/2009,"interesting how you call it an isk faucet. the risk of wormholes usually make it a challenge, and the rewards should accompany that risk.it's an interesting idea about making them useful, but they should first look into making some of the other items in this game useful (passenger 'livestock', trade goods, etc). if this turns into a massive isk faucet, i trust that ccp eyjo and his crew will temper the influx. for now, the economy is working fine."
4/14/2009,"i agree with that. but what does it have to do with the idea?except that passengers and trade goods don't get spawned by wormholes, fw and so on, and it would be a massive amount of work to get that implemented, while the system for this idea already exists and fits in."
4/14/2009,"to the op: you do realize when u spawn in wh space, you are in jump range of the wormhole... zomg! that simple jump out"
4/14/2009,"i am still amazed by the number of people who think wormhole space is supposed to somehow be ""safe"". it is a lawless zone just like 0.0, travel at your own risk and be smart about it."
4/14/2009,"unless im wrong which i can be in this case but i really thinks what he means is that he really hates gatecamps.. wormhole or not. but like qorrin said, your in jump range so use that but besides that if the op wants to stop the gatecamp, perhaps a negative bonus should be given if theres too much players in a fleet or just together near a gate ? like a proximity sensor thingy near a wormhole or gate ?but for what he proposes.. not signed at all.. no way. takes too freakin long to scan taht w-space ..dont want to do it a second time."
4/14/2009,yep definitely a dara cothrom post.
4/14/2009,"drake - you came back!ok, now that's outta my system, on to the op. several other people have already said you can jump back out while you're still cloaked. it's not like empire space where you end up 10 or 12 km from the jump gate and have to try and get close enough to jump without being seen.secondly, we always send in a scout - usually in a cov-ops ship or a cheap frigate to check the gate before we all jump through. so if there is a camp, your scout sends back the report and you don't jump in. that's what scouts are for. there's no reason to lose anything more expensive than a cheap frigate to a wh gate camp."
4/14/2009,yeah... i had to come out from under my bridge as i was having trouble tolerating my own smell.^_^
4/14/2009,"oh wow, when did they add a +2 targets to the sig amp? i agree though, the low slot versions of these mods should be more like 75-85% as effective as the mid slot, not the current 50%. the mid slot version would still have a bit more base str, and could be overloaded, and scripted, but at least the low slot versions would not be a complete and utter joke."
4/14/2009,"after that? fitting mods or an armor tank, usually, though a utility pdu if i'm tight on cpu happens sometimes. other than covops frigates(lol, mid slots), i can't think of a single ship where i've had enough slots, never mind too many."
4/14/2009,this...
4/14/2009,"refining arrays are useless for ore due to the 25% loss. unless you are mining arkonor then you are better off mining veldpsar in high sec than taking the 25% loss from refining at a pos. the annoyingly slow pace they operate at is a fair price to pay for not having to haul to a station, but the loss is killer and needs to go. they should behave like a 20-30% base refinery so you can at least get the loss down to less than a few percent with max skills and an implant."
4/14/2009,a simple and elegant solution to a pointless time sink for some people. supported.

4/14/2009,"alliance and corp interfaces need some work.part one: alliance roles and structurei would like to see executorship removed from being based on the executor corp and built into the alliance's own personal role's system. this overhaul would replace many of the workarounds requiring alt corps, alts and etc. as an example to what i'm getting at is that a pos for example would be possible to enable as an alliance governed pos or that individual modules on that pos would be openable to alliance control. this would mean...--labs/arrays would actually work, and they could actually have prices set on them.--pos gunners do not need to be in the pos corp if the guns are set to alliance control--if the pos was completely handed over to the alliance any alliance member (with alliance level fueling roles) could then fuel or switch out strontthese ideas are mostly geared toward more cohesion between corp and alliance assets, the corp's for example can still lock down specific poses if need be, but siege pos's could be opened to allow for a more able defense. instead of watching the tower go down because no one from that specific corp could break through the gatecamp.part two: bills and internal managementalliances need a structure in place to issue bills to their corps, ie for monthly dues or something similar, as well as a system of internal alliance contracting between the alliance and a corp or a member of a corp. allowing for not just internal trade but also for trackable agreements between the alliance's operational leaders and the corp's various tasking and etc.part three: the uiseriously, alliances need their own seperate system of wallets, divisions, especially when coupled with the proposed changes in part one. accurate information about the alliance needs to be accessible by alliance leaders (with appropriate roles).i'm sure this has been brought up once or twice, but i think it needs a refresher since all the other issues after qr's changes, and now apoc's as well."
4/14/2009,"no way! i use plexes to get a fight in my hull class, i don't want less fights. i love minor plexes.i don't think they should be more difficult, as it's up to the militia to fight for them, not the npcs. (the caldari rats are already way overpowered compared to the gal rats). i wouldn't mind plexes taking longer though, gives you more time to get there and fight.do not remove the plexes! they are a brilliant way to get fights in a particular hull class. however, this point (edited the rest) was kind of random. i agree that defensive plexing is easy and boring though.also, have to disagree here to. i fly in minors because that's all i have the skills for to fly well, and soloing in a frigate means you can avoid gate camps. i am not interested in shipping up so i can get blobbed, right now there usually aren't many huge t1 frig gangs, so a solo player (or maybe a gang or 2-3) can get some interesting and relatively fair fights.while i will be very sad that i can't catch the targets on warp in, i can agree that this might make plex fights a little more interesting?if you can find a way to make plexing fun, i am all for it. but what you have suggested removes what tiny bit of fun plexes already provide, which for me is fun fights in frigates (or cruisers). if you remove the number of plexes, you vastly reduce where i can fight (and how many fights i can get), and make plexes something that are blobbed over, which completely nerfs the solo or small gang playstyle. then it becomes like 0.0, big blobs fighting over just a few places. the great part of fw is the spread out, and size restricted, battlegrounds.while i am all for some improvements to fw (possibly rewards?) what you have outlined is just horrible. horrible! sorry ;(do not support."

4/14/2009,"hello csm3 candidates.let me start out by saying why i'm not running in the next election. i've got some rl stuff to take care of, and the csm was eating a huge chunk of my gaming time and family time. it's been a great run, and i don't plan on giving up before handing over the reins of power to the next ones who are elected.that said, let me explain a bit about what being in the csm has meant to me. i dedicate about one hour a day to pouring over the assembly hall, features and ideas, and other interesting tidbits on the forums, and sometimes need to dedicate a large portion of my time to creating new dockets for items i've decided to support.for those who think this is a free trip to iceland, it's anything but that. the trip did mean a lot to me, but it was mostly work. we had very little time to see the sights of iceland or indulge in the nightlife (which, given what i saw there, there is quite a bit of it).i've heard a lot of flak from the forums about how the csm is meaningless, and my experience demonstrates to me that nothing could be further from the truth. however, as a csm delegate, be prepared to wear your fireproof suit. there have been times when i thought about quitting the csm due to the negative feedback i was getting.one final thing: the csm is a team effort. if your idea of eve is a scammers paradise (which it can be), and think the csm would follow along those lines, i can tell you now that it's not. i may not have agreed with my fellow delegates or thought they were in the right with what they were saying, but i hope the record shows that i have supported them.that's about all i wanted to say - little snippets of golden wisdom from a delegate nearing the end of his term. i wish the next csm, and the eve playerbase itself, a great game. this has definitely been an experience for me, one i won't soon forget."
4/14/2009,agreed.

4/15/2009,wut?
4/15/2009,"it's a horribly contrived situation where a pilot ""exploits"" the proposed mechanic in order to make a trip with a jumpclone a bit earlier so that they can launch a titan right when they get the skill to 1(because of course you're going to give a titan to a guy who just finished training the skill to 1, right?) instead of having to wait a trivial amount of time to use their skill. and even the guy who came up with this ""exploit"" thinks it can be safely ignored, because he supported the proposal. this is why i say there's no need(from a gameplay point of view, i can't speak to the technical) to restrict skill injection in any way - all the attempts i've seen or can think of to abuse it are laughable and obviously contrived. it's a convenience with no drawback."

4/15/2009,"moms , especially asking for some love .we getting more and more posts about that. not many people will support them because not many people fly or produce the supercaps.i already posted it somewhere else but let moms bridge ships as well (maybe one bridge per 30min?)"
4/15/2009,bridging is lame because it's limitless and never puts the titan out in the open. just like dd are lame b/c titans only sit on the field for about 25 seconds.the type of fleet movement i posted is more practical and sensible to make these ships more vulnerable. the loss of a titan or mom should be an epic battle all it's own. right now it's a 30 second laughing stock with dreads.
4/15/2009,"i'll update my initial comment about defense... i believe 2x now a titan has survived due to tank... not because it was saved by a fleet, but because it managed to inch into pos shields in time. they deffo need more tank, and those proposed tank bonuses would do 100x more for those ships than any triage bonus.i seriously want rr carriers outta the game or limited to triage too, but that's another issue all together and would just **** people off here."

4/15/2009,"i don't really have an issue with deep probes having the same effective strength as core probes; the problem is that they are often not strong enough to resolve signatures at their finest resolution. this makes them largely worthless in most situations, as you will have to switch probe types at some point.i proposes that the easiest way to address this is to reduce their minimum radius to 0.25 (matching the core probes) or 0.5 (matching the combat probes), then adjust their strength to match as well. in other words, make them effectively identical to the core or combat probe, but with a longer range. this retains balance (once under 32au, they give no benefits over core/combat probes) but also add utility for those specialized in probing, via the higher max radius."

4/15/2009,"making low-sec more appealing to industrialists requires making it possible for me to mine there without have to first convince 10-15 other players that there is nothing in the eve world that they'd enjoy more than sitting there watching me mine so that the belt rats and player pirates don't kill me and take my ore.alternately, make the stuff so valuable that getting one iteron 3 full of low-sec mins out is worth throwing away a couple hulks with their fittings (and the ore the pirates took after destroying them), and the full itty that didn't make it out.industrial characters keep score in their wallets instead on their killboards and the only thing that will get us into low-sec is the ability to make more profit there than we make in high-sec."
4/15/2009,"a better fix would be 'illegal' mining crystals. massive boost to yield of low end ores.'devastating veldspar crystal'yield bonus 350% (175% is normal tech ii)usable in 0.3 or below, due to extremely devastating environmental effects (synergy with the devastating environmental effects of moon mining). contraband in empire. sourced from pirate lp stores, and rat droppings.this would bring the market forces to play in low sec, allowing veldspar to be mined there for reasonable profits to compensate the risk. also, this high yield, short burst, type mining, lends itself well to ninja style mining."
4/15/2009,"yes, this should be discussed.i love this idea, although balancing the numbers is obviously in order. as sep'shoni mentioned above, the problem for miners is the risk - in hi-sec there's concord, and in 0.0 there's your alliance, but it's a true free-for-all in lo-sec. a great way to decrease the risk is to reduce the time that must be spent as a sitting duck in order to mine enough ore. this could be a good way to get both casual miners into low-sec and overcome (to some degree) their risk-aversion, and serious miners into low-sec for the high isk/hour. it could also be a boon for player pirates, because it would mean more unguarded targets in lo-sec.i'm very curious to hear what herschel thinks of this..."
4/15/2009,"the illegal mining crystals proposal is a very interesting one, although there's a couple tweaks it'd need right off the top. most importantly, if you double ore yield in non-secure space, you need to halve the yield of the 0.0 ores, to keep the profit of 0.0 mining constant(since 0.0 is fine as-is). that means you need a crystal supply large enough to keep every 0.0 miner in arkonor crystals forever, meaning that these will have to be fairly low-value goods despite their nature as contraband. also, don't be surprised if 0.0 miners scream their heads off anyways, since you're making their life harder with no real corresponding benefit. that said, it does one very nice thing for lowsec mining - it doubles the yield of veldspar(and all the other ores heavy in specific low-ends too, but they're less valuable) for people mining in low/nullsec. this largely eliminates the large-scale traffic in moving around low-ends, because it's perfectly reasonable to just mine in place if you need a particular mineral, instead of hauling it in from jita. all of a sudden, 0.3 veldspar is worth significantly more than gneiss and is competitive with crokite, and lowsec mining is at least twice as profitable as highsec no matter what mineral prices become. to be honest, that's probably way too much of a buff, because lowsec mining ought not to be better than soft 0.0 mining. mechanically, this works out to be fairly similar to the proposal to make a wider variety of ore grades available based on sec status - in both cases, you're providing a guaranteed risk/reward curve instead of allowing market values determine what it looks like, which would solve the lowsec mining problem. on the other hand i like market forces determining what the relative risk actually is, rather than a dev pulling numbers from the air to say what it ought to be. all in all, this seems like a version of the multiple grades of minerals proposal designed to make life easier for rorqual pilots. it's far simpler logistically, but it lacks a lot of the tweakability and overall attractiveness of that proposal, losing things like highsec megacyte in the tradeoff. it solves some of the problems cleanly - lowsec will never be worthless again - but on the whole, i like the system less than the multi-grade proposal and less than the status quo. the details would be better than the status quo, but the structure would be worse. it's nifty, and in some ways it's attractive, but i think i'd rather fix the current system than implement this one. you certainly made me think about it, though."

4/15/2009,"why not? are you sick?on the topic of the op, i'm not sure what the issue is with allowing the freighter access to the orca hangars. can anyone explain what the supposed problem with this is? i mean from a game balance perspective?"
4/15/2009,"question 1: im trying to set a good positive example for people who post ideas...stupid or not.question 2: the freighter is a massive moving cargo can with the speed of years as opposed to minutes.aside from the large cargo hold... a freighter who can pick up gobs of stuff in space would be viewed as a problem.however... in the orca's (unique ability) corporate hanger... your limited in what you can do.an orca's corp hanger is not something easily accessed and is not the main cargo bay. for some reason i found it would be useful for someone to call in a freighter to pull along side an orca about to burst its cargo hold of rock/materials... pull it in the freighter..and the freighter goes off somewhere and parks or docks some place.an industrial ship of largest size can't handle that kind of inventory.the only down side to this that i can tell is just an extension of the orca being a secure can with the freighter being a massively large ""can"" that can only access corp hangers and hangers on stations let alone grab freight containers.it wouldn't be a problem if an orca could carry a freight container.... but it can't in most cases if at all.if a freighter can access corp hangers on a pos/station... why not the orca? and is it that big of a problem?freighters are very expensive and not entirely easy to obtain.so yeah.. i'm not really bugged if its lack of support... just wantted to throw that idea out for people to poke at."
4/15/2009,"my problem with the whole idea is that it isn't being done on any sort of scale with ships. if you want to transfer items via-ships, its done either the station or jettison. this changes the whole system with ship-to-ship. would i like to see this? maybe, but it does nerf the smaller industrial ships quite a bit (except the blockade runner) i've beaten my head on this issue enough. i doubt we'll see it implemented as we've had the rorqual and freighter/jump freighter around for so long that ccp didn't see the need then. --isaac"
4/15/2009,"hmm. i'm still not sure i see the problem. but since i'm not sure i have a firm grasp on the potentials problems, i'll neither support nor detract from the issue. i may just watch the discussion and see what happens."
4/15/2009,a: how does this nerf smaller ships? most players can't afford the expensive nature of a freighter or an orcab: how do you explain the ability of anyone to drop or pull or push items from/to orca's? : o )
4/15/2009,"um. you have realized by now that you're wrong about this, right? if not, i'll offer you the following:mining directly into the corporate hangar on an orca is a direct transfer from one ship to another."
4/15/2009,this was possible. ccp changed it so they cant.
4/15/2009,"one of the big problems of low sec is it's low control value for high risk and little reward. people say why risk it when 0.0 is safer. so to truely make this lowsec territory more desirable, why not make it a limited version of 0.0.sov1 and 2.for any system without an npc station, make it controlable by players. allow limited sov which would give the holders a slight travel advantage over others while never allowing them cyno jammer protection. this would offer pirates or attackers a chance at bridge networks and give defenders some defensive advantages.stationssystems currently w/o stations need to be allowed deployment. this would again help to populate lowsec with more incentives offered. for systems with npc stations of the holding entity, allow for limited control. this would include limited tax control over stations in system allowing holders to gain 10% of ore/refining and garner 50% of service fees on stations. story line could be something along the lines of:due to an escalation of war in the high sec systems of empire, the factions are looking for outpost managers of their more troublesome systems. to become an outpost manager, you need to do the following:hold sov claiming towers in system for 14 days. register with the holding faction and due x type of task to prove abilities (requiring numbers in excess of 25 pilots). alliance favor needs to be above 5.0 for 0.3's ... 3.0 for 0.1 sec systems. alliance favor = sum( corp favor*1+(corp member count/alliance member count)why?added to more monetary incentives to hold low sec space, and the less defensible status, smaller entities can get their slice of the pie, and a reversion to the older style of pre sov warfare can ensue. titan dd's are also removed from play.other features or comments?"
4/15/2009,low sec is the only buffer zone between high sec and 0.0.your proposing to edge 0.0 territorial grabs towards high sec.sorry... the focus of fixing that value should start on the high sec side... not 0.0.imho that is.low sec is much like a dmz zone for you 0.0 folk.... other than pipelines and routes... not that its demilitarized in the sense of the word.
4/15/2009,"people who stay in high sec do so because they don't want the risk. people who stay in 0.0 go there b/c the risk is their main desire.the only difference between sov 0.0 and 0.1 is conq stations. docking rights and services can still be allowed under this system b/c lets be honest, the empire factions want that income. this also has huge implications towards faction warfare and why someone would want to fight on any side. this isn't meant to be strict control over your space like 0.0 is, it's meant to be limited but incentivised. they can nuke empire mission running income by 50% and people would still stay there b/c of the lack of risk for the reward. the best thing yet to draw empire to low sec has been faction warfare, this is another step in that sort of direction."
4/15/2009,your being contradictory.you can't have it both ways.you say 0.0 is safer... and yet you said people go there for the risk.which is it?high sec is not safest... its safer... but risk is very much alive... its called war-decs...piracy...ganking.low sec has the greatest risk as its the best place for piracy.0.0 has the lowest risk factor due to the ability to take control of it and band together. and likely safer than all of them together as your not likely going there unless your in the alliance...blue to them.. or ratting.most high sec people stay in high sec for industry and marketing... and mission running.75 to 80% of the high sec population are in fact... you and everyone else down there and there alts and there mothers alts.so i suggest you get your facts straight.
4/15/2009,"0.0 is safer based on the short term. the overall risk is much higher. bob for example just lost the entirety of it's space in a few weeks. for 1 solo ratter, this doesn't matter, for the alliance scale and monetary affects for an alliance, it's huge. if you're a flavor of the week ratter, this just means move to another alliance. if you're a hard core alliance rat, then it means months of dedicated fighting to get lost assets and space back. the pos loss in isk alone is well over 200bil by goon pos kill estimates. i'd call that huge risk overall.so yeah, 0.0 is safer than a .3 for an individual, but for a group and over time not so much. the empire rats who do stay in empire are those people not willing to risk huge assets that can be lost at war. this plan allows for limited loss based on exactly what you're putting out, ie ships and pos... losing station control only affects tax intakes, not assets docked in npc stations. deployable stations are another jump towards risk, but it's providing scale for everyone, while allowing different options for anyone."
4/15/2009,like i said.. your pushing 0.0 political territory beyond 0.0.low sec is supposed to be dangerous...you should put this in the context of making life for alliances easier as far as sovereignty.if this was about making low sec more appetizing... wrong approach : o )since i don't participate in 0.0... not going to support or not support it.but don't bench it towards the high sec campers
4/15/2009,sure.

4/15/2009,summary of the problem:
4/15/2009,"that sounds fantastically annoying. something needs to change here, i agree, and your list of proposed changes in your gd thread seems fairly comprehensive. i don't like #1, because it cuts a step out that nobody else is allowed to ignore. #4 has a few too many knock-on effects for me to like, but it does solve this particular problem. #2 or #3 are my preference - #2 seems like it'd be annoying from a database point of view, and doesn't solve the problem of building hypothetical t2 capital ships, but it's the cleanest solution to this particular problem. if you changed ""packaged only"" to ""post a warning if you use an unpackaged"", though, it'd probably be the best generic solution. #3 is almost as good overall - repackaging ships doesn't seem like it'd be too broken or unreasonable, and it solves this problem and others like it cleanly. for that matter, you could just implement them both and i'd be happy. but yes, if #2 and/or #3 is the solution used, i'm in favour of this proposal. no need to frustrate the jf builders with this weird interaction."
4/15/2009,change #1 to components or t1 faction ship and it makes sense.but yeah... supported.

4/15/2009,"some kind of prenerfed to hell i think 5billion would be enough and probably lower the cpu/pg so maybe someone uses it actually. 3m pg dont even fit on an empty caldari tower.and maybe instead of the usual ""stuff the ship in that structure"" approach maybe make it so the mom or titan is ""anchored"" within x km to the array. so pilot flys the ship within 5km of the array and anchor his ship, gets ejected and the mom/titan takes 5minutes or something to anchor there. same for unanchoring and boarding the ship."
4/15/2009,"ok, yeah, i swung a bit hard. just trying to fend off the ""dont make titans impossible to kill!"" inevitable posts. hope the changes helped- removed flag on grid if used- removed stront penalty- lowered cost- shortened time to build- lessened fitting req's"
4/15/2009,"i'm not a supercapital pilot, and i'm not personally familiar with the mechanics of being one, but from what i can see of the numbers on the capital ship maintenance array, it fits the role you're requesting without any of the absurd drawbacks - it holds a titan or two moms, even if they're assembled. am i missing something here?"
4/15/2009,"you are missing something, as a titan or mom cannot dock in such arrays, although the volumes do line up."
4/15/2009,"so the capital assembly array builds them, they get moved into a capital maintenance array, and then they can never be docked again? that's...interesting. i didn't think it worked that way - i thought i remembered hearing about how people used csmas as docking facilities, apparently i was wrong. in any case, i don't want to support this, because i clearly don't know enough about the topic. i sure would like to know why it works that way, though."
4/15/2009,"umm, yes, that is how it works, the op is confused. capital sma is fine as it is without any of these absurd nerfs, though the ability to password protect ships in smas in general may be a good idea."
4/15/2009,"this is how wormholes actually work. gate camping them is a waste of time since targets just jump out. unless they are smartbombing to clear out cov ops ships, well then don't send a fragile frigate through first. use brains, stop whining."

4/15/2009,justice what justice? true evil doesn't care for justice! unless you are an imposter or perhaps you want to put to shame all those who voted for her... twice
4/15/2009,"well voting for a ceo of a small corp wasn't the reason, its the now bolded part, no point in voting for someone with a carebear only mindset in this game as many have said this isn't hello kitty online or wow for that matter."
4/15/2009,"ok. i understand what you mean now, i just wasn't clear what exactly you were opposing. and yes i do see a lot of opposition to the carebear mentality. to a certain extend i even understand it, i mean it is only natural to try to preserve aspects of the game one considers crucial. however the fact that the anti-carebear voices, are louder doesn't necessarily tell me that they are right. i even suspect that there are more carebears then we think in this game, they are by definition less confrontational, and therefore more quite individuals. while reading some of the texts in this forum i often come to the conclusion that they are more mature. ooops i admit that last comment was a bit far fetched and unfair over-generalization, as is the claim that allowing the carebeares to care, will somehow destroy the game for the rest of the players. i think that my question is still unanswered why should the so called carebears, even if in minority, not be represented by a carebear? no offense erik."
4/15/2009,"ah right, that must be why lowsec boosts, factional warfare and 0.0 sov were also covered. we represent all players, and do not cater to a single playstyle or any special interest group such as specific alliances in eve, as is clearly proven by my track record."
4/15/2009,"i guess people are a bit confused, on one hand you support different styles of play, which , as you say is proven by your record. on the other you form a party, which proclaims: ""while pilots of big in-game alliances will represent exactly those issues which they deem helpful to their cause, take care delegates will represent your cause"" ( i actually took the time to read your web page) that reads as offering support to the underdog. don't misunderstand me, i love the underdogs. i am skeptical only because in my opinion the name take care reinforces in some way the already derogatory label ""carebear"". don't you think that the division between ""carebears"" and the ""real eve players"" ( real because they do a lot of pvp player fighting player) is a bit artificial?in the end ""the big alliances"" feel that they can represent different styles of play better the you and that is why, rabble rabble."
4/15/2009,snake oil salesman.
4/15/2009,"well, if we take ""alliances in fw"" as an example, that's an issue that is clearly proposed by alliance players. i have no problems looking into their valid concerns if they ask me to. a lot of the issues i proposed do not affect me as a player at all, but i think they were for the general good of the game.of course some alliance candidate is likely to represent their particular alliance better, but i do not believe that alliance politics should be carried over into the csm. a more neutral view might be preferred. sure, the csm can benefit from the experience by having some of these alliance people on the council, but in my opinion the best council is a mixed group of all types of playstyles."

4/16/2009,"ok, iv'e been a director somewhat of the gr corp and one thing that my ceo really doesn't like is giving out roles like access to corp labs, what happens when you have access to a lab is you have access to not just the lab but the assembly arrays as well with ability to anchor, un-anchor and of line stuff in the pos. we need the ability to give more specific and individual roles to people without giving them full access to larger areas. we want our members to have free access to certain labs but we don't want them to have access to everything else as well.in all honesty corp tools were ment to have been looked into a loooooooonnnnnggggggg time ago and are really needed. not just this but also some new alliance tools as well to let alliances work more as a whole if they so wish to. corporations and alliances are the core of eve and thus needs a high priority on the to do list, and to be quite honest id rather see a compleate overhaul of the corporation and alliance tools/mechanics in the next expansion than any new fancy ships and items.to do list:- individual role sand permissions- allow all members to sell for corp/allaince without wallet access- ability to use singuler items in corp for example; individual lab access without granting rights to touch other labs.-ability to remove members from the corp without removing roles-alliance wallet/hangers-extend character limit of alliance mails if anyone can think of anything else please post hereedit: unerlining some major issues"
4/16/2009,"i think you can give access by use of titles, set up titles, then on the pos controles you can set different pos equipment to allow people access when they have that tittle, or somthing similar"
4/16/2009,"there's a lot wider range of changes needed here, but yes, this one's important."
4/16/2009,yes.
4/16/2009,"agreed, the corp management tools under roles and access are extremely unwieldy"
4/16/2009,you have my support.
4/16/2009,supporting my own topic
4/16/2009,"couldn't agree more, a look into alliance tools would be much appriciated."
4/16/2009,"yes, yes, yes and did i say yes!!!!! i can't stand those tools!"
4/16/2009,you have my support!
4/16/2009,adding my support since just figured out how to do it
4/16/2009,you have my support.
4/16/2009,...
4/16/2009,me too
4/16/2009,it should be looked into but at the same time consequences for standings should be expanded. having a -5 with an empire/faction should make life a bit more challenging when you are in that factions space.
4/16/2009,something along these lines
4/16/2009,good idea.
4/16/2009,things fall faster then that.we really need something done.right now i take a ccp stand point. what do they think. busted. or ok?
4/16/2009,supported.but missile in general should have a much higher dmg to make up for the very hard job it is to get the perfect hit.so that their base dmg is normal again and their perfect hit would be like when turrets hit perfectly.
4/16/2009,supercaps can't be webbed :welp:
4/16/2009,i'm not an awox alt and i support this topic.
4/16/2009,agreed
4/16/2009,"well, the illegal crystal proposals i've seen floating about all are for low end ores only. as for competing with 0.0, idont' think that will be an issue. with the numbers i listed for blast veldspar, you're getting twice the isk/min as in high sec. this is still far less than what abc will earn you (about 2/3 at todays prices). this is before this increase in supply has it's downward effect on trit prices. and while you may say there will be only limited use of these methods, i believe that numbers in this range would lead to quite a lot of alliance ops hitting the 0.0 veldspar, therby greatly dropping the demand on empire tritanium, which would have a significant effect on price (i'd guess down about 25-35% from todays market), as the empire centric demand would approach closer to the available supply. the other big advantage of the crystal mechanic, is that he only coding required is the legality check on miner activation. other than that, it's just the addition of the crystals to the database.this is not my ideal mining overhaul situation, but it is the quickest path towards a 'mid-term solution'. i feel the overall best situation for mining to find itself in is one where most asteroids are found in grav sites, and those roids are not 'veldspar', but composite rocks with a varried mix of ores. mining them yields a proportionate mix of those ores. crystals skew the proportion towards their designated ore type. this would also lend itself to the elimination of the variable ore grades (which, was a huge mistake on ccp's part, imho), as well as put even greated emphasis on prospecting out the best belts to mine."
4/16/2009,why not require all asteroid belts to be scanned before you go mine them.certainly would dent the macro miners. and would make lowsec a bit more challenging.along with the ore being made more valuable.
4/16/2009,i think the title says it all. why not give us a bigger character limit for us to write our biographies? let us fill our bios with more meaningless and fun stuff :d
4/16/2009,hell yeah i got half a pic in my bio need more space :p
4/16/2009,i support this :)
4/16/2009,it's a small request but worthy.
4/16/2009,i would also be nice if the game saved the last tab opened in the window even after client restarts.
4/16/2009,"this has been raised before. ccp won't do it, because there is apparently exploit possibilities with a longer bio. this statement utterly blows my mind, but it's the official stance. also, they're overhauling that whole side of the game fairly soon anyways - bio, mail, all that stuff. i hope it's soon. but yeah - everyone wants to do this, but it seems it can't be done."
4/16/2009,think in terms of a forum post herschel.bios allow for various tags and other aspects that could be abused.the more chars you allow the more code you can shove into that window.
4/16/2009,"the basic proposal is that ccp examine in depth the ecm mechanic and change it. the current mechanic is effectively broken both from a user and target perspective. in addition, a new second ew mechanic/module should be introduced for the caldari.from a user perspective the effectiveness of the module is chance based and thus can be unreliable and has a binary result.from a target perspective, when the modules are effective it is very debilitating. the inability to target anything results in the target feeling powerless and unable to take part in a meaningfully way beyond warping out.other forms of electronic warfare have a measurable, non-binary effect. this is both a strength and a weakness; strength because its effects are known and a weakness because its effects are known. ecm (and second caldari ew) should be along these same lines.---ideas related to this:one possible option is that ecm reduces the signature radius of the affected ship's targets. this is different from affecting the scan resolution of the affected ship and has a direct affect on the damage the target ship deals. from a background perspective this would represent the targeting accuracy being reduced by the increased static (not speed and range - that is remote sensor dampeners). the overall effect is reduced damage output of the affected ship.as for the second ew system something that either effects gang/fleet bonus effectiveness for the targeted ship or drone bandwidth/control range."
4/16/2009,"oh god, more falcon tears. they are in every thread now."
4/16/2009,so asking for them to change ecm entirely - as in no breaking the lock is falcon tears? also show me where i have ever owned a falcon or used a falcon.if anything for me it is rook tears.or you could actually read it and not assume a thread about ecm is someone crying about how their falcon is ruined. the proposal will likely actually nerf ecm more than the current changes.
4/16/2009,how about waiting for the patch before you start screaming.
4/16/2009,"i am suggesting the entirely change the mechanic. today's patch addresses a few symptoms of a broken mechanic and not the actual broken mechanic.i am suggesting ecm no longer break the locks and then stop further targetting attempts.if you read what i have been screaming about in other threads you would see it is generally not related to the ecm changes (plenty of people with complaints there), but rather the addition of drones to the falcon & rook and the fact the rook can now deal out more damage than a cerberus."
4/16/2009,"except for the fact your entire argument is based on an assumption.you should wait until the patch is released... test it out and see if the compromise is enough to work out.if you find out its not.. then resume your ""screaming""and no sisi isn't enough... live release includes fixes they don't always include on sisi."
4/16/2009,"ugh, bad idea = bad idea. ecm is fine. quit whining and play like the rest of us. --isaac"
4/16/2009,"plenty of people disagree with you (as evidenced by steady changes to ecm over time).if my idea for the change is bad fine, ccp won't use it. it does not mean they should not look into entirely changing ecm (which has been steadily changed over time). just look at the ecm ragequit thread, there are still complaints that the changes are not enough.that ccp should look into changing the ecm mechanics entirely is the point, not that they necessarily do what i suggested."
4/16/2009,and just which thread does this have overwhelming complaints of emorage?this one? ---->
4/16/2009,"support,sooner or later ccp will realize there are better ways of making changes, than the ol' slam it into reverse to change directionsi burned a lot of sp on making my sb a terror to ecm ships that sit on the edges during big fleet fights and now i've got to start all over again with torps to go after bs? eh?"
4/16/2009,"i dont see a huge problem with it. a corp hanger is a corp hanger is a corp hanger.. orca has a hanger, by not letting the freighters access it, ccp is say ""well we're calling it a corp hanger, but its not really a corp hanger and we're just too lazy to name it something else.""drake, nice post btw. getting tired of all the demands and vitriol flying around lately, thank you."
4/16/2009,like i said... im trying to set a standard.if you got an idea.... say it... but don't push it.i rarely post ideas as i tend to conclude they are crap.^_^
4/16/2009,"i have always wanted this capability on the rorqual from back when it was released. of course, it could be argued that when the rorqual is deployed, it truely is a station (albeit a very limited one). this was before the orca was in the picture. i could even support this on the orca, as it would provide a lot more opportunities for empire freighter ganks.as for fluff, the same advanced material management systems that enable the increased tractor beam range of the rorqual and the orca also allow the easy management of freighter loading and unloading."
4/16/2009,that.... is a very good point(s).
4/16/2009,i've cancelled two... join...
4/16/2009,"no.more of a change, less of a nerf."
4/16/2009,"see you later fotm person, don't let the door hit you on your way out etc etc."
4/16/2009,cancel more and cry me a river.
4/16/2009,saying no to a change isn't the right way to go about it.if you think the change could have been done differently then say so and that you think the csm should bring it to ccp's attention that they should readdress ecm and actually think through a change beneficial to the game.
4/16/2009,..........

4/16/2009,"while i am sure you'll be missed horribly, i ...ok, i can't do this with a straight face. you're an idiot and eve is better off without you."
4/16/2009,"in fact, i'll reverse your suggestion!! i'll buy two more accounts/characters and train them to use curses. that way, you will curse at me every time i use them. genius!!! lol--isaacp.s. i'd donate to ccp if i could for finally nerfing ecm."
4/16/2009,why hell.. i'll get me a falcon!yessiree!let's go get im!
4/16/2009,"cya. even after the range nerf, ecm will still be the most powerful ewar in the game."
4/16/2009,you will be back before the end of the month.have a nice break from eve . we will see you soon
4/16/2009,the only thing better than a falcon nerf would be if all falcon pilots canceled subscription. huzzah!
4/16/2009,qft. ecm is the least fun form of ewar.
4/16/2009,yes say no!! sell all your stuff and send all the isk too me! then cancel your account.
4/16/2009,"well... i don't like the new falcon, but i do really like the new rook. and hey i'm training gallante anyway.so: no."
4/16/2009,"for all smart guys... i mean: cancel subscription to say no, then resume it. do flashmob!"
4/16/2009,so more balance ingame is a bad thing? we must fight the dictatorship that is ccp all join and terminate your accounts!on a serious note:you actually think that it is a bad idea to add balance to ecm and make the rook now actually worth flying?
4/16/2009,"1. i want your stuff so just contract all your things to me.2. death to all people that whine about these changes... adapt or die [place curse word here]3. dont like the changes, post a solution and stop crying like a baby"
4/16/2009,"come on, we'll cancel together. you should send me all your assets and money first though, it makes more of a statement against the tyranny of ccp. :osrsly.just send it all to me with an evemail."
4/16/2009,no its all mine mine i say
4/16/2009,we'll split it... and then we will quit of course! *looks around warily*
4/16/2009,this tbfh.
4/16/2009,"too bad that most people on here tend to cry ""nurf nurf"" every time there is something in the game they dont like instead of adapting to it, which is entirely doable with the whole falcon ecm thing. it can be countered, easily even...guess the pitchfork and torches crowd always wins.edit : must admit patch info looks indeed not realy nerf like... will check when i get home"
4/16/2009,"by nerf, i think you mean buff."
4/16/2009,"i wholeheartedly agree with this thread.please remove more falcons from the game.also, ccp whimped out on the nerf that was actually needed."
4/16/2009,"your two falcon alts, right?"
4/16/2009,"um, no. not that big of a deal."
4/16/2009,"/me drinks the bitter, bitter tears of whiney ass falcon alts who are incapable of understanding that a decrease in range whilst increasing stregnth is not a nerf at all.also......adapt or die ^.^also......can i haz stuff?"
4/16/2009,actually. there's quite a bit of value in low sec. i know a guy who went exploring in amarr low sec. made roughly 1bil a week for fairly low time put in. the problem is epic lulz risk. pirates everygoddamnwhere. you cant do anything in a belt or deadspace. you are certain to die.tbh this idea could be good. except it basically means logistics become even easier. oh god. people are going to burn u with fyre for suggesting that.empire outposts are such a wincakes.so needed.though tbh in my opinion. value doesnt need to come to low sec.capship proliferation and less risk would be best.1. capships in low sec need to be proliferated much more.2. pirates need a much harder time. lowsec needs to be policed.
4/16/2009,"no, no no no no nooooo. you destroy hundreds of corps with this idea. one of my previous corp made a profitable living in low-sec. we had our days with hellish pirating, but in the end of it all, it was fun and profitable. we didn't have to join a huge napfest, didn't have to have 100s of pvpers. your suggestion will make low-sec, null-sec. we don't need it. i don't want it. low-sec to me is much more interesting and exciting. why? because i don't have to deal with bs politics from dirtbags such as goonswarm (yourselves) and other yaahoos. i agree that low-sec needs more incentives, but if you haven't noticed, ccp has made many changes here recently:wormholesgas mining (ladar) sites increased in value and frequencyeasier scanning and additional sitesbattleship ratslvl 4 agentslvl 5 agentsand that's, in my opinion, just the tip of the iceberg for changes for low-sec.no support.--isaac"
4/16/2009,"lowsec and 0.0 are fundamentally different, and extending one into the other is a bad way of going about this. there are many better ways of dealing with the problems of lowsec than this rather ham-fisted proposal. what are you talking about? there's bubbles, fancy asteroids, good rats, sovereignty, gate guns, sec loss, doomsdays..."
4/16/2009,"you both seems to forget that this was only duable because of a exploited system that made bob lose soverignty etc..so no, if not for exploiting 0.0 is safer"
4/16/2009,wth are you talking about?
4/16/2009,"if you want to put more candy in low sec and a bit less risky, just put a ""targeting"" limitation either on size or number. sure this is just a brief idea or description but something in the range of ""you can't be targated with more than x number of ships"" while in low sec. no limit in zero or high sec.same thing with size. if you flying a cruiser, you can't be targeted by a bs or higher let say.imho, that should get more people in low sec since theres less chance of getting ganked by 33938 ships on a gate or scanned inside a mission hub or plex. or problably not targeted by bc's while your in a frig/flame shield on/lol"
4/16/2009,won't work....the only way you could put a bit of a challenge on something like that is to eliminate local... since it seems to be so effective in whs.
4/16/2009,"we ... don't ... need ... more ... jumpbridges (to make your life easier/more secure), actually the contrary (less jumbridges, cynocampable ships, titans and all that crapp).sov is a crapp mechanic that is goign to be revisited (hopefully), don't extend it to lowsec, also it will reward blobers overall. fix (nerf) hisec rewards, buff lowsec rewards, make 0.0 more vulnerable (or less safe). but overall, this:nerf cynos, you can't jump from 0.4-0.2 to 0.0 (neither from hisec ofc). this will revive lowsec logistics and piracy, obliguin freighters/transports to move using the damn gates.about stations, alliance should have high standings towards controlling faction sov (5.0 at least), so this will make it hard for big fishes to control them giving smaller entities some options. but there is a lot of ways to bypass thios, not sure this is a good idea at all."
4/16/2009,yes lets break 0.0 all together.not
4/16/2009,two horrible ideas in the same thread. wow....wow indeed.--isaac
4/16/2009,oh noes your dyspro
4/16/2009,"is this your plan to take over aridia's moon mineral income? sorry, there is no other delve."
4/16/2009,sov and low-sec in the same post? no
4/16/2009,"i believe the market system in eve is one of the best around, however there is one problem that has been annoying me a lot lately. whenever i look for an item in the browse menu, i have to open several drop down menus. when (and i am sure this will have happend to you) i have no idea of either the name or group for the item i want, and i am in a bit of a hurry i will drop down multiple different tabs.personally i hate a messy market window so frequently spend 1-2 mins tidying it up.i beleive that if there was just one button to collapse all tabs i could save at least ten minutes per week. time which would be far better spent watching sports on a saturday or down at the pub.this is my idea and i hope it's a good one.many thankssilverswann."
4/16/2009,"yeah, this'd be handy."
4/16/2009,why not
4/16/2009,"ok, what happened to the in station graphics? they look awful now.and as for the blue bar on cargo windows, what was wrong with the old bar that worked fine, took up less space and looked better?finally the search box, sure, it is nice in the items window, but is is really necessary in cargo and cans? it just wastes space there.please give us an option to disable these (and just change the station graphics back...)"
4/16/2009,"i've posted a question in the s&i forum and got a response that i'm not happy about. just to make things easier i'll just copy/paste the relevant post and add a suggestion.i've created a vote in my corp to decide if we want to buy fuel for the pos straight out of corp wallet or to let the pos fund itself by adding the ""cost per hour"" and we decided to add the price. i've set the price up for each lab slot and it's working, but not as i've expected. bpos can't be researched from my personal hangar but from corp hangar in an office within the same solar system, thus the installer of a job is my corp, not me. the corp then pays itself for using a slot (?!).i don't know if it is possible to implement, but it would be great if i could set up a pos lab slot so any member of my corp could use it and pay the ""cost per hour"" fee for the research from his own wallet to the corp wallet (main or some other wallet division). the jobs would still be installed/delivered from/to a corp hangar division accessible to that member and the only change would be that he must pay for renting the slot from his wallet to the corp.thanks for your time"
4/16/2009,taking drake's stance on this one.why am i suddenly siding with drake all the time?????
4/16/2009,"the variable's are no bigger then they are now, or different from how it is now, it will just load them one by one untill all are loaded, would be quite fast."
4/16/2009,dream on kid... we live in reality... not in an illusion.
4/16/2009,just allow repackaging items at a pos... it would fix so many other pos annoyances as well (especially for wh dwellers).
4/16/2009,"sure thing,"
4/16/2009,stealthbombers have been fixed. this thread needs to be locked.--isaac
4/16/2009,"yes please, not that ccp is listening."
4/16/2009,"no... this is not their role.and they are supposed to get killing by small ships.but they need some seriously love to be able to do their jobps: yes to the bomb change. although bombs either need to be able to launch 3-4 at the same time per ship, or their dmg need to be at least dobbelt.since one bomb will kill nothing and you need around 10 of these to even touch a t2 ship. properly closer too 18 of them to kill it"
4/16/2009,"but if you read the csm-ccp 2.2 meeting log, you will realize that we already raised that issue and ccp thought that it was fine."
4/16/2009,"so?the dogtag handins are borked (some have been giving no standing for years), not repeatable and so on.this also provides means to gain standing for ratters and explorers which is a very important thing."
4/16/2009,pretty please.went to buy ammo for revelation and there's no faction crystals in oursulaert nor jita. at least if mission runners could supply some. it'd be good.
4/16/2009,moved to features & ideas.

4/16/2009,you have my vote.
4/16/2009,you have my vote.
4/16/2009,"well, if we take ""alliances in fw"" as an example, that's an issue that is clearly proposed by alliance players. i have no problems looking into their valid concerns if they ask me to. a lot of the issues i proposed do not affect me as a player at all, but i think they were for the general good of the game.of course some alliance candidate is likely to represent their particular alliance better, but i do not believe that alliance politics should be carried over into the csm. a more neutral view might be preferred. sure, the csm can benefit from the experience by having some of these alliance people on the council, but in my opinion the best council is a mixed group of all types of playstyles.i believe in your honest efforts. it puzzles me however, how many players engage you in aggressive polemic, and how few try to actually bring valid arguments against you. i mean whatever ""eve religion"" one believes it is clear that csm has done much good, ccp is clear on that, therefore i wonder what are you people doing wrong to deserve all that ""hate mail""."

4/16/2009,"the killer and the politician are from the same mold, the only difference is the method."
4/16/2009,"good point that is why i don't generally like politics. what i am trying to determine is what exactly is being killed here by so called ""politicians"" like ankhe or erik or any other representative of csm for that matter. even though they all represent different player interests, it is ultimately ccp that guides the ""politics"" of eve."

4/16/2009,"larkonis, you can't go getting drunk juzt becauze ccp ignorez you. if ccp ignorez you, it would behoove you to rally c&p to your cauze (that of reprezenting us pew pew playerz of variouz attitudez towardz pillage). in other wordz to paraphraze some famouz sayingz, ""don't give up the talk"" or ""never surrender, never give up"" or ""keep on talking, keep on talking"". remember if elected, you are not alone, your conztituency will be uz, your power baze, priwatz, privateerz, scammerz, and other fun loving eve citizenz, and we will support you. we know you don't have a magic wand to make ccp do anything, but you can hopefully get them to lizten to your and our legitimate concernz."

4/16/2009,"just wondering, but what is the point of your thread? i know that sounds a little harsh, but this game is built to be harsh. also, as for the numbers thing - eve's subscriber base has been growing since it's inception - how exactly is that a bad thing?"
4/16/2009,hmm smell that? smells like an alt. but whose?
4/17/2009,"yes :]and as its not really worth posting a new thread about, could we have the option to change the colour of that 'cargo cap' bar thing in our cargoholds? it sticks out like a sore thumb on my settings :["
4/17/2009,good lord can't agree with this enough.
4/17/2009,seconded
4/17/2009,"i support this idea, not so much for the ability to rent highsec research space, but for an easier way to organize space for a large number of members."
4/17/2009,"finally i gathered all my senses to finish this document. for the last year i was thinking about all the things which suck when it comes to supercaps i always knew the basics of what i would change, but was never completely happy with solutions i had on my mind. also the good part of the last few months i spent on numbers, doing calcs and all that stuff to try to balance everything as best as possible but i found out that i suck at balancing :d, almost the same as ccp :d so i will leave the final touch to them, if they decide to consider ideas i gathered and posted here. disclaimer: i talked with a lot of supercap pilots in the last year or so, and i will try to mention everyone i took some good ideas from, but please dont mind me if i forget someone.anyway, lets go. i am personally the owner of one mothership class ship - nyx and owner of a titan class ship - ragnarok. while i didnt play much lately on both of the accounts, the reason for not using the titan much is that i didnt have time and tbh the will to fly it lately, but when it comes to nyx for the last 6+ months i am logging in only to change the skills."
4/17/2009,"i will 1st try to generalize problems for both titans and moms and then i will continue with each specifically.main problem: - they die so easily its not even funny. solutions: massive boost of hp and supercap reps1st solution and imho the <U+FFFD>must<U+FFFD> one is a massive boost of base hp of both moms and titans. if we take a quick glance at the current numbers (unfitted just as a rough comparison) thanatos (carrier) has 591k ehp, moros (dreadnought) has 890k ehp, nyx (mothership) 1250k ehp and erebus (titan) 1575k ehp. if we take quick relation between carrier and mom we have price ratio of 1:20 and ehp ratio of 1:2.1, and dreadnaught and titan ratio is 1:32 price wise compared to 1:1.76 ehp ratio. even with ehp boost of 10 times price ratio and ehp ratio wouldnt be the same.2nd solution is the introduction of supercapital armor reps/shield boosters. i wouldnt boost them too much compared to regular capital ones, mainly because the intention of supercaps is not to be solomobiles. with all changes i will propose here, one thing must be untouched and that is <U+FFFD> if you deploy your supercap solo, you need to die :d3rd solution i was proposed which i dont like is the role bonus of increased armor/shield resistances. it would be too much imho, because it simply becomes a multiplier to spider tanking which is already powerful.4th solution is decreasing of sig radius to prevent dreadnaught weapons inflicting full damage except when a supercapital ship is not moving. before late 2007 this is how it was until supercapital sigradiuses were increased by approximately ten times (to make them more probeable). because supercaps can<U+FFFD>t be webbed ganking them with seiged dreadnaughts was challenging, and involved tactical skill both on the part of the dread fc in positioning his dreads, and the supercapital pilot in trying to maneuver to reduce the damage. the titan which died before this change was shrike in 46dp in a long battle involving sieged dreadnaughts missing a lot and hundreds of other ships. soon after the change thulsa doom was ganked quickly in a safespot by sieged dreads before any exciting battle could get underway. the real advantage however is for motherships because they'd become viable again in capital battles.other boosts of supercap ships related to both motherships and titans.1st <U+FFFD> increased size of ship maintenance bay 2nd <U+FFFD> increased size of corporate hangars3rd <U+FFFD> buffing/reworking clone vat baysnow i will spend just a few moments on one thing many people proposed but in different variants. its about turning supercaps into mobile/deployable/permanent structures. honestly i am totally against this, and i am not even sure how it would be implemented code wise. however i am open for any discussion about that idea as well."
4/17/2009,"mothershipsnow i will concentrate on motherships exclusively. there were many proposals about giving motherships higher damage but somehow i dont feel that dealing damage should be the role of motherships. with increased static and active tank, increased corp hangars and ship bays, they are a step above carriers but still not that much to justify price difference. one thing motherships have and i personally adore is the remote ecm burst. i would slightly boost it and allow it to break the lock of sieged dreads as well.there are some nice proposals for boosting moms as drone boats by edfromhumanresources:"
4/17/2009,"titansmy main dilemma here was in which direction titan class ships should go. even with the initial nerfing of doomsday devices, they are still way too powerful, and with increasing numbers of titans around, they are seriously threatening to destroy the phenomena of fleet fights. anyway as mentioned, i had 2 directions, nerfing doomsday or removing it. when i say removing doomsday, it would kill the role of the titan as it is now (if we exclude jumpportaling) so they would need another role, and the only viable one would be to introduce them as capital killer ships as they already have bonuses on their weapons. when it comes to nerfing doomsdays i will be honest and say i didnt have any idea what to do beside decreasing the damage inflicted, until yaay posted a great proposal, especially the aspect of doomsdays doing heat damage to modules:"
4/17/2009,"olympians - !!11!1!!while considering the option of removing doomsday devices, as mentioned above the only viable solution for me was giving them the role of capital killer ships. finally i asked myself if maybe its time for another class of supercap ships. my fellow alliance mate danny centurai christened them as <U+FFFD>olympians<U+FFFD>. (if we continue using greek mythology, the olympians are a group of 12 gods who ruled after the overthow of the titans, so its a really nifty name for the new class.)anyway, as we witnessed massive 100+ vs 100+ capital fights maybe new eden is ready for a supercap whose sole purpose is blowing up capital ships. they should be able to inflict massive amounts of damage to the capital size ships. to counter them being too powerful they need to be <U+FFFD>massively<U+FFFD> nerfed from the other side. to effectively siege one olympian you will need to support it with constant remote cap transferring (someone invited motherships to the party) because an olympian itself cant sustain the massive cap consumption of its <U+FFFD>siege module<U+FFFD>. their active tank due to low cap will be also nonexistent so you would need carriers, and motherships if you want to make sure 5 rooks/falcons/scorps doesnt shutdown your olympian<U+FFFD>s spider tank. basically if you want to deploy oly you need to deploy your moms, or its just one giant sitting duck. when it comes to production costs of olympian initially i wanted to put it between moms and titans (around 20-25 bil figure) but with huge amounts of isk floating around i am thinking maybe to make them more expensive than titans. from the other side it would totally waste any chance for some <U+FFFD>smaller entities<U+FFFD> to get ahold of them. maybe something like an increased price but decreased production time, compared to titans. anyway with the initial idea i am sure that others (hello yaay) will come up with more positive feedback."
4/17/2009,"conclusion: my initial motive for proposing these changes is to give more intense and more fun gameplay for both supercapital and all other pilots. with changes like this we will see many more supercaps deployed on the frontlines and many more of them killed (killed, not ass****d without the chance to live long enough for a 2nd rep cycle :d ). to be honest, i wouldnt be emo at all if i lost my mothership or titan after hours of fighting with my hull going down to 5% just to be boosted again and so on. atm a titan pilots combat experience is all but non-intense (besides praying that you will not die cause you were in lag for 1 minute :d ) and a mothership pilots combat experience is...lets say non-existent :di hope you recognized my motives and i am happily waiting all constructive feedbackcheers"

4/17/2009,no
4/17/2009,"looks like a well thought out a pretty solid idea, the olympian idea works, or allow titans to fit a seige module for killing caps, and give them a supercap repper, this gives a expensive ship some real hours in the feild as it hammers into dreads with heavy hitting vollys, whilst risking itself greatly, but more of a tank is definatly needed in this area."
4/17/2009,total support
4/17/2009,i dig it
4/17/2009,well thought out.
4/17/2009,good ideas
4/17/2009,aproved
4/17/2009,lets change it
4/17/2009,seems good. nice ideas
4/17/2009,lets fix it and i'll get into one of those :)
4/17/2009,"loving these proposals because they're obviously grounded in tons of actual supercap experience, plus good research of existing proposals and aren't whacky left-field dreams (mobile stations etc..). mostly just simple tweaks to existing stats. with predictable outcomes. for sound reasons. this was desperately needed over 18 months ago so just getting it fixed properly asap should be priority.the details of the olympian idea i'm not totally sold on but there is definetely room for another supercap class with a super-dread type role. fixing the existing supercaps should be priority of course, after that i'm happy to see a new class that'll be totally broken for the next two years"
4/17/2009,i suport the idea
4/17/2009,i fully approve of this product
4/17/2009,"that's a problem of remote repairing out of triage for carriers. simply put, they should be allowed to do any advanced remote repairs outside of triage... ie capital rr. logistics ships are the repair platforms of the game... and honestly, i'd rather they have a form of triage to speed up pos repairs rather than give carriers anything of the sort that they have now. capital rr are flawed in use and in range. they should have a much smaller range, a much smaller hp repair, but they were introduced at a time when pos repairing was crap, and were justified as such. now we get the **** ass turtle tanking as a result."
4/17/2009,"the changes as a whole i do support, the idea of anti mobile platform i'm against. there is a relatively simple coding update using current game mechanics to do the limited mobile plaform base that's needed, including docking ships, repairing, using the corp h anger bay, refitting, etc.... it's just removing it from an external feature to one linked to docking. docking can be as simple as a graphic of ""view ships"" while having these features available in their current form (ie fitting window with carriers) when docked, you just watch said ship move around space, going wherever it goes. logging requires you to be out of the ship, or risk jettison in unknown space. yest disconnects are a problem, but they're already a problem in game for so many reasons far worse than this. it's not a flaw of the mechanics of the ships, it's a flaw of the internet to have instability of connection."
4/17/2009,"there are some very interesting ideas contained in the op(s) and i agree that the overall issue of super capitals needs to be explored in a major way. even though i can fly an avatar, i have little interest in doing so as the the class of titans stands now.the proliferation of titans is something that it's probably too late to explore, but i believe a major problem with the ship class is simply the number of them that exist. tbh, i'd rather they had never been introduced at all. as they obviously have been, the need a serious re-working. i think the ideas put forth herein are a very good basis for moving forward along this line."
4/17/2009,"supported in principle however you don't need an olympian. what you need to do is remove the domesday and install the olympian as a modular replacement. that way instead of having a super capital smart bomb you have a directional target based weapon. think of it as a hail of bullets/laser charg or hybrid charges that one shots carriers and dreadnoughts.a slow rate of fire, stupidly high volly damage and overall dps fitting of a super capital.it is also a great way for titans to due against each other."
4/17/2009,"i like the idea of olympians, caps are spammed."
4/17/2009,yes
4/17/2009,i like the ideas. and i agree on the ehp problem of supercaps.
4/17/2009,"supported, awesome idea's give me a reason to put my alt into a supercap"
4/17/2009,nothing to argue about with the op that i can see.
4/17/2009,"so the proposal is for both classes to get vastly more hp, somewhat better reppers, smaller sig radii, bigger hangars, and clone bays that actually work properly. moms would get cool new drone types and aoe healing, titans would switch to ew doomsdays, and there'd be a new anti-capital supercap introduced. i like some parts, not so much a fan of others. more hp i'm completely in favour of. supercapital reppers just seem an unnecessary complication - you want them to be gang-dependent, let them live or die by their gang's ability to rr. smaller sigs are unflavourful, but they do the right thing mechanically, so i'll support them. bigger hangars and better cloning facilities are both good ideas. new fighters might be a plan, but i'd have to see specifics. aoe healing seems kind of wrong to me - i prefer the proposal to let triaged moms rr sieged dreads(but not each other) if you're going to give them a buff to their rr abilities. ew doomsdays i've long been in favour of, though yaay's proposal is less interesting than other variants i've seen. as for the olympian, it sounds somewhat interesting, but ultimately unnecessary. it feels like you're just creating a dread with bigger numbers. if we're going to add a new capital class, never mind a supercapital class, i want it to do something other than just oodles of dps. i'll support this, because i think you're on the right track, but there are parts i'm not really a fan of."
4/17/2009,/signed
4/17/2009,yes please!!
4/17/2009,"definitely needed. i use 3 x 28"" monitors plus a 73"" hdtv as a 4th monitor. would love to spread eve over three monitors."
4/17/2009,and a million asteroid voices cried out in pain...
4/17/2009,"yeah, thats pretty much what i was gonna say.loldefinitely agree though. granted, its not a gameplay breaking thing but i really think itd be pretty incredible if the scaling was right and you really did go 'wow' when you flew past an apocalypse in your rifter or whatever."
4/17/2009,playing eve for more than 5 years now myself i say its time to do this finally... at the very first day in eve i was already wondering about ship sizing... tbh at that time the stations have been even much small than they are now... at least stations have to be a lot bigger... take a look at jita 4-4 anyone else ever wondered how all those ships do fit into that small station???
4/17/2009,yup.
4/17/2009,"actually, maybe a boost to the range of a titan jump bridge and for a mothership to have the current range one?also, t3 ships now have the ability to be immune to all types of bubbles. as we have hics with focus scripts now, maybe its time for the supercaps to have their bubble immunity back?"
4/17/2009,"well, titans are bigger motherships for all its worth. the first titan class vessel was the jovian mothership. ^^but i agree, they should be buffed."
4/17/2009,been keeping an eye on this thread and i am surprised it hasn't gained more support.perhaps changing the thread title or starting a new thread with a title more specific to the proposal would draw in more support.zos
4/17/2009,i like the jump bridge idea.
4/17/2009,sounds good. i dont want my minmatar bs v to be useless.
4/17/2009,time to postnot that its any certain claim that something will change but posting doesnt hurt.
4/17/2009,"i took care of my minmatar capital issues by selling my naglfar, training gallente battleship to level 5, large rails to lvl 5 and buying a gallente deadnaught skillbook. this was very much like what i did to take care of the issue of large artillery and the tempest being incredibly sucky.my nidhoggur problem was also simple fix...i simply don't fly it anymore unless i'm jumping stuff out of 0.0 into low-sec or visa versa.split weapons systems on a dread are a joke. i like the idea of three turret and three launcher slots...let you pick your poison and still have some benefit for those of us who did both.additional buffing is necessary, of course in order to help bring the rest of minnie capitals up to par. i think the ragnarok is pretty fine as-is. i don't see a lot of change being needed on that front."
4/17/2009,yes i support it as well.

4/17/2009,"so, this thread is just about phoenix pilots whining that they can't blow a frigate up with citadel torps.blasters miss, missiles do reduced damage regardless of whether they're hitting a cruiser or a titan. it has always been like this, end of story. if this is going to be changed then i demand blasters have a much better tracking while in siege too but then the phoenix pilots will whine that my dread outdamages theirs one of the very few intelligent posts in this thread."
4/17/2009,"clearly minmatar caps need a nerf cause they can speed tank. seriously, give all missiles a boost in pvp and just mess with npc sig radius's and speeds next time if you want to kick pve running ravens in the nuts(which is fine by me)"
4/17/2009,"naglfar and phoenix use too be able too deal great dmg too a battleship, the citadel torp would hit them hard and could nearly take them out in a shot.was this broken, maybe. but it also gave theses two ships something over there counterparts. the slow speed of a citadel and delayed dmg too anything at range ( even 15km or more) really hurts the two ships.now we get the missile changes and they have lost that one small perk and gained.... nothing!where they could fight a battleships gang. they now can't even fight a single carrier. the dmg cut form a titan moving at 20m/s is just out right sick. don't even bother trying too hit a battleship they can passive tank you. i am not asking for the phoenix and naglfar too wtf own everything on the field. but i would at least like too feel useful in a cap battle. too point out one issue i seen. i was in a cap fight and the range was about 60km. the enemy cap fleet would die too other caps before any of my missile made it over there. i even aimed away from the prime targets and yet they would never make it in time.too top it off. if your phoenix died too there fleet any cid in flight was useless, would deal no dmg. adding a bit of kick too the already uselessness you might feel.so if you think the naglfar and phoenix are ok as they are you need too try using one and come back and see us."
4/17/2009,"no, i don't think it's funny, nor is it a bad thing, in my view. dreadnoughts already are almost uncounterable for capital ship warfare, in that you dump them down, siege, and need no support aside from interdictors to kill any type of hostile capitals since you're immune to anything other than getting popped. if you need a couple webbing ships to boost damage, so be it. not supported."
4/17/2009,"as topic suggests, the new probing graphics with apocrypha 1.1 are awful, i cannot probe for more than 5 minutes without looking a away from the computer to prevent onset of epilepsy, change it back to the previous graphics."
4/17/2009,also fix whatever it is that causes 15 seconds of system hang during the 'probe warping' stage.
4/17/2009,"agreed, im having similar issues"
4/17/2009,"while i won't go so far as to say it causes eyestrain, and i actually kind of like the effects... the new graphics are hard to work with, it's difficult to see your own probes under all the sphere effects and it does seem laggy."
4/17/2009,"all warfare is based on deception, and this works both ways. not supported."
4/17/2009,i'm astounded that this proposal has gotten even 5 supports. it's a profoundly stupid idea.
4/17/2009,"yup, since you are agressing, and not just stealing from a cargo"
4/17/2009,"i also support this topic. if i can park my whole ship in the bay, then i can park my whole ship in the bay and this includes its cargo."
4/17/2009,"i wonder how this would potentially change if they added cargo mass to ship mass... a carrier could become quite heavy, and therefore expensive to jump, with the mass of the industrials and the cargo.. the jump freighter could retain its fuel efficiency advantage.of course, i like the idea of cargo mass affecting every ship in game... there should definitely be an agility difference between a loaded up freighter and an empty one.oh.. and the awox alt bs is just annoying and seriously detracts from an otherwise reasonable thread."
4/17/2009,it is good idea and i support this topic.
4/17/2009,"ccp, change the contract system showing any price in xxxx (million) if its million or more than million.this is just to prevent the stupid and idiotic spam in any system and save your database maintenance costs.who is so stupid that it will fall into scam where an item is told to be priced of 2 m isk and it actually is priced 2 b isk... seriously... nobody.end this stupidity now. and save your costs also."
4/17/2009,"thing is, it does work - i just showed contract history on some scammers in jita/amarr local, and they make billions at it. and besides, if this scam gets banned, the next one will come along and be just as irritating."
4/17/2009,i take it you got scammed recently?: o )
4/17/2009,"i don't imagine making engine trials would be that strenuous or resource intensive, and its something about the game that really gave it some charachter. not to say the current engine effects look bad....but much like the badass cyno jumping animation...it appears that engine trails also succumbed to the void of ""really awesome effect ideas that have been lost in the abyss of lazyness"".but yeah, bring them back and make them better....i loved the trails from games like nexus and even some of the hw mods. just do something with them so i can tell which direction the vagabond/inty/recon is going, and because this space sim seems less spacy without them :(."

4/17/2009,we had engine trails?where?!
4/17/2009,"instead of creating new ores why not simply just increase the amounts of ore that all low sec rocks give? no matter how nice you make the rocks in low sec they will never be mined nearly as much as high sec or 0.0. this means that if ccp dropped the current ores rates there, and boosted them substantially higher, we would see more people venturing into low sec, but with the same amount of risk causing the other areas to still seem appealing.another thought occurs to me, why not boost the refine rates in low sec? bump them high enough that a person with mediocre standings with a npc corp can get 99% much easier. this would give newer players and miners a chance for better refine rates, while still not causing any issues to high or 0.0."
4/17/2009,"do you mean more ore extracted per mining cycle, or more total ore in each asteroid? it's a nice idea, but i don't think it works - why wouldn't miners just take their peaceably mined hi-sec rocks and ship them to a lo-sec refinery for easy extra cash, rather than actually doing all of their mining in dangerous lo-sec? there's currently no way to distinguish where ore was mined, and even if there was it would complicate things.perhaps the higher-density asteroids should be much rarer in hi-sec and much more common in lo-sec, and perhaps buff their refine yields slightly? i think this is along the lines of what you're getting at. that would make mining in lo-sec marginally more attractive, marginally hit hi-sec macrominers' profits, and probably not disturb mineral prices too much."
4/17/2009,"tbh, one of the things that you're never going to fix is the reputation low-security space has, and for good reason. industry is nearly worthless there, with 0.0 and high-security space giving equal or better rewards at far lower risk. this is only trying to combat the problem, not create a solution.that being said, the scannable belts idea has merit, and the results in wormhole space seem to make it somewhat appealing. if this scannable-only belts idea is implemented in low-security space, it will create more interest, but the root problem still exists.i do like the idea of the illegal crystals, but that would require a major effort by the balance team. you would have to majorly limit their spread (similar to how faction towers are limited now), but not making it a money-losing venture with the costs of said crystals.if you only made them for low and high security asteroids (it's a new technology, other asteroids use too tight of a laser beam compression, etc), this idea would be nice. this would allow people to use them in 0.0 space as well, but only for the more 'mundane' ores, giving them a competitive stance without blowing everything out of proportion.although it's too late for this topic to be presented this weekend, i will add it to the subsequent csm meeting's roster, as i think the idea has merit. supported, in part."
4/17/2009,"oh, i can think of a million ways to make a bio obnoxious, and twice as many on how to make it obscene. but an exploit? like, an actual ""the game is no longer functioning properly"" exploit? that just seems bizarre."
4/17/2009,"yeah it puzzles me too, in the conversation i tried to pry details loose, but all i hit was a big wall with ""we don't discuss exploits"" and a blank expression."
4/17/2009,"this is the old ""isolate your system from your text values"" problem which is best summed up as follows.a young man is enrolled in school by his parents. once his enrollment is complete and his application submitted to the database, the database suddenly ceases to function. upon checking, the dba finds that the database no longer exists.the root cause:through some fluke of parental geekiness, the young man's name was ""drop database;""-*the point to all of this being, if it's true that you can input text into the bio that can result in a game exploit, then there is an underlying design issue that needs to be addressed, regardless of whether they make the field length longer or not.*-disclaimer. of course this never really happened. it's an example from a class i took about the dangers of not properly isolating your system from the data it stores."

4/17/2009,hilarious strip!but yes... sanitary bios are the way to go.did i just make an oxymoron?
4/17/2009,"i think some bio's could ""lag"" people who were looking at them, so ccp fixed this by reducing the character limit. if you can't fit into a bio what you want to say about your character / corp then post stuff on a website and link the site to your bio. even better linky it to a soite that is in-game compatible.if ccp didn't feelit necessary to reduce the character limit in bio's, they wouldnt have done it."

4/17/2009,"there is something severely broken in the npc cost for the bpos for the ore mining barges - especially when you take into account the cost of the orca or rorqual bpo.the retriever hovers about 0.9b isk for the bpo, and has a manufacturing cost around 4mthe covetor hovers about 2b isk for the bpo, and has a manufacturing cost around 10mthe orca hovers around 0.82b isk for the bpo, and has a manufacturing cost around 300mthe rorqual hovers around 3b isk for the bpo. and has a manufacturing cost around 1000myes, i'm aware their are capital component needs for the orca and rorqual but the coveter (and the more useless retriever) compared to any other ship in their area of manufacturing are significantly less. 30 - 40m cruiser class bpos generate ships worth 5 - 10m each, but when it comes to the barges you're looking at an investment in isk you can't recoup for decades. it seems off balance.even if you invested in the orca specifc capital component bpos that's around 6b isk more, but with a decent profit margin on the ship you can recoup that much faster than you can on a retriever or covetor."
4/17/2009,didn't it occur to you that the said worthless bpo's are required for tech 2 manufacturing?
4/17/2009,your point being? lots of cruiser class bpos are needed for t2 ships and they don't cost billions.

4/17/2009,that thread is a complaint/ragequit reaction to the changes to the falcon; my proposal is that ccp look into a total redesign of ecm to both address the concerns of those on the receiving end and those using it.i suppose i should have proposed this months ago instead of when a patch changes the ships and modules that utilize the current mechanic.here is a 5 page discussion (some may called it a whine) regarding ecm from months ago.
4/17/2009,there's a difference between a ragequit thread and a discussion on tactics thread.which is what you just pointed out.your on reallllly shaky ground here.i suggest you try to come up with something a little more concrete.i'm not denying there might be a problem...but i failing to see that it is a problem that serious.
4/17/2009,"i pointed to a thread in the warfare & tactics section; it discusses the psychology of electronic warfare and points out why ecm is poorly designed mechanic.my understanding is that ecm mechanic has been modified three times in some way.1) modified to a chance based effect.2) modified the overall effectiveness of the modules so they are no longer effective unless used on an ecm focused ship (griffin, blackbird, scorpion, rook, falcon)3) recent changes reducing the overall effectiveness of ecm including range and strength.three changes to the break & stop lock mechanic and associated modules shows that there is something with the basic mechanic that is unwanted. yes the current changes have reduced the range and strength of ecm. however, when ecm is used the targeted players (who will be fewer now) are still going to have the same effect happen to them. their ability to target will still be removed and the choices they have for those 20 seconds will still be warp or sit there and spam the lock key. even with the reduction in strength, it is still possible, less possible, to perma-jam* an individual target.so ecm still targeted first (not fun for the user) and if it doesn't go down still not fun for the target.*perma-jam being a state in which a ship is unable to target and take an action against the selected target for more than 10 seconds. chance for a single racial to jam an average hac (str 15) is roughly 60%, 2 jammers 84% chance one of them is effective, 3 jammers 93.6%."
4/17/2009,as far as i know ecm works on probability based on the percentage of the chance of a succesfull hit.so by definition it is not a perma-jam.skills that push that limit to as close to 100% as possible make it look like that.which is why i refuse to favor ecm nerfing.it's called tactics.
4/17/2009,"and that single phrase, permajam, which i defined for my purposes, seems to be the single thing you took away from my previous post. i am well aware that a number close to 100% is still not 100% and thus a state of being permeanently jammed does not exist by definition.but the definition doesn't matter as much as preception. to the person getting jammed 95% of the time, it seems like 110% of the time. frustration ensues, they come to the forums, join a ""nerf ecm its bad"" thread and the complaints build up, some players quit until eventually ccp decides to once again 'balance' ecm.you do not dispute that there have been 3 changes to ecm to attempt balancing and that 2 of the 3 changes have not fully addressed the issue (or there would not have been further changes). continuing down this course i would expect that ecm continues to be nerfed until it is entirely unused.i am suggesting that instead of waiting for another round of whines (i can picture the rook centered ones now); ccp begin to look at ecm mechanic design alternatives and not make it a chanced based binary effect (current situation) and instead to a always works, precentage effect (rsds are an example of this)."
4/17/2009,give us back the old bombers ... the new role you thought of ist completly different and you screwed over a lot of people
4/17/2009,the nature of freighters is purely civilian with no military application.i think freighters should be allowed to utilize tech 1 defensive shielding modules.
4/17/2009,"so you want mid slots on freighters? after all, nobody will ever fit a scrambler or a mwd in there instead. for that matter, there's no existent game mechanic to limit someone to only fitting a specific type of module on a ship - what are you going to do, a role bonus of +9900% cpu requirement for everything that isn't what you want them to fit? no. just no. don't make them fit modules to have the proper hp level - if you want them to have a certain amount of hp, just give it to them."
4/17/2009,here are the rules for freighters i follow:1: you use autopilot - your dead2: you flying in low sec/0.0 - your dead3: you stay parked at a stargate - your deadseriously... if you can't figure that out... you deserve to have your ass ganked.
4/17/2009,there are many options that could work:1. orca/rorqual role capability that allows freighter interaction in range (appears as a tower to the freighter)2. anchorable 'freighter dock' that emits this capability.3. high slot 'docking port' module that immobilizes the fit ship and allows freighter interaction. (relatively long cycle time to make it a decent trade-off... plus losing that one of three high slots on the orca would be a significant sacrifice).4. probably other ideas out there as well....
4/17/2009,"i like it. but i'd want some economically minded folks to examine the idea first, to see how much of a boon this would be for macrominers, and if so what its likely effect on mineral markets would be. i like the idea of making corporation mining ops less hauling-heavy, but not if it affects prices in a big way."

4/17/2009,"w/o sov 3, it wouldn't change what's current would it?the point of this is to create an unprotected pvp haven. it's safer investment than 0.0, but riskier in the sense that jammers aren't allowed. right now, fw is pretty dull. i've tried it, it failed. this is a way to give fw a new life, and a new purpose. fight for the amarr and you're rewards will be great. fight for the caldari and the stations become yours. the whole point of the major task required for station taking is that it would be faction warfare driven. actual faction would also either be warfare or quest driven, so 2 avenues, both more consistent with empire's current path.concept wise, story wise, i think it plays in quite well with the game's current path. will 0.0 people be tempted to come to low sec, yes, but they're gonna be super busy defending low sec and 0.0 both if one of the 2 is unprotected by jammers."
4/17/2009,so basically you hate cyno jammers and factional warfare but want to combine both ideals into one (no cyno jammers + incentive to low-sec combat) how about this:no.--isaac
4/17/2009,"faction warfare is dull because at the end of the day, it has no real affect on the game, the climate, etc.cyno jammers are dull because they deter fightsfaction warfare as a 2nd source and as an introduction to pvp is a great tool, and i do like the concept, but the execution is lame. people fight based on incentives, faction warfare offers very little considering the risk you put your wallet at. this is a more direct approach with real incentives, because lets face it, ehonor isn't gonna carry faction warfare on it's shoulders.."

4/17/2009,"you are probably right about that, many players that enjoy the style of play you describe wouldn't even consider voting for them. it is completely natural to support what you believe. the problem is that this discussion often becomes too black and white and the arguments people offer to support one style of play versus another entirely ignore the areas that we all share. as the result the whole issue becomes an ego trip on who is against who. as otri sarcastically pointed out earlier: the forum becomes an extension of the game, and we just keep pounding each other completely forgetting the gray areas we share.i spend a lot of time in 0.0, we operate a pos there, confrontations are inevitable and often necessary, but when hauling fuel or minerals we have to avoid gate camps and we don't enjoy meeting pirates and we try to avoid them. when doing occasional missions for isk one tries to avoid pvp fights since one is usually fitted for pve. is that a confrontational style of play or not? if i do not engage in pvp everyday does that mean i don't enjoy confrontation? perhaps i am an exception. nevertheless, the changes that have been appearing recently, including the one's lobbied by ankhe benefited all areas of gameplay. moreover, ccp is quit good in correcting solutions that have a clearly a negative effect."
4/17/2009,"he is pandemic, they are ""badass"" , isn't that enough to challenge carebear mentality"
4/17/2009,"to clarify, i have both industrial characters and those whom are -10.i am worried to the extent to which i see eve favouring ethics of game design that make it less of a cold dark and harsh universe, to paraphrase devs from a while back, and more of a generic wow in space game (yes i am overstating the issue and using a oft bandied around phrase). i am sure my meaning is obvious.i want to see industry, empire mining (of the non-macro kind) and invention to get a boost. i want moon mining to become a dynamic enterprise as opposed to static resources that huge power bloc's fight over.i would love to see empire mission running become considerably less profitable and reprocessing from loot nerf'd into the ground.i want suicide ganking to become more viable. the hp buff redacted in part.lowsec buffed, the current situation is still a farce.empire wardec corp hopping fixed. you can sum up most of what i want to see: 'eve should funnel people towards lowsec and 0.0 rather than creating static divisions between players. empire should not be as safe as it is, empire should offer far lesser rewards to its inhabitants than lowsec and 0.0.'i don't believe erik will see this happen on his watch. i do believe such lunacy as 'pvp flagging' is a distinct possibility were the csm to be steered by individuals such as himself and his mentor."
4/17/2009,"thank you for this answer i can relate to that, nevertheless i believe that this game has enormous potential, a potential to encompass many aspects of sci-fi universe, both dark and light side. this genre always encompasses that epic straggle, and without it it would loose its appeal. as it appears, ccp knows that, and creating a universe with a multitude of experiences is their goal from the start.you are talking about game mechanics which would enhance the harsh aspects of the game, so from this point of view it is kind of clear why you would not agree with my vote.myself, i like the role playing aspect of the game and from that point of view the eve story is definitely harsh enough, if you read my toon's story you will see that it is rather dark. therefore i don't see the need to get the players forced out of highsec areas to create more carnage. with the help of my imagination i find plenty of harshness and you cannot say that the game lacks fighting opportunities. just look whats happening in gw after fdn disbanded"
4/17/2009,"sup, i had a look at this ""track record"". it's all **** by the way (except overview exporting)."
4/17/2009,"i assure you that that are not take care's intentions.i personally ran an ultima online server of which i rewrote a large part of the ruleset, and guess what, it had a pvp ruleset, and not even town guards, except for the capital city and what the player created towns supplied themselves.we don't want to turn the game into hello kitty online.agreed there.i supported the motion to reduce mineral gain from loot. mission running for the casual player is just fine, the pimped ships are generating a bit too much cash, but are also at the risk of getting suicided so...suicide ganking is still pretty viable, and the nerf i had a part in was never aimed to reduce its viability, it was to counteract the imbalance that there was no consequence for suicide ganking and it's practically a zero-risk game. i've had people whine and complain that i ruined their ""200+ mil per hour"" easy money source, as if that is balanced in any way.if people earned permanent criminal records and insurance gets voided so there is actual consequence, maybe then we can talk again.agreed, veldspar earning twice as much as lowsec ore is a f...ed up situation and just one of the things wrong with lo-sec.ccp said that the current wardec system is a pay-to-grief mechanic and i agree. the whole wardec system could use an overhaul to make the entire thing more meaningful.agreed that it is stupid that 0.0 players are going back to high-sec to mission run. 0.0 and lowsec should provide more income sources for individual residents, not just static moon mining that goes into large alliance pockets. there should be viable targets for small-gang warfare. i provided a lot of input for the 0.0 overhaul we'll be getting later this year, and i hope you guys will like the results.you're making very wrong assumptions."

4/18/2009,"assault ships (assault frigates) are currently the only t2 ships which do not receive 4 bonuses. it is only fair that this is addressed, and a lot of the ships in this class are in desperate need of another bonus:hawk and vengeance: these need a second damage bonus, as they are currently outdamaged by the kestrel, a t1 frigate, and rockets in general give very poor performance for their fitting requirements. it is increasingly common for the vengeance to be fitted with blasters or lasers as even without bonuses they will outperform rockets. this is surely a sign something needs to be done.wolf and jaguar: given the concept of minmatar ships as being fast moving, outmanouevering their opponents and dancing around them, the lack of a tracking bonus on these ships is absurd. given that their t1 counterpart, the infamous rifter, receives this bonus, it is quite clear that it is necessary for the role they are most often required to perform; engaging the enemy in a tight orbit, using their superior speed to avoid the guns of a larger foe.the other ships in this class, whilst having no glaring flaws, are still in need of help. for example, it is worrying when gallente pilots in need of a high dps, take no prisoners blaster using frigate will pick an interceptor, the taranis, over an assault frigate, the enyo, everytime. in my view that is indicative of a serious problem with assault frigates, and i believe a 4th bonus will justify the cost of these ships and make them perform the way they should."

4/18/2009,"in full agreeance with vuk. though i did here somewhere the idea of giving a mom a temp... blast shield, that could extend around a fleet like a pos shield with a limited ehp. this shield could defend a fleet from a titan, like a mom level triage. if i remember it correctly, it would immobilizes the mothership completely and give it reps bonus's to hp but shorten the range. a shield would open around the mothership that ships could travel through at a reduced velocity, they would be immune to targetting or being targetted (as a pos shield is). the counter to the titan dd, effectively shielding those units that are near the mom when the titan deploys, now one restriction is how does one know when to deploy and if one does will a titan dd? i cant remember if they talked about this in their post.anyway that was something interesting that i read that i thought could possibly work.make mom's useful outside of pos decorations and epeen measurements.... and docking would be nice cause i agree they are just as big as a pheonix and arent as tall as a naglfar so why dont they fit!"

4/18/2009,"explain to me the point of a titan if it doesn't make newbies go ""holy ****! a titan!"" a weaker doomsday would remove this reaction."
4/18/2009,"rough principles i'd go with;-any changes should not create super mission/rat ships and any change should be checked against this risk. -caps and supercaps should be pvp and not pve, at the very least this keeps isk moving in the right direction in the eve economy.-caps and supercaps should encourage teamplay and playstyle/gameplay developmentideas and feedback on suggestions so far;i like the emphasis on ewar, as the main weapon of a titan, with all ship systems being fried (heat damage) with an area effect weapon and perhaps a focussed fire weapon designed to nail cap ship systems (heat damage), making them easier to kill by supporting ships. also, an area effect warp scambler module for titan use, to pin an enemy fleet. definitely support the bridge radius extension. also for future development could the titan create a temporary wormhole to who knows where, as a last resort for it/fleet.... giving new gameplay opportunity? moms should be able to repair heat damage using perhaps a repair bubble that ships warp to in the intensity of battle, aiming to get back into the battle after completion. a second bubble could do as suggested and act like a pos bubble when on campaign. changes to hangers/vats/maintenance bays supported. survival time for a supercap needs to be engineered to be at least 30 minutes, to allow for cta to get help in and around which a big battle could rage. not sure whether hp increases etc are the way to do this .... i would rather see the need for reliance on a support fleet (racial repper ships) fitted with new cap repair modules, or treat them like pos' with a re-inforce period to save them. if we have to increase hp's then it should be on moms. purpose of titan should be offence and moms defence. super cap survivability needs to improve but should be through team support not boosting.if i was going to introduce a new cap ship it would be an ewar cap. this would be paper thin and need a bay filled with repper drones and racial t2 repper ships to survive but would have the ability to take down a pos shield, with a long recharge time. this would remove the need to conduct the dull pos bashing exercises alliance pilots ""enjoy"". this ships survivabilty must be extremely high if it's well supported with the right ships/drones.we are where we are but imo any changes should take us in this direction."

4/18/2009,if you recall the first titan. he loggoffski with aggression. giving them 15mins to kill him. lets say they boost the hp even more.titan pilots are only going to logoffski even more; with primarily more passive setup tanks... ex eanms instead of hardeners.why not just an expensive tech 2 version of the capital rep. where the cost essentially dictates that supercaps use them. while reg caps can use them... but is silly. kind of like officer fitting your nidhoggur.kinda what they do already?this is the funny thing. if you put a hyperion next to a thanatos. the hyperion more or less is the same size if not larger in volume. yet its sig is much smaller. on the otherhand... pheonix and naglfail already can be speed tanked effectively well. especially so by supercaps because u cant be webbed.the thing is... back in the day you had uber canned out iteron 5 t2 rigged carriers jumping tons of stuff. so they were kinda kept so low. now the ship maint bay is so lacking that it's basically a joke.heh.
4/18/2009,"although i am rather a fan of the titans being reworked more towards mobile bases, any change is a good change.to increase the survivability of supercaps one could think of a short-term reinforced mode."
4/18/2009,"the reason i upped the rof on the dd in that scenario is due to the titans being more exposed on the field. lower damange means better chances to tackle, warp disruption means static titans. so as a trade off, they need to have a higher probability of affecting the fleet. bare in mind, the repeated use of a dd won't necessarily save them like it currently can. it does however give them more of an advantage over a fleet than a longer rof would. titans are meant to give smaller fleets more opportunities to fight back, 1 x an hr rof is detracting from that goal.the idea is titan comes in, dd... fleet comes in immediately behind, starts mopping up tacklers while the enemy fleet recoups, titan hopefully escapes, if not, countdown beings til it runs another dd. smaller fleet is now dealing with a less effective fleet due to heat damage and the minor racial damage while trying to salvage the titan use. smaller fleet is also receiving the benefits of titan gang bonuses. titan tank keeps it from being ganked in 2 sec.next goal is for either side to escalate the fight to either try to save or kill the titan. but ultimately, the titan is still effective in it's own right ever 20 min beyond it's current ability to use it's guns and drones in fights.point is to make the fight around titans epic. this would be a movement towards that goal."

4/18/2009,this would be so nice to have.
4/18/2009,"i would love this now, but i think it would be even more needed once ambulation comes out. since ambulation seems to be more about adding flavor, feel, and immersion to the game. it wouldn't be very effective to have to minimize everything just to enjoy the environments.i'd like to be able to shove all my windows to the other monitor and see the stations in all their glory, unmarred by ui."
4/18/2009,support
4/18/2009,"yes! this is a great idea and i think i can speak on the behalf of most people in eve in saying that ccp should implement this with ambulation.have a look at this, anyone who has'nt seen this page:"
4/18/2009,"this really isn't a new idea, and this is very close to most the previous planetary interaction threads out there... planets consume and produce items, those items are used to build stuff, and to support other planetary colonies... on its own, i don't think this particular interaction really adds anything to the party, and seems awfully simple.. feed it what it wants, and it gives you what you want... just seems a bit too dry to me.i do like the interaction through the anchored dock, as it makes the most sense in the eve gameplay.. again, nothing really new here.what i would like to see are planetary structures that could be built... a given structure would require a certain population (of a certain type).. it would also take an input material, and provide an output. the population itself would have its own needs, as well as security/unrest and moral/loyalty stats.example structures could include- farms, which would require laborers, consume soil, water, fertilizer, and produce foodstuffs (grain, food, etc)...- ranch, which would require laborers, consume grain, water, and produce meat and fertillizer...- university, which would require professors, consume any general population, and produce upgraded population types...you get the idea... this would bring new value to the many passenger types floating around new eden. slaves could be substituted for certain population types, and facilities (vitoc initiation centers) could be used like the university to create slaves from other population types."
4/18/2009,anything is better then the current system
4/18/2009,"i was starting to think along such a line:one step back: space dust as the origin of mineralsinstead of fixed belts and a certain ammount of minerals and ores, as well as having a fixed respawn time each sector is assigned several local variables being different dust densitys. dust density describes how many particles of a specific type float around in a system. there is each a density for each ore type additional for none refinable ores.under certain gravimetrical circumstances space dust collects to more condensed micro roids and this micro roids eventually combine to a bigger roids which will attract more micro roids and grow bigger.game mechanical suggestion: 1) besides ore dust there is non refinable dust one for each nonrefinable mission ore, ice dust  which in itself can spawn as ice roids  radioactive, metallic, organic and other types. harvested it might be usefull for other products of daily live, it might be necessary in certain production processes or to create a specific alloy.2) ores are found at gravimetrical spots, the gravimetrical strength of a spot doesn't provide how lucky the finder is but is part of the respawn formula:specific dust density * gravimetrical strength of location * 3600 is the ammount of specific ore that spawns per hour at a specific location.3) combined with the gravimetrical strength such spots provide a magnetometrical strength this on the other hand is cue on how rich a certain spot is.4) there are several states an asteroid can be found::arrow: dust cloud:arrow: micro roid:arrow: cluster of micro roids:arrow: asteroid:arrow: planetoideach of the states has an own way of mining:dust clouds are collected by dust cloud harvestersmicro roids are collected with tractor beams, they should be handled similar to cans, tractor beam pulls in micro roid, when the roid comes closer than 500m the player can scope it to cargo bay.clusters of micro roids can be mined with miners, strip miners and tractor beams however using mining laser it requires a certain script so that the laser runs on a lower power level. not mining with this script will lead to the creation of a dust cloud and a very low yield. tractor beam won't need a script however will have a lower yield than a scripted mining laser, yet without any danger to turn precious ore into dust.asteroids are mined as they are today."
4/18/2009,"planetoids planetoids are not like the modes before, to begin with they are as big as an outpost or npc owned station, have three zones, a core, an intermediate layer and a surface. each of this is different. beginning on the surface it is condensed dust, loose mirco roids, similar to dust clouds and micro roids they can be harvested partially with tractor beam, dust cloud harvester, or scripted mining laser.the intermediate layer/zone consists of unrefinable ore with precious ore veins, two possible ways of mining can be applied, either one strips the planetoid of this layer using a strip miner, however the player has to deal with a lot of unrefinable dust, or in combination with a survey scanner that can identify the veins and makes them each targetable.the core, in difference to asteroids the core of a planetoid does not consist of known ores yet of inartificially alloys. the core is the hardest and will always require a deep core miner to mine it. additionally it may have a primary and secondary ore that are it's basis, then mining crystal might provide a bonus.asteroid farmsbeing a known fact that minable asteroids are found most likely near gravimetric sites as well as objects of high mass lead to some experiments of trying to attract asteroids to specific fixed sites in so far as not having to always track them down and search them.well over short or long some device that fosters artificial collecting of asteroids in space and those are todays belts.might be even usefull for 0.0 sovereighnity as those who have sovereighnity could anchor such devices and create ""belts"" where none would be otherwise.just my 2 cents (well had some more thoughts i didn't manage to write down)"

4/18/2009,my previous topic was more on minmatar capitals in general (
4/18/2009,"sniping with dreadsalong the same lines of sniping battleships, sniping dreads sacrifice tank and dps for range. this isn't as effective as sniping battleships as they don't get the nice t2 ammo for extra range + damage and they are stuck in siege where as the sniper battleships have more ability to warp in / out, but if you can control the hostiles you're shooting at it's an effective way of killing hostiles that arn't usually designed to even be able to lock you, let alone shoot at you. the naglfar is once again bottom of the barrel by a long shot for this. all 3 other dreads only have to fit a few range mods because they only have 1 type of weapon to worry about. naglfars have to fit range mods for both guns and missiles. this is one of the many reasons why split weapons suck.how to fix this!now bare with me for a second and read all of this before you start screaming and shouting about how overpowered this is.remove missile slots, give naglfar role bonus 100% damage bonus to capital projectileremove both bonuses, give the naglfar 5% damage per level (instead of the 7.5% rof per level, which means this is a 10% damage decrease from bonuses) and give it a 5% bonus to shield boost amount per level.give the naglfar a 15% cpu boostdrop 2 low slots, add one midslotokay, i know what you're thinking. holy **** 4 guns on a dread? that's like 25% more damage than all other dreads!!!!! first of all, artillery sucks. if you look at the pheonix it gets a 5% kin damage per level and 5% rof damage per level. it has the same number of weapons as the rev and moros and it does the same damage even with a 25% more damage bonus through hull bonuses. the moros gets a 50% drone damage per level and a 5% damage per level but compared to the rev's 5% damage per level and t2 sentries, they both do the same amount of dps (infact the rev does more). the gun types matter, artillery sucks and in order to compete the naglfar needs this extra boost of damage.where does this leave the naglfar in comparison to other dreads?good damagebest burst tank, although still very uncapstablegood ehpno fitting problems able to sniper fitedit: update due to discussionhere's a nag with giga beams (all skills v):"

4/18/2009,"obviously people build them, or there'd be none. there are.obviously people make money doing so, or they wouldn't do so. they do.logical conclusion? no issue whatsoever exists."
4/18/2009,"i agree with your premise (ecm is annoying for both the user and target), but i'm not convinced that your proposal works. some reasons:1) it would have almost no impact on ships using modules that aren't impacted by signature radius, such as warp disruptors, webs, painters, neuts, etc. (other than possibly making the original lockon take a bit longer.)2) it would have almost no impact on ships that are attacking larger targets.i realize that you were trying to steer away from chance-based system, but here's a variant idea:instead of ecm inflicting a single hit-or-miss attempt to break a target's lock for 20 seconds, make it so ecm instead gives the target ship a 'miss chance' for the duration of the ecm cycle, equivalent to the current chance to jam. for the duration of the effect, each time a module is used that requires a locked target, the server checks to see if it 'missed'. this would include guns and missiles, ew, disruptors, remote repair, etc. for multiple jammers used on a target, apply them in much the same way as adding multiple hardeners -- ie, subsequent miss chances affect the margin and stacking penalties apply.by the way, note that this would not automatically require an total overhaul of ecm strength, sensor strength, eccm, etc. the miss chance would still be calculated like the jam chance is, and for a given jammer the effects over time should be the same (though the interaction of multiple jammers might make some adjustments worth looking into). eccm has a direct benefit by reducing the miss chance.basically, this would represent the jammer creating 'false images' on the target's tracking systems, leading the target to effectively fire at 'ghosts' instead of his desired target. it's still chance-based, but with a much smaller granularity -- generally, some of each volley would hit, and even if you got an unlucky volley, your next chance is only a few seconds away.as to the 'second bonus' granted by caldari recons ... perhaps remote eccm would make sense?"
4/18/2009,i am not realy agree with these bombers. and i explain why.they are only two race need normaly to learn the missile skill : caldari and minmatar.for me the best way will be to put the bonus in the bomber on the large weapons of each racial skill.exemple :amarr - large pulse caldari - torpedo gallente - large blaster minmatar - large autocannon and each bomber can use bomb. for me the term of bomber it's to be launch the bombs. and i don't understand with the only other weapons you can fit is missile.
4/18/2009,"how about changing it so two racial bombers go back to cruise missiles and two stay with torps?i don't really use them for what they're meant for, but the new torp based ones are even more completely nerve-wrecking, and i wouldn't have though that's possible."

4/18/2009,great idea.
4/18/2009,this... macro miners are not likely to invest that much upfront capital just to reduce hauling times. it's not like hauling is cumbersome to them.
4/18/2009,"the orca can indeed unload its cargo and still provide uninterrupted mind link coverage for the fleet. it need only visit a pos to offload. a corp freighter can then consolidate the shipment from the pos and deliver it as required.a second option is to run your haulers out to the orca to offload the hangar. this is really just a step up from jetcan mining, but it is a heck of a lot more secure. the orca's extra space even allows you the ability to sort cargo, so your different haulers can deal with only one type of ore. this makes for quicker stacking, if you're anal about that kind of thing. i think the balance issue here deals more with the potential for macro miners to sweep entire belts clear without the necessity to pause in their actions. it seems like it would be much more difficult to write a macro that mines and dumps ore into a hangar when the orca may or may not be there in the system. the requirement to coordinate either the orca docking/redocking cycle or the hauler trips into the macro make it a lot harder for those unscrupulous folks to conduct business. also, by factoring in the corporate hangar size as well as the cargo hold size, the orca's cargo shuffling would come into play for extremely large mining sweeps.the orca seems to work well for its intended role. it's an empire-based coordination platform. it allows storage and transport internally, as well as gives options for peacetime (higher security) cargo movement via industrial haulers. for low sec operations, the appropriate ship to use would be the rorqual."

4/18/2009,hi ank... why don't you allow your man erik to answer these questions himself?
4/18/2009,"guys,thanks for the elaborate comments to those who invested that effort. all the others, thanks for your volley. i need to bow to otri, who put it into terms, which are understandable for my ""kitten"" mind : for many this is only a pew, pew game [...] this forum is an extension of that. yes, my pvp experience i made on the weak side so far, and above that i had powerful help to avoid it in most cases. this csm candidature now is me turning pvp. and this post is about my personal background.getting personallet me, hence, comment on the pvp issue first : pvp is what makes this game interesting to me as well as to my whole staff ! and it is actually implied right by my rp play style. i am subject to the whole player-to-player sandbox and its immersive drag, and interaction with an npc does not fit there. only the whole player interaction mechanics and the one-shard promise is what makes this game the best, which i have advocated also on other forums like xing and linked-in. and i mean the whole pvp mechanics, which includes the player-driven economy.sure, the pve aspect is supremely beneficial to me at the moment. still, all my company's activities are shaped by the pvp aspects : do not use jet cans, but invest in haulers; do not go to low-sec unless a scout is sent ahead, and an escort is guarding your route; do not employ pilots without a thorough interview to avoid scams, etc. we even go mining in low-sec for the thrill (cause we know it's not for the profit...) and while we are picking up a notable number of pilots who did not like the aggressive behvaiour of their previous company, yes, we all dream about one day being able to take on the real challenge of capsuleer fight. why, in new eden, would i want to abolish my idols ?being balanced : game and real-world economics, new and oldit is about the balance. and this balance, with all due respect, i am not measuring by the immediate whining about changes. neither, as a csm, is it my office to role-play during the meetings. as a csm, we are vested by ccp to a real world game design mandate. thus, let me toss into the discussion a real-world economical aspect of the balance : ccp is depending on a growing subscriber base. this will not happen should the new player evolution curve be too steep with newbies being vaporized and ""take this can, it's for you""-scammed on the spot. at the same time, the experienced players need to be fed to keep them. and between the two positions, a viable curve of player-evolution must be crafted.to know the state of things, i want to rely on economical data fed by dr. enyo, and on other statistical data, like pilot movement and number of pilots organized in corporations and alliances. and to change the state of things, i will always pick up those suggestions from the assembly hall, which have player-interaction as the driving force of change. again : i will pick from suggestions which have been posted by you to assembly hall or directly to take care.as a side note : that said, the highly discussed high-sec gank nerf using concord was the least liked solution of all. the whole csm advocated and still advocates pvp options, and you all know that ! tradeable kill rights are on the table, and there are fantastic suggestions to a war-dec refactoring. it is ccp's decision to go the way they deem most cost effective. ankhe has submitted 0.0 incentives to be integrated into the next expansion. and i am in favour of a player-driven mission system.[...]"
4/18/2009,"edited for spelling[...]what you vote is what you getthe csm is made up of sane people. csm and take care are always proclaiming changes which will increase player activity. ankhe is a student of game design, i have studied computer science and virtual sociology. and we have an advisor, rufus britton, who lives in null-sec. take care, in addition to that, is about making csm work efficient by passing on experience about the csm mechanics. it is this mind-set i am putting up for vote !"

4/18/2009,fine but others have already started making judgements on me without any facts whatsoever.
4/18/2009,its easy to make ill informed judgements about people when you know nothing about them and indeed before they have offered up anything about themselves isn't it.why not tell us about your lowsec pvp experiences?what have they (your experience of lowsec) lead you to conclude about pvp in lowsec with regards to the policy and aproach you think take care should adopt towards lowsec and lowsec play styles?-with regard to the policy's you would want erik as a csm member to adopt towards lowsec and lowsec play styles?
4/18/2009,anyway i suppose i should do a little bio:i'm a bit over a year old. i've spent most my time with the benegesserit chapterhouse but i've recently joined the flaming sideburn's. i mission in hisec a lot for iskies to fund my lowsec pvping. i enjoy smallships more than bs combat so i mainly fly harpies and hawks. i'm also training for a dreadnaught which i should hopefully build myself in the next month or so. i'm about to move to 0.0 and try life doing pve and pvp out there to see how that compares. up until now i've only had little sorties into 0.0 i haven't stayed there for any significant periods. i'm experienced in af and bs combat and used to be fc in our roaming gangs in my old corp but in my new corp i'm hoping to learn more from those more experienced than me.
4/18/2009,"i think lowsec pvp is pretty good as it is. the only issue that frustrates me is station hugging. you can spend a lot of time camping people only for them to station hug and redock when aggressed but i can't think of any solutions to that which wouldn't make gameplay worse. the other issue i'd like to look at is maybe changing gate and station guns damage so the lower the sec of the system the lower the damage they do. i fly afs a lot, i can tank the gate for a short time but if 0.1 gates did less damage i might engage a bit more at gates and gank and run before the gates finish me off. currently if you're in an exclusive small ships gang it can be crap for finding pvp as you have to be aggressed first which bs are reluctant to do or you have to go in belts but its hard to find any targets in lowsec belts even if you only send one member in the system to scout and directional scan the belts."
4/18/2009,now that would be just one of many issues of interest to those that pigeon-hole you into the bear category and see a distinct lack of policy favouring pvp in your hopeful erik's campaign.
4/18/2009,"i have been playing eve for over 3 years now, and i still learn new things all the time, i have mostly been in marketing, industry, invention, research and tend to do those on the mass scale and also mission a lot, have basic pvp experience, and my eve schedule is usually pretty busy, would need more hours each day to do more :)z0d"

4/19/2009,"sure, assuming ccp can do it without expending an undue amount of effort. one or two a year would be a nice little event. no more than that, of course, but occasionally is good.edit: yeah, of course if they can make the servers work. pull one of the extra-beefy nodes off tq, stick it in fd-, and move everybody there as part of the setup for the day."

4/19/2009,"i am loving the ideas and suggestions you've written down in this thread.i am picking out the highlights for me ( not a supercap pilot tho ):1. titan makeover- way higher ehp- dd device makeover, less damage, cap drain, ecm shockwave, effected area warp disruped- tank balanced so it couldnt be used solo2. mothership redesign- raise the logistical role of the mothership - let it be a real ""mothership""- nanobot repair cloud, bigger corp hangar / ship maintenance3. a new capital class between a mothership and a titan- dedicated to be deployed on enemy capital fleets- with penalities ( e.g. cap boost ) when ""siege mode"" on- no ability to fully operate without external capital support ( rep / cap )"
4/19/2009,"give me your nyx, i'll [l]use it! as for your ideas. i support the need for change but i would ask you to go further in your suggestions, specifically, supercaps should allow pilots to dock in them while online. with a mom, make the sma superhuge. if you log off in it, well, you are stupid as all you get to do is talk in local where the mom logged off or jump clone out. nothing else. but when the pilot is online, you can pick any ship from the hangar and undock in it. or man point defence weapons (up to 6 x-large / 15 large / 30 medium /50 small ship weapons) with the mom having a racial bonus to proj, energy, hybrid or missiles.. the only thing you need as a docked gunner is to have sdm skills.. (note, not pos guns, guns you could fit to a ship, depending on the skill of the supercap pilot, does not include the highslot weapons at the supercap pilot's disposal)with the titan, you get an even bigger sma and double or even treble the number of available point defence weapons. using these things to move big groups of pilots around would make titans and motherships much more usable. having them not persistent in space after the pilot logs off though. (maybe a 15 minute grace period where it becomes invincible on disconnect so people can undock from it if the pilot gets dc'd) when he logs back in, he better have a scout;) maybe with having these defensive capabilities. the need to buff the ehp so heavily is reduced. the ships become multiplayer powerhouses, able to defend themselves (with other players docked) and/or project a metric f***tonne of offensive damage.."

4/19/2009,"while i think the rest of vaal's post is unnecessarily harsh, this part i agree with fully. the nag is hilariously bad, and needs a fix. it's obviously, and by a large margin, the worst capital ship in the game. unless this is part of a plan for race-wide balance(e.g., minmatar intentionally get the best cruisers and the worst capitals), and i have no reason to believe it is, it needs fixing. not a big fan of balance issues, but this one's pretty glaring."

4/19/2009,"clone vat rebalancing:1) allow fleet members to alter and upgrade their medical clones when next to a ship fitted with a clone vat bay. this does not allow them to store medical clones in the ship, just change which station they are in and uprgade clone coverage. there should be some indication like an alternative icon in fleet to let fleet members know which ships have useable clone vats for this purpose.2) allow alliance members to remotely install clones into a ship in the same fleet. to do this the ship must have an active clone vat bay, and the character wanting to clone jump should be docked in an outpost owned by that alliance. this would provide a mechanic for alliances to bring reinforcements back to a hostile system easily.3) allow fleet members to clone jump back to a station jump clone when in a capsule next to an active clone vat bay. when using this mechanic the character performing the jump would have the option of storing their current jump clone back into the capital ship, or simply discarding it. this allows clone vat bays to hold clones containing implants too.4) reduce or eliminate clone jump period when done via clone vat bay.to support this change i'd like to see three further changes:firstly mothership and titan sma size should be doubled to allow for more spare ships to support the fleet. a 'repair bay' module for motherships and titans would be a nice asset to fleets. this item would project a shortrange smartbomb-like effect that repairs friendly vessels. it can only be activated inside a starbase shield and causes hull, armour, shield, capacitor and module heat damage to regenerate slowly for all fleet ships within a short distance.next - alot of people keep suggesting the ability to allow motherships to dock. i disagree but do think i have a better suggestion. in order to add another perk to owning good space as well as providing ore chances to kill supercaps i suggest this. allow supercaps that come within docking range of sov level four outpost to access its services in space. this would mean supercap pilots could upgrade clones, refit their ship, and even access personal+corporate hangars in the station. it would make reloading with spare ships for fellow corp members a simpler process and more viable to use the ship as a real forward base."

4/19/2009,this plus some other upgrades
4/19/2009,"the e-war based doomsday appeals to me. especially if it was made to be a more regular effect (firing several times a minute) rather than a 'fire then get the hell out' weapon. a racial aspect would be better however, making each racial titan good for varying situations. with the amount of titans ingame now it should be possible to combine different effects into the perfect tactic.such a dd change would need to come with a defense boost of some kind, as the whole concept of nano-titans is silly. the biggest ships in the game should get the best defenses - not able to be ganked in 30 seconds and requiring interceptor fittings to get them off the field first beforehand.i've never liked the idea of docking inside another ship. perhaps i'm just too jaded with watching a simple idea like starbase jumpbridges suffer constant bugs for a year before being fixed, but i think something like that would just result in a plethora of broken code and stuck petitions.i do think there are better ways to make supercaps more viable frontline bases though. fixing clone vat bays and making it easier to load spare ships would be a huge improvement. supercaps could also be better fleet support ships in battle with appropriate new items."
4/19/2009,"obvious troll but i'll bite. this thread is about citadels doing pathetic damage to moving capitals. i used the phoenix as an example but the nag is also affected.i'm not going to bother re-explaining why ""guns miss"" doesn't cut it. read the thread, understand the figures, look at the graph.and grats on quoting the second stupidest post in this thread (yours wins first prize).let's ignore carriers for a second, this post:is stupid because:supercaps. cannot. be. webbed."

4/19/2009,"scamming, i'm fine with. it punishes stupidity and rewards cleverness. contract spamming local with these bogus things when all you want is to say hi on local whilst selling stuff, or even trying to use it to spot a nice contract? i'm not fine with that. i know this has got a lot of support on other, non ah threads. i'm putting this here to appeal to this and the next csm to implement a simple change that will destroy this mechanic: 1: the colour of the price changes from dark red to something much easier to read - a nice white. green can still be used for negative prices. 2: the exact price is always displayed next to the price in numerals: ie for 199,999,999isk it would display as ""one hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine isk"" 3: isk cents are always displayed on wts contracts. i've never fallen for this scam, for the record, but for traders, i can imagine this being highly irritating. - dprevision: it has come to my attention that a new variant of this scam in which the contract instead reads ""800,000,001"" or similar. this is inherently the same problem, but is actually a little harder to detect thanks to the problem highlighted by solution 1 - ie, the red sales text is too damn hard to read."

4/19/2009,"if you're using local to search for contracts, you really deserve everything you get."
4/19/2009,which is a face load of spam. it is sometimes nice to sit in local and talk to people - eve gamers are usually a friendly bunch - and i can imagine that the guy that is really trying to sell his contracts on local is annoyed because all he sees is spam. this xkcd comic is a good way of putting it:
4/19/2009,this thread's a duplicate - please take it to the original.
4/19/2009,actually it isn't - mine is a [proposal] thread whereas that topic is just an [issues] thread. but that's beside the point.
4/19/2009,it doesn't work. it causes spam wich doesn't help anyone. and it also makes life of legit trader harder. everybody hates it.
4/19/2009,"as i said above - it does work, amazingly enough. and the scammers seem to like it just fine."
4/19/2009,"i did enjoy the super-fast mwd'ing intie trails that you could almost double back upon with sufficient fiddling. =)still, the occasional lag or jitter did make them do crazy-weird stuff, so the lack of them isn't bad, visually."
4/19/2009,very much agreed. i turned the trails off pretty quick because i thought the game looked a lot better without them.because i had the trails off i never noticed that they where removed. i support bringing the trails back as long as i have option to turn them off!
4/19/2009,word of advice - it usually takes a couple months for a csm issue to get to the devs and get implemented. this seems more urgent than that. have you filed a bug report?
4/19/2009,wrong forum. --isaac
4/19/2009,"how can it be wrong forum, when i was contacted by the guys from the mac channel, who would like to have this issue raised and bumped up in priority?edit: forgot to support"
4/19/2009,"yes, a bug report has been filed.thank you for the support lavista vista :)"
4/19/2009,being a newer player and not having much low sec experience not sure if this already happens. what about adding a chance to find 0.0 ore in low sec.... either by hidden belts or just a random chance of finding a decent roid in a belt the reward of mining extra ore has to outweigh the cost of losing ships to pirates.
4/19/2009,"already exists - lowsec gravimetric sites can spawn the lesser 0.0 rocks, worth about 140-175 per m3. i think that level of income is fine to give to belt-mined rocks, though - it's hardly game-breaking when veldspar is worth 125."
4/19/2009,"recently i have returned a bit more to the game because i belive 'invention' thing could be finally interesting. doing good profits building some interesting tech ii stuff and so on. i got some of ours lots of core datas and buyed some interfaces to try... and... then i discovered that the maximun of runs you can obtained is like 10 and with a probability of 50% or less. because of the prices of the core datas nowadays it is impossible to get any profit at all, and it is better to sell the core datas with that kind of ratios.i can imagine that if you have moon mining and reactions you can do a good profit on tech ii stuff, but that is a 'alliances' and 0.0-only activities.great! so invention is basically another more giving-fuel for the endless and nonsense wars in the 0.0 space. great!if all the game is for the alliance wars things at least transform that wars into a real interesting thing, a 'useful' thing, an activity that could be creative and not just a circle of destruction. allow to the powerfull alliances to transform the 0.0 space, very slowly and very expensively in 'real' little growing secure empires. that could be interesting, but firing your enemies all the way just for fun is basically a nonsense activity."
4/19/2009,(i think you need a tl;dr version - it's kinda hard to pick out your point.) i guess i can support this. sometimes the 0.0 sov stuff feels kinda pointless - the only reason you're killing the other guy is because you don't like him... a point to reeeeeally large 0.0 holdings? that would be nice.
4/19/2009,"btw, if you haven't noticed, t3 cannot be dominated by the super alliances, simply doesn't fit in for them. on that note, if alliances can't have some reason to conquer space (beyond the ""i am uber"" reason) then why bother with 0.0 at all?--isaac"
4/19/2009,"i can tell you that your numbers on invention are simply wrong, and that it's quite profitable even if you've never seen a moon. also, controlling 0.0 space seems to be judged worthwhile by the people trying to do it, which seems to be enough. also, slowly civilizing 0.0 space is entirely possible - look at the spread of outposts over the years. those objections aside though, i don't think you're actually making a proposal here. what is it, precisely, that you want the csm to advocate? i really can't tell."
4/19/2009,"my idea for the change was just a suggestion added to the proposal that the ecm mechanic be thoroughly reviewed and changed. whether a variant of my idea or your idea or anyone's is used doesn't matter to me but rather that ccp review and change the from the current mechanic of break lock - block lock to something else.i am used to ""if you think there is a problem, provide a potential solution"" and so i did that."
4/19/2009,"posting to bring together two ideas in other threads, neither of which i take credit for but i do think worthwhile and simple quick fixes for mom's.docking a mothership would not detract from the supercapital status nor does it seem impossible in terms of ship models versus dreads for example.add the ability to fit a jump portal generator to motherships for bridging fleets in the same manner as a titan. this would fit with the role of ""mother of the fleet"" without encroaching on the role of carriers or freighters through extension of cargo/hangar capacity. the mothership essentially transports ships via the bridge into hostile situations rather than internally.adding the portal would not infringe too much upon the role of the titan since the mothership does not have the devastating damage output of a doomsday, and perhaps it's current stats would feel more balanced vs. cost given the utility a portal gen would offer to an alliance. buying a mom would then be a useful investment for any alliance since it makes fleet movement significantly easier and allows even smaller alliances to project power more effectively.as i said, not my ideas, but interesting to see what support they get as a package.zos"
4/19/2009,supported... i'm dumb.zos
4/19/2009,no and no. supercaps are not allowed to dock. end of story. titan gets the generator. --isaac

4/19/2009,eveo thread:
4/19/2009,"0.0 warfare: there needs to be some adjustment. pos warfare is a drag for both parties involved and can be a huge timesink of suck. yes, i said it: suck. being in goonswarm i'm right in the middle of the action and have plenty of opinions on how things can be improved. not only have i been following my own alliance's moans and groans, i've seen what the rest of eve online thinks too. one big complaint is setting up and tearing down pos structures. i will be proposing ""templates"" and ""queues"" to lift some of the burden in deploying them. and another thing i believe the game needs are ""fuel packs"" to accompany the templates. it would involve same mechanics as producing off of a bpo where the numerous pos fuels are combined into one specific product. 0.0 environment: the addition of wormholes did a lot to give everyone more options. i however want to see more added with the static areas, namely npc space. there is mission running there but not much else that sets it apart from the rest of 0.0 territory. i would like to see the npc ai enhanced for systems they hold sov in. just as players will aggressively defend their space the npc should too! market/contract improvements: it would be nice to see how much of a specific item has sold in a station or system. as it is right now you can only see sales totals across the whole region. create a new skill if you have to, because this would be an asset to all players. concerning contracts, the ability to view more information from the list when a search is run would be highly desirable.ui improvements: i must say that i'm pleased with many of the additions to ui that ccp has made since my last csm campaign run. it was a major part of my platform and seeing the changes leaves me very satisfied. there are still more things to improve on, however. namely the overview, a column needs to be added for ""state"" which reflects what pos modules are doing: online, onlining, anchored, unanchored, incapacitated. when your dreadnaught is in siege you are already dealing with a slow lock time. having it lengthen further by wasting lock cycles is a huge frustration! also, when are we going to get an aggression timer countdown for 0.0 combat? do it already!ccp policy visibility: i'll get into this more on my website, but i feel that the rules (of game and forum) need to be spelled out better. the official wiki is up, and now it needs to be fleshed out further. i've read so many accounts of one gm doing one thing while another does the complete opposite! there needs to be more consistency.lowsec revitalization: there isn't much activity going on in lowsec space beyond people constructing capital ships, gaining access to/from 0.0, or the occasional pirates. i propose that bounty and mission rewards for lowsec see an increase. along with this 0.0 ratting bounties need a big boost. previously i was leaning towards a highsec nerf but i have since reversed my stance.and much much more: my website will be updated with further thoughts. a few things on the list are giving logistics ships a hull rep range bonus, mothership role improvements, evemail filters/folders, t3 ship innovations, and plenty of ways to make holding sov more exciting in a constellation. i hope this post has given you a decent overview of my platform and what i hope to accomplish should i be elected to csm. it has been said that ccp will be taking a closer look at revamping 0.0 warfare in the upcoming year and i want to be a part of that process. not to mention walking in stations is another thing i'm very interested in. both of these things will be huge for the game and i will dedicate my time to ensuring it will please the eve online community."
4/19/2009,"i endorse this candidate.she is indeed a girl. however, angel looks better (imo)."
4/19/2009,"you sir are blind, brain damaged or both. she's fat... in game"
4/19/2009,"yes, more details would definitely be helpful to put this discussion on the right track."
4/19/2009,"jaina, redsplat,let me first say, your questions are not new. and i am proud you are turning to take care in seeking for answers. the solutions neither are new nor unknown. indeed, the csm has been discussing them for a long time. it is one benefit of an organization like take care that such knowledge about the history of issues is forwarded to the next candidate.furthermore, i read from posts over and over again the implication that we are pacifists. no ! take care embraces pvp, and realizes that non-consensual fights are part of the game. it is a bit misleading, though, how your questions imply the existence of easy answers. i acknowledge that take care puts the bar, where pvp turns into ganking, a bit higher than you like.dark universenow, as to your questions in particular. non-consensual fight is a fair style of this game, even in high-sec. redsplat, i am differentiating between high-sec pvp and suicide ganking, where the latter is a style which heavily compounds the new player experience. the silent majority of high-sec pacifists felt that it was getting out of hand. not because ganking in itself was unacceptable, but because they lack means to retaliate and there was no meaningful consequence to the criminal act. the suicide ganking ""fix"" is often cited as an example of a hello-kitty attitude. instead, you will see from the csm proposal that we are in favour of a pvp solution, for example tradable kill rights among others.high-sec industry, mining, and mission running are directly connected to incentivizing 0.0. because take care promotes bumping the right aspect over nerfing another in order to achieve goals. from the csm wiki entry you see it includes a decoupling of industry from sovereignty, creating opportunities to develop the vastness of space, connecting null-sec economy with high-sec, and increasing the rewards also for small gangs. may i remind you that empire income, currently at least, often is a required fall-back for both fw and 0.0 pilots. we want to change that as well. but that is just to give you an idea of the interleaved mechanics of the game.[...]"
4/19/2009,"[...]the war-dec mechanics are being discussed in high detail, jaina. and the csm has submitted an issue on war dec mechanics almost a year ago. we are aware of the issues with people in npc corps, where the safety it provides is abused for activities such as canflipping, corp logistics, and let us not forget about remote repairing in high-sec warfare. however, like the other issues you listed, this issue also is a two-sided coin. on one hand there are those that abuse the security, yet on the other hand we have large amounts of legitimate casual and solo players that simply do not enjoy playing the game as part of a corp, or do not have the time nor mindset for it. sacrificing this valid playstyle just to get rid of an inconvenience for another is not acceptable. to tax or remove npc corporations has been proposed on the assembly hall many times, and none of the csm members, not even those closer to your background, ever saw any merit in it. if you want to make changes to the game mechanics, you will have to take into account other playstyles as well, which is why suggestions like abolishing npc corporations altogether simply will not work. however, we can work together to identify minor aspects of the problems that we can do something about. for instance, if npc corps are being used for logistics, perhaps it we could look into removing the sec hit from aggression and killing of npc corp pilots in low-sec. this will not have much of an impact for the legitimate player, but does help corps and alliances at war. i'd genuinely appreciate it if you would bring up constructive suggestions like that either to me directly or to the assembly hall. balance - not boringjaina, redsplat, one man's meat is another man's poison. while some might imply you are seeking the easy kill, high-sec bears seek easy isk. and you see from the above cited issues that pvp is always part of the equation, which take care tosses into the game.what you might not have noticed from the wiki, is that most of the above issues have already been submitted to ccp. following current governance of the csm, we are not supposed to raise the issues again ! on the other hand, the highly acclaimed skill queue made it into game, because take care knows how to bend these rules in our voters' favour.i will take your pvp desires into account. and then it is about managing ccp's attitude to bring them into game. and i am very capable of that from my real-life experience in management consulting.your vote - my job !"
4/19/2009,"i have to say i am very glad for this well written answer, the point i have been trying to make from the start of this discussion is that improving this game is all about balance. i think it is important to understand both extremes when trying to find the middle ground. and to me, this post once again shows that you are only being misunderstood as leaning strongly to one side. in fact you are kind of in the middle when in comes to your views while in the same time, you will try to represent any proposal that your voters will impress upon you. that is a winning attitude.from what i understand about ccp and their philosophy, that middle ground is the best place to be when it comes to effecting changes, it is the best place to be to make our voices heard. ccp will be always skeptical to solutions which favour one side, and open to the once that are win/win. i don't think people realize, that a good csm candidate is not only the one who simply represents our interests. he/she should also understand how to get results from ccp."
4/19/2009,"edit: firstly (even retrospectively) thank you for the carefully worded and well thought out reply.erik i still feel you are somewhat dancing around engaging on issues you feel are contentious rather than expounding your opinion and what you thinki was, as i think i emphasised, looking for your opinion on these issue. not what has been done in the past.i am looking to the future and am interested in your personal and specific views- they will be what motivates me to vote or not vote for you and what will motivate many others.these view, i think it reasonable to assume, will be driving your actions during the csm term.i was, be they in altered form or otherwise. now that i wasn't aware of, hamstrung would seem an appropriate word. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------on a related aside, i don't want highsec to be a gankers paradise- i want balance. i feel game balance between styles of play in eve is adversely effecting with mechanics favouring specific play styles over others.if there was only 3 things i would like take care to shepard into existence they would be:transferable killrights and a re-invention of the bounty system and by extension sec. status.re-balancing of level 4 missions; from reducing minerals from loot reprocessing (favouring miners, having 40% of the market in minerals being from reprocessed mods and ships isn't right) to a general reduction in profitability. proper divisions between security of systems and the inherent profitability of ventures from high-low-null sec as part of an initiative to favour mechanisms moving players into losec and nullsec. the stagnation that exists as current can be pinned rather firmly on the comparative profitability of highsec."
4/19/2009,"this idea, i definitely agree with.btw erik, i feel much more confident about voting for you now, understanding how you think helped a bit..."
4/19/2009,"finally we are getting somewheredear redsplat i hate to do the an... i mean interfere in your informative exchange with erik, but it is my perception that the take care party's strategy isn't primarily centered around their own egos/views but rather on a firm grasp of the divers needs of the players and their ability to sell those needs to the almighty ccp.

4/19/2009,"i think right now the mechanics in highsec with regards to the predator/prey dynamic (ie suicide ganking, can flipping etc) are pretty much bang on and i think a shift in either direction would be a bad thing. you are not going to get ganked if you pay attention and use a suitable ship, you are going to get ganked if you ap in a t1 hauler with a bil's worth of loot. although i loathe rl comparisons... if you absolutely have to transport a load of gold and gems and monies through compton or some other notorious district of a large city you're going to do it in an armoured car at speed, not at a leisurely pace on your bicycle with the goods overflowing out of panniers.yes, i would like to see the rewards of hisec tweaked. for starters, given the uselessness of mining in lowsec i do believe that t1 loot drops from missions need a nerf, restrict them to named only. this gives the t1 producer a boost, he's not being undercut by mission runners dumping 6 months worth of goods on the market at ridiculous prices 'i mined it/shot it, therefore it is free hurf durf durf'. although there will still be the flow from drone missions and rats i'm sure ccp can find it in their heart to tweak the alloy refine rates too. i realise that if you nerf rewards too much then it will just drive people away, ccp has pretty much made it clear that level 4's in hisec were a mistake but now that they're in place they can't really do much without several thousand emo rage quits.ref 'carebears'. in my mind a carebear is someone who out and out avoids confrontation, either in battle, in chat or on the market. i know plenty of mission runners and industrialists who are able to put up a decent fight if need be... these people are not carebears. in my time i've run across a lot of industrialists trying to get a foothold into lowsec. many of them were receptive and we traded protection for goods and services... these are not carebears. the ones who'd ignore me, block me, call me a dirty pirate because of preconceptions and would then procede to be milked for all their worth by us as we pulled down their towers and ganked their haulers. these people were carebears. i have no issues with industrialists. these people are part of the game. i couldn't invent manufacture a t2 ship or build a carrier. we'd be pretty boned if there were no more industrialists. if you want real representation for industrialists then vote one of the other candidates. however, i've got a pretty level head, i'm more aware of pvp dynamics and the knock on effects of any changes than most people. i realise the harm that moving level 4's out of hisec would do as much as the harm of moving level 5's to hisec or buffing concord even more.it's not a case of what 'i' can do for carebears. i have a few good ideas but i am no idea factory. if issues are raised that i think are fair and balanced then i'll support them. if not... well... i won't. i am a pirate and a scoundrel but if things aren't kept balanced then i will run out of targets pretty quick."
4/19/2009,regarding fuel pellet issues i attempted to raise this issue for a previous csm meeting. however access to the wiki which was at that time was being required for issue proposal and a decision to focus the entire meeting on expansion issues prevented me from bringing it up.i definitely will be involved in the discussions.issler
4/19/2009,"we have been discussing this in militia chat: some of us are looking to vote for a candidate that promotes faction warfare and causes ccp to inject more content into faction warfare (e.g. making system capturing meaningful, monetary or non-monetary rewards for pve/pvp, centralised killboards, statistics improvements, medals, achievements etc.), since ankhe may not run again. the candidate should be part of one of the four militias and prove his commitment to faction warfare with a high rank (pve) and/or sufficient kills on the militia killboards (pvp). election campaign tactics such as promising to work on fw improvement in order to get the thousands of votes of militia members won't impress us, if the candidate haven't ever participated in fw. the candidate should be vocal and persuasive, a good lobbyist who knows how to influence the devs, so that we know that our interests are well represented. if you think you are an eligible candidate for this task or know someone who is, please link the campaign site in this thread, so that we can check it and give our vote if we think the candidate is suitable (most of us are not patient enough to read the campaigns of all candidates in order to find the one who represents our interests at best)."
4/19/2009,"edited for wordingiudex,the short comings of the fw content are apparent and have not been addressed properly since the introduction of fw more than a year ago.take care has already picked up the matter : our member ankhesentapemkah has first joined the federal defence union then the 24th imperial crusade to get hands-on insight. some issues have already been put forward as documented in the csm wiki.ankhesentapemkah has visited me a few weeks ago in berlin, when we were shooting the campaign movie, and explained to me the pressing fw issues. while i might lack personal experience, eva and i consider in unison that i have the better lobbying skills and social experience from my studies to well succeed in promoting the issues. and i shall be proud to forward your cause !current issuesfrom current knowledge, these are the most pressing issues (the order does not reflect priority). feel free to get touch in order to discuss details :1) the rewards need to be bumped as to take into account plexing and kills. fw does not have to be a profitable carreer, but it should at least be sustainable. people should not be running back to high-sec and grind missions to fund it.2) the current loyalty point shop does not have anything special, and is only accessible to those that run fw missions.3) as for storyline impact : right now the caldari have been victorious in many systems, and it does not have any consequence. enemies can still operate out of a station right in the middle of their territory, and there are no benefits to actual occupation.4) spawn mechanics : right now the plexes end up in the least-frequented areas over time and whole strategies of plex-herding are required to just be able to conquer a desired system. front-line systems cannot be attacked because no plexes spawn, and it is a vicious circle with decreased plexing activitiy spawning less plexes, resulting in less plexing...5) as you, we love the medals : now, it is nice to be featured on fw stats, but how about something like a small medal for the weekly top pilots ? fw stats should be expanded on, too.6) not to forget the cloaking exploit. ccp attitude and prioritiesthe most important issue to address, though, is ccp's attitude towards fw in particular, and working on released game mechanics which are only half-finished in general. sure, content is only ever used by a part of all players. but still ccp should care, when a majority of these pilots feels that it is half finished ! they promised (rp) alliances in fw from empyrean age 1.1 and it is still not done. what is so difficult in that ?!i expanded on my view of ccp's attitude in my campaign thread : i suspect that ccp struggles with our suggestions on the dimension of investment effectiveness. new content can be put into shiny press releases, which will address the whole market and will trigger new subscriptions. but update type game releases ""only"" address the existing player base. i guess, that take care will be able to influence ccp in that area, if nothing else because i have experience in management consulting and can bring forward the right arguments.thus, making ccp move is as much a lobbying (i.e. right language) matter, as it is putting the finger onto the technical matters. i am the right candidate to do that !what you vote is what you getiudex, i shall be happy to support you as a fw pilot. i am depending on your experience, and i will be able to turn it into the right words, which will make ccp move into a win-win direction."
4/19/2009,i express my full confidence in erik and believe he possesses the skills required to convince ccp to allocate a higher priority to factional warfare.

4/20/2009,yes.. you are the only one.
4/20/2009,"no, it's pretty pathetic that people are still falling for it, but then i feel that way about all those silly jita scams. the font only having a minimal difference between a comma and a period doesn't help, but even then there's a serious difference between 999.99 and 999,999 - the third decimal place. if you don't look at an unknown contract closely enough to see that, you deserve to get scammed."
4/20/2009,i never saw the point of having to place guns in the first place seeing all calculations are done from the tower. there just needs to be a menu like the skill planer to anchoring and online pos mods. the menu bring up all pos modules that are inside the pos shields you set the order of anchoring and onlineing then the tower just auto places and online all the modules. take the same time but no arrows and no need to be there at the tower for 8 hours.
4/20/2009,listen to this man ccp.
4/20/2009,i miss trails!
4/20/2009,"i was thinking that maybe a shorter rep cycle time say 1 or 2 secs along with a simular reduction in cap usage and rep amount (per cycle) would help active tanking. this would make a active tank regen more like a passive shield tank instead of in chunks that have huge alpha strike gap in the cycle time.so the base stats on a lar would be(rough example only):activation time 1.5secs instead of 15secs.armour hp repaired 80 per cycle instead of 800 per cycle.activation cost 40 cap per cycle instead of 400 cap per cycle.so it cycles 10x faster but reps 10x less per cycle for 10x less cap per cycle....gives the same overall effect but does not leave a massive 10+ second or so hole between rep cycles for alpha strike meltage, especially considering a lot of races have a rof of 5 secs or even less (so 2 volleys per rep cycle at the moment).so as you see proportionatly reducing the duration, amount and cap of active reppers gives roughly the same effect as fitting a plate with the down side of it uses cap but the upside that it is a regenerative effect (ie: if the dmg is lower than the resistaces+rep amount the tank will be stable instead of just breaking slower like a pure plated fit would).a 1600 best named plate gives a set 4200 raw set hp.with this idea a large repper would give (without skills) 800hp but instead of doing that every 15 seconds in one chunk (leaving a big 3 volley alpha hole) it gives the 800hp (without skills) over the 15 second period (53 per second or 26.5 every .5 secs ect).it woulds be a little like the passive shield tank effect but with a active rep component doing the recharging.ps: i only used the armour tank as a example and would apply this effect to all active boosters and reppers in eve (shield, rr and hull)."
4/20/2009,maybe i'm just confused... but isn't that gap there for the exact purpose of striking between reps?
4/20/2009,hell yeah lets nerf alphastrikes because minmatar are so overpowered(hahaha no)
4/20/2009,"oh joy a goontard.....how often are local active tanks used in pvp compared to plus and plate fits at the moment?.and considering the rof of mini guns a repper gets a cycle in between their volleys already so it hardly effects them.not as far as im aware.....how often do you hold your fire until you see a ships armour or shields get repped a little and then start firing?.active tanks are already one of the thinest in the game let alone coupled with the cap, fitting and cycle time they suffer from."
4/20/2009,fit 2 small shield booster. works well on a golem/cnr. atleast for missions. not so sure about pvp. besides shield booster already have a shorter cycle time. for the usual 2x lar setup i think staggering the reps might help
4/20/2009,"im not asking advise on how to pvp as i have been playing eve and pvping for 6 years and have several thousand kills, i am making a suggestion for improving active tanking and making it a more viable option in pvp."
4/20/2009,you don't sound like you've been playing for 6 years.
4/20/2009,how can i make suggestions or comment when your idea is contradictory and wholly doesn't make a damn bit of sense?
4/20/2009,"maybe you could start by explaining why you think it makes no sense, as when i posted it in other threads it has been highly supported and understood."
4/20/2009,why argue with someone who has no idea how game mechanics work? i'm not going to waste a lot of breath on you. your idea is simply not going to work because that's not how the game is going to work. --isaac
4/20/2009,i know exactly how the game mechanics work pal its you who obviously does'nt fully understand the idea.so are you are saying that the passive drake does not work?.ok im now not sure if you are trolling or just clueless...
4/20/2009,first off... the only clueless person around here is you.secondly... if your going to suggest a change to the mechanics... take the time to do a propper explanation and list the reasons why... not beating around the damn bush.not supported due to the size of op's ego matches that of a planet that and he's obviously a bloody liar and a posting with an alt.6 years my ass.
4/20/2009,"well if i'm relying on an alpha strike ship, or a ship with slow rof. timing is key. so, in my wolf. never.in a sniping battleship. literally every time i fire my guns.as for 6 years? what?"
4/20/2009,"i don't see any benefit to this. getting killed by burst dps is not easy outside of a serious blob fight, and if anyone can kill you that fast, a repper won't help. it also increases problems with module lag. as for why people fit passive tanks, it's because pvp fights are short. at max skills, a lar adds 71 hp/second, and a 1600 adds 5250 hp. if the fight lasts less than 74 seconds, the plate is better, on top of being a lot easier to fit. unless you want yet another buff to ship base hp, which would screw up other things fairly badly(most notably, station dock timers), or unless you want to buff active tanking massively, which would destroy pve balance, you aren't going to fit active tanks on any ship where a plate gives you more hp in the opening 30-60 seconds of the fight. capitals fit active tanks, because they have no reason to bother with those dinky plates, but subcapitals will plate until you make an active tank better, not just more finely divided."
4/20/2009,"the key to what?, if you hold your fire until he has repped all you are doing is reducing your dps?. the only reason i can think of to hold fire is if you have a monster alpha and want to ninja the km but that is hardly a laudable or valid reason.or maybe against a ship with a high transversal and you need to time your shot when it dips to a point you can hit it, but that is another issue all together and has nothing to do with this matter."
4/20/2009,"a lar has 1 cycle for 800 or so every 15 secs so you go 15 with 0 armour repped until the cycle renews, with this idea you would have been getting repped bit by bit upto the 800 or so hp for the entire 11 seconds. i know why ppl fit plates instead of reppers in a lot of situations but the 74 second rule does not apply to a mobile and intricate pvp fight, it also means that a roaming gang with plates needs to find a place to rep up or bring rr along in the form of drones or modules/logistics ships. this is a idea for solo and small gang pvp where the dps is naturally lower, along with the fact ppl manouver and warp in and out engage/disengage and a resist and rep regenerative tank would be a reasonable and useful option.the fitting issue for active boosters/reppers also needs to be addressed as it is a crazy situation that it should have so many short commings in pvp and so few benifits compared to plated fits."
4/20/2009,"jesus you're like a child.unchronicled shots do not = more dps. 5 ships with ungrounded artillery cannons all off sync will be easily tanked by someone with an active tank.if every volley coincides directly after a rep in a long cycle. the damage will be done all at once. and instant massive damage is better than staggered damage in any scenario where you want the enemy ship to pop as fast as possible.as for your boosting idea... they already have that, it's called small reppers/boosters. thats why you're getting flamed.i'm curious as to what ship loss caused you to take up this crusade. you must have had a bad streak attempting to active tank or something."
4/20/2009,"maybe you should read your own stupid unclear post.you do not say anything about synchronising a gang of ships you only mention one.if all the ships fire at the same time half way through a bloody rep cycle the damage will be done all at once you clown. a simple target caller saying ""fire"" can synchronise your gangs shots ffs.the only reason you would apply it just after a rep cycle is if you had a fast rof and wanted to get as many volleys in between his reps as possible in the hopes he would go pop before his next cycle.1400mm arties with 3 dmg mods and max skills could maybe get two volleys off in between a non staggerd twin lar rep cycle depending on if the tanking ship had rep rigs fitted but the fact is that it is all speculation and eft warrioring as active tanks are very rare in conventional pvp or i would not be trying to improve and thus increase their useage.im talking about pvp rep and resist fits for solo and small gang fighting not stupid pve fits.why would you think summat like that, do you only post after you lose a ship or summat?.having active tank modules spread their repair ammount over their cycle time instead of just lumping it all together at the end of it is a much better way of operating its that simple and i thought of the idea while reading a post about active tanking on the ships and modules forum."
4/20/2009,"no. no it is not that simple. stating an opinion, vaguely, and then expecting everyone to agree with you is probably not the best way to win an argument.drake was right, this is like talking to a wall. active tank =/= passive tankthey have different uses, they operate differently, and whether you like it or not they are both viable in combat. no need for a change, and you don't get my support, nor apparently anyone else's. now stop wasting a top slot in the assembly hall, this place is clogged enough with bad ideas without yours sitting on page 1."
4/20/2009,"i will reply to as many posts as i feel like thanks, and if you do not like it tough.1. your post is the first hypocritical one here, and other than your proposed change, you offered nothing but a vague reason as to why it would be better. i.e. your opinion.you are more of a <U+1F51>p<U+03CC><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03B9>s<U+03B9> than me. i'm not kidding around, i at least gave you a few reasons why i personally wouldn't like it, since this is less of an argument and more of an exchange of opinions. the rest of the board responded by not supporting, and barely responding to you.2. drake is not an idiot. rude yes, arrogant yes, and out of line... most of the time. but you're just as rude to fill your own thread with responses instead of simply telling us why this would be better other than it's more like a passive tank?that brings me to...3. why would anyone want the active tanking system to be more like a passive tanking system? you haven't given any reasons... because people use drakes? wow. people use amarr ships quite a bit too for their tanking ability.4...... uh i don't care how many times you reply, people like me and drake will continue to shoot you down. i was giving you the honorable out. your idea is obviously not getting support, angers a few of us who appreciate things like spelling, variety, and etiquette. in a situation like this, an intelligent person would simply bow out, and devote his time to re-arranging his proposal with more reasoning, changes, or ideas, or simply stop arguing a moot point. lets hope you're one of those."
4/20/2009,"i gave a good reason why it would be better and ofcourse its my opinion ffs if it was anybody elses it would not be me posting it you clown.i did and have done that if you did not understand it that your problem, do not make it mine by trolling the thread and claiming its not understandable just because you are to stupid to get it.1. it helps close the alpha hole.2. it would allow reppers to be run reasonably well on a ships passive cap regen instead of needing 400 cap for a single delayed cycle (so its yay for mini and missile user not booo).3. i also mentioned reducing the fitting costs due to how ineffective reppers are compared to plates..you have shot nothing down, all you and the other clown have done is show your ignorace, inexperiance and capacity to troll.add to the discussion, ask questions or go away."

4/20/2009,"the ""alpha hole"" i describe on say a lar fit would be the gap between rep cycles, so if it is 11 seconds between rep cycles the oposing ship/ships have 11 seconds to hit you with enough dmg to pop you.in my modal the reppers would rep say 80 dmg per second for 40 cap..., instead of how they are now giving say 800 dmg repped after 10 seconds for 400 cap.(obviosly these figures are not totally accurate to in game figures but using 10 seconds makes the math easy to do and understand).it does not change the simple end math no.but imagine if you have only 200 cap available or even 80 in actual pvp..., with things as they are your repper would not activate because it needs 400 and even if it did you would need to wait 11 seconds to get any benifit. but with the new system 200 cap would give you 5 cycles or likewise 80 cap would gave you 2 cycles and the benifit would be 80 hp repaired x the amount of cycles, so 5 x 80 = 400 hp repped and 2 x 80 = 160hp repped.perhaps but the fact is that when you consider that a 1600 plate costs 500 pg and 28cpu base for 4200 hp, and a single lar 2300 pg and 55 cpu as well as 400 cap per cycle for a base of just 800 hp per 15 seconds it is obvious that reps need reducing in fitting cost considewring their poor effectivness."
4/20/2009,"okay, can everyone on both sides calm down for a minute? you're all making asses of yourselves. you're both trying so hard to make the other person look bad that nobody is actually making any sort of a point. stop flaming, get back to actual debate, and this might be a thread worth having. right now, all it deserves is a scrubbing or a locking."
4/20/2009,"alright. simply put, i disagree with the op's proposed change because it's simply pushing active and passive tanks closer together. i do not agree with it.is that civil enough?"
4/20/2009,"and this is how i reply to reasonably phrased and inteligent questions:the ""alpha hole"" i describe on say a lar fit would be the gap between rep cycles, so if it is 11 seconds between rep cycles the oposing ship/ships have 11 seconds to hit you with enough dmg to pop you.in my modal the reppers would rep say 80 dmg per second for 40 cap..., instead of how they are now giving say 800 dmg repped after 10 seconds for 400 cap.(obviosly these figures are not totally accurate to in game figures but using 10 seconds makes the math easy to do and understand).it does not change the simple end math no.but imagine if you have only 200 cap available or even 80 in actual pvp..., with things as they are your repper would not activate because it needs 400 and even if it did you would need to wait 11 seconds to get any benifit. but with the new system 200 cap would give you 5 cycles or likewise 80 cap would gave you 2 cycles and the benifit would be 80 hp repaired x the amount of cycles.perhaps but the fact is that when you consider that a 1600 plate costs 500 pg and 28cpu base for 4200 hp, and a single lar 2300 pg and 55 cpu as well as 400 cap per cycle for a base of just 800 hp per 15 seconds it is obvious that reps need reducing in fitting cost considewring their poor effectivness."
4/20/2009,"yes, though to be fair you've been the least obnoxious by a good margin. and for that matter, i agree with you. i think he's trying to solve problems that don't exist with solutions that won't work. i just don't think that a flame war between op and drake solves anything, and it's gotten past the point where it amuses me."
4/20/2009,"i don't see that as a hole. any gang that can do 100k damage in 10 seconds is going to kill you, no matter what your repper's cycle time is. 800 repair, even assuming 90% resists across the board, can't even buy you an extra second. if anything, i'd like to see alpha made into more of a consideration, not less - right now, dps is the only thing that matters. if you're that low, it's either because you're being neuted, in which case you won't get above 40 without a cap booster(and with a cap booster, you'd prefer status quo reppers, because they use all that cap, instead of letting it get neuted away), or because you've used the cap already, in which case a bit of change to how the cap use is parcelled out won't matter much. i don't see this helping much under any reasonable circumstance. active tanks are hard up against the realities of pve balance. pve, not needing nearly as many specialized modules, lasting far longer at much lower intensity, and with known damage types that can be tanked with two pair of hardeners, allows for a much larger active tank. without a massive shift in pve numbers, you can't make active tanks good at subcapital pvp without making them far too good at pve. i regret that somewhat, but i can't see any easy way of making active, passive, and buffer tanks all viable and not overpowered at both pvp and pve. unless you can figure out a real way of improving this, i can't get very enthusiastic about changing it. furthermor, your proposal doesn't change the viability of an active pvp tank at all - i'm no more likely to fit a lar if it did 80 per 1.125 than i am when it does 800 per 11.25 like at present. you're not fixing it, you're just changing it."
4/20/2009,"i did say this was about solo and very small gang pvp and i do not consider the raw dmg of 10 gank fitted close range bs to be a small gang or solo amount of dmg output tbh...of course you will, the natural regen of a mega gives 20 cap per second so thats 1 cycle every 2 seconds even without a cap recharger fitted vs never getting to 400 for a normal cycle because of the neuts cycling.if you cannot see the benifit of being able to rep 400hp over 5 secs for 200 cap instead of needing to wait for your cap not only to get to 400 but also needing to wait for 10 seconds after that for a cycle in a solo or very small gang pvp situation then i cannot make you. although im the first to say on a bs hull and considering the available forms of pvp at the moment for bs its application is limited.but do not forget to consider that it would be applied to med and small reppers/boosters in the same way, and then think about the bc, cruiser and especially frig hulls that are very vulnerable within the alpha hole i describe above as well as not really wanting to plate up or use extenders due to how much speed the plate reduces them by and larger sig radius the extenders give.these changes may not be earth shattering for bs considering the availability of pvp for them at the moment although they would be useful in a few limited ways, but on smaller ships they would be a lot more useful and viable and maybe even prefered to a plated or extended fit due to the drawbacks the others give that smaller hulls rely on like speed and sig radius."
4/20/2009,"that's exactly my point. if they can alpha you down in 10 seconds, they're not a small gang. no local tank will save a ship primaried by a big gang. doesn't matter what your cycle time is - if they can alpha you down, your repper won't save you. you say you've been playing for 6 years, but you don't even know how cap regen works? if you're at zero, you don't get 20 cap a second, you get closer to 4. that 20 is only valid if you're at about 1/3 cap - aside from there, you regen far slower. you really think 80 hp every 10 seconds will save you? no, i really can't see the advantage of not having to wait. yeah, it'll save your bacon one time in a thousand, but the rest of the time it doesn't much matter. if you're using a cap booster, those 400 charges will run your tank basically permanently and at full strength, whereas under your system you run it at 1/5 to 1/10 strength assuming proper neut staggering. your system would harm an active tanker at least as often as it'd help them. also, i'm not sure precisely what your complaint about small ships is, but it seems kind of silly to demand that you get bonuses without penalties all the time. yes, plates slow you down and extenders blow you up, but they're a form of tank that's actually somewhat useful. accept their penalties or work around them, but don't assume that you should get a bonus of equal magnitude without any penalties - that's just nonsense."
4/20/2009,"what part of solo and small gang are you having problem understanding?, this is not about it competing with a rack of plates in a gang v gang situation its about it being more effective in solo and small gang.there are two options for the idea (im using lars in the example but it can be scaled down relativly for meds and smalls).1. you get the repper giving 800 hp over its 11-15 second cycle for 400 cap.or2. the cycle time is reduced along with the rep amount and cap usage by say a factor of 10, so you rep 80 per second for 40 cap per cycle.where the f*ck do you get the idea that im complaining about small ships?, do you understand the differance between pointing out a benifit the change i suggest gives over extenders and plates (like you and others asked me to do) and complaining about summat?.and where do you get the ""benifits without penalties"" comment from?, reps use loads of cap and have huge fitting costs compared to plates as well as needing to run for many cycles (well over a minute with a lar vs a single 1600 rtp) to give the same amount of hp.how many more freaking penalties could you possably fit on a bloody module?."
4/20/2009,"the part i'm having trouble understanding is why you're talking about a ship fitting a lar getting killed by alpha damage inside the 11.25 second window between repairs. if you die that fast, you're not facing a small gang. either the alpha simply isn't that high, at which point your argument fails, or you're facing a big gang, at which point your argument is irrelevant. yes, i get that. we all get that. the thing is, we don't think it'd be a useful change. i was referring to the line ""think about the bc, cruiser and especially frig hulls that are very vulnerable within the alpha hole i describe above as well as not really wanting to plate up or use extenders due to how much speed the plate reduces them by and larger sig radius the extenders give."" - i'm not entirely sure what you meant by that, but i was responding to it. ""benefits without penalties"" comes from your whining about plate/extender penalties. you want all the tank a plate provides, without having to slow down, so you come up with this. at least, that's sure how it seems. i don't know why you'd think this would solve the problem, but from what i can tell, that's one of the problems you see and are trying to fix. also, seriously man, cool it. i know we don't see eye to eye on this, but you could at least try not to make yourself look like a fool when you defend your proposal."
4/20/2009,"how can getting the hp from your reppers sooner and spread out over its 10-15 second cycle instead of having to wait until the end of its cycle not be a benifit?. so in your world pointing out the drawbacks of extenders and plates and saying that a repper does not have those draw backs but others like fitting, cap and a relativly small rep amount compared to the hp a plate gives is whining?.iknow its standard procedure for certain posters to call anybody with a opinion that differs from your own or a point to make a whiner but do try to control it you will look less stupid if you do."
4/20/2009,"never done one of these but i think i got the format correct. i was looking through the wiki to see if this has been brought up yet. i did not see it, but it's possible i looked over it.i'd like to inquire to the possibility of an actual ""log"" being added into the game so we may see whom is giving to and taking from the corp hangar, instead of trying to manage it with audit containers."
4/20/2009,overdue feature. supported.
4/20/2009,"very ditto. this has definitely been mentioned here before, but i looked over the csm wiki too and i guess it just never made it to a csm meeting before.this would be especially excellent if it were combined with some sort of auto-notification system that ceos and directors could set up, both to alert them to low or high stocks of certain things (need more ammo in the corporate ammo hangar tab, or high volume of unrefined ore in corporate ore drop-off hangar tab), and to potential thefts (someone took a large quantity of things from a corporate hangar and immediately removed corporate roles)."
4/20/2009,this was sadly voted down. i guess my eyes will have to bleed to death now
4/20/2009,i'd love to add more historical quotes to my bio
4/20/2009,"i disagree with the programming angle. this guy summed it up. ccp limited the character limit because some people would experience lag if opening a bio that was 50,000 characters long.this problem is simply. triple the current limit, and have a warning pop up for character bios longer than the current length. i.e. (warning this character's bio is another x characters long, and could cause lag upon opening, proceed? {show this warning again, yes, no})the idea of limiting what little expression there is in the game is silly. supported.also, seriously, if their database was so intrinsically connected to it's own data, the goons would have shut the game down by now."
4/20/2009,"if throwing around simple undirected lag was an exploit, they would have nerfed hardin's corp history years ago(seriously, try loading it, maybe go cook yourself dinner while you wait). the old bio had a character length cap too, and it wasn't an extraordinarily long one - not much longer than a forum post, iirc. i can't imagine this was a reaction to lag issues."
4/20/2009,supporting on the principle that more faction ships = better. tier 1 battleship variants would be cool but i would rather see faction bcs first.
4/20/2009,"oh yeah, black amarr ships"

4/20/2009,"i can't play much at work and i don't have an interesting job atm so i browse the forum. although this never happened to me (or anyone i know) it's getting more and more annoying to see all that posts about bans. i'm starting to get an impression that soon every large isk transfer (in billions) will lead to a ban (?!) so how about saving some gm and player time (skill points and isk also) and do something about it.ideas:1) every direct isk transfer (char to char) larger than 500mil (or something like that) should be done through a new window where both characters state the reason for the trasfer. that info could be of some help if your account gets banned for no reason. it could be avoided by sending, say, 2x 250 mil, but it would definitely make life harder for isk sellers. 2)the time frame could be added also. something like: ""you recieved xxx isk from some_character in the last hour. you will need to confirm/proove that you are not buying the isk"" or something like that. this could be implemented it the client so the only thing that adds traffic to the server is the message you send after typing in reasons for the transfer.3) i don't know... figure something out yourself cheers"
4/20/2009,and you my friend got trolled. ccp doesn't ban someone for being too rich. quit buying dirty isk.--isaac

4/20/2009,"maybe this is a reason for me to see this problem... oh well, if there isn't a problem we shouldn't try to find a solution for it"
4/20/2009,"choosing the immobility drivers subsystem grants a bonus to a mid-slot module, but yields less overall mid-slots than choosing some of the other electronic subsystem options. why would adding a subsystem designed to augment a mid-slot module add a low slot?this is not the case for any of the other races electronic subsystems:proteus gains max mid-slots for electronic subsystems when choosing friction extensiontengu gains max mid-slots for electronic subsystems when choosing obfuscation manifoldlegion gains max high-slots for electronic subsystems when choosing energy parasitic complex.i propose that the immobility drivers subsystem add 4 mid-slots instead of 3 mid-slots and a low-slot.ps: i do realize this screws up some pretty good builds for the loki, but it grants just as many and simply makes more sense."
4/20/2009,"oh no, there's tradeoffs required when building t3 ships. i agree that the module probably isn't as powerful as it'd be with +4 mids, but it's certainly not as powerful as it'd be with +6 mids. just because the power level can increase doesn't mean it should."
4/20/2009,"way to dive down the slippery slope. im arguing for logic and consistency. i havent proposed some ludicrous slot distribution like adding 6 mids; what i have proposed is entirely consistent with the existing mechanic in terms of both total slots and typical distribution for the subsystem in question. and again, every other race gains the maximum number of appropriate slots within the standard distribution pattern when choosing a subsystem that adds a bonus to a specific type of module. im just not sure why the minmatar ships are always the odd man out.moreover, this slot distribution doesnt necessarily make the loki more powerful as i have several good configurations that use extended webs and make good use of the extra low, since it is difficult to both shield tank and use webs (because you really need 2)."
4/20/2009,"no, your proposal wasn't unreasonable. it's not that it was bad, it's that i tend to prefer changing the status quo only if there's a good reason to do so. i don't see a good reason in this case. this seems like an issue of preference, not of a generally-agreed improvement, and i tend to think that the csm should try to confine itself more to the latter."
4/20/2009,"fair enough...i still feel my argument has merit, but i respect your perspective."
4/20/2009,"i'm not sure what to say. on one hand, it's not good to have a 3-ship module slot streak running, and then just have one different, nor is it good to have them all the same (diversification). my opinion? do it to one of the other ship subsystems too. 2 for 2 man!may i ask, are you one of the lucky few to actually own a loki?"
4/20/2009,i'm waiting on a few of the newer subsystems to become available.
4/20/2009,"mhh, this feels like a market 101 learning session here. yes its always better to do inventions. dont sell your datacores. but selling it is a good way to make isk anyway.for the rest..mhhh nope, i wont tell you how to do it but its pretty obvious though."
4/20/2009,there is profit in invention. and i like wars. wars make things go boom. that keeps the market going. please blow up more things. my sell orders are up :p
4/20/2009,"i propose that when a pilot enters a system via a cynosural jump in (including titan and black ops bridges), he or she does not show up in local until he or she comes on-grid of a stargate or station, or speaks in local.though the logic behind why local exists is a little flawed no matter how you cut it up, the proposal conforms to the existing logic better than the current system. when you cyno in you have not entered the system via a stargate or station cloning facility, so there wouldnt be any record of your entry. this would be especially true of entry via covert cynosural fields and bridges.moreover, this mechanic boosts the effectiveness of black ops and covert cynos, making a black ops supported recon team very stealthy."
4/20/2009,"good idea, but i think it should be implemented first for covert cynos only then we'll see what happenz."
4/20/2009,"this change would be positive, like riding a bike with training wheels is positive. i'm still waiting for the day all of local is set to ""recent speakers"" mode."

4/20/2009,"i like the way the salvage ""system"" already works so no change is neccesary but...if there would be a change (threatening me with a gun on my head ) well, how about this:first to salvage the wreck belongs to him... its yellow even to you, fleet, corp mates and everyone else. becomes white to the person who does the first successful salvage. plain and simple. just like cans (i dont know if it changed with the patches) but if the can is yellow and you take from it, its stealing and you get aggro..well you can shoot him in other words."
4/20/2009,"i was reading the first page and got bored. bear with me. if a wreck is salvaged by anybody outside that player's corp/alliance in the first 15 mintues after the wreck is created, that gets the ninja salvager flagged. after this, the salvager can do whatever the hell he likes, including looting the wreck."
4/20/2009,"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.keep salvaging free. i'd also like to thank those people who keep leaving their t2 drones behind once they have handed in a mission. would you like to have aggro on a salvager for those as well?"
4/20/2009,"0.0 warfare: agreed, and ccp is closely looking at this too. i expect much to happen regarding this in the near future, but that future is in ccp's hands, based on their workload.0.0 environment: i can agree with more pirate-faction npc space, but not with the improved ais....yet. the ai will gradually weed it's way into 0.0 space, but mostly in commander spawn tactics.market/contract improvements: i think one of the last things the market system needs is more datacalls, as it's already overworked with the current system. the sales per system is something that you need to acquire from research, not just a blanket statement. the better contract searches i can agree with though.ui improvements: well, yes, the ui does need to be improved, but you can already see the state of the modules by looking at the pos structure. admittedly, i've only setup poses, i've never sieged them, but even still, i can't see how this would improve the system as it is. ccp should be looking into this as we speak (hopefully). the ui improvements i would recommend would be an improved layout so that people don't get a headache from the overflow of information.ccp policy visibility: yes, their policy is currently being worked on, especially with the whole bobzoku incident. however, as a csm, that won't be in your responsibility, as we're only liaisons.lowsec revitalization: move level 4 agents to low-sec?!? there's already risk enough in high sec, as most of the agents are in trade hubs and player interference is a common thing. low-sec does need to be improved, but that should be done by boosting it, not by nerfing high-sec. low-sec has level 5 missions, which is enough - i ran one level 5 mission and wound up in my cloning station. also, people who don't want to leave high-sec never will. it's the nature of the beast, and the reputation that low-sec has, even if it isn't fully deserved, is the part that needs working on.and much much more: i agree that moms need an improvement, but the evemail should soon be hit with a sledgehammer and reassembled. t3 is a new introduction, so give it some time. sovereignty is also hopefully being looked at with intense scrutiny.that said, i do think you could be a valuable asset to the csm. remember that a csm is only an elected official to filter through the forums and coalesce the data into a usable concept for ccp to consider. best of luck though."
4/20/2009,"not so much adding more npc space but improving the ai there. why should more intelligent npc be restricted to missions and wormhole space? it would be a way to keep nearby alliances stimulated with combat even if their space isn't threatened at that moment. take venal for an example where guristas have sovereignty. when they aren't off fighting a war, rzr could send their troops there to attack guristas towers and camps. all of these would be randomly generated by the game system and as a result limit chances of ""perceived abuse/favortism."" i wasn't aware of the current system being overworked. if that is the case then it is unfortunate.when there are 20-60 dreads hitting a pos, having to select the module on overview and then find it in space to see if it is online is a complete pain in the ass. if you've got brackets turned off you are in for even more suffering. nevermind the fact of having modules grouped together and you can't tell if one you selected is ""online"" among the cluster of ""incapacitated"" ones. this all goes for repairing modules too. it'd be my responsibility to convey what the players have complaints about and this has been one everyone has grumbled about at one point or another. perhaps if a new standings system were added to the game which allowed for people in lowsec to pay for additional protection as a buffer for getting used to the harsher environment. if they've been running missions for the entity in control of that system (racial faction or corporation owning local stations?) or bribing them a ship could spawn should they be attacked which would attempt to intercept the pirate and give a chance to escape? the very same pirates could do similar things via bribing so a blind eye is turned towards them attacking people in that area. agreed. thank you for responding to my introduction, bunyip."

4/20/2009,i bet any posturing done by me will get a lot more attention.heh heh heh.
4/20/2009,"oh ouch, that hurt.... oh wait i never claimed to be anyone important but this guy comes out withand since he seems to think he represents all players and i have no actual idea who he is and the fact that he apparently is representing all players now via another player whose(sp?) sole game time is spent in an industrial corp i have to say that does inspire confidence. these words carry very little weight when the character you post from has not a single kill on battleclinc.com or eve-kill.net , granted you'll probably have alts but not having any kills isnt exactly advertising your ""pvp is what makes this game interesting to me as well as to my whole staff !"" line."
4/20/2009,"ank, as much as i would love to be manipulated by your feminine ways and horrible dutch accent much like your man erik...i do love your excellent website and you do seem to have put in a lot of effort as csm but as a self confessed pacifist where is your passion for eve? pew pew? this is an area that you and your 'advisors' and indeed your chosen candidate really appear to have little or no grasp of. i will be the first to admit i can't tell one end of a bpo from the other, but i do know how important miners and manufacturers are to my work. do you people know how important we are to your work? i think not."
4/20/2009,"level 4 agents should be transitioned to be in lowsec. it'll bring more players to that area and bring the isk value of missions more in tune with risk vs. reward. increasing bounties on the rats in lowsec would help this too. and speaking of websites, i completely revamped mine. ;)"
4/20/2009,"i am a ""fuel bitc.."" and a pos manager in my small corp, and no body's alt. i avoid gate camps when flying to my pos in 0.0, but i guess that is not enough pvp for you while my skill is not sufficiently high to engage you in a direct combat. i promise that if you show up at my pos, and i have you in my sights i will do my best to give you your moneys worth of fun you mean, no matter how valid a point i make about pvp, it's worth little in if i don't have any kills? that sounds like some religious extremist crap, and it hurts, ouch! . now i am definitely voting for the sensitive types."
4/20/2009,"pew, pew drives the economy granted, but as you admit in your own thread it is about balance : ""i am a pirate and a scoundrel but if things aren't kept balanced then i will run out of targets pretty quick"". i support them precisely because they understand this, and i am passionate about eve even as a ""pacifist"" just in a different way then you."
4/20/2009,"i don't think my pos was directed at you but anyway.. 1 pos? if its one pos it doesn't exactly make you a pos manager since its like once every 30 days you top up the fuel, woohoo , and is no real excuse to not have at least a few kills. saying that i should come to your pos and you'll pew pew me is hilarious and i'm curious if you even have the skill to pos gun at all or are you talking about auto-aggro? that's exactly what i'm saying."
4/20/2009,"hi,thanks for your response, but i feel you have avoided answering the question a little.i was hoping more for a response which listed what *you* felt to be issues and the the resolution you would promote.for example:""i see neutral remote repair being an issue - thus, i would campaign for either concord shooting neutral remote repairing or repairing causing an aggro timer so that docking is not possible for 2 minutes.""this will allow us to very explicitly see your views on *what* issues are faced in eve and your philosophy on how these are best fixed.i look forward to your response.jaina"
4/20/2009,"sorry, i didn't know that commenting on issue which i feel effects me, but is not directed at me, was against proper etiquette. it wont's happen again.well it takes a bit more for one person to find cheapest fuel and deliver it in a transport ship, with a small cargo space. i don't have time to play for hours at the time so i have to do a bit everyday. i also take care of selling off the minerals, researching blue prints etc. anyhow my point is that as a character with specific role in mind, being only 4 months old, i do have enough evasion skills to avoid gate camps etc. but i hadn't the time to develop other, more combat related skills. i focus on skills i need including starbase defense for the guns. of course if you came with an intention of destroying my pos you will not come alone anyway, so inviting you to a fight was a bit of irony in case you didn't notice. my point was that my inability to offer you a serious challenge in a fight, doesn't exclude my ability to draw conclusions about pvp and what it means for me.perhaps we should propose to ccp, that people with less then 50 kills should simply be banned from discussing pvp, then you would not have to waste your precious time to explain to a noob like me what this game is all about. brilliant!"

4/20/2009,"boo hoo! people have a decent income through a playstyle i don't like! nerf them!do you honestly believe that people come out to lowsec if you remove level 4 missions alltogether? nope. they'll just go do level 3 missions, or look for other ways to generate isk in highsec, such as mining (plently of ore in some level 3 missions, ha), exploration, trading or producing. oh ****, nerf that too as those people have to be dragged kicking and screaming into lowsec! by the time people like you are done with the game the only thing that you'll have accomplished is making a lot of people quit. because a lot of people would quit with their assets intact, hoping for better days, before venturing into lowsec. and if this type of player ventures into lowsec and gets a l4 mission ship ganked a few times, you can bet that they quit.have you even considered other playstyles as your own? i think that people that can't, won't make a good csm. erik on the other hand, has given ample display that he can step outside his own little sandbox and see the impact and consequences of changes to the game mechanics for multiple playstyles.by the way, for completeness sake, i've already brought that level 4 in highsec ""problem"" to ccp as part of the missions under review issue. ccp didn't even see it as an item worthy of discussion, but feel free to bring it up again if you ever make it to the csm so ccp can put you in your place and we can have some lulz. if the rest of the csm doesn't protect you from your own stupidity and shoots your issue down, that is.also, in case you haven't noticed, i lobbied for low-sec boosts and we got battleship-sized rats in there now as the first step, and improved ore is on the horizon.thank you for your appreance in erik's thread, please come again."

4/20/2009,"thanks for the compliment, larkonis.yes, i am a true pacifist in eve, even when i go to 0.0 or play factional warfare i don't go out with the intention to shoot other players, which is an activity that simply is not enjoyable for me as a person, and conflicts with my rather strict moral code which i apply to games as much as real life.however, i look at eve from the perspective of a game designer rather than a player, one that did run a ultima online server and has hosted several other game communities as well, such as nationstates and is only months away from graduating for a master degree. i might not like pvp, but there are many players that do. in an mmo, like ultima online and like eve, a game designer should seek to create game mechanics that benefit and balance different playstyles, as all playstyles are inevitably intertwined. and like a ball of twine, one should not peck at strands and attempt to unravel the thing until there is nothing left of the ball itself. if we would do so, we'd end up with a very one-dimensional game indeed!it took me a long time to find someone with a similar mindset, but i truly believe that erik has it. he will not just advocate his own playstyle, but work towards the betterment of the game as a whole. pvp is part of the game, pvp is fun for a lot of people, so we will do whatever we can to make it even better. we may not know every detail of it, but we'll spend the effort of researching any complex issues that show up.just like factional warfare. i spent months in the militia, did you think i'd enjoy that kind of activity? oh yes i like the shiny ranks a lot, but for me fw is rather boring and unrewarding. i saw that no other csm picked up fw, and that there were many things wrong with it. i didn't mind dedicating a lot of my playtime to experience it and nail down all specific issues i could. it's a shame that a lot of fw players did not understand what i was doing and just criticized my 'cowardly' playstyle, but my satisfaction will come when my work comes to fruition and fw improvements will seep into the game, eventually.there was some criticism towards the selection of advisors in another thread, but i'd like to point out that rufus britton has experience in low-sec pvp and is currently packing to head out for 0.0."

4/20/2009,"some of ccp's best decisions (stuff like corpses floating in space) are from sources much like the inside of istvaan's head, they really need to let that kind of thinking dominate more of what the game is like"
4/20/2009,"i was going to vote for mazz, but your platform of grief and unending torrents of blood has me intrigued. please good sir, elaborate further on the coming bearpocalypse..."
4/20/2009,are you a girl?
4/20/2009,nope
4/20/2009,"i wanted to stay out of this, but as i can see there is some personal issues derailing thread (how could this happen in eve...?!, some tournament ring a bell), but dude, seriously, what is your argument that you will be better than others? not that they did great job anyways... i mean, i like your style, and i believe you would, but still need convincing...hmmm,... am i also alt of friedrich? if i do enough ash kissing maybe i get recruitment convo with free cookies and carriers and vindicator perheps..."
4/20/2009,"one of the biggest reasons i think i will be better than others is experience. on csm, nope. but, in rl, i have lots of experience working in a political environment (i am a civil engineer, working with local municipalities mostly) so things like councils, planning commissions, etc (which is how csm is organized) are second nature. operating within the csm environment should be easy.secondly, this csm will be devoting a significant portion of its time helping ccp out with new sov mechanics. from my current understanding, ccp is looking to utilize a system similar to the faction warfare system as a base for the new sov mechanics. look at fooms (my corps) history within faction warfare. we have one of the best records of all the militias for both pvp as well as pve. we broke ground in faction war so many times  first to do empire (in our case, jita) raiding where we tanked the npcs instead of just trying to outrun them  i still feel kinda bad for that officer fit bhaalgorn that was only in the guys possession for less than an hour before we popped it; first to capture multiple systems; first to capture an entire constellation; first to show folks that moving into an area is the only real way to do force projection to capture it; etc etc. yes, now there are several organizations within the various militias that are probably as well organized as we are, but we were the first, and we showed many of them how to do it by example. so, unlike most candidates, i have first hand experience with both the existing sov system (running and managing dozens of pos to do sov spam; logistics via titan jumps, jump freighters, though cyno jammed systems, etc) and as close as possible to the proposed new mechanics with the time spent in faction warfare. your not likely to find a candidate that understands both systems nearly as well as i do, including their benefits and their flaws. considering how ccp intends on working with the game mechanics themselves, now is the time to work with ccp in terms of helping to polish up the faction war mechanics to push it beyond that 80% complete stage, to balance the system out, and to help ccp make sure that sov mechanics are as close to being a completed system when released (due to the importance of sov for 0.0 space) and making sure they stick with it to polish it up once released instead of leaving a mostly finished product out there for us players to deal with its flaws and omissions as best as we can."
4/20/2009,"you say that you are a well-rounded player, a sort of jack of all trades, having experienced both the pvp and logistics aspects. do you have any aspect on the trade and manufacturing based parts of the game too?and, if so, i have another tougher question. eve allows you to be many things, and if you want, you could be a jack of all trades. however, a specialist in eve will beat out a well-rounded character in that particular area of expertise more times than not. so what can you offer, as a ""jack of all trades,"" over some of the more specialized candidates you are running against?"
4/20/2009,"just a simple filter option would fix that. for example, filter everything in local except corp mates, alliance buddies, wartargets, etc. that way, no more mess in local, both for the characters in local and the links in jita or that crap.would be simpler to code in comparision to the op suggest."
4/20/2009,"take care are a group of empire carebears pushing a 3+years in noobcorp agenda, buried under prose and misdirection. they are for mutual pvp and other such wonderful advances. search their posts."
4/20/2009,"i suppose you have some evidence to back up your troll comment? cause if you'd read the campaign thread and all the wonderful work i've been doing the past year, you'd see a different message. and our message seems to be a welcome one to the many players of eve, based on the successes in the past two elections.how about you actually read rufus' posts, he doesn't sound like an empire carebear to me.and actually it's over 5 years in aliastra and over 4 months in the various militias for factional warfare. couldn't get that fact right either."

4/21/2009,"af's could use a bit of boost indeed.what i concider being worth mentioning as well is apart from the missing bonus, there's the retribution with only 1 medium slot, making it a rather limited af in comparisson to the rest"
4/21/2009,"i very much agree, the retribution is entirely useless for solo work (unless you want to try honour tackling), and, outside of frigate hull gangs, the only job you need an assault frigate for is heavy tackle; turn up for a fleet in a retribution and you'll probably be asked to come back in something useful. on top of that, just to rub it in, the alternative for amarr af pilots is outdamaged by t1 frigates. someone at ccp is having a laugh at your expense"
4/21/2009,"agree 100% with this, af's need that little bit extra, and as mentioned why is it that the retribution only has 1 mid slot :<. kinda makes it hard to pvp in it with only 1 mid slot (you either put in a mwd/ab to keep up with things, or you stick a point and not be able to keep up.)"

4/21/2009,buy like 3000 more processers and then switch off the empire cynos aswell :d
4/21/2009,"nerf those ideas, they are too good :dfully supported"
4/21/2009,"i agree on hp boost, but:1. you should take logoff time into consideration. i would suggest to increase aggressed logoff time for supercaps so it would not be a solo survival tactic.moms ecm burst and clone vat bay:1. definately needs boosting (not major though)hangars:don't see any serious problem with them so increasing their size is not vital.olympians is an interesting idea but it needs a lot of tweaking so it would not1. replace dreadnoughts2. be invulnurable for support fleet.(probably charging it with smaller ships like logistics either than with moms, probly some special this purpose only energy transfers, will be more vulnurable to subcapitals/medium sized ships)dd re-work:seems nice, but i personally would like to see more deviation of effect types by dd type. (each race dd will have different effects including cap drain,heat damage , warp disruption , maybe mass web etc)and a really like an idea of personal aoe pos-like temprorary shield , it would be nice. and encourage to use moms in large scale fights.and a small idea of my own:biggest problem of supercapital use in large fleet on fleet battles is definately ammount of damage that kills it almost as fast as regular capital ship.i think we can introduce the following solution:all supercapitals get strontium bay (as pos) , and after shield , armor and lets say some ammount of structure is destroyed supercapital goes into reinforced mode similar to pos but in smaller period ofcourse. (lets say for example moms for 30 minutes and titan for 1 hour), cannot move , fight or logoff etc. (probly may be a good idea to give support fleet the ability to heal the damage and get their supercapitals out of reinforced state)it will give ability to shutdown supercapitals in combat without destroying them and support fleets will have time to respond and save them.(but ofcourse massive hp boost is needed anyway otherwise this solution may not work in full strenght)"
4/21/2009,"i haven't proposed the idea in the features forum, but i'll post it here instead:let titans fit a siege module (idea originally posted here). it seems like the perfect compliment to a fleet of dreadnoughts, and could replace a battleship fleet for anti support with the doomsday device. you jump bridge in the dreads, with the titan following. any battleships or hics that run in for the tackle or warp into grid to snipe get doomsdayed. the damage on titan guns in siege mode is also higher than a dreads, which makes me wonder if they originally planned to allow siege modules on titans in the first place. it would certainly make them viable as more than a glorified smartbomb, and i would actually want to fly one of these if they were changed.it does make the titan more powerful, but the tradeoff is it's more vulnerable to being destroyed in very large capital fights (almost always a guaranteed primary target), but in smaller capital fights it would be invaluable."
4/21/2009,"... why again would you as a normal pilot want more scap's on the battlefield?.super caps are so insanely overpowered compared to anything else in came it is rediculess, they totally remove any means of balance.and don't give me some bull**** with ""they cost a lot of isk"", well so do a best officer fitted bs, one of those can get over 30 billions easy (if any one was crazy enough to fit it), but that doesn't mean it is balanced if it had the abillity to take out whole fleets by itself.caps are overpowered too after the siege and tri modules was introduced.anything that can't be taken down by 4 well fitted bs's with max skilled pilots and t2 fit, is overpowered to the point that it needs to be rebalanced, since it absolete any other ship type (only a matter of time so people can fly them. you already see now that when the cap fleet are comming almost any other ship then a cap is useless and a wasted of pilot space)..my solution:remove the bpo's/bpc's for super caps and reimburse the amount they costed to the corp/alliance.and let the last of these roam untill they die.then remove any siege and tri module bpo and bpc and do the same with these. while removing the modules on market and in hangers and on ships and reimburse the producers with 10% of it's value and the mat it took to build them.now the balance is way better (although a rebalance of the dreads would be needed to get their dmg up a bit, but keep their tank low)"
4/21/2009,"sound, and well thought out, suggestion."
4/21/2009,"by putting super caps on the field in more situations, they're more likely to die. especially when it comes to titans and why their proliferation is so high. it's very hard to make a mistake in a titan atm, it's more about luck to get kills. people point to shrike for titan losses, but only 2 of his were in any sort of actual combat, the other 2 were based on nano bumping using pos passwords. that's more a flaw of game function. **m-o was also in combat, but was reimburse similar to a mm mothership due to a change in servers for testing reasons by the devs. of the 20 or so titans that have died in game: 4 were logged off. 1 was a spy sellout. 3 were to pos bumping outta shields. of the remaining, 2 were total gits warping into fights they never should have been involved in. 1 was due to a terrible cyno and possibly a sellout for a grudge. out of the 20 or so killed, maybe 10 of those were legit, good kills. 10 titans in 2.5 years of game play lost to legitimate fights.these proposals are geared towards making the ships more vulnerable while giving them a different role than just damage. for the titans, it's ment to remove their ability to 1 or 2 volley fleets for a more tactical role and more risk. the only real overpowering problem with capitals right now is the remote repping abilities of carriers and how it's been implimented. i would personally like to see it removed or allowed only in triage or not at all. i mean, why do we even have a logistics ship in game if carriers are used far more often and far more practically in most situations."

4/21/2009,simple - to ease the management of hundreds of corp members and thousands of alliance members and get them on the same page when they log in can ccp not make the alliance and corp channels motd capable so that the ceo (possibly directors) and alliance executor can post in these channels?what say you all? yes or no? bad idea or good idea?

4/21/2009,"first of all.you can't re-use a password in the first place. second, while the intention is good, the solution put forward only serves to annoy more people than it helps.i would be ****ed off if a *game* forces me to change my password on a regular basis. granted that i do it, eve shouldn't force me to do anything but pay my subscription.edit:on the other hand, but implementing a security warning that is shown on the character-selection screen could work.basically, if you haven't changed your password for x amount of time, it will say ""we recommend that you change your password."" in big bold letters."
4/21/2009,first off... anyone who posts a stupid idea like this and has a crap ton of alts posting support is just begging for trouble.... which makes this idea completely stupid.secondly.... if you are running a computer with little to no security on it... and you go off and make a dumbass move in buying isk... you deserve to be hacked.thirdly... it is your responsibility to secure your account... if you don't got brains enough to figure that out.... then i sincerely hope you enjoy being hacked.don't blame ccp for the lack of intelligence you have.get a brain... and actually use it.not supported.
4/21/2009,"do you even know what re-using passwords means? \=anyways, wrong and wrong. you would be really surprised the number of eve accounts you can log into if you capture the username + password + e-mail handed over to a ****ty forum with users that play eve. not like ive ever done it personally, but you know, ive seen it done. a lot of people re-use their passwords.in my experience users cant be trusted with their first and second choices of passwords. the periodic changes dont have to be often, and perhaps a minimum complexity requirement will do just fine. but if you let people do what they want you will always have a certain percentage of people that get ""hacked"" when in reality they input their same password somewhere else.i find this quote funny"
4/21/2009,"this is extremely constructive, since ccp suffers no negative consequences when an account is hijacked and the isk spread around to other accounts and real $ is exchanged because of it. maaaan **** those guys that arent more computer savvy then the average population."

4/21/2009,confirming i want to have mazzilliu babies and support all her ideas.how much for pics ?
4/21/2009,are you allowed to empty quote something just to let it stand alone and people can see its wrongness a second time?account+personal information is on an entirely different level then space monies. i don't really see where you are getting at with your last line. clearly if i know enough to want these policies i probably know enough not to break my own rules?
4/21/2009,let me break it down into small words so you can understand a little more easily.stop blaming ccp for your mistakes.even a 6 year old can figure this out.forcing people to change passwords for there stupid lack of security and common sense is a total waste of time.all your going to do is make customers mad and it will not fix a single bloody thing.there will stil be idiots who install limewire.there will still be idiots who buy isk and get scammed.keyloggers will always be there for downloading pleasure.if you can't think beyond your delusional state than i'm done here because its like talking to a brickwall nevermind a child.
4/21/2009,"what mistakes have i done? you should elaborate more on that part since i have no idea what you are talking about.the issue isnt individuals computers being infected with viruses- ccp cant do much to help that. the issue is easily obtained massive lists of passwords from hacked forums, malicious forums, etc gathering user info handed to them like candy. a matchup of those lists with eve login info will produce a large number of results. enforcing password requirements will decrease that number of results.for example everybody warns each other about re-using their login info on **********.com, but what if scrapheap challenge was hacked and their database backed up? it only takes a few days to get a ton of passwords from a stolen phpbb3 or vbullettin database. it is always the sites you trust that pose the greatest threat."
4/21/2009,"try and go in and change your password to something then. then go back in and try to change it back to your old password again.you will find that you can't. conclusion: you can't re-use old passwords.nobody is it at all questioning that either.the csm already raised a big bunch of security-related things. however, when it comes to passwords, eventually the user has to be trusted. not that i mind if it requires me to have a minimum complexity(mine are about as complex as they get). but we already discussed with ccp about that.basically ccp can't save it's users. there's still a lot of things that ccp can do to help, and that i support. but anything intrusive, like being forced to change passwords on a regular basis, is stupid."
4/21/2009,"in my experience, the more often you make people change their passwords, the less secure those passwords get. it's not quite as bad with a computer game as it is in a workplace scenario, since you can write it down without it being a security breach, but it'd still be a bad idea. also, i dislike a game that i pay for being obnoxious about security - it's goal should be to let me play easy, not to annoy me with security measures to protect fools. if my bank doesn't make me change passwords regularly, neither should my computer games. also, spamming alt support is childish."
4/21/2009,which mistakes you've done?alt spamming?oh you meant the topic i'm sorry.your posting about password security... that imlpies you've been hit or know someone who is... that or your stupidly paranoid.now your arguing that ccp needs to step up security due to forum attacks.got news for yah pal... when someone starts getting worried about security they usually go to the source.this whole proposal is bloody stupid as a result of your logic.i manage phpbb3 boards myself... and if there was a concern for security as far as sql injection and password hacking... there's only 3 factors.1: the user2: the admin3: the server (forums)note i said user first.most cases the server getting compromised along with the admin are few and far between.statistically speaking its the user whose been compromised... not the server.users... do stupid things after all.as i said before you started flapping your gums... the user is responsible for his or her own security.yet you presume that every user is too stupid to be responsible to keep to a secure password.i answer you... who the hell do you think you are to make such a presumption?we can speak for ourselves... if i choose to use a massively complicated password i'll use it.if i choose to use 12345 as a password then that is my bloody right.if i get hit then that's my problem.. not yours... not ccp.ccp has told us time and time again... use effective passwords...don't buy isk... don't do this... don't do that.telling ccp to change our diapers will not fix the problem.the only way people will learn is to get hit once or twice until it sinks in.but most will blame ccp won't they... wah wah... cry me a river.which is why i don't support anti-scamming systems short of being able to mute them for those who are actually picky about the crap that's sprayed on local.(supports darwin awards)if they can't read... then your wasting your breath with this idea.this is nothing more than sheer paranoia.you should be more concerned about the users who use the same passwords for hotmail.com and yahoo.com and eve online... not about the ones who have groups of passwords based on how secure the servers are... or one for each and every little item.stop blaming ccp for your shortcomings... and that goes for the rest of you who happen to support this little idea.grow up... stop being lazy.... change your bloody password and use something unique for once.just keep in mind this whole system is easily defeated with a simple keylogger... all thanks to windows.unless you use a mac or linux... then the odds of getting hit are dependent on your common sense.you keep pushing for something that would anoy the users in the name of security.when in fact you are not helping but making it worse.this changes nothing as far as security.because all one would have to do is keylog your computer and thereby rendering this whole system useless.just like your proposal... completely useless.
4/21/2009,"aha, now there's a detail i hadn't known before :)but there's still no provision for the users that set their password to something stupid and never change it, more specifically re-using it from other websites. a forced password change at least once in a player's lifetime should clear up the majority of re-used-on-other-sites passwords. most people have no clue that re-using their sgrs3%3rt43wv%e2 password on somesketchygamesforum.com and eve-online.com with same username is a security risk. it doesnt have to be as obnoxious as, sayyyy, pandemic legion forums. but if there are restrictions on the number of login attempts, a weak password is far superior to a password that is re-used on another website. it's the difference between handing it over and making them guess at it. you're right, i just wasn't subtle enough and ended up getting caught!"
4/21/2009,hey i heard thatpressing enter every fewwords is a goodway to get peopleto read what you'retrying to say
4/21/2009,"are you talking about the forums.shadowcadre.comboards? if so, i can understand why you take that attitude, since you have about twelve users that an eve account stealer would even take an interest in. small fishiesso the user is the biggest threat to security you even say so yourself, then you say we should not attempt to reduce the vulnerability?this is very funny to me because admins re-use their passwords as well. also incompetent/uneducated server admins for eve corp forums are generally the rule rather then the exception.someone who knows a mere desktop computer can crack ~50% of the passwords from the average stolen phpbb2 forum database in a few minutes with a good dictionary, and a few % more in a few days using different methods. putting targeted keyloggers on eve player's computers takes some social engineering for every single target and is a serious crime of some sort, and only nets you one password. setting up an eve related website that innocently asks users to log in to get access to something, is not a crime at all, nets you a zillion passwords, and a certain % of them will work on eve accounts.and ofc hacking a pre-existing eve related website is very much a crime, but less time investment and no problem if you live in certain foreign countries. nets same end result as above pointhahaha do ittttso i can post all your top secret ""worlds end consortium"" director forums all over the internetswho has to clean up the mess afterwards? always ccp in the endsign me up for the yahoo.com and hotmail.com csm council thingy pleaseman, i really want to use this better password but i cant be arsed to change it from 123456. i really wish ccp could force me to do it..."
4/21/2009,your arrogance and ignorance is just baffling.for someone who is so concerned about security... you know very little about it as a whole.regardless... you can keep alt spamming away... you will get nowhere.
4/21/2009,im voting yes because1) mazz promised me a shaved llama ( with a goatee beard)2) mazz said if i didnt vote yes i would learn a whole new use for pineapples3) its a damn fine idea
4/21/2009,"no... because it doesn't help in real life, it's not going to help game life.forced password changes is a concept for people write down their passwords on paper and leave the paper in a draw or on the table etc. this forced people to protect themselves from themselves. you can't protect the stupid from themselves, if they change their password on eve they'll probably change their password on eve related websites as well. so it's stupid to force them to change their eve password.to be blunt if ccp forced this, i'd petition my password changes every time my password expired. here, i've been forced to change my password, here is a petition back to extend my password expiry, save ccp money? not likely."
4/21/2009,exactly.
4/21/2009,spot on
4/21/2009,"i'm inclined to go with this too, although if i disagree with maz will she get kugu to hack my computer and kill me with it? the stupid people this will be targeted at probably won't take notice, yes their pw's might become slightly more secure but it won't stop them duplicating that pw.i see no harm in implementing this feature, or at the very least a warning every 3 months or so on the log in screen."
4/21/2009,"would you prefer that ccp introduce other optional security measures to protect your account? how about mandatory security measures?take a look at final fantasy xi online and world of warcraft. both of them are offering key-fob random number generators, linked to their players' account(s), that allow them to use one randomly generated number to access their account and play. both of them are optional purchases.on the other hand, most websites that have had problems with spammers and bots have captcha authentication to thwart those sorts of security breaches. rumor has it that these security measures are vulnerable to compromise by sufficiently advanced ai's (don't laugh, they're in development!)both of these examples are used all of the time by major corporations to enhance their security and make sure that something doesn't happen in irl. these measures cost lots of money... but they save much more when used properly.and you say that because something is a hindrance to your real life that it cannot possibly enhance your recreational pursuits?heaven forbid that someone take the initiative to protect you from yourself.supported."
4/21/2009,"to quote my best friend...""you can't fix stupid""you want ccp to remind you to change the passwords on your pos shields? your secure cans?you want ccp to hold your itty bitty little hand as you leave the station and fly off on some mission?please... grow a backbone people."
4/21/2009,"simple request here. in 0.0 you are often sharing regions and even in empire you often do not want to fly far for goods.therefore add a ""5 jump"" filter, along with the current system, station and region.additionally, add a filter on the main screen that will remove all orders from non-alliance/corp mates. even better, make it possible for players to only offer sell orders only to members of their corp/alliance. then you know that the special offers you give will not be used by a hostile."
4/21/2009,sounds good to me.
4/21/2009,"the x-jump filter makes some sense(you'd make it an option, not just 5), but i'd like to see the market interface fixed to the point where it isn't necessary instead. the idea to filter out non-alliance orders won't happen though - it'd be laggy, and the game mechanics don't like it."
4/21/2009,supporting my own thread.
4/21/2009,"wow, how the hell does ccp justify this one? are we going to have to have another speed nerf just so phoenixs and nags can hit something? lolthat is quite pathetic that any cap ship can speed tank another cap ship."
4/21/2009,"after the missile calculation change, all missiles ****ed up :&not much more to say... change it back... a stupid move to change it like they did in the first place.and why again should ab be a ""95% tank against missile"" ? not like they work anything like this on turrets.you already have mwd's which is against missiles as long range and ab which worked better against turret at close range, while turret have no problem hitting stuff at longer range missiles still have the same problem as if they where 1km from them, actually bigger problems since they can move faster at long range..anyway long in short, change the missile calculation back to be signature as main calculation and tweak it"
4/21/2009,"i believe this new scanning system as a whole has caused nothing but trouble. sure the old system had it's flaws, but this new one creates more problems than it solves. it's very slow, more complicated, much more difficult to manage, and is generally an eyesore.this must be one of those ideas ccp thought was good on paper, however on implementation... i'm all for a new scanning system, albeit a scanning system that's efficient and practical. one that works."
4/21/2009,use a pair of flyfishing sunglasses like i do.problem solved.
4/21/2009,i don't really like that idea - it would harm the genuine traders and the clever scammers.
4/21/2009,i have to agree that it is getting out of hand.
4/21/2009,"it should just round up 199,999,999 a 10% up or down it rounds out the number and reports it like.. (almost 200 million)round up to the nearest even million unit.149,999,999 is ""almost 150 million""pretty easy even if they go, 149,000,999, it's still (almost 150 million)supported for rounding up to nearest million and reporting it."
4/21/2009,"i've already explained this - it's not a benefit for a cap booster-fueled setup under neuting. getting it all in one shot, with a cycle time comparable to your injector's, is actually far preferable to spreading it out, since it means you get to use more of your cap and have less of it get sucked away. this seems far more common than the number of fights where a minuscule injection of hp will save team active tank to fight another day. i expect your change would actually be a net detriment for active-tanked pvp fits. i've said it twice now - i don't know what you were talking about. i replied as best i could to a thoroughly unclear statement. phrase your commentary - the bottom two paragraphs of post #44 - more clearly, and then maybe we can have a useful discussion. (edit: post-scrub, make that post #31)"
4/21/2009,cleaned.please stay on-topic and post with respect towards fellow players.
4/21/2009,no support. in addition to all the reasons previously mentioned if you had your way you'd be killing one of the advantages of shield boosters/transporters (hp at the beginning of the cycle).
4/21/2009,i lawl at this threahdi have gank mega dual rep hyp and dual rep domi and a shield hyp at ready i fly the dual rep hyp most then shield hyp then the mega then domi (only for rr gangs with domi) the reps of the active tanks are fineif this has been made because of the malstrom then look at the maelstrom's bonuses and think of remapping them since it gets a large percentage of boosting from the 1 bonusbut to say the least a maelstrom is easly beat if u no how to beat it
4/21/2009,"where the f*ck do you get the idea that im complaining about small ships?, do you understand the differance between pointing out a benifit the change i suggest gives over extenders and plates (like you and others asked me to do) and complaining about summat?.and where do you get the ""benifits without penalties"" comment from?, reps use loads of cap and have huge fitting costs compared to plates as well as needing to run for many cycles (well over a minute with a lar vs a single 1600 rtp) to give the same amount of hp.how many more freaking penalties could you possably fit on a bloody module?.just fyi the lar has more penalties because its actually functioning to repair the ships armor right there so it needs alot of power to use yet plates or just like a add on you get a sheet of metal and apply it to your ship so it doesnt use cap or to much pg or cpu becaue its basicly adding more armor not repairing big holes in you armor on the spotits like saying body armor or nano bots?(nano bots not beeing expensive and are buyable :p )the nano bots take a while to work but wen they do u feel brillant but body armor u feel heavy slow but loads of protection"
4/21/2009,"i already said that the second option took the 400 cap as it does now but instead of repping at the end of the cycle it does it over the cycle, so you get the 800hp over the 11 seconds instead of at the end.there is nothing wrong with my comentary or my points, i do suggest you use less provocative and juvinille terms in your replies and stear clear of making accusations about ""whining"" ect and other childish and inflamatory/trolly remarks when somebody is explaining the pro's and cons of each system."
4/21/2009,"i think everybody knows how reppers/boosters work and how plates work bud, but the fact remains that the fitting and cap costs for them is absurd when you compare it to the benifits they give in comparison to plates.lets be honest the only ppl who use active tanks all the time are carebear mission runners and ratters, active tanks do have a small application in pvp but only in a very limited sense because of the drawbacks vs benifit situation they have compared to plated fits.what is it with this forum that everybody thinks a poster has a alternative reason for their idea?, is that why others post here or just how those who are accusing me of it do things?."
4/21/2009,"the ore is not the problem; it's mineral prices. mex, iso, nocx, zyd are supposed to make low sec ores more valuable but their prices are in the toilet due to rat and drone loot providing far too much of them. these sources need eliminated and/or rebalanced to bring the price of these minerals back up and restore low sec ore to being more valuable.increasing the size of asteroids would be nice too though, so you don't waste so much time switching targets. as it stands, an additional few percent yield bonus is useless since mining out a rock in 2.1 cycles is no better than 2.6 cycles."
4/21/2009,"this is very probably the easiest solution of all.it would be a lot easier if the minerals from rats and loot ""due to inefficiencies"" would be reduced by 50% to 75%. it would nearly instantly spark a hike in mineral prices. today the missioner who salvages the ships they destroyed during the mission makes about as much in minerals as a miner. way to undercut an entire profession. at the same time the miner in a hulk is sitting in a 100 million isk ship with a giant bull's-eye painted on the back. the only alternative is to go to nul sec with covetors, with vastly reduced mining ability as a result. it takes longer to mine the ore, which increases the miner's exposure to risk in a ship that is even less equipped to defend itself against nul sec threats. how's that for game balance?miners sorely need a space frame that is better suited to handle the risks of nul sec as well as a real advantage compared to alternative mineral sources. or, if ccp is not inclined to do this, it has to get rid of the mining profession altogether instead of keeping up the pretense.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"
4/21/2009,"long-term, yeah, that's the solution. mining should be the primary source of minerals, not missioning. thing is, if you try to do that right now, you'll mess up everything. there aren't enough miners to support the mineral needs of the economy, and trying to make them would spark massive price increases. hence, i want to see mining boosts, like this proposal, added before we even think of nerfing mission mineral income."
4/21/2009,this.people keep screaming about drone drops and mission drops when the problem is elsewhere.it's only a symptom of the problem.my suggestion is to start with the nerfing of macro miners (make all asteroid belts scanned/random and thus requiring a human brain to actually find good ore to mine)... then kick up the value of the rock to make mission mineral hunting not so profitable.the rest should fall into line.
4/21/2009,"the security status mechanic has many good aspects, but one thing it does that is less desirable is to make it difficult for people to establish and hold a presence in low-security space without ultimately finding themselves barred from highsec. this is not a problem for -10 pirates, but there are many other groups who could use lowsec to a far greater extent than they presently do if this problem were reduced. as such, i'd like to propose an extension of the concept of occupancy of lowsec space, as it is currently used in factional warfare, to allow corporations to gain occupancy of non-fw lowsec systems and thereby reduce their sec status penalties for defending their space, as well as possibly also gaining other benefits. i know that the instantaneous reaction to this will either be ""pirates are just going to get free ganks!"" or ""big alliances are going to take over everything!"", but i believe that those problems can be addressed effectively while leaving the core of the idea intact, and making this a serious option for smaller corporations. here is one example of how this could be implemented. i do not claim that it is perfectly balanced, and it will certainly need significant review by ccp before it is implemented, but i believe that it should address most of the obvious concerns effectively. every lowsec system not used for factional warfare will gain a control bunker. this will not be attackable, but will instead be a control point. every hour, the corporation with the most ship-minutes spent in the space around the bunker will gain one point. at each downtime, whichever corporation meeting the standings requirement has gained the most points in the last week will gain occupancy of the system. the standings requirements are the same as for anchoring a pos: 1.0 of corp standing to the faction holding sovereignty for every 0.1 of system sec, so to take a minmatar 0.3 system you need 3.0 corp standing towards the minmatar republic. occupancy would offer the following benefits: - a -25% fuel use for poses in the system, the same as sovereignty 1 provides. - any of your players may shoot a -0.1 sec player as if they were -10.0, without gaining a gcc or losing sec status. - if any player gains a gcc in the system, your corp will gain kill rights on that player. this works best if one of the transferable kill right systems proposed is implemented, but it could be done even without such a system. if a corporation in an alliance gains occupancy, the entire alliance gains the first two of the above benefits. however, the corporation must hold the system in its own right. as well, i would like to see some kind of cap on how many systems a single corporation can gain occupancy of, preferably a skill-based cap, though a hard cap could also work. flavourfully, the empires are busy with factional warfare, and are looking to pass off security duties in unimportant systems to trustworthy corporations. this is why unprovoked attacks on +sec players are still disallowed and why standings requirements are in place. however, it would in practice function much more as a set of options for corporations to defend their space more aggressively than is currently allowed, i expect. alliances will take some systems, of course, but most major alliance corporations do not have enough standing to take anything, and the above bonuses will not likely convince them to try on a large scale. i acknowledge that this is likely to be a controversial proposal, and that there may well be aspects of it that i have overlooked. the detailed proposal is intended as an example, not as the only way it can be done. however, i think that this idea, properly implemented, will revitalize lowsec and give new options to many corps who would otherwise stay in highsec, and that it is worth bringing forward to ccp."
4/21/2009,i like where your going.but there's still the nagging issue of the ever popular pirates that love to prey on most players in low sec.until there is a balanced solution to that problem.. most will not likely go there.if there was a way to bring forth a police enforcement incentive much like a 0.0 alliance would provide in there own territorial areas that coordinates with the empire navy or concord... it would be quite fun and a challenge.surely the pirates grow tired of one ended fights and camping.we need some all out fights.fights that pirates are forced to fight... not the ones they pick.
4/21/2009,"lowsec piracy will never change, and lowsec will never be as popular as highsec. those are basically unchangeable aspects of eve, and they're not even bad ones at that. lowsec isn't bad because it's dangerous. it's bad because it's dangerous with too little corresponding benefit to bring out the people who are willing to accept danger in search of profit - and yes, they do exist. this is why i keep proposing changes to lowsec. i'm not under some delusion that it will ever be half as popular as highsec, because it won't be. the number of players interested in it simply isn't as high. i just want it to be an environment that more people find to be worth dabbling in, maybe even moving residency to. it may never be as popular, but it can and should be made better and more popular."
4/21/2009,"i agree with herschel in this case (i know, shocking right?) -- the reason i don't really want to move to low sec is that it's not very attractive to me, from a purely profit vs loss standpoint. in high sec i can make substantial amounts of money with very little risk (yes risk does exist, as our recent loss of a ship during a war dec proves), but it is far less than what you encounter is low-sec, and this is the core reason why low sec is so unattractive. null-sec really doesn't figure into the arguement, imo, since that's a completely different beast.i like the idea behind the op, so i will offer tentative support, though i think there's a lot of implementation that needs to be hashed out (as herschel mentions in the op himself)."
4/21/2009,yep... i'd have to agree with that... i'm just a bit hesitant as very few ideas in low sec are even possible let alone doable... herschel is far better than most tho.
4/21/2009,"you mean like a local defence force/gang made up of players. if you want to occupy your own space then you should be able to fight for it yourself.interesting ideas but they need some work tbh. the op clearly has no clue about lowsec agro mechanics etc etc, but some form of 'occupancy' by lowsec dwelling corps giving certain benefits might entice more people to lowsec."
4/21/2009,<.< gutsy for a whelp like you to say that about hersch.
4/21/2009,"the only assumptions i made in writing my proposal that i can imagine you're objecting to are that gate guns will fire on anyone at a low enough sec whether they've aggressed recently or not, and that shooting someone who is at a low enough sec status(i believe -5.0) will not lower you further. are either of these assumptions wrong? did i make an erroneous assumption somewhere else? i haven't played around with all the various sec status interactions, having never been a serious lowsec pirate, so it's possible i made a mistake somewhere, but i'd like to get a better explanation of what it is. i don't think i botched anything that fundamental, but if i actually have ""no clue"", i'd definitely like some enlightenment.assuming trassier is trassler's alt, he's been playing a year longer than i have, and with more experience at lowsec pvp than me besides(given that he's -10.0 and i'm +4.2). if he has objections, i'd like to hear them."
4/21/2009,i've never seen you say anything without researching or knowing about that one thing specifically.for someone to say you don't know what your talking about is like saying the sky is not blue but green.well maybe not like that exactly and i'm not saying your infallible... but your rarely ever off key either.which is why i stalk your posts...
4/21/2009,"and i appreciate the vote of confidence. if it'd been someone less knowledgeable, i wouldn't have said anything. i don't know lark especially well, but judging by the reaction to his candidacy thread, his opinion is one i ought to pay attention to, and he's certainly no ""whelp"". i don't think i made any glaring errors, but if he says i did, i'm going to double-check it for sure."
4/21/2009,a whelp like me? and just who are you?
4/21/2009,"i am indeed, my main just recently joined the 90 day club.sentries will never agress a player for simply having a low ss, they require you to have a gcc or be flagged somehow to the owning corp in the case of stations or the empire in the case of gate guns. i may have been a little harsh with my initial statement.i like the idea of tying this into standings but i can't see it working out too well tbqh, perhaps in lieu of this either some sort of cash bribe should be offered (isk sink) or once the bunker is taken a specific task is set which requires multiple people to carry out."
4/21/2009,<--- read the name.; o )and i tend to defend hersch from the disrespectful people.but since you where kind enough to withdraw... so shall i.
4/21/2009,"seriously? damn. could have sworn i heard about sentries auto-aggressing for low sec status. oh well, that was easily the least important of the bonuses anyways, doesn't matter too much if it's removed. i'll go edit the op. as for the standings thing, that was part roleplay and part a way of dealing with the ""oh god, the goons will conquer everything!"" concerns people have whenever you mention anything about buffing lowsec in a way that doesn't expressly forbid alliances from participating(like fw). personally, i've never really understood why people thought the big alliances would bother with lowsec space - yeah, that vanadium moon is really going to bring down the ravenous hordes - but it's sensible on its own merits too. even if players are gaining occupancy, they're not sovereign, and the owners won't let you have it if they don't like you. as for the details of conquest, i went through a few different ideas. i sort of liked the one about tying it into the wardec system - declaring a war with the stated objective of taking one particular system - but concerns about multiple aggressors, swapping it off to alts, and limits on how many could be gained/lost per week scuttled it. the proposal above was the simplest that i thought would work effectively. you can certainly elaborate on it from there, but i wanted to give people an idea of how it could work in practice without it being overwhelming(since i have a tendency to write too bloody much as it is, i don't need complicated ideas to make it worse). i'm not sure if i like your idea - control being contestable at any point appeals to me, as does the natural way it spreads out the contest to prevent alarm-clocking and other tz issues. all that said, the proposal i want to go forward here is the concept, not the specific implementation i outlined. ccp can pretty it up later, but it's the general proposal i'm concerned with here."
4/21/2009,good ideas. maybe it'll make it farther this time around. it'll certainly be an improvement.
4/21/2009,i like the new pos graphics when it's nice and calm around the bubble... but i guess it would be difficult to see anything when it's under attack. the option to switch between graphics would be great if that could be implemented.edit: didn't see it was voted down... oh well

4/21/2009,"with ccp getting around to confirming our acceptance in the race for csm today i would like to officially announce that i am now on the ballot so to speak. so this post is not entirely devoid of content to mull over i would like to present to you, the voting public, my thoughts on transferable killrights. something that i think should be implemented as soon as possible as i believe it is in line with what ccp and the players vision on eve is. transferable killrightsintroductiona single shard. for some people it is merely a piece of marketing spin by ccp to sell eve as a unique experience. for the majority of us though the idea of a single shard universe to play in, when combined with characters that don't get maxed out in a matter of weeks or even months, means that for our actions there are potential consequences to our every action and our every word. killrights are such a consequence. right now in eve kill rights are something that are, on the whole, ignored by many. but what if those killrights could be sold or given to another player? what if that noob in a badger you kill today could 'spawn' a 90m sp pvp specialist gunning for you tomorrow? in a universe where frankly everything is for sale including concord turning a blind eye to the deaths of millions of crew members for a paltry bribe should the bounty hunter not have a role? the answer, i believe, is transferable kill rights. mechanicsthere has been much discussion over the years about how this could be achieved and the answer, i think, is a reasonably simple one. instead of kill rights being some esoteric entry on part of our character sheet we never use they should become a real commodity. when you are killed in a way that would normally give you a kill right you are given, the next time you appear in a station a small 0.1m3 item that you plug in much like an implant. this allows you the same 'rights' as the current kill right mechanic. if you are a one week old new player with no way of using the kill right what use is it? well then you can trade them on the contracts system. as with any commodity you can set your own terms. maybe some people will sell them to gain a bit of isk and hope the other person kills the person named. maybe to try an ensure the 'kill' you offer an new form of isk on completion contract which, when the kill right is used up transfers isk to the person using it. all of this will, of course, require some programming on ccps side and there certain are ways the mechanic can be abused. it wouldn't be impossible to contact the person you have kill rights on and terminate them with their consent to claim the isk and split it with them for instance. i believe, however, that the market will adjust for this, i believe that people will be willing for pay a little bit of isk to gain access to a kill right in this way. i think the hunt and the kill will be enough of a reward to a certain type of player who wants to do some solo pvp on the side. now before all the pirates start complaining that this is a 'nerf' to their existence just think for a second what it could mean. if you have access to high sec and you have bought a kill right on someone that happens to be flying past in a freighter headed for jita loaded down with some tasty items it's yours for the taking. if you are in low sec and you want to grab that person who's been bugging you recently and the only thing you can use to tackle him quick enough is an inty you can buy a kill right and no longer be blown away by the gateguns. there will be things that i haven't thought of that result from this post and i'd be glad if they could be pointed out so i can modify it before putting it in the ideas section. let me know what you guys think.if you have any questions about this or anything else you know how to get hold of me."
4/21/2009,"get serious.let's say, for argument's sake, you get elected with such a slogan and then what ... if you insist i am sure erik can make such a proposal to them, so what.i would imagine that as a dedicated player with 5 accounts you have some understanding of the way ccp thinks? i mean what part of the word ""balance"" is hard to understand? you all seem to blame, erik and ankhe for their pacifists soft approach, but refuse to see that it is ccp that ultimately dictates the terms and they will not accept proposals coming out from an attitude which you demonstrate. if you would get chosen as a csm, your impressive killboard will not be of relevance as long as you refuse to acknowledge that fact. erik in his responses may luck the detail some of you insist about, however that is because he understands that an effective csm, in ccp's terms, is first and foremost a person with an open and flexible attitude, and not one that desperately clings to his ideas and only cares for his own play style. if our attitudes here are so outlandish and unpopular for you, why don't you stop wasting your time, and focus on supporting larkonis. dispite being a ""blood thirsty pirat"", he seems to have respect for other play styles, balance and understands honest effort when he sees it."
4/21/2009,"p0wned! asking to move lvl 4s to lowsec only is the wrong direction. what we need is to move level 5 agents into highsec, so that the majority of eve players (according to one of the quens over 80% of eve inhabitants live in highsec) have a real pve challenge, and not only weak rats that are eaten by a faction fitted cnr like french fries by a fat kid."
4/21/2009,"if you want a challenge go and pew pew sentient players or go and find some sleepers. do you honestly think people would do level 4's if the income from them was nerfed and the difficulty ramped up? the first one or two times you run a mission it may be 'difficult' but only because you don't know how to run it, after that they're all pretty simple (even the level 5's).at the moment ccp shouldn't be encouraging more people back into high sec (and they have stated several times that level 4's in high sec were a mistake) but gentley nudging them back out into low/nullsec."
4/21/2009,in response to the sickening take care platform shaping up might i suggest a similar platform for the miscreants and malcontents around here? you could even call it....take everything
4/21/2009,"cool beans, but then i'd require a 2 term csm member to adopt me and use me as a mouthpiece to push his/her agendas through."
4/21/2009,can a csm be an effective leader/representive of the people if that person is banned from the forums?
4/21/2009,"that might be good qualities if you are a sergeant in the army, but certainly not when you are supposed to represent people besides your self and deal with people that are the same level as you. well, at least i hope you aim at doing more than simply try to force through your own self orientated agenda, because i see very little point why others should support you in that and vote for you.i see you have listed some ""problems"" but i do not see you listing any well considered solutions. except ""beat it with a hammer until it works"" solutions of course. does overall game balance mean nothing to you? do you even recognize potential bad side effects of your proposed changes?"
4/21/2009,and my bow!
4/21/2009,and my axe!
4/21/2009,"i represent what my ""kind of players"" feel is fair and balanced in eve.if one has to please the masses, one ends up with nothing being done! because wether you are capable of seeing it or not, eve is divided in two major parts (probably more parts, but lets say two for simplicity), the hardcore and the softcore. pleasing them both will just end up with the csm being all about talks and not about doing; i am here to do things.it is not a ""self oriented agenda"". none of the changes purposed will have much if any effect on me. it is changes that i and many others feel are necassary for a well balanced and fun game experience.my solutions are better than no solutions at all and i do not see you posting anything constructive except for your personal dislike. if you feel you can do better, what is stopping you?you can not just post ""have you considered the negative of your solutions"" and leave it be. every solution has a negative side, be it mine, yours or any other.i see your post as a poor flame. you are trying to point errors by argumenting with _your_ feelings and not with facts. if anybody here is self-oriented, it is you!"
4/21/2009,"yes, i do. i make most of my personal isk doing the trading thing, with some occasional mining / missions / ratting. i also run several of our corp programs including reactions and capital construction.i am a gerneralist human, but in eve, that doesn't usually work out too well. i have several characters, one of which is a builder/inventor (t1, cap, t2), one of which is a miner (exhumers 5, ores at 5, etc), one of which is a generalist that i started the game off with and am putting into a carrier righ now, and one of which is pvp.for newer players, most people start off as generalists, but then realise the need for specialization fairly quick. the only effective way i have found for people to do this, particularly if they are new, is to have multiple accounts with multiple characters. so, game mechanic wise, i am specialist. several specialists actually. having a broad experiance base with the different specialists is what i am offering. do i have 70 mil skill points? no. can i fly a capital ship - yes. can i invent most t2 and build it if i want? yes. can i run multiple pos's, plan and move bulk goods in freighter/jump freighter, position and set up a drag bubble, strip out 3 belts of everything from ark to velt in a single day, plan an assault on a hostile corp/allaince, run a roaming gang, kill off a pos, scout out a new region - yes, and i have done all of them.obviously, some have more experiance in things than i do - some are leaders of thousand+ person alliances. some are super-cap pilots. some are low-sec pirates. i am not everything, nor do i claim so. i am probably more rounded than most people are, however, because it is what i enjoy. and i am fortunate, in that many of the skills i have picked up in eve are the exact issues that this csm term will be facing. ccp has said that they wish to look at sov mechanics this term, which hay - guess what - i have dealt with first hand. and, hey, guess also what, some of the means and methods thay are considering are the things i do have experience in. good things, for me and ccp, if i am elected."
4/21/2009,i'm astoundedthe most pressing issue on every pilots mind in militia is still the almost game breaking lag and desync.i've never seen any candidates in militia chat asking us what issues we would want brought to ccps attention.pure lol and waste of time....sorry you have no iodea about fw and our needs
4/21/2009,"i have to agree with dr grot there. the number 1 priority is the lag. i have been trying to monitor it with the intention of submitting bugreports, but the lag gets so bad, it breaks the logserver. fw did used to run pretty well at one stage, and big fleet fights were fairly common. now, they are uncommon (if not completely rare), and almost always involve at least half the fleet being desynched to the point where they are just lumps of metal floating in space, unable to defend themselves.this is not a problem with my settings or computer, as i can get involved in bigger fights in 0.0 with all the options turned on, and i get minimal lag (barely even noticeable). if a fleet goes above ten ships in fw, the whole game starts locking up.it is common, and everyone experiences it (although it seems to vary as to exactly when). if anyone on the csm had partaken in a fw fleet, they would have seen the lag. this isn't a small problem. it's an elephant in the room.everything mentioned in the post above is all fine and good, but it pales in comparison to this. nothing should be going ahead of this, not even the cloaking plex bug. this is the first and foremost problem and should be fixed ahead of anything else, as this is gamebreaking, whereas the others are just bugs."
4/21/2009,"i am not involved in fw but i ply a lot of my trade around black rise/tama/old man star... the lag is indeed pretty terrible with more than a few dozen ships on grid yet i've done the same in 0.0 with greater numbers by an order of magnitude and had no dramas whatsoever.before looking at the rewards of fw (about which i thought was never to give anyone anything particularly tangible, just to give people an excuse to get involved in medium-large scale pvp without shooting poses or messy alliance politics) ccp need to make it possible for people to access the rewards that are currently available. while i realise there are finite resources on the server and the nature of fw doesn't lend itself to fights over one system for days at a time i am pretty sure there are some resources that could be freed up and i'll be brutally lobbying for this to happen."
4/21/2009,"all it takes is an eve-search.... and thats what the plus (3 +) was for...being in a noob corp for that long is nothing to be proud of. persons who never leave empire invaribly push an empire-only agenda. answer me truthfully: do you believe that pvp should be mutual?vote istvaan shogaatsu, i hear he is building a fountian filled with blood and tears.edit: removed a little smack... :)"
4/21/2009,"oh right, i suppose you read my agenda and accomplishments then? did you notice the 0.0 improvements and factional warfare topics? have you even seen where i've been hanging out the past year? half the time you could find me in lowsec and 0.0! so, please use eve-search some more, silly troll. define mutual. pvp is by definition mutual otherwise it's pve eh, as you need two players involved to make something mutual. i think you mean consensual pvp here eh? and you can find all the answers of that in the campaign thread, no need to answer the same questions twice. of course you'd know my answer if you had actually used eve-search.i couldn't care less.next remove the rest of your senseless dribble as well please."
4/21/2009,agreed.
4/21/2009,"be real. if you can have dabbled in all parts of eve what should have prevented them for having doing the same?just because they end up with a different main occupation than yours there is suddenly something fundamentally wrong with their views on game balance?of course they can not represent all of the eve community as the individuals within the community have contradicting desires. but they can represent those that give them their vote, and if they are nice they can try to please some degree those who did not give them their vote too."
4/21/2009,"you're not going to see the really experienced 0.0 players in the csm. at best there will be some random alliance's middle-management buried there, but never any of the people that saw the upper stratas.eve's too much of a logistical nightmare in the endgame for people to survive the ccp audits. or care, for that matter.it's the classic ""unpaid politician"" problem. the bulk of the applicants are going to be inexperienced and biased players with nothing else going on in eve. there are a few shining exceptions, but not enough by far."
4/21/2009,"jade constantine, darius johnson, vuk lau, to name a few?so far the csm has been a diverse mix of people from all areas of the game, just like it should be.i don't understand the hate that some people here voice against particular playstyles. and no matter what assurance we give them, they'll just go ""you're lying! you're all stupid carebears! lalala!"", so what's the point of even arguing with them if it's just going in circles?"
4/21/2009,"this is the real misdirection: carebears, noobs, hidden agenda, conspiracy theories what else? like if you are not a lobbyist, by starting such a thread splat.i thought that the carebear term applied mainly to people who never leave highsec . larkonis wrote in his thread:""ref 'carebears'. in my mind a carebear is someone who out and out avoids confrontation, either in battle, in chat or on the market. i know plenty of mission runners and industrialists who are able to put up a decent fight if need be... these people are not carebears. in my time i've run across a lot of industrialists trying to get a foothold into lowsec. many of them were receptive and we traded protection for goods and services... these are not carebears""i am not against non consensual pvp, when attacked i engage in a fight and usually loose because outgunned. the only difference is that i don't find it fun to hunt and attack other players. i live in 0.0 and trade with pirate corps for protection if need be, i focus on mining my moon and role playing with missions etc. so am i a carebear now? make up your mind, and stop manipulating the carebear definition to fit anyone who doesn't agree with you aggressive play style. the truth is that many of you have industrial alts who don't do a lot of combat, just like me... so who is doing the misdirecting? i support take care because of their open mind set, which is the key to success when presenting ideas to ccp's. ambitious agenda and gang-ho attitude are secondary qualifications, if you want to be csm member. lack of pvp experience and a massive killboard score doesn't effect once ability to come up with creative solutions. ccp is clearly welcoming only balanced proposals. senior producer torfi frans olafsson in his presentation during the fanfest clearly states that pvp fighting will always remain the core, however that he himself plays a miner and some of his friends never even leave the station. he clearly states that the game will be developed in other areas as well. just look at ambulation project. if that is not hint enough, well you are simply wasteing your time..."
4/21/2009,i'll make time for any csm canidate who wants to give a 2 minute campaign speech at eve vegas. eve vegas websiteeve vegas facebook group
4/22/2009,well id like to solidly agree with you but lavista has responded twice i think but i will agree that we are due for more information now.
4/22/2009,"not one, but two csm candidates responding i'm glad this issue has your support guys, and as an alt of one of the less legally inhibited pod pilots i'm pleased to see our esteem c+p candidate here! as a fairly new pirate in a 2-man corp, i fly solo for a lot of the time, and i need a ship small and fast enough to avoid the camps and blobs, yet with the firepower to deal with any juicy targets i come across. with a little bit of a boost, assault frigates could be the perfect tool for players like myself who want to avoid the whos-got-the-bigger-blob style of pvp.hopefully this thread alongside the many mentions in the big thread of balance will get ccps attention and get this sorted"
4/22/2009,why be so surprised? it's a good idea. : o )
4/22/2009,veng is the tanking ship. if anything it should get bonus's to tank harder. retri is the killing machine. pair em up and fun fun fun :)
4/22/2009,"definite thumb up for this one, poor little friggis."
4/22/2009,"the problem is unless rockets are fixed, the vengeance does better damage using blasters or lasers, even with the rocket damage bonus. it really needs a double damage bonus to redeem it. i do agree with a tanking bonus for some ships though, personally i think the enyo would be a good candidate."
4/22/2009,"i love assault frigs, but i'm not sure that an added bonus is necessarily the way to go - i think it might be too blunt an instrument.take the vengence for instance - it's role isn't a dps ship - the whole reason for it being there as i see it is for you to sit there eating dps and holding point whilst your gang warps in to gank the poor fool you've got locked down - something that it does suprememly well. if you gave it a dps boost too, i'm not sure that's not overpowered.on the other side of the coin, i'd equally say that the retribution doesn't need an extra bonus, but i'd sell my dear old gran into slavery for an extra mid and 44tf of cpu.this thread needs to be more specific - after all wolfpacks of a few inties and af are nasty little blighters - even when your fleet is only the other side of the system. once we have concrete improvements that won't attract the nerf bat, then we'll have something to support."
4/22/2009,assault frigates need to be nerfed.
4/22/2009,cute.adding a support for more t2 bonuses like all the other t2 ships.not supporting meddling with the slot layouts.. i think the bonuses will do enough.
4/22/2009,i'm always leary of slot changes... other than the dreaded 1 mid slot amarr tech 2 ships.
4/22/2009,1 med slot amarr ships are fine. cross-train caldari if you're too stupid to figure out a good ship setup.
4/22/2009,troll. this thread is about t2 bonuses and the fact that the assault ships don't have enough.maybe you should try hooked on phonics if you're too stupid to read forums.
4/22/2009,"i find assault frigates to be fine. in fact i have innumerable kills in them, including the supposedly terrible retribution.you ought to stop sucking."
4/22/2009,"thats your opinion, and it's nice. (good for you)sucking has nothing to do with the proposal. it's not even a matter of opinion. it's a basic logical argument.premise 1 : t2 ships have 4 bonuses.premise 2 : assault ships are t2 ships.premise 3 : assault ships do not have 4 bonuses.conclusion : assault ships should either get 4 bonuses, or all other t2 ships should get nerfed.between those two options, i'll take the afs getting a bit of love. if you like assault ships, what possible reason could you have for not wanting them to be a bit better?"
4/22/2009,"they do have 4 bonuses. the fourth one is hidden, that's all.it used to be public but people kept whining about the apparently bad bonus. a lot of people are very bad at this game."
4/22/2009,1
4/22/2009,"to be honest, as efrim has said, all other t2 ships get a 4th bonus, its just ridiculous that afs don't. however, in regards to your point, about the vengeance, yes it performs well as a heavy tackler already, but a second damage bonus would hardly make it overpowered, given that its outdamaged by a kestrel. i'm not proposing damage bonuses for all of them, in fact its only the veng and the hawk that i personally think need it. but for every single one of them there are useful bonuses they could be given to bring them in line with all other t2 ships without making them uber.i did make another thread in features and suggestions that had some decent discussion in it:"
4/22/2009,this just shows that either you're trolling (badly) or don't actually fly afs as much as you like to think; the old bonus for resists was moved to being built into the hull (like all other t2 ships) but they never got a new 4th bonus (the one which all other t2 ships have).
4/22/2009,this is what i see every time he posts.i suggest everyone else does the same.
4/22/2009,qft!
4/22/2009,putting this back on page 1.
4/22/2009,"he posted on his own boards to get the thread recognition... this is not a morsus mihi issue, it's a game issue for those involved in 0.0. hence the reason that b/t the 3 main threads that this one entails, there is goon, aaa, bob, nc, and other support. all of 0.0 know how borked supercaps are. but since you're so naive with your reply, it can only lead me to.... vuk, i'm putting my app in for mm tomorrow if you'll have me sweetie."
4/22/2009,"the amount of idiocy here is so staggering i hardly know where to begin.a mothership can not take out 30 other ships. even a lone titan will loose to 30 bs if they are set up properly.umm, no? siege was always there and is the only way that dreads become at all useful. out of siege you are better off in a bs. the only time triage is used is for repping up pos guns. it isn't used anywhere else because the penalties ( can't be remote repped, can't move, loose fighters ) are too steep, not to mention burns stront.waaaaaaaahhhh! that's like crying that it isn't fair that 4 t1 frigs can't kill a maurauder. of course it's fair. ohh, and a dozen bs can easily take down a mothership if set up right."
4/22/2009,"remote repping on carriers is not any more overpowered than on any other ship. you have logistics ships for the same reason you still have dicters when we have hics. each has its own advantages and disadvantages. carriers might rep more, but they require more skills, are far more expensive, less manuverable, and can't use conventional stargates to get around, which prevents them from entering cyno jammed systems entirely."
4/22/2009,"no offense crest.... butyou obviously arent a capital ship pilot. if im in a battleship gang, more than usual i would rather have a team of logistics with me than a couple carriers. reasons:logistics are fasterthey lock quickercan follow the fleet through gatesthey can warp out or avoid if primaried alot quicker.generally logistics pilots know what they are doing, cant say the same for all carrier pilots running in a logistics role.carriers are great when supporting other capitals. assigning fighters, repping at a pos when friendies warp in. but other than that they are pretty useless against a well fc'd bs fleet. secondly a dread without siege is useless their tracking is ****ty, their locking time is horrible, their tanks are much worse than a carrier, the size of sig radius they have to hit as a target is sooo large. anyone that ever said bs's and smaller dont have a position in a fleet is purely and utterly wrong. supercaps without cap support are lost, and caps without support are lost. its easy to overwhelm a cap fleet with a well fc'd support and bs gang. they are all integral parts of an alliances over all fleet mechanic.what vuk is trying to do is make the highest end of the ships (by highest end i mean size, value) more useful to the general fleet mechanics of the game. this way he is hoping to see them more commonly in battle. because right now if your in a mom your an instant primary. if your in a titan your only job is warp in dd and get safe, thats it sounds exciting doesnt it. so dont bash someones ideas that are going to make the game better and give a class of ships that is not used to its full potential an actual position in the fleet.vuks got my support"

4/22/2009,for all the logistical reasons in the world this would be good
4/22/2009,looked into it... yup...supported.
4/22/2009,"raised in csm1 year ago and passed to ccp, should be implemented....anytime....in next 4 years."
4/22/2009,"my thumb, you have it."
4/22/2009,"spinning my ship in station and trying to imagine all the tiny people in it is what i do best in eve, so i will support this measure. in other news, the sky is blue but that is not my favorite color. let's change that too, it should be even easier than redrawing every single ship. next you'll have ccp putting out a little eve ships guide that tells you where the hell the bathroom on a tempest is and whether that little thing that connects the two sections of claws/stilettos is actually a hallway between the sections, or some sort of bizarre laundry chute."
4/22/2009,they have an internal planck bubble stabilizer that allows them to fold space in their interiors.
4/22/2009,definitely support
4/22/2009,"simply because the issue is raised does not mean that it does not still require attention. to be blunt, 3 years of neglect on ccp's part warrants whatever action the player base deems necessary in order to get the ship balanced properly.edit: lrn2sign"
4/22/2009,"convincing arguement yorda, even if you are a goon."
4/22/2009,yes naglfail needs attention. obvious.well no dmg mods on ur fits kinda suck tbh. i'd drop the 3 hardeners and get 1 more faction eanm and 2 dmg mods. 1 bcs and 1 i guess heatsink? pshaw?
4/22/2009,adding that i think this will be ignored by ccp as the same 'blight' of split weapons systems infects a number of ships that they would get pressure to revisit if they look at this with the seriousness it deserves. and i bet they don't want that.
4/22/2009,pretty hard to dispute that nags (and large/xl arty) need a buff now...
4/22/2009,"supporting this !not much else i can say really, just look at the evidence infront of you. nothing ccp say's can dispute the fact that the naglfar is the worst dread if not the worst cap ship out there.ccp, fix this please! :)"
4/22/2009,"minny ships are pretty terrible, this one, however, is the worst"
4/22/2009,supported. something so awesomely vertical shouldn't be so terribly bad. some sort of fix needed.
4/22/2009,supporting tis
4/22/2009,longer training time has yielded me being primaried because the ships base stats suck and thus warrant crap tanks.please fix.
4/22/2009,"nobody primaries a naglfar - this counts as balance in ccps book, right?"

4/22/2009,"i have a few issues with pos access regarding titles and roles, i think a coherent thread listing in detail every issue should be created. however for now i want to raise this issue in particular : a member, cannot change the type of a silo without the config starbase equipment (config manager) role. i have tested this thoroughly and have done what i can to allow my members to run reactions, but it is impossible without giving them complete access to every single array at every one of my towers. this is inclusive of offline/online and unanchor/anchor.this is a serious security flaw, and illustrates the fundamental issues currently involved with pos access roles.we're faced with a choice, either give a member the ability to take every single asset inside your force fields, or don't allow them to do anything but seek it's protection. this is unacceptable."
4/22/2009,"dear drake draconis. your right. hence i`m not trying that with you, since at least one of your advice options in awesome in itself. if your wondering right now - why the **** lil ecid is beeing that blunt with you - take a look at how all your previous responses are worded.now to get to the point. cause its annoying as **** if you dont get a response for your valid bug petition for a week or 2, cause ccp is to busy dealing with rmt and hacked accounts:the quote that most of you guys agreed on, is totally unrealistic. why would one, if forced to change the pwd, change em on all other websites they visit too, when you consider that they have not changed their pwd`s before, cause it simply was ""effort"". and to be honest its not the people that buy isk, or frequent hacking sides, or have a software like limewire or bittorrent running per se. that become victim of a cleared out account. its people that are careless with their information. either because they dont know any better, or cause they dont care.if you have been playing for a while now, you might remember the multiple news/devblogs one of ccp<U+FFFD>s customer support ""persons"" posted about how hacked accounts have been straining their customer support. and how buying isk can also make you become a victim of getting hacked. in all those cases they gave advise, like having anti virus software, not visiting ""shady sites"" or not buying isk. but the most important part, they did not advice. changing the pwd regulary.i can see how for some fellas changing the pwd mandatory every 6 month is a pain in teh arse. perhaps ccp should just display a big warning in size 72 letters saying after every 3 month "" your pwd has been used for 3 month now, time to change it. for more information on why to change it, please read < link to wiki here>"" until the players actually change the pwd and the timer resets.in any case, people that suggest that the user is the biggest problem, are right. people that suggest that you cant fix that problem. are that wrong that its not even funny anymore, and should, when suggesting that they work in ""security"" look for another field of expertise.@reminder for mazz: ""pictures""!"
4/22/2009,"also.: confirming i am chieldish too, while supporting this topic."
4/22/2009,"drake, you are awesome.first you call mazz stupid. then, expertly masking the irony, you tell her to grow up. but not satisfied with just a 'good' effort, you then crank it to 11 and deadpan an admonishment of her arrogance you, sir, are the best troll on the eve-o forums. never stopand speaking of trolling; mazz, if you promise to never stop tweaking pompous prigs like lavista vista, i'll vote for you early and often."
4/22/2009,i don't even need to promise its just going to happen because its the natural order of things. vista just fights like a ~tiger~ on the forums. it is hard to resist trolling someone that important.
4/22/2009,how the #### does forcing someone to change their damn password mount to a ####### hill of beans?what the hell is the advantage in that if at all?seriously... do you people even know what the hell a keylogger is? do you have any sense of intelligence about you when it comes to security?are you all just that damned stupid?hell... why stop there.... force everyone to not run windows! that should clear up about 80% of your trouble right there! don't even connect to the internet! you'll get hacked! this is utterly insane and hilarious all at once.guess i'll be expecting more business this year (i fix computers for a living).better tell the boss... the gamers are getting stupid and lazy.... they can't breath without the game developers changing there diapers!seriously.... this is going from stupid to hilariousness.is this a comedy stop? where's the next punchline? seriously!anyone see my tin foil hat? sheesh... must be running out of tin foil. not enough to go around in this thread!
4/22/2009,"mazz is proposing a change that will hopefully cut down on the number of people who get their accounts hacked due to them blindly using the same username/password for eve and an external forum/site. it doesn't effect me much either way as i don't, but i bet there's a whole ton of people out there who do.it won't help against keyloggers, but as mazz has already pointed out, these are by far and away the most pain for least gain method of stealing passwords compared to hacking a forum database, or starting a site designed to harvest usernames/passwords in the hope that one of them will be a vaild eve login.i support this plan."
4/22/2009,this won't happen because ccp is not staffed by a bunch of total idiots with a lack of forsight.guaranteed.you people are so bloody backwards on security its hilarious.you think by forcing people to change there passwords is so damn effective... its laughable.you assume the user isn't going to keep using the same password but only change a couple of characters... next thing you know you'll end up screaming to have us use microshaft 2k3 standard passwords which are utterly insane and not to mention wholly stupid... and sorry to say... eve online is not the end of the my world here... i happen to have a life unlike you tards.but i give up... it's like talking to school children... who love to speak on behalf of us so called idiots who have no common sense.it's disgusting.i'm out of here.
4/22/2009,this line has me in utter stitches. this is the best line ever. may i steal it?also being an antivirus2009 remover for a living doesn't mean you know everything about security for a large number of users. please dont leave my thread.
4/22/2009,i prefer to not waste my time with jackasses.
4/22/2009,i'm againtsi like short password it's easier to hack then and without that i would have an empty wallet
4/22/2009,tell me why password requirements offend you so much dear drake
4/22/2009,worst idea ever. if this is what we can expect from you on the csm you can count me and everyone else with an ounce of common sense in your opposition.jk
4/22/2009,"i'm not. the idea is stupid. also, alt-bumping + a juvenile sense of humor will not win you votes.passwords can not be re-used, and anyone who makes their password easy deserves to have their account hacked.not worth forcing on the rest of the playerbase. it's also not worth a top slot on the main page when more important game changes like lag fixes, ship balancing, ui tweaks, and fresh ideas are all getting shoved to page 2.thumbs down."
4/22/2009,supporting this. it needs to be on the front page so that people would read drake draconis' posts.
4/22/2009,i am captain internet of the aids. corporation and this idea is wholly relevant to my interests.
4/22/2009,and my axe
4/22/2009,"replying to this, to point out that out of the 26 current supports, about 17-18 of them are almost certainly alts and corp mates.this is pathetic."
4/22/2009,"i am not a corp mate nor am i alt, are you claiming that i am part of sniggerdly?this is further proof that you infidels are much too inferior to be taken seriously in very serious matters such as game and password balance. it is obvious that those who are actually competent (such as members of pandemic legion) must take the matter in their own hands."
4/22/2009,pandemic legion - finally an appropriate name for an alliance. you guys have the combined humor of a 5 year old.
4/22/2009,"well to be honest i ran out of alts on the first page. i dont know if those other chars are alts or not or whos they are exactly, but thanks to ccp's forum system they still count the same! you should enlighten us on the proper way to have a sense of humor. go on, tell a joke or something. i promise ill laugh~anyways so far the only real rebuttals ive seen so far are:-people who dont know about password security deserve to get hacked-me and everyone else is going to raise a huge fuss and petition everything if this goes through(because lost password forums are hard to fill out)-the op is dumb and wrong and i know because i work at geek squad.-we in the past csm already failed to solve the issue so dont bother wasting our time, havent you been paying attention mazz??!!-i like to hack peopleand alternatives offered:-warning popup on login instead of mandatory password change-minimum password security requirmeent instead of mandatory password changewas that all?"
4/22/2009,that about sums up this entire thread. plenty of people who know what they are talking about and run servers have told you that your proposed idea is pointless and/or stupid. you just ignore them for some reason.
4/22/2009,wait i run servers too
4/22/2009,well then i guess we have to go majority rule? lets see how many more supports you can scrounge up for this sinking ship.
4/22/2009,"you know, on the whole i am actually pretty glad that the only people who seem to be supporting me are people that would do so anyways, and just about everyone else has this sort of carefree/hostile attitude about this sort of thing, especially when they ""run servers"".which servers exactly do youall run and whats their addresses~"
4/22/2009,"i ""run servers"", therefore am immediately superior to anybody who doesn't and thus my opinion or vote counts for morehelloi am efrin black~in other :nesw: i wholly support this however i believe the prescribed notion of passwords only being accepted with a mandatory secure level should also be added into this proposaloh and ccp should also do hell-purges of passwords forcing you to change at irregular intervals as long as they have a working and user-friendly password recovery system ~ which automatically resets their password to a scrambled 12 character one (which they have the option to keep)another *final* thing, perhaps a function to allow one to save their password so they don't have to enter it each time (as long as this doesn't produce any security issues other than somebody actually *taking* your computer - which is pretty unavoidable itself anyway)ps: i love mazz and she has promised me nudes if i post here backing her up^^so this is what i am doing, y0x"
4/22/2009,this deserves to be back on page 1.
4/22/2009,this needs to be brought back!
4/22/2009,"are you entirely sure about this? your snippet seems to give off an aura of uncertainty. i believe this serves to prove that live events were an utter waste of time and resources. ccp should focus on real matters such as lag management and word limits, not waste time on roleplay."
4/22/2009,"basically, virtual worlds research has shown that live events are a goddamn incredible drain on resources, as ccp mentioned in one of the previous csm meetings when this was brought up. personally, i'd rather they fix the game than put people into this black hole of an idea.i know you all love to have fun and all, but if the company can't do it, they can't do it. and they've said they can't do it. writing an essay about this stuff won't change that. also...did you ever get a new wyvern?"
4/22/2009,"events are good to have. eve should have them. however, you are somewhat misguided in what you want to happen. you describe a team that puts together theatre. people do not play the game, in general, to watch other people play the game.take your example of the empress, and how people would be punished for trying to gank her. why? if you want real rp, real theatre, then it needs to be alive, living, breathing, and evolving. if the rp plays out as planned, cool. but you should want a team dedicated and creative enough to be able to adapt the rp to what actually happens instead of taking your hostile view that people are ruining it.if you have a creative rp team, then anything that occurs in the event is the event and should be adapted into the story.excessive punishment for actions that already have punishments associated with them means you just want to go to the movies and not actually take place in anything meaningful. if you want that lackluster rp, go read a book. books are fun and they stick to the story.if you want grande-scale rp in a game filled with people, then you should want it to be adaptive to whatever happens.so for instance, take you empress example. a better way to handle it, if it is so important that she is received unharmed, you use normal game mechanics. you protect her with an armada of concord-equivalent vangaurd. this has two effects: it'll possibly stop alteration to the script by people that you think are just trying to ruin the fun, but it also provides an epic alteration to the script that the team can play off of if somebody manages to topple the armada and kill her."
4/22/2009,"we already have that. i set mine to 0 jumps often, because i only want to buy stuff in jita no. that's no good, and it would cause tons of lag too.have you heard about contracts?"
4/22/2009,all good points. contracts system is bleh but does work. if they overhauled the contracts system it would be ok.
4/22/2009,op just scored major respect points in my book.: o ) stick around mate... we need more folk like you in assembly hall.
4/22/2009,supporting
4/22/2009,"got my support, it's a cheap exploitation of the current contract system."
4/22/2009,as being directed to this thread from my post. i support this idea. primarily for implementing a buffer to keep scammers from posting at ridiculous speeds in local chat. all for scamming.not for spamming.
4/22/2009,"/supported.the contracts will reach a point where they will become worthless. honest traders in particular will be at a loss. imagine a noob looking at the contracts fore the first time? i wouldn't look a second, that's for sure. the contract system will die if something is not implemented to control the spam and scams.if you want to scam...go for it.but eve doesn't necessarily have to make it easy for you."
4/22/2009,"opposedalthough i don't really entertain myself with scamming people or haven't been scammed yet like this, its a fair tactic, and if you can't be arsed to properly read the letters on your screen then you deserve everything you get.people tend to glance at things, hope ccp makes it into easely understood pieces of info and press the buy button. just for once, actually read properly what it say's on a contract and 99% of all these scams become useless"
4/22/2009,"after reading 10-20 contracts, yes you tend to glance at things.""9999999999"" is not easily understood without having to count the digits.memo: ""10,000 trit cheap""contract: ""trit x 1""...is conflicting information.so why bother with contracts at all then?"
4/22/2009,"you're confused as to the motive of this change. i want to see this removed to help get a spam free local in jita and other trade hubs (for community and legit advertisers sake). i think that tackling the scam head on would solve this, as every spam-scam i've seen in jita has been this scam."
4/22/2009,"really? i don't look at jita local much, but i seem to recall a fair number of ""navy issue"" ravens and ""100 million"" tritanium being spammed as well, not to mention the old 10-for-1 scam. besides, just because this is the one they're spamming now doesn't mean that they'll stop if it's changed, they'll just move to the next best. if i thought it'd deal with jita spam i might be inclined to support it, but it won't."
4/22/2009,sov holding alliances should be immune to wardecs.wardecs are about a conflict between 2 groups. you require no wardecs in 0.0. thusly any sov holding entity has at least 1 asset in space in the sov system. thusly for example anyone with a grief about say goonswarm or solarfleet. you have to first goto 0.0 destroy all their assets removing sov. then you may wardec them.
4/22/2009,yes... let's prevent high sec strikes of cargo and transport for alliances like goonswarm.top that off with the fact that wardecs are usually a waste of time when its against a 0.0 alliance who hardly comes to high sec in the first place.please.... try to put some thought into your idea before you post.and giving a alliance war-dec immunity is a serious balance breaking mechanic.don't like it? then join an npc corp.
4/22/2009,"wow, that breaks the whole point of war-decks. as if super-alliances didn't have enough power as it is.no. --isaac"
4/22/2009,you are wrong.i support this idea.
4/22/2009,"this doesn't make sense from either a gameplay or a roleplay point of view. in gameplay terms, wardecs on big alliances are how you attack their logistics, which is a valuable purpose and not one that should be eliminated. in roleplay terms, concord doesn't give a damn about 0.0 space - a wardec has no effect outside empire, and concord doesn't care how sovereign you are out in delve or perrigen falls. there's no reason i can see why anyone would want to do this."
4/22/2009,terrible idea - makes no sense - not supported
4/22/2009,the entire point of wardec'ing an alliance is to attack their highsec assets...
4/22/2009,"no, because some of those sov holding people are in high sec and a war dec lets those people get shot in high sec without concord getting its nose all bent out of shape."
4/22/2009,"no, for all of the reasons already outlined. if you want to attack an alliance, you need to be able to attack all of it's assets and members, not just those out in nullsec."
4/22/2009,why should empire dwellers be able to attack 0.0 empires? it doesn't even make sense!
4/22/2009,the same reason why corps should be allowed to war-dec each other.because they can and they will.
4/22/2009,"makes perfect sense.get your 0.0 alliance out of high-sec. or get your 0.0 alliance to protect your high-sec assets (if you still have them) *shocker*.imo, logistics aren't defended very well in-game enough. this would only encourage less protection.--isaac"
4/22/2009,"this mechanic makes perfect sense. you know, as long as members of the sov-holding alliance are not allowed to enter high sec or low sec."
4/22/2009,intriguingbut then that would compound the alt wacko issue something fierce.so no... but intriguing idea none the less.
4/22/2009,"i think i speak for everyone when i say that the most important and vital change ccp must do to eve is to fix the absolutely shocking insult that is made to fenris, the nordic mythical wolf of awesomeness.fenris is the name of a giant wolf, son of the god loki, who during ragnarok (nordic apocalypse for the heathens ignorant in nordic myths) kills odin and lives on a diet of gods' hands. fenris' sons eat the sun and the moon during said ragnarok."
4/22/2009,"i would suggest sleipnir, not naglfar. but the general consensus is yeah. fenrir shouldnt be a freighter."
4/22/2009,"a freighter is large at least, take some solace in that. could have been worse <rookie ship>.on a similar topic, what's up with the name ""vargur"" (the minmatar marauder)? can't find any info on that name~"
4/22/2009,"from what i recall after asking around back when they got introduced is that vargur means ""outlaw"" in icelandic."
4/22/2009,"cheers for the reply, i'll stop de-railing this thread now/"
4/22/2009,your initial premise is severely flawed.
4/22/2009,and your sense of humour is severly broken.
4/22/2009,"a vargur is a wolf, often reserved for a man-eating wolf...though the name has been used for men with connotations to wolves, i.e. murderous criminals."
4/22/2009,i stopped reading when i saw that.nothing turns me off more when someone starts a proposal like that.course if you do start the proposal... it better be bloody true.sorry to say.... while the names are pretty much as the op stated... i wholly think this is a waste of time./me leans on his fenriri happen to like my freighter just fine thank you very much.i'm not completely against it... but i think there are far more important things to worry about.
4/22/2009,"no support, ccp has bigger issues to worry about then ""epic names on wrong ships"". i see no reason to change them. and if we do start changing names, there are ""tons"" of ""epic names"" that are on the wrong ships. but you don't see me crying about it. oh and btw, don't try and speak for everyone.--isaac"
4/22/2009,"four years ago, i'd probably have agreed with you. today, not worth the confusion."
4/22/2009,am i agreeing with a goonswarm member?
4/22/2009,supported. the option to turn them off was there so surely that's the lag inducing issue out the way. i miss my epic trails.
4/22/2009,yes yes yes!we want our trails back!!!
4/22/2009,no support
4/22/2009,"ok im gonna be real with u guys, i dont know what the right way to fix this problem is, but there are some great ideas in this thread. the bob guy seems to be right about there being too much medium-value ores, and the guy with the pirate/illegal mining crystals idea was awsome too. the fact is we should all be supporting this thread because the more support it gets the sooner ccp will atleast try to fix it.just the 2 cents worth of a highsec hulk pilot tbh..."
4/22/2009,more miners in lowsec
4/22/2009,"why not nerf loot drops instead? i'm pretty sure i read somewhere that 40% of ore in eve was from reprocessed loot. i'm no expert on the subject of what items from what part of space reprocess into what ores...is it true that these rarer ""lowsec"" ores are easily found in your average reprocessed items? change the loot tables or change the reprocessing equations and poof! all of a sudden that ore sitting out there in lowsec is worth a hell of a lot more."
4/22/2009,"i have trouble believing that.course i don't bang out level 4's until my ears bleed either.but by the time you grab the loot...and reprocess it... you pretty much make the same amount of isk as you would doing a good solid few hours of mining in a hulk.just mining 2 to 4 hours a night for 4 to 5 days straight i still make 80 to 100 million isk easily.mission running in the same amount of time is dependent on the missions which is not entirely predictable... not to mention that the loot may or may not be reprocessable.this is all tied into the market prices... and tritanium is still the most pricey of the lot.drone drops do produce more... but only if you get a pile of drone kills.also keep in mind you do not get bounty for killing drones... so how do you compensate for that i ask you.i'm not asking the ""nerf pve"" jackasses.i'm asking the rational people who balance both worlds without being stupidly prejudiced and blind."
4/22/2009,"highsec has the best trit, pyer, mex, and iso ores, lowsec has the best nocx, and 0.0 has the best zyd and mega ores. the problem is that most of lowsec's value comes from nocx, which is worth bugger all right now. oddly, this doesn't seem to be the fault of missions - nocx is one of the least mission-supplied minerals in the game(only zyd is lower - see"
4/22/2009,"verified and confirmed... i see more of the high sec popular ores than the little ""rare"" guys..."
4/22/2009,"totally agree. im one of those people that would take the risk, but not if it means making less money then i would be in highsec (which is the current situation). btw the op is well thought out and has good ideas./signed"
4/22/2009,"not supported, this idea could easily be exploited to a high degree. for example, any of the large alliances with a moon mining operation pulling r64 mats would put tons of cloaked, cov-ops alts in the system. that way whenever a pos bashing crew comes, the alliance with the pos and alts in the system has a definitive advantage, both in defence and in running the pos.this would encourage meta-gaming to the extreme."
4/22/2009,"maybe i'm crazy, but if i had a major alliance i would have far better things to do with my pilots than park gobs of them in covops to watch one system. one sucker on sentry duty, maybe, but ""tons""? and if you're suggesting that the covops pilots would be collecting points for system control, i assumed it went without saying that cloaked ships don't count. barring that, i really fail to understand how this proposal would change the status quo you describe in any way. okay, so your dysprosium moon netting 20 mil an hour can spend 50k less in fuel costs, sure. some people like their 0.25%, i suppose. but if you actually read the proposal, i think you'll find that you're worrying about nothing."
4/22/2009,linkagei think that would be a better way of managing lowsec tbh
4/22/2009,paranoid much?some how i seriously doubt any self respecting alliance would do that.maybe not on a grand scale.... but still... that's a bit far fetched at best.
4/22/2009,"i support the general idea, while the mechanic you suggest has at least one very exploitable hole and one big drawback:- drawback: ""the corporation with the most ship-minutes spent in the space around the bunker will gain one point"". if this is meant literally the corporation would have pilots doing nothing beside orbiting the bunker to get the standing. and this get us to the - exploitable hole: alts, especially people with alts in shuttles (or noob frigates) orbiting the bunker at 100, 200 km or whatever is the maximum range where the bunker register the presence to get to control the system. those alts will have a clear slate (no negative sec standing) and so firing on them would damage the standing of the people trying to get control.if the bunker register all the people in system (or even better all the people outside a station, pos shields, not cloaked, not in shuttles, i.e. all the people that are at least potentially doing something related to using the system and not only the facilities there) it would be lesser exploitable, even if alts in safespots could still be a problem. even with the limits any idea leading to a more used low sec has merits, so supported."
4/22/2009,"no drake, you are not enough paranoid.to better protect a good moon in low sec any alliance would go to great length."
4/22/2009,"no, i'm not paranoid at all. any alliance would go to that length to protect a moon that produces 15-20b isk per month in materials. you would see metagame alt-corps spring up just so alliances would have parking spaces for alts to sit in the system cloaked. a mechanic such as what was proposed is far to easily exploitable."
4/22/2009,"i've always sort of expected that shuttles, pods, and noob ships wouldn't count - nothing below a t1 frigate, so that you at least lose a token amount when you get shot. the standings concern is a reasonable one, though i expect you could fix it by saying that all pvp around the bunker is legit - if you go there, it's for a fight, and so you don't need the protection of sec status penalties for your opponents. it's a bit clumsy, but something in that vein should work. the systemwide option is one i considered, but i don't like it - too easy to safe up and make it a fight of pure numbers, instead of numbers and skill like it ought to be. if you want the system, you should have to risk a fight, not just sit warping between safes. yeah, good moons are worth a fantastically large amount of money, and alliances will want to protect them. nobody denies that. the question i have is how this system will change that. you don't protect dysprosium moons with fuel use reductions or kill rights, you protect them with the ability to drop fifty dreadnoughts on anyone who comes to take it. and you hardly need alt corps or occupancy to put a cloaked scout into the system - you just get someone in a covops. you don't need any sort of special status for that to work, you just do it."
4/22/2009,this.as i said... i don't deny the defense... but exaggeration to such a degree is laughable.if someone is in local your likely to locate them... if there's a problem... you call in the fire support.end of story as far as i am concerned.
4/22/2009,"you've got my vote, this is something i've felt we've needed since i started playing....the lack of logs in corp hangars is a serious issue."
4/22/2009,"supporting this, would be very helpful to see where things have gone and find corp thieves quickly"
4/22/2009,"sure - supported. it could probably even be an extra feature a corp could have the option to pay for or not - x amount more isk per month for a ""managed"" corp hanger that keeps audit logs or just the basic rent for a basic hanger."
4/22/2009,actually a better way is to push that log info to the api datastream.app's like eve hq could log the activity for you.but that's just a minor suggestion.
4/22/2009,"i would like to ask the csm to get ccp to fix this issue immediately.recently had experience of flying a battleship with 215 scan res (1 sensor booster) and you can't lock a battlecruiser before it warps, not just at a gate, but in a belt or mission.that is just plain wrong.it's killing pvp, fix it please."
4/22/2009,"fit a second sb, get a buddy to fit a rsb, or get a smaller ship to tackle with. i'm sure it's annoying, but there are obvious workarounds - i wouldn't say pvp is killed just because a mixed gang outperforms a solo bs."
4/22/2009,umm...lol?battleships have crap res scan. fit another sb or get a tackler. --isaac
4/22/2009,"no matter what you would have posted after this, it would have been dead in the water."
4/22/2009,"i didn't see anything i was trying to find an answer to. is there a topic on a separate bay for just strictly ammo, scripts etc.was wondering?? it is an idea i had but not sure if it has been suggested and i couldn't find any other place to put this question up!!kryllster"
4/22/2009,"a separate cargo for ammo and other charges? no, i don't think that idea has been proposed before. why would you want that?"
4/22/2009,"actually... it has.but not often.a separate cargo bay for ammo would allow for ease of sorting when your doing multitasking like grabbing cargo or salvage/killing.that or your keeping your ammo sorted out when you carry multiple grades.is it a major need? no.... and not likely to be implemented as its a ""minor"" annoyance."
4/22/2009,"i think there is a relative concensus that bigger minmatar ships are underperforming.the root cause imho is that versatility is the racial idea behind minmatars, which is nice but the implementation of said versatility has been lacking.just giving us split bonuses and/or mixed turret/missile points and calling it a day doesn't work. you end up with a ship that can do everything but also sucks at everything (naglfar, i'm looking at you evil or very mad).now we can either ditch the concept and go to a more traditional focused role for minmatar ships or we can go a bit creative.i say we keep the minmatar ships as is, keep the split weapons, keep the ambiguous tanking abilities, keep the split bonuses, keep the ****ty cap, keep the ****ty hp,...but, give minmatars more slots.up to now ccp has always given the same amount of slots to all ships in their classes (16 for dreads for example) and i think ccp should think about ditching that rule for some minmatar classes.if you'd give the naglfar more slots, it could really become versatile, depending on fits, becoming good at one thing but still not overpowering.same for the tempest, give it more slots than other bs to compensate for it's anemic tank, anemic dps and anemic range (but you couldn't compensate for them all).obviously, the bigger the ship the more the slots advantage it would have.this would mean that minmatar still need insane training and it would also make minmatar ship more expensive to fit than other races, but at least you could be truly versatile without falling into the jack of all trades, master of none. a truly focused fit could become very lethal in that one narrow focus, yet you still couldn't compensate for all the inherent weaknesses of our ship design. obviously this would involve a good dose of rebalancing but i think eve could do with more wildcards and that's minmatar's creed.just food for thought."
4/22/2009,sounds reasonable.
4/22/2009,not supported because for some reason i get the impression you don't know what your talking about... being a minmatar pilot i always have plenty of cap.... but then arties and auto's dont use cap.the only exception to that however is the loving there capital ships need.i think your going about this the wrong way.you keep forgetting... minmatar are people who fall down stairs in a wheel chair with duct tape and bailing wire while holding an uzie.... and do so gracefully while surviving the whole ordeal.: o )and why do people keep saying add slots as a quick fix?
4/22/2009,the new stealth bomber is interesting but they are something will be not correct for me.i don't understand why to use torpedo for each race on this ship.why the bonus will be not on the main weapon of each race.exemple :caldari -> torpedoamarr -> large pulsegallente -> large blasterminmatar -> large autocannon( the bonus will be not the same on each weapon type sure).for the bomb keep the same then now.(already sorry for my english)
4/22/2009,"because it's a bomber.and missiles aren't the ""main weapon"" of caldari.there's even more things wrong. you would give the 3 races instant alpha, and again, missiles with crap- no.it's ment to fire large, slow high damage weapons against large targets. it's not a mobile weapon platform.no, just no."
4/22/2009,"hum yes i agree it's bomber.for me bomber it's to launch bomb.the torpedo is not a bomb it's a missile. i say ""you keep the bomb and bonus on this ship"".lol ""the main weapon of the caldari is not missile"" if it's a joke nice yes the caldari can use also hybrid turret. but you know a lot of caldari who use only them ...and sorry about large weapon, they are no problem if you ajust the damage bonus of each type of weapon.why this modification. because i don't understand why the gallente or amarr must to learn torpedo to use the 100% of this ship. if i make one ship for all race with laser. i am sure than caldari and gallente and minmatar will be not very happy.alt of helkia"
4/22/2009,no.the torp is not a missile... its a torpedo.... as it's name... suggests.and after seeing it action... i must say.. i like what i saw.it's just fine the way it is now.

4/22/2009,"hello, i couldn't be bothered to train any useful skills which allow me to actually make my own isk. does anyone mind if i come into your mission and salvage all your wrecks? i know it's a pretty big part of your income as a mission runner but i really don't care.ninjas should copy-paste this in local and see what kind of response they get. maybe some runners don't salvage but most do.and before any ninjas respond by saying ""scanning/salvage skills take time to train up"", compare that with the amount of time it takes to get lvl 4 mission running skills up."
4/22/2009,"tell that to the 3 month old raven pilots doing lvl 4 misions with ease...it's all about risk/reward in my opinion. you want to sit in high sec, untouchable by other players, and rake in the isk hand over fist, there should be some risk. in this case the risk is that ""some"" of your profit is at risk from a ninja salvager."

4/22/2009,"yeah, definatly, after seeing that ak-47, my vote is for mazz.seriously tho, this is my first post. i told myself i would never post. made it about 8 months. but mazz is hot, with the ak and all...."
4/22/2009,would this not mean you could be scrambled for hours if the attacking party does not kill your ship ? this would be an extremely bad change from a game perspective as this would create a situation where the game you pay for becomes impossible to play without a means of escape.
4/22/2009,"a couple questions if you don't mind.1. you mentioned pos warfare. i agree that it sucks, i've been playing eve for 1.5 years and it feels like i've spent more time in a pos, shooting a pos, repairing a pos than anything else (like most i'd prefer to shoot people rather than towers). one dev proposal was to remove sovereignty from pos's, what are your ideas?2. i think that it's time to increase the amount of claimable 0.0 space, well past time to do so, since the game population has increased so drastically in the last couple years. i also think that there needs to be a serious look at existing 0.0 space, and the fact that certain regions through also have npc stations and agents in them which have broken truesec levels and thus are much, much richer than others. i'd like to see truesec fixed in regions like delve so that it functions like other regions and the addition of npc stations and agents to other existing regions, what do you think of that and what are your ideas?"
4/22/2009,here are my vote for you!
4/22/2009,"got my vote, mainly from vista's and ankh's 'do more than we had to' butt-hurt."
4/22/2009,"logging out worksit would be hard to keep track of who lives where and it would make useless the sov2,3,4 mechanics ccp already put a ton of work into. pos warfare would end up centering only around dyspro towers and the like and i dont know how station ownership would be handledi like npc 0.0 regions. it gives small corps with no friends an opportunity to live in 0.0 without obligations and makes it harder for large alliances to completely own such rich space, when enemies can just base out of npc stations. some regions ought to be better then others, so people who already have 0.0 space have something more to go for. and the richness of npc regions is always offset by the fact that its a lot more active with enemies. vast tracts of owned 0.0 sov space might not be as rich but people wont bother you so much.i see my ""likes to watch people get provoked into internet anger"" base is well pandered to"

4/22/2009,"boost rewards. simple as, there are many ways to go about this and i've covered several of them in various other posts.lowsec at the moment serves no real purpose other than to act as a buffer zone between highsec and 0.0 and really needs something to bring people to it apart from pvp for the sake of it (fw), which only affects part of lowsec anyway and of course i would like more worthwhile targets to shoot and who actually have something to fight for.yeah i do, although i am sans tache atm. if i'm elected i'll regrow it for any potentially lulzy photo ops."

4/22/2009,shouldn't this be stickied?
4/22/2009,i can only ask (and i did). we are at the mercy of the moderators.
4/22/2009,"ccp is well aware of the lag and has some people assigned to fixing it already, with them wrapping up the issue soon(tm).however, it seems that they are still busy with apocrypha and the issues that expansion spawned. now i can go in there and yell at them that they suck and should fix it, but what would that accomplish? the csm is for bringing matters to ccps attention, but they are already more than aware of this problem.also it's easy to complain that i didn't do x, but i have been in militia chat for months asking what people want, and my mailbox is open 24/7. i've got hundreds of mails from people, but none from you.now, as for addressing your particular concern here and actually doing something productive instead of whining, i'll ask about the lag in the last csm-ccp meet this term.and larkonis can make all kinds of quick and easy election promises here, but i think it's clear to see which is the more committed and knowledgeable party here."
4/22/2009,"unfortunately dear i don't run the csm wiki nor do i have the benefit of having sat on the council for the past year so do not have at my fingertips details of every issue raised in every meeting. and yes, i don't think anyone can fault your commitment, as for your knowledge of the issues, have you ever been involved in a large scale battle in an fw zone, or any other area for that matter? do you know what it's like to fight in laggy conditions? ever been unable to lock a single thing on grid or desynched so bad you explode on the other side of the system to the battle? until you have and you understand the frustrations faced by these players then please don't bring my knowledge of the subject into question and my commitment to resolve it."
4/22/2009,"hello larkonis, i'm not questioning your awareness of lag in general, i was referring to fw lag specifically and the things ccp has been undertaking to fix it. i think we can all agree that combat lag in general is bad and frustrating, fw lag or otherwise. i've experienced my share of it and lost a few ships and pods (nothing big, but still annoying) to it because they went unresponsive."
4/22/2009,"tbh the the extent of lag as you describe it is a myth, and i've been in quite a lot fw fleetbattles, from day 1. there were major lag issues when we had 80-150man fleets in first months, but in the last months i didn't notice huge lag myself, occasional desyncs, which were fixed by a quick relog, but the majority of the fights was playable. that's because i play on low resolution when entering fleets, no sound, no effects no brackets and always scrolled out. this way i have a little weapon ******ation at best, when others scream they can't play because of lag. so i think fw lag is mostly because of wrong overview settings of inexperienced fw pilots, not serverside - or a cheap excuse for having lost a fleetfight (always easier to blame ccp instead of admitting one's own fleetfight incompetence). buy a good graphic card and learn how to adjust your comp for fleetfights, and lag won't be a ""pressing issue"" for you anymore, young padawan."
4/22/2009,"intents and purposesok, that said, the issue of local has many potential solutions. some have stronger benefits than others, and as always, you cannot please everybody.the simplest method is to treat local as an in game resource instead of a player resource. for instance, the help channel is a player resource. it has zero to do with the actual game of eve (beyond eve being the topic). it would be just as effective and useless outside of eve as it is in.local on the other hand has no relevance outside of eve because local is a representation for something in game (a system).so you treat local as a system resource instead of trying to approach it from some chat moderated function.in this case:if you speak in local, you are in the local list.if you arrive in local via a normal gate, you are in the local list.if you get on grid to a station, you are in the local list.if you come into system via cyno, you are in the local list.but, this information can go stale - that is, your name turns grey, indicating normal eve mechanics have not seen you do something (not the same as going afk):if you stop talking in local, after x amount of time, you go grey.if you stay away from gates and stations, after x amount of time, you go grey.after a stale period - that is, eve mechanics have not seen you do something for even longer:keep not talking, after x amount of time, you get removed from local list.keep staying away from stations and gates, you get removed from local list.cloak, you get removed from local list.now, the idea here is two fold if you can't guess by this short lists.1) people in a system, from a role play type perspective, receive local information from the eve entities, such as gates, etc.2) from an in game, role play type perspective, other people in local can only know about you if you have done something to demonstrate you are in that system to the eve entities.so the roleplay mechanic of local is this:""hello gate that i entered through, i have just come through you. you obviously know about me since i just traveled through you, and thus you will tell other people i am here. you are broadcasting this system wide as a questionably useful service!""""hello gate that i am going to exit through. i am going to leave through you. you obviously know that i am leaving since i am traveling through you, and thus you will broadcast this sytem wide!""""uh oh, i am a sneaky bastord. i came in to this sytem covertly. i have not spoken, touched a gate or a station. nobody knows i am here!""""uh oh, i am also a sneaky bastard. i came in through a gate, but i am leaving through a covert cyno! everybody will still think i am in local, but really i have jumped out!""so, to sum: if an eve controlled entity knows about you, it will tell everybody else about you. but, that information becomes old if that person is doing nothing to get noticed. that information might even be flat out wrong if that person stays clear of those things which announce their presence.this is essentially an extension of what the first post is about, but boils it down into game-related reasons. there is no reason players should not have this information, but there are plenty of reasons why the information might be out of date (from an ingame, rp type reason), and no reason that a person cannot work around it (cloak and covert cynos)."

4/23/2009,"yeah, the current mechanics allows for time and material research slots to be rented out and people can install jobs from the stations but to rent out invention slots people would have to have actual access to the pos as the fruits of your endeavor are deposited into the lab at the corp. this would be of use to people who would like to rent out invention slots. if they changed the mechanic so that you could manage everything including the final product from the station remotely this wouldn't be as necessary. but otherwise i support something like this."
4/23/2009,seems good. a hp boost could do some nice things for them. anti capitals and ddd with different effects also seem like good ideas
4/23/2009,"the difference between a carrier and any other rr platform is about 500k eft, 1800 more repair per 5 sec cycle, 76 eccm strength, and 40km more range than a bs group. carriers also have considerable offensive power projection, compared to none for logistics. yes there's a problem with that when out of triage.when a carrier group exceeds 10, especially in a cyno jammed system, baring a vastly larger enemy fleet or a capital hot drop(not in jammed systems), you might as well not even take the fight. yes there are lemming groups that can manage to fail, most won't. it's got nothing to do with abilities of carriers, it has to do with the power of their remote rep platforms. carriers are offensive projectors and hubs for resupplying ships. they are not logistics. they only reason they were ever given repair abilites was because pos repairing was even more dull than pos shooting, so it despirately need to be reduced in time.carriers were originally put in game with 30-50k hps in tank platform with bonuses in gang. they're now 170 to 200k hp in tank and vastly more proliferated in numbers. i'd rather have motherships retain the ability to repair out of triage while carriers are unable than to keep the current structure. it would add another level of uniqueness to moms while removing the joke that is carriers atm. carrier swarming just kills conventional combat and forces capital warfare even more. by fun factor, conventional fleet warfare is far superior to capital warfare any day."

4/23/2009,good ideas
4/23/2009,"as a nyx pilot, i wholehartedly agree with this statement, which is why i'm uneasy about the proposed changes and leave my own below. (i'll be sticking to the mothership side of these changes for my analysis)necessary changes in priority to moms:1) boost survivability2) boost usefullness to fleet3) improve maintenance/corp hanger space, add fuel bay1) survivabilityi agree that moms need a huge boost to hp and armor repping ability (as do titans)- they are way too easy to kill, which is a major reason why they arn't wanted in fleets.2) usefullness to fleetthey're primary role is, as stated, a combination of offensive firepower against support fleets and being used as a forword resupply platform for ships/ammo/fuel/etc. i fully disagree that mom primary roles should be gi-normous ""hospital"" ships (aka capital logistics ships w/ fighters). the ""bubble heal"" is a nice idea, but that's more suited to a ship who's primary role is a hospital ship. i don't think that rr should be allowed to be used outside of triage mode, but triage mode needs to work like seige mode and boost defenses if it's to see any use outside of repping pos'. on the other hand, i do like the pos effect mentioned earlier, that allows the mom to put up a pos bubble and protect the fleet, that idea has some major potential if implemented properly.i like the projected ecm effect, but it's effect is simply not enough. it needs to be boosted. clone vat bays need to be changed so that the mom isn't a sitting duck when it's activated. i think clone vats help fulfill that ""forword resupply platform"" role, but they're currently worthless in their current state. 3) maintenance bay, corp hanger, fuel bayi think that like blackops, all capital ships should have a seperate fuel bay, so that corporate hangers and cargo isn't filled by the necessary fuel requirements. this aids in the motherships role because that means more room for ammo and modules to help the fleet refit.moms also need huge boosts to their maintenance bays to resupply a bs fleet that just lost all it's ships. moms should be able to carry 20 bs'."
4/23/2009,"not sure where you want it but,[issue] corp and alliance tool overhaul"
4/23/2009,"absolutely would support this. stop the game being caldari mission runners online.would also like to see better options for accepting and refusing missions. no 4 hour rule and get a menu of missions offered so that you can choose a quick or long mission depending on your playing time. oh and can we have missions against factions clearly marked? or better removed as the faction hits make so much of this game problematic. if it was an rvr game fine, but its not so very soon a player can find themselves in a lot of trouble faction wise."
4/23/2009,"people are using small 20km tractor beam on bs ratting, doing missions or exploration where wrecks are usualy even around 100k from you. this is just wrong, ccp have from years in their database bigger tractor beams for non capital ships but they just doesnt want to 'turn on' them in the game:- medium tractor beam 40km base range with 1000m/s speed- large tractor beam 80km base range with 2000m/s speed"

4/23/2009,"not supported, at least not yet.while i agree online role playing games in general could do with something of an incentive for role-playing, eve needs time spent on balancing the damn thing and working out bugs before i could support something like this tbh.*looks at yorda's beam-naglfar post*.....*sob*"
4/23/2009,"there's still player-run events that can be memorable, like for instance the xetic inauguration ceremony in yulai. that made me feel like i was playing a massively multiplayer game for the first time seeing the sky full of ships, each with someone inside, much unlike quake lan parties with just a few dozen.i must guess that the quafe ultra rollout probably didn't take all that much man power away from development, since it was all rather gung-ho, but that was a mistake as seen by the abuse of the system when there was not enough accountability.for now i'd be happy if just a bit more man power went into fun stuff like christmas or anniversary gifts, or even in-game occasions. even the interbus shuttle was just a a really quick hack and far inferior to the apotheosis.currently all man power seems to be focused on getting the next expansion out according to schedule, with no time left for a little fun on the side. i'll say this works nicely for expansions, but i'd hope with all the folks now in employ there could maybe a bit time left for fun distractions."
4/23/2009,pretty much this. all the missiles are screwed since the nano nerf. the formula changes were a disaster and need new rethinking
4/23/2009,bump. this is totally ridiculous ccp. i was shooting a carrier with my phoenix today and doing less damage than if i wouldve just got a raven out instead.the idea that a carrier can speed tank a citadel torp blows my mind. you need to fix this immediately. in the short term a boost to explosion velocity would probably do the trick for the citadels. please unfork my ship and torps that i trained a long time and spent a lot of my friends isk on.thanks.
4/23/2009,"pheonix does the weakest dps of all dreads and even these dps are screwed massivly by the missile nerf. in fact, even a bs like megathron is a better dps dealer against caps unless the cap is webbed by 4-5 ppl. so what is the meaning of the phoenix then? suggestion:all kinds of capital weapons has two different types of ranges(in case of the moros rails/blasters --->phoenix doesn<U+FFFD>t, just the long range oneso why dont introduce a capital missile launcher for short range, but with better dps/ explo velocity? maybe something like capital assault missile launchers..."
4/23/2009,"india99, the problem is ccps stupid missile damage formula, not that we need to introduce yet another capital missile to train and equip. they simply need to fix the formula so you cant speed tank citadels with simply by moving your ship.its utterly ridiculous and whoever allowed this to go through at ccp failed to do their job. i cant imagine it would be hard to fix this, and until they do fix it my 2 billion isk ship is severely gimped."
4/23/2009,"two things1. this needs to be looked at. citadels need to be able to hit other capitals. i don't approve of them alpha-striking bs (that's bull****), but something should be done so that they can hit a flying city (titan, mom). super caps cannot be webbed, so something needs to be done to make sure they are hittable. other dreads/carriers shouldn't be able to shrug off half the dps at a mere 20/ms. 2. i don't think all the people who say ""phoenix dps is the lowest of all the dreads"" have ever shot a pos. every pos shoot i am at, the phoenix walks away with the highest damage done. why? you can choose your damage type. that's a huge advantage and don't pretend it's not. tl;drthe dps numbers on a phoenix are fine, the citadel torps need to be able to hit other caps for much higher % of damage when the target is moving."
4/23/2009,"maybe, but its a fact that the phoenix does the lowest dps (pure numbers) of all dreads in addition to the explo velocity speed main issue. that means even with the a better missile calc. the phoenix is the weakest dread at all.sure, u can choose the damage type, but if we talk about dps, the only dps u can deal in compareable numbers is kinetic.so why dont give the phoenix a short range anti-ship weapon like every other ship has since ever?"

4/23/2009,"the problem is not in the scam itself , i'm totally fine with scamming, but the problem that every single person in jita is trying it. there are like 20 people or so trying to do it and all but 1-2 never get any contracts through. it's more an annoyance as they all scam every 1-2 seconds (most of them are under my block list fortunately) but they keep popping up everyday because they think this time that player who blocked me suffered such a iq decrease by drinking so much alcohol that he will fall for it this time around.to the scammers i request of them to be more original and don't just follow the fotm scam.to op sure why not this ""new"" scam has had so many followers that it inst funny any more and i see no harm of putting the number in exact words."
4/23/2009,"as my fellow capsuleers are aware, the transportation of rigged ships in quantities is very limited. in low sec we have the carrier the move battleships and smaller around. however in high sec we have the orca which can only move cruisers and smaller around in any substantial quantities. this is puzzling considering the cost of rigs. especially since they're most likely to be used on t2 cruisers, battlecruisers, battleships and the various t2 versions.as it stands currently rigging ships burdens the owner with a time consuming logistical undertaking to the point of unfeasibility if he or she decides to move his or her base of operation. this flies in direct opposition with one of the basic premises of new eden. the freedom of capsuleers to setup and move their business wherever they see fit.in the past proposals have already been put forward to deal with this issue by imperator jora'h and myself. but to this day ccp's standpoint on this issue is still unknown. therefore i urge the council to place the issue of rigged ship transportation on the agenda again. the capsuleers of new eden are eager to know ccp's view on this matter."
4/23/2009,yeah.... i have to say that the inability to pack a ship with rigs is just flat stupid.it's been raised several times as well.i don't mind transporting mods and equipment and ammo separately... but what's the point of buying rigs if your going to lose the damn things just because your packing your ship somewhere else.
4/23/2009,"my preferred solution to this, like i said in jora'h's thread, is to allow unpackaged ships into cargo holds, at their full unpackaged size. it lets freighters move the bigger stuff far more easily than at present, without it being too easy."
4/23/2009,"fine as is. battleships aren't supposed to be easy to move around. if you want to move bs around, then go to lowsec or don't rig/insure them."
4/23/2009,"stacking solutionokey i have noticed that stacking is a huge problem in eve and it have been proven misused time after time.here is the problem, the problem is not that modules stack but that they calculate on a % on %.this means that it calculates on the active amount on a ship.lets say a 10% increase to the ships 100. this is a increase of 10.which means a 110. well if this module was based on the base instead of the active this wouldnt be a problem because no matter the amount of modules it would still only add an extra 10.which means you would need 10 modules to increase the 100 by 100%, thereby double it.but because it is calculated on the active the next module will add 10% of the 110=11 and thereby bring it up to 121 which is only an extra 1, no bigge. but then the next add an extra 12,1 instead of 10, = 133,1 and then the next an extra 13,31 which already means that the module now adds an extra 33% of its original addings, and this is only after the third (3) module. so it would take:10+11+12,1+13,31+14,62+16,03+17,703+19,763+21,45+23,5so by the 10 module it is suddenly not 10% it is 23,5% which is over the double of the original module and actually is a 235% increase in the modules +.yer sure there is a stacking penalty but this still doesnt stop the fact that there are a lot of different ways to increase and they doesnt have that penalty, which means this is still what is happening.and this is why we see so many problems with nano ships, double mwd(back then), heatsink (full low rack before stacking nerf), crystal set(capital cant even use them because of it), etc etc.so what can we do, well this is the simplest and most obvious way.let every procent (%) be calculated on the base of the ship/module/dmg (maybe after own skills or before depending on what the intention from ccp was).this would make a module give a set amount of increase depending on the ship and your skills not depending on the ships other modules.this would solve the problem and you should then remove all the stacking penalties you have made (which by the way was a utterly wasted of time because the method you tried was and are clearly wrong/extremely time taking and not very productive)any comments?!i would really love!! to know why ccp decided to have the active number being the source of the % increase, since it seems quite weird (overpowering and exploitable) to do so..their solution have been stacking penalty, making a cookie cutter world, where you know that 3 modules touching the same thing is usable, 4 is a bit over the top and 5 is useless.i would like to have the ability to put 8 modules on if i so choice too, so i can design my ship the most after my needs, instead of having to do around the same as every one else, and still so it would not be overpowered compared to the amount of slots used for it (which it would now without the penalty, but the penalty does that it is useless to put more then 4 modules on)"
4/23/2009,"maybe they did it because every other game known to man does it that way, maybe they did it because that's how percentages are defined, or maybe they did it because that's easier to look at the info on. maybe they just did it so that 5 cap rechargers don't give you infinite capacitor. to be honest, i'm not really sure. i am fairly sure, however, that bringing up a bunch of fixed mechanics, two of which date to the early days of the game and one of which most people didn't want to see changed, isn't going to prove your case for why this mechanic should be changed."
4/23/2009,"please read-- then test-- then calculate-- then write..clearly you haven't done these.5 recharges wouldn't give you infinity cap, it would just let your cap recharge at dobbel speed, already now you get much more then that:fleet temp base max skills=19,2 /// 3 recharge t2=37,4 // 4=46,8 // 58,5 // +3 ccc =95,2 cap per sec.soo that's a 495,8% increase... while without this % on %, it would be 145% increase instead (and thereby would every module actually be as effective as it is written and wouldn't become overpowered/underpowered depending on the amount of different things that adds up.. those last ccc adds around 85% instead of the 15% cap recharge as is said.)"
4/23/2009,"actually, if you were to look at the module, you'd see that it provides -20% cap recharge time. five of those, under your funny version of math, is -100%, which is zero recharge time, which is infinite cap. actually, with energy systems operations, you'd only need four. there are similar problems with other modules(2 damps preventing all targeting, 5 sprs giving infinite hp, etc), but that's the first that came to mind."
4/23/2009,"yer okey i see why you think it in that way.but i am talking about how much effect the individuel module will give in the total.and just like resist, which will be taking from the constant base.but yes, you are right, in things that decrease you will need to let the decrease be a constant, but it should be like with resist, if you have 50% resist and get a extra 50%, you will get a 50% of the 50%=75% aktive resist. in the same manner will the recharges give first 20% of 100% then 20% of 80% etc.."
4/23/2009,"so your suggestion is - change the way it works for positive percentages and leave it the way it is for negative percentages?seriously, do you normally eat stupid flakes for breakfast?ok, let's use some real numbers.the catalyst has a capacitor recharge rate of 312.50 seconds (unskilled) and two medium slots (bear with me).under the current method of calculating the recharge rate, if i put a cap recharger ii in both slots i get a final recharge time of (312.50 * .80 * .80) 200 seconds. (ok, wow. i never actually did the math before).using your ""new"" method of computing these, that number would be (312.50 - (2*(312.50*.20))) 187.50 - 12.5 seconds better. that's not an insignificant bonus, especially for active tankers.now consider the worst case. let us just suppose we have a ship with 5 mid slots - for example, the hyperion. it has a base capacitor recharge time of 1500 seconds.repeating the above calculations, for a full mid rack of cr ii's, we have:current: (1500 * .80 * .80 * .80 * .80 * .80) = 491.52 secondsnew: (1500 - (5*(1500*.20))) = 0 seconds.so your new suggested calculations mean that you could have ships with effectively infinite capacitor - which means you can kiss the nos goodbye as it's now useless.worse, in fact, you could potentially give a ship infinite shields using only four t1 non-faction fittings. so we'll have ships who can rep forever and ships with shields you can't take down.i'm thinking no."
4/23/2009,i fixed your post. no charge.
4/23/2009,"epic troll? or epic fail?either way, my answer is no!"
4/23/2009,"epic troll, and he'll admit it if you ask him. jason's actually reasonable half the time, half the time he comes up with absurd **** to amuse himself. the one i'm still confused by is crest - i sort of assumed he was epic of the fail variety, he's got that air of well-intentioned idiocy about him, but this percentages thread is making me second-guess my assumption."
4/23/2009,"no.this would be insane and stupid.although i think wardec's price should be calculated on the amount of players in the corp compared to the amount of players in your corp, the difference in these two would be what determined the amount of isk the wardec will cost"
4/23/2009,i can place buy orders using the sensors embedded in my teeth.

4/23/2009,i support at least 10km long engine trails with mwd!
4/23/2009,i support.
4/23/2009,"this is certainly complicated, but i still believe that nerfing t1 loot would go a long ways towards making mining profitable again. by the way draco, here's a link for you:"
4/23/2009,"ok, you got one big problem...if you nerf loot reprocessing you will cut about 50% of the tritanium supply which would let it skyrocket even further making lowsec even more unprofitable.noxc isn't supplied by mission as much and that is down. trit is suupplied alot by missions and it is up....think a few seconds and tell me what will happen if you remove all the trit supply from missions...."
4/23/2009,this is why i'm against nerfing loot drops.you folk who are oh so worried keep forgetting to look at the big picture.take off the rose colored glasses and take a good long look before you start yelling your mantra.
4/23/2009,should be a rule against spamming the local with scam orders..it's insanely annoying when the local is totally overspammed with clear scam contracts... :/ i rather have isk seller spammers then this... it's around as annoying and inconstructiveand i will bet you that half of these are macro's spamming the chat :/
4/23/2009,"noyou cant just have a rule against scam contracts, since scamming in game is totally legal. if anything the only solution akin to what you want would be to remove the ability to link all contracts in local."
4/23/2009,"well so is talking in the chat, but still there is rules about what you can say in the chat.there should be a rule against annoying stuff like this. it is seriously annoying and it is no doubt pressing the servers quite alot when there is a constant ton of spamming in the chat which have to be send to x00 people in the system..and no removing something usefull because some people decides to be *******s and idiots and do stuff that just clear irritates every one but them..you should look at the overall and say ""hmm okey we got this which irritates every body and stress the note, so one person can have a bit of more ""fun/bla"", this should be reverted so every one could have a bit more ""fun/bla"" and one person would have to be irritated and the note would be less stressed"""
4/23/2009,there's this handy little tool.. you take your mouse and you right click the name of said scammer and you say block.see? that wasn't so hard now was it?
4/23/2009,"1. it is just chat. the amount of data is trivial.1.1 if you'd forbid it just to save bandwidth, you should shut down all the npc corp channels as well. they usually tend to be even less informative than scamspam.2. there is a block feature. use it.3. return that ""crest of intelligence +2"" to your trader. he either scammed you, or it is cursed."
4/23/2009,"you can pause a skill queue, but you cant resume it without re-doing the skill queue.simple answer, add a resume button onto the skill queue window."
4/23/2009,click 'apply'.
4/23/2009,"this - however, i would like to see them have the 'apply' button text change to 'resume' if your skill training is paused.it took me like a week to figure out that clicking apply would restart my training."
4/23/2009,"i've seen the original thread months late and was wondering if this has gone anywhere? apoligies if this is a cross post or a re-hash of something years old.i was surprised to see no suggestion of optional 2 factor authentication?i have been in the unfortunate position where a game account was hacked (not eve) and it took weeks to get the problem resolved. meantime i discovered eve so it wasn't all bad!2 factor authentication will have some deployment costs however these can be recovered by charging for the keys - either as a one time cost or as a 'bump' to the subscription.the benefit is even if you're machine gets compromised and/or your password becomes 'known' the one time key generated by the 2 factor system secures you - even if you have a weak password.again, i suggest this as an optional additional feature for those that want it."
4/23/2009,i'd support this as an optional feature with a one time cost for those people who want it.
4/23/2009,i like options.
4/23/2009,options are good.
4/23/2009,i agree. something like a 1-time password would be quite nice.
4/23/2009,ehh.... as long as it's an option.otherwise no go.
4/23/2009,more stuff
4/23/2009,"needs to be implemented. corporate espionage and what not is supposed to be part of the game, but even with that sort of thing rl logs of who accessed things have always been around. ;p"
4/23/2009,much needed !
4/23/2009,"a corp hangar log? but you already have that by using containers with logs.even if ccp were to implement it, they should make it an opt-in thing which would require a considerable corporate investment, per hangar."
4/23/2009,"hmm...isn't this exactly what ninja salvagers do? what do they risk? mission runners risk losing their ships if the mission goes wrong. and please tell me, how many lvl 4 minmatar fleet agents (for example) are there in highsec? ninja salvagers are just griefers who couldn't shoot their way out of a wet paper bag so all they can do to harass other players is steal their salvage."
4/23/2009,"ever warped a probing ship into recon 3 of 3? hehe there's a risk for you. or what if the mission runner leaves the mission? then we risk aggro. yes the risk is low, but i think the level of risk for the salvager is on par with the risk for the mission runner."

4/23/2009,thanks :)

4/23/2009,@ mazzilliuwhat is your position on high-sec pos sieging?
4/23/2009,"420 siege high sec poses errrryy day(seriously though i don't know what you are asking me here. if someone gets wardecced, all their stuff in highsec is fair game to the attacker.)"
4/23/2009,"highsec pos sieges are long, insanely boring and very repetitive and tedious. do you think a rethink of how pos sieges work is necessary?"
4/23/2009,"now i think of it, it is pretty ****ty that you can't use dreads on highsec poses. do people use tons of hardeners on their poses or something? that's the only module i can think of that skews the balance too much against battleships. simply making them unanchorable in highsec should fix the problem to bring it more inline with 0.0 pos seiging, yes?give me more complete information on the problem, as i don't have experience seiging highsec poses- none of my pvp characters can enter highsec. :)"
4/23/2009,"i like you, please pledge to have md shut down and the ""regulars"" ""airlocked"" (ingame) - if you know what i mean"
4/23/2009,"wow. i'm really surprised with you, ankhesentapemkah. you're going wild with the assumptions, claiming i believe one thing and another. plus, insulting me? do you have any idea how much isk per hour a player in nullsec can generate with ratting? if they're lucky they can match that of level 4 missions in highsec. this means we have all this isk being pumped into the game with very little risk by way of highsec. they aren't at risk of being blown up like the players in nullsec, so how is that even remotely fair?as for lowsec i'm saying there needs to be more incentives to draw players in that direction. shifting the level 4 missions would accomplish that. and maybe a system could be created where players can generate standing with npc entities in lowsec so that they get added protection by way of a support cruiser warping in to jam the hostile and allow escape.the csm reps bring issues that concern the players to ccp by way of the players voicing their support first. are you letting yourself be blinded by the corp i belong to? it seems that way. which is unfortunate because i believe you shouldn't judge a person so hastily. btw, why are you doing erik's campaigning for him? people are going to have a hard time getting to know him with you towering over his thread."
4/23/2009,i believe that is exactly what the sleeper ai was intended to do. but then those players who are fighting mission rats which are complete cake (in faction fitted cnr) would be upset when their old tactics won't work very well.
4/23/2009,i like how my question still hasn't been properly answered.maybe he doesn't want his views on them known?
4/23/2009,csm needs charismatic people from 0.0-> vote for vuk lau!

4/23/2009,"sry on late reply, i totaly overlooked it.1. i really have nothing more to add to the things i already wrote 6 months ago in my csm 2.0 thread. anyway ccp said they will rebalance the capitals completely in upcoming patch so the prayers of all minmatars should be acklowledged.2. well i also said before i dont have much problems with falcon's being unbalanced. generally i liked ""properly"" unbalanced things cause races ""should"" differ and thus some races/ship classes will suck and some will own. ccp has cycles of nerfing/boosting races on their own unbalanced way and even if sometimes nerfing hits my favorite ships i dont have much problem with it, cause thats eve. but i must say that they nerfed falcon on bit retarted way, but well...life goes on..3. i will try to give you short answer. as i said above i am cool with unbalanced stuff, and when it comes to new content i am much bigger fun of making old/current content working properly then ****ting unfinished expansions every 6 months. but from the other side eve player base is constantly growing so my my opinion is proly lone one :d"
4/23/2009,i support dierdra vaal for csm 3.0.
4/23/2009,you were pretty entertaining during the last ganknight. that'll get you at least one of my votes. bring a bo to the next one and you may get two :o
4/23/2009,"all this talk about falcons what about stealth bombers. i like the new extra pew they bring, but some people did point out they only trained cruise missiles for stealth bombers and now they need to equivalently train up for t2 torps. with the changes in say scanning the skills were simply renamed or retooled. so probably what i'm asking is should something similar have been done in this case ie an option for a cruise missile -> torp sp swap and oh what to do with the extra sp?"
4/23/2009,your inherent rage against criticism and your weak ad hominen argumentation makes me giggle.good luck with your campaign. i even bumped you to the top of the forum.

4/24/2009,"i disagree. while i support adding the missing 4th bonus, a price drop in assault ships would mean me flying them exclusively. forever. if a jag cost me even just 10mil, as opposed to 20+ i'd never fly anything else.the prices are absurd. even for t2."

4/24/2009,"i'd like this.make them require graviton physics, though. like the capital tractor beam.medium could require graviton physics iilarge could require graviton physics iiicapital already requires graviton physics ivi don't think the range increase has to be as drastic as 100% for each step up, though. 20/30/40 would be enough, as long as the tractor velocity increased with each step.one thing i'd like even more would be if tractor beams in general had a falloff in addition to their range, yet a smaller base range to compensate, where falloff would affect tractor velocity. that way those who sit still in one place would have a bit more comfort, but actually tractoring the stuff in would take longer for anything beyond base range. that would give other parties interested in the salvage a better chance to fetch the fish right off the hook.or:a rather nasty concept/twist would be to add scripts to tractor beams that allow it to run a tractor beam in high powered mode (when the script is used), where both range and velocity double (or tripple), but with a chance of 50% -5% per level in graviton physics, that the wreck is ripped apart in the process and... destroyed. i like potential benefits that include a drawback."
4/24/2009,"no. don't like it? fit a mwd, get someone else to do it, get into a smaller faster ship, don't salvage/loot, etc etc. current mechanics work just fine. no change necessary.--isaac"
4/24/2009,"bs = battleshipbs != battlesalvageshipsorry... your ""reasoning"" is not strong enough to warrant this change.not supported.marauders have tractor beam bonuses... but even then they should not be that powerful."
4/24/2009,medium = small on a marauderlarge = small on an orcajust because they don't have the names doesn't mean that they don't exist.
4/24/2009,"i don't think we need more tractor beams. if you think about it the bigger the ship gets the slower the ship gets. this means that the small tractor beam is actually more effective on a bs than on a frig since it will save the the bs more time.also, t2 bs = 40km, spend the time and train for it.i would however maybe support having a t2 small tractor beam that has a 25km range, but that would be pushing it."
4/24/2009,"doesnt work heremaybe you will spend your time to help me then, and your friends to help other guys which also want better tractor beams? yeah because ccp doesnt really want people to loot/salvage their own wrecks...medium tractor beam 40km base + bonus from marauder = 80km <=== thats sounds and works alot better because many l4 missions have npcs even around 130k from your warpin point."
4/24/2009,use a marauder ? i thought that was supposed to be the big advantage of the ship.
4/24/2009,"yeah because no one is doing missions in 0.0, no one is ratting in 0.0 and definitely no one is doing a plex in 0.0 and even if then we *all* know that 0.0 npc's does not leave wrecks."
4/24/2009,whine thread is successful whine
4/24/2009,"good idea, i am also sick of the orbit changes i constantly have to do. --isaac"
4/24/2009,definitely want.
4/24/2009,"but it wont be fixed,ccp allways keeps the brutors in there place.you would think after all the years that that if one dread allways gets called primary.ccp would fix it,ooo wait we really needed tier 3 ships"
4/24/2009,if only ccp could hear us...
4/24/2009,a tractor beam skill book that lets you. get +5% range and +5% velocity. make the book a(3x)to be able to unlock the book u need to have salvaging 4 and and science 4.
4/24/2009,"there is already a skill that fits tractor beams, because it is already a prerequisite for capital tractor beams.graviton physicsjust implement it for such an application. it's a x5 skill, btw."
4/24/2009,supported
4/24/2009,no. --isaac
4/24/2009,"i tend to be pretty gung-ho about adding new skills, but this one is a little too narrow even for me. i really don't see the need."
4/24/2009,i can't say yes or no on this one.so i'm taking a seat until i see the logistics behind this.
4/24/2009,"india99, what is the point in introducing a new short range weapon for the phoenix when the problem is the damage formula? why should a siege phoenix do less damage than an unsieged phoenix when shooting at a ship the size of a small city?its ridiculous atm and needs a formula tweak and not a whole new weapon system to be thrown in on top of an already broken formula. so simply increase explosion velocity on the citadels, or maybe just include an explosion velocity bonus against caps (if thats possible)i dont know exactly what the best comprehensive solution to this problem is, but ccp will hopefully think of one, it is their job to do this sort of stuff after all."
4/24/2009,"the phoenix is widely regarded as cannon fodder, in other words if a dread dies in a cap fleet odds are its the caldari one. this is just another shiny example of one of the many things that need to change in regards to capitals."
4/24/2009,"like i said, these short range missles should have a better explo velocity than the citadels. so u have the citadels for sniping/pos bashing and the other ones for killing caps/super caps.tank of the phoenix very ok, i would say.i see there no point to complain about it atm."
4/24/2009,"citadels torpedos are the short range missile, there just aren't any citadel cruise missiles to serve as the long range missile. that isn't really the issue here though. giving citadel torps a 20-25m/s explosion velocity while in seige mode would probably solve this while still allowing bs's and smaller to speed tank them effectively."
4/24/2009,supported.
4/24/2009,"150 km range = short range? dont get confused just baout the name"" torpedo"" its the cruise missile in siege"
4/24/2009,"because there's only one capital missile you can argue back and forth all day wether they are short or long range weapons, but beyond the name their lack of a bonus from guided missile precision follows the pattern of the close range missiles. remember when torps were changed from not so useful midrange to close range heavy dps dealers, well a similar change for citadels coupled with the introduction of capital cruise missiles for longer range fights would be great.that said, this topic is about a specific issue. if you want to continue discussing the lack of a second capital missile system you can do so in another thread."
4/24/2009,/signed
4/24/2009,"please consider getting a filter for level 5 skills. why an earth they are included in the skill queue skill training selection makes no sense since they cannot be further trained.this adds significantly to the ""bloat"" of skills that you have to scroll through when applying skills to the queue."
4/24/2009,"agreed, a couple more filters would be nice, this one especially."
4/24/2009,agree. seems silly to include lvl5 skills
4/24/2009,"this, though tbh it is kind of bad ui design so i wouldn't object to the ""almost xxx"" idea."
4/24/2009,"one item, which i consider an exploit as it has no real benefit to storyline or community, is the log in trap.is there no way to force a 15 second buffer timer so that when someone logs in they are immune to attack and can not attack a target?this 15 secs would prevent these lamers that park all their ships at the gates at optimal range, log off, and wait for a ventrilo alert to log in.basically what they have created is a ""super cloak"" that can not be governed by ccp, an unfair mechanic, and exploit.an added bonus would be that players that get legitimately disconnected in battle would have a 15 second breather to allow their graphics to catch up and get positioned before continuing.i would also suggest a buffer to exiting stations. the same 15 secs would prevent undocking and finding yourself podded before your screen ever shows you the battle field."
4/24/2009,yarrrrr!!!
4/24/2009,sounds reasonable and gives all parties involved time to have a fair advantage.
4/24/2009,i would prefer more or less 5-10 seconds......but! i would rather when you logged in in space you would not warp to last location but rather the nearest celestial object(planet) i think this would help out allot with things.. instead of local spike then everyone is ontop of you you have time to get away etc....inputs
4/24/2009,10 secs may be a more appropriate time.
4/24/2009,randomize the login entry point (except when your docked at a station or a pos) and you have my vote.have them show up at some random deep space point or near a celestial body...keep in mind that logging off is an entirely different pandora's box.you can't possibly have an effective solution to that problem due to the nature of tcp/ip and the science behind internet connectivity.
4/24/2009,stations already have 30secs/first movement you makeabout your idea:this can be exploitable in lowsec for people trying to avoid gate camps were they quit out of the game log back in and cant be shot for 15 sec while they just warp off.it might work if you need to move in order to lock/be locked delaying logoffski about 4 seconds while giving people who dk a chance to get there barrings while not giving them the ability to warp off while in the timer.
4/24/2009,that's reasonable as far as logging off.if you get targeted before you exit the game then ok.and i can't stress the before part enough.how do you know some jackass didn't pull the plug on your internet connection in the middle of a fight?this is why its a pandoras box.
4/24/2009,"i like this idea. if the ship is smaller than the hold it should be possible to put it into the hold.we don't have to repackage the magic, bigger inside than outside, secure cans to get them in. why should we have to unfit and repackage ships if they're smaller than the available space in the hold?"
4/24/2009,"in case anybody forgot, the csm was originally created in responce to the call made by players for some sort of independant auditing body. in all reality, i dont think ccp will ever let the csm do something like that, all conspiracy theories aside. also i dont think elected players inherently have the experience to look at huge lists of transaction logs by ccp employees' chars and determine foul play or not, and the temptation to out them is there.despite that i still support this idea. the csm could be replaced with an online checkboxes poll in its current state."
4/24/2009,oh my god none of my modules are selling!!!ccp must be outselling me with their secret restricted economic information including the highest module drop locations and the best asteroid belts there are!supporting for the lulz.
4/24/2009,"not so much, actually. you will find out if you get to talk to them.that's what internal affairs is for, not the csm. you would know that if you read the csm document which describes the csm.hence why that's something the csm is working on changing."
4/24/2009,did it occur to you ******s (minus the people who laugh at this whole thread) that ccp doesn't need any isk or any stupid anything?they just snap there fingers and have the items they need.it's called being a gm.... you know? access to db? spawning items?yeah?duh?they don't need any frakking isk! x o dyou people are hilarious.btw i'm selling tin foil hats.... 1 million isk a piece... i'll even throw in an exotic dancer for yah....step right up!
4/24/2009,"1. why would ccp need to make isk? they can spawn it with a single button press.2. ccp know about changes before players? oh my god! (see point 1)3. the forums are not the preferred way to contact ccp internal affairs. have you tried emailing them?wts tinfoil hats, only 99999999999 isk (100 thousand isk)"
4/24/2009,so basically you don't want to have to interact and be committed to put up a pos?.. hmm no i think not.
4/24/2009,ccp: stop destroying our souls
4/24/2009,"from what i read the op's point is that the way reppers are now you have to wait to get the damage repped.well i would like to point out to the op that he is wrong and that his entire argument is based off a false assumption.this example will use a repper with a 10 second cycle that does 800 hpwith the op's ideastarting at time 0 = total hp reppedt0 = 80 hp reppedt1 = 160t2 = 240t3 = 320t4 = 400t5 = 480t6 = 560t7 = 640t8 = 720t9 = 800t10 = 880now using the current systemt0 = 800t1-t9 = 800t10 = 1600now the op is saying that with shorter rep rate you gain your hp faster, but this is not the case, if you look at the above example you will see that at no point in time does the shorter cycle ever end up gaining the player any extra hp.the only time this idea would work is if you had to wait 10 seconds for the first rep to occur, but since this doesn't happenthe idea is not good"
4/24/2009,"i like the idea of making the armor repairers repair ~70 per second over the cycle time rather than repair the full amount after the cycle ends. reducing the cycle time instead would be a bad thing since one of the things lars have going for them is that they cycle at roughly the same speed as a large cap booster, which adds some neut resistance.that is false. the way armor repairs currently work is that you get nothing until the cycle ends. with the current system is is more like:t0 = 0t1-t9 = 0t10 = 800the only exception to this is if your enemies are doing low enough dps that you can turn your rep on while your shields are still holding and time it perfectly so that its cycle ends as you start taking enough armor damage. of course when the enemy does that little damage, your repairers should hold the incoming damage anyway and you dont need to worry about the cycle time."
4/24/2009,"ah,i've only used shield reppers, and i know they work the way i stated, if the armor reppers don't work that way then i apologize."
4/24/2009,"can we get more of a reply on this and possibly a word in from ccp? i really would rather not have the answer be, ""get a new computer"".if the drivers on the gfx cards are not supported, than why can't us mac users get some love from ccp and have them supported?eve worked fine for me before apocrypha came out and it really is a shame that we can't play now because of some fancy new shader engine."
4/24/2009,"i enjoy you cherry picking your own topic. of course, getting kill rights or a fuel use bonus are not 100% defensive things. but, the ability to attack anyone who comes into your lowsec system and has a sec status less than -0.1 is very much a defensive advantage. that's the part of your post i've been focusing on. yeah, congrats you can drop 50 dreads on a lowsec pos bashing fleet, but which is easier, the logistics, cost and time of 50 dreads assembling, jumping, fighting, hopefully not dying, jumping back and being refueled/rearmed? or parking an alt corp in a system in which you hold an r64 moon and letting it sit there. then, when your spies hear rumblings of an impending attack, you blob the in-gate to that system with a bs heavy fleet. the first character in the attacking fleet that is below the security status gets wtfbbqed, but the no-one else in the attacking fleet can fire back because they'll draw a gcc and diaf even quicker. so where does your idea get us? stagnation of lowsec moons and resources. alliances that can pull off the meta-game are rewarded for it instead of punished. still not supported."
4/24/2009,"okay, one of us is missing something here. we are still talking about fleet combat in lowsec, right? the same lowsec that lets anyone shoot anyone for any reason? the same lowsec whose best form of defence for ""innocent"" players is some hundreds of dps of gate guns? do you seriously think that gccs and sec status losses are going to dissuade anyone in a fleet fight from firing? when you're protecting dysprosium, you don't check sec statuses of people going through the gate to see who you can fire on and rely on the gate guns to pick off anyone else, you shoot them all. i'm not the slightest bit worried about a narrow interaction between my proposed aggro mechanics and dys/pro defence, because: a) the alliances won't care about this - they defend the moon, not the system, and they don't care about sec status when they do.b) most alliances won't really be able to use this even if, by some miracle, they do care.c) there are a whopping 20 lowsec systems in the game with valuable moons, and i intended this proposal far more for the 800 that don't than the 20 that do."
4/24/2009,"as the title says to be honest, seen blue responses over two years ago saying this was going to be implemented.i know this wont be on the top of most peoples lists but there really is no reason why this has not been implemented yet, should not take up to much time or resource to do either.thumbs up please people ------------------------------------------"
4/24/2009,"i just realized today, why are drone control units active modules? they take absolutely no cap to run on their 20 second cycle times, why not just make them passive modules, fit them to the carrier and they give +1 drone, no need to activate the module."
4/24/2009,"supporting my own idea, lest i be a hypocrite."
4/24/2009,because they can't be used when you are in triage mode.
4/24/2009,yup!no support for idea.--isaac
4/24/2009,"i'd think the easier solution to that is to make triage modules work properly on a ship fitting dcus(e.g., by giving a flat -25 drone cap), rather than having dcus be ""active"" modules. this feels like a fairly sketchy workaround. that said, it's not worth changing. no support."
4/24/2009,just have triage mods remove -625 bandwidth(moms bandwith) and make the dcu mod passive seems like a better woraround.dcu dont give any extra bandwidth and unless theirs some problem with the calculation in having negative drone bandwidth it dose not matter how many drones you can control if you dont have any bandwidth.i whoud not mind them being passive because that one less module you have to activate in a fleet battle and one less module that can lag out.
4/24/2009,"fighters don't use bandwidth, so your fix wouldn't work. personally, i'd like to see triage just have a -100% drone damage mod, so you can keep using logistics drones, but really any change in this is likely to not be worth the effort."
4/24/2009,"this is so true. after spending a couple of hours in jita trying to scam people, it was still horrible looking at npc corp chat and seeing endless reams of people spamming crap where they substitute the word 'duck' into normal sentences. really, local doesn't have a well defined purpose, but npc corp chat is meant to be, at least mostly for help. for the record, i don't do any of the usual crap scams though (99999999 isk, 10x back, raven instead of navy raven, etc)."
4/24/2009,why is there an option for allaince use on a corporate hanger array when non corp members can not use this.for alliance wide mining operations etc out of a corp pos the ability to set the specific array so that anyone in allaince can access it would make sense. of course there is agreat risk involved in this at the pos owners expense and he/she would need to remove the access when the opp is finished.
4/24/2009,"alliance access permits alliance members to put things (like ore) into another corp's cha. they can't see or remove items, but can put things in.if you don't like it, don't give them access."
4/24/2009,#NAME?
4/24/2009,"from my time in sn i remember most members not only salvaged but looted wrecks in the missions they entered.frigate/destroyer fit with salvagers vs battleship carrying light drones that can permatank an entire lvl 4 spawn.there is some risk for you. if missionrunners would rather retaliate on the forums in the form of whines rather than in game, well, i'd say that rather predjudices any argument against them.i just know some of you are thinking 'but he will come back in a pvp ship and kill the missionrunenr if he gets shot at by him'. oh, just a minor thing- the missionrunners entire corp have aggression rights to the looter.please don't forget that the mr can change ships as well, nor that your average pilot running level 4's makes isk an order of magnitude faster than anyone ninja salvaging and should a ship be lost.tl;dr missionrunners have plenty of effective tools against ninja salvagers, in reality they hold all the keys to the castle.but wait...what if the ninja doesn't loot?salvage alts to beat him to the quicksuicide gank himwarp out and watch the rats pop himturn in mission and take out another onemission in a less crowded system with no salvagersmission in a hub (less chance that you will be scanned out or selected)make a deal with the salvager, he takes a % cut, your isk/hour efficiency probably increases."
4/24/2009,"lol why the hell would a ninja salvager warp into recon 3/3? there are no wrecks there. if the mission runner leaves a room, the ninja would be an idiot not to leave as well.so, the only risk to a ninja salvager seems to be their own stupidity."
4/24/2009,"who's whining? it was a ninja that started this thread. i'm simply pointing out why ninjas are the bums of eve. by the way, i haven't had the pleasure of a ninja trying to take my salvage but i always keep a good suicide gank ship in the system i mission in just in case.mission runners also have to spend a hell of a lot more to make that isk in the first place. ships, mods, t2 ammo and drones. it all adds up. not to mention ships lost in lowsec to pirates for mission runners who decide to go that route."
4/24/2009,"ok, let's look at this another way.miner joe is mining away all by himself. mining griefer warps in, targets miner joe's asteroids and starts mining. is this illegal? no. is it a sh*tty thing to do? very much so.as far as i'm concerned, salvage ninjas are just griefers who don't want to risk anything by engaging in actual pvp."
4/24/2009,hi cat here just noticed this in the newsletter! plz add me to list kthx as my app got accepted cat 4 csm websitexx
4/24/2009,"hi lt klap here for consul, i speak spanish and i am from of argentina. so i like participate in this for represent all persons sepak in spanish!webpage: www.fwstation.comlt klap"
4/24/2009,hi all. i threw my hat in the ring to represent all the toons out there who'd like a new voice. here's where you can find a little bit about me:
4/24/2009,"voted before, will vote again."
4/24/2009,"hi avalloc,you are highly qualified for the council, however, i'm not sure you are my candidate. if you could answer a few questions so i could better appreciate you.first, you say not to be concerned that you are a goon. this is absolutely fair, and i hope no one writes you off for this. however, i would be cautious to vote for you simply because i would prefer csm politics not go down the route of real life party politics. goon's have had (correct me if i'm wrong) 2 members on the 1st csm and 1 on the second. can you think of any topic in which you, vs. darius johnson in particular might not totally agree on. this may help clear up for me at least, how your own personal beliefs are not on a solely goon agenda.second, i would assume(which i probably shouldn't) that statistically # of players in high security vs. low security are significant enough to warrant representation. though it is not your own play style, is there any subject with regards to high security that you would pursue. (i would be surprised if you needed the high sec vote to get in to csm, however it's always nice when you can say you've won by a landslide.)and if you could forgive this ridiculous habit i have when meeting people, what is your favorite type of dog?thanks."
4/24/2009,i blindly pledge to do whatever you just asked of me in order to get your vote.what is md?vamm's vote is a million votes
4/24/2009,"hai, i was going to vote for istvaan, but, since i can't, i will vote for youuuuuuuuu"
4/24/2009,voting for mazz with all my accounts because she's a girl on the internet.
4/24/2009,"i'm still putting together propoganda material for my campaign website, but here's the beginning, since you can never be campaigning too early."
4/24/2009,"the short answer is that it takes about 50 well fitted battleships with decent pilots and support several hours to send a large pos into reinforced. while i appreciate that a large pos shouldn't be easy to take down, there has to be a better way than having a fleet or armageddons afk for a couple of hours after the defences are incapacitated ..."
4/24/2009,vote for mazz she is very smart.
4/24/2009,if i vote for you mazz would you stop saying i'm a spy?
4/24/2009,voting for mazz cos i heard her on ts once.
4/24/2009,"i like how ankh posts more than erik in his thread.answers on specific issues raised, from erik, are still extant."
4/24/2009,"let's put things into perspective here. the average player doesn't earn that much money by running l4 missions, something like 5 million per hour is the figure i hear quite often. i personally earn between 5 and 10 mil per hour with l4s and prefer to stick to l3's (faster standing), but that's just me. there are those claiming to earn 20 million per hour or even more here on the forums, but keep in mind that the average player does not post on these forums at all, and the average player certainly doesn't fly a nightmare or golem or has any kind of faction/deadspace/officer modules and expensive rigs.the players with the pimped ships might be earning a bit too much compared to 0.0, but i think it's a better option to boost lowsec and 0.0 and have some more income sources there so joe-average in the alliances there can choose to live in 0.0 instead of moving back to highsec for missionrunning.removing l4s from highsec alltogether is not the way go to, and doesn't create incentives for people to move to lowsec if people do not want to go to lowsec and 0.0 in the first place, no matter what. it'd make more people quit than those that do cross the line. it bothers me that the vocal minority that calls for this extreme act does not realize that and fails to understand the needs of the casual player and vast silent majority of eve players.nah i've had a year of exposure to your corp already, that's not it. any take care representative can answer for take care, especially when a specific representative is occupied with real life work, wouldn't you agree?"
4/24/2009,"no, i don't agree. this isn't the party campaigning for the csm, this is about erik. if he's busy then he should answer when he gets the chance to, not have someone else belonging to a psuedo political party answer for him."
4/24/2009,"hi erik,all great leaders have advisers even if they function from behind a curtain. i appreciate the up front approach of take care.if you would be so kind to answer a few questions.first, you emphasize your individuality from ankhesentapemkah very early on. some of ankhesentapemkah's work does include functions encompassing the whole of eve, and for that, my thanks. from reading some of the csm meetings (something i can recommend to everyone), as i perceived it, ankhesentapemkah put higher priority of re-working bounty hunting over sovereignty. take care states to have an open minded platform working for all players, however, seeing as how ccp has limited resources, would you personally like to see something like the above example take priority?second, perhaps unrealistic. with 2 instances i can see the same alliances being voted into the csm(correct me if i'm wrong). after reading arguments from 1 member in particular, i can think of no other explanation except that party politics is already involved in this new democratic process(as i wasn't there, perhaps they just seem like bad arguments on paper). if it came up, would a representative of take care push not only for the 2 term restriction per pilot, but also for a 2 term consecutive restriction per alliance? ankhesentapemkah feel free to answer for this last question if you care to.and last, a fun question, if you don't mind, what is your favorite dog?thank you."
4/24/2009,"he's like superman, batman, and hugh hefner all rolled into one!vuk for csm!!"
4/24/2009,"what you been bad again istvaan ? how could you ...it is a shame that this has happened, you would provide so much to the csm. rules are rules i suppose..."
4/24/2009,guess i won't be voting after all... i hope captsky gets around to making my new sig soon.
4/24/2009,[hijack]could always just vote for me instead...[/hijack]
4/24/2009,"no, i agree. they should vote for you.in fact, let this be my rallying cry! though i myself have fallen in the pursuit of csm power, there are many candidates available in this running, who aren't useless carebears! therefore, i encourage the voters during this csm run to cast their votes for omber zombie, mazzilliu and larkonis trassler. i have faith that they will represent my moral stance well enough in the upcoming elections."
4/24/2009,"i've updated the original post with chip mintago and larkonis trassler's interviews. i've got a couple of more sitting around, still waiting on replies from alot of my commitments."
4/24/2009,just wondering if you got my responses - i emailed them to you almost a week ago...
4/24/2009,"i too, would like to participate!"
4/24/2009,after your initial mail i've never received any questions or request for an interview. did a mail get lost somewhere?
4/24/2009,didn't receive nearly as much support as i would have liked it to have. but lets give it a short anyways.stability issues on macbook.
4/24/2009,thread has been stickied.

4/24/2009,"it's good to hear there's a candidate with an understanding of pvp while being pve centered. however, the sound card on my computer has been fritzed for quite a few months, and i only got it working again due to a usb sound card.that said, i would like you to list your favored types of topics and what you would like to change for those of us who haven't listened to your radio program. everybody has an agenda, and it's only by finding the people who represent what you endorse that you make a change in the game by voting.in that regard, there are a few questions i have for you:1) what aspects of the game do you think are in the greatest need of change, and how would you change those to make the game work better?2) what do you like and/or dislike about previous csm sessions, and how do you think you could do better if given the chance?3) if an idea comes up that lies outside of your sphere of influence, how will you find an answer to reflect the wants of your constituents?thanks, and just trying to get an idea of your platform."
4/24/2009,"well let me start off by saying i love this game. i have since i started playing in 2005. i actually was in the beta briefly, but my pc at the time needed a triple by-pass after trying it due to its low performance. after a few years in other games (earth and beyond, swg) i found my home now in eve. there is so much about this game that is enjoyable. as for aspects that need change, that is a difficult topic really. i feel that above all else, the community is a big portion of what makes or breaks a game. dont get me wrong, the development support is also a huge factor, but the community is what really keeps the players together. i read the general discussion forums almost every day, mostly taking in the complaints and whines from people, and also just looking at what people are discussing. i browse the other forums when i am search of information, but i find the gd forums to be generally a good read when it is slow at work ectright now one of the biggest topics that the gd forums are raising concern is the contract scams. while scamming a player out of his/her isk a right for each and every person in eve, it really has gotten out of control to some extent, mostly in the form of the local channels of trade hubs being bombarded every second with more and more contract scam spammage. the local channel wasnt really designed for that, and some people do enjoy a little conversation with others in system, but that is impossible when there is so much spam being said.personally i also wouldnt mind seeing ccp go through with the removal of local or changing local to be like worm-hole space. the idea of not knowing who else is there with you really brings a rush to me when i go into a wormhole. local channel is more of a crutch for low-sec/0.0 when fleets are looking for fights ecti would also like to see a return of the in-game events on a certain scale. one time as a member of an alliance in 0.0 space we got contacted by a mordus legion npc (run by isd) to do an escort mission to the mordus station on 5zxx-k. the alliance formed a fleet and pulled off the escort without a hitch (though some others tried to stop us, which was great fun, pew pew) one of the most memorable experiences in eve, and i think with some planning could be brought back. the previous csm sessions i think they were really useful to the community. a few items that the csm brought to the table were really taken in by ccp, and eventually made their way into eve. (skill queue) the csm is really a unique element of eve which makes eve that much greater when you compare it to other games of similar type. one reason for this is ccp really takes the csm seriously. i feel i can offer the csm a community orientated side because of having a talk-show on the radio; i ask and also get asked many questions about the different aspects of eve."
4/24/2009,"im always learning and expanding my knowledge with eve. recently i started getting into tech2 invention as well as poss. the eve-online forums as well as other players inside the eve universe are a great resource at everyones fingertips. ive also used my show as an outlet to voice questions when i am interested in learning more about different aspects of the game. its amazing how much knowledge is out there in the community, and everyone is always so helpful. not a problem. i had actually considered running in the previous 2 elections, but real-life took precedence over my choice. i was chosen to host the alliance tournament coverage shows during the tournament, and enjoyed doing it a lot. we offered very unique perspective to the community and everyone enjoyed it. it was the biggest thing i had ever done for the community, and i would love the opportunity to help out the community again. i love this game.also anyone interested, my scheduled show is 0400 to 0700 eve time saturdays on new eden radio. feel free to tune in, or join in on our conversations in our in game channe neweden-radio"

4/25/2009,agreewe want old effect backsp.also old effect of neutrolaisers ans nosferato xd
4/25/2009,"+1return old effect, please."
4/25/2009,not a cap pilot but soon will bebring it back
4/25/2009,it's very true.most people i see skip the af for the hac since it fills its role better. sucks when an interceptor can out-dps an assault frigate.
4/25/2009,"af need 4th bonus indeedand btw every t2 ship shoud have hes own role bonus, so every t2 ship has his own role in gang."
4/25/2009,"you know what the funny thing is when i hear people quote ""the jag is one of the best afs""? have you looked at how people fit this ship, then took a look at the bonuses? the bonus suggests artillery as the ships weapon of choice, and, afs are meant to speed/signature tank, yet, the ""tank"" most people fit is a medium shield extender and an ab/mwd and web/point.it's quite ridiculous that the long range minnie af gets used as the short range heavy tackler with autocannons (not by me though ;p )also, i fully endorse the adding of a fourth bonus to the assault frigates, although it doesn't necessarily need to be the bonuses proposed by the op."
4/25/2009,1
4/25/2009,"i was gonna write a big post arguing about long range fitted afs, but to be honest, i don't really care. its great that people have success with both autos and artys, would be a shame if there was one good way to fit a ship and everything else didn't work. it would remove the ingeunity in putting together a fit noone has thought of before.what i'm really trying to say is that i hope the 4th bonus isn't one that confines the ships to being used in a certain way. for example, if only the wolf was given a tracking bonus and not the jag, you'd be forced to use a wolf if you want to get up close and personal - the way i like to fly my jag, but am finding really suffers from not having the tracking of a rifter. of course, a tracking bonus would also suit the arty use as well, hence not confining ships to a particular role."
4/25/2009,best of luck vukkick their asses and get it done for all of us super cap pilots out here
4/25/2009,****ing rights supported. good on you.
4/25/2009,"agree we need reworked titan's and mothership's bonusses/rolesbut i'm not agree with topic starterccp say titan should be a logistic ship, i say i'ts bull**** coz titan should be a flagship with heavy defence and firepower capabilities."
4/25/2009,the proposed changes keep titans with immense firepower and usefulness. they just don't allow them to be the 1 shot killers they are now.
4/25/2009,"i would support the idea but not with such overpowered stats as the op suggests; missions are lucrative enough as they are without speeding up the process even more.perhaps have longer range tractor beams with slower tractor speed as a trade-off, so players might have to think a little more about what sort of tractor beam might suit their style of mission running./ben"
4/25/2009,"this, but i'm going to support now rather than later. that said, when salvaging, i frequently end up going too fast if i do it after a mission ends and outrun my own cans, and this is with a bc. having a longer, slower one which doesn't require as much running around and/or would allow me to grab a can that accidentally fell of the end while i slow down would be nice. (okay, i admit it, i'm kind of voting for thinking less, but salvaging's pretty brainless as it is, and i'd rather have it be simple and brainless instead of complicated and brainless.)"
4/25/2009,"i would like to see the ability to add, or even make it a default, a column for meta level in the items list.it would make organizing our accrued crap easier, we could sort by meta level and identify/refine all the low meta level items.this may help server lag, if everyone is refining all items below a certain meta level there may be less for the server to track/store.maybe this is an option currently and i have not found it?"
4/25/2009,"i know i've seen people asking for this before, though i'm not sure if ccp has already brought it up. but yes, this would be one of the best single features they could add to inventory management."
4/25/2009,yes!
4/25/2009,raised? the issue is still outstanding as a fix has not yet been applied. and this is the only naglfar specific topic.the nag is the biggest white elephant in the game with no advantages/great inferioritys and certainly no role.
4/25/2009,"the question is, why ccp does hate mintards?"
4/25/2009,"yes, the naglfar needs ballancing. not that i necessarily want it to be changed to a 4 turret layout, but it does need some changes.on a sidenote: on capital ships, signature radius is not an issue. while it is true that the naglfar has the smallest signature of all dreads, it means nothing since:1. dreads in siege mode don't move2. xl weapon's signature resolution is still smaller than the naglfar's signature, so, no help from there.and on a sidenote: adding a falloff bonus component to all optimal affecting modules (as tds already have), would help minmatar weaponry quite a bit, as you can see with the xl arties, 88km falloff is quite a number to be modified by a range mod."
4/25/2009,topic needs additional bumpage this is important >_<... well more important than additional bling on ships and such
4/25/2009,"agreed. the whole corp interface needs an overhaul. it makes no sense to new players, and old players don't like dealing with it."
4/25/2009,"i'd rather see a skill that adds 10% range to tractor beams per level, and adding that as a bonus to graviton physics sounds fine to me."
4/25/2009,"i've lost a carrier in empire recently, turns out you have to wait 20 seconds before you jump ( for the purpose of getting a better look at the flashing red gang in front of you, obviously). i was bumped to hell and back immediately after exiting the station and couldn't make it back. (mwding vagabonds are quite fun ain't they?)so i'm wondering what is the common procedure in such cases:1. check station surroundings with an alt first.2. set an insta jump bookmark prior to exiting the station with the carrier.3. log off.log off works as intended, however, i would appreciate it if the untargetable time interval after undocking in empire could be extended to 30 seconds or more for capital ships.p.s. go to null sec and use bubbles / dictors, you lamers!"
4/25/2009,"not supported, you are wrong.why?1) dread in siege modedreads in siege mode are supposed to be anti pos/dread weapons. if you want to hard hit a moving target while in siege mode, you have to use some tricks. sieged dreads shall not be able to do it out-of-the-box. there are two tools for that: target painter and webber.while the webber cannot be used on supercaps, but it still works on carriers and unsieged dreads. the only point is, ship fited webbers are too weak to give you enough dmg boost alone. the only webbers that have good effect are the faction webber arrays, but these are expensive and only avaiable if you are in range of a pos which is equipped with them, and if you manually direct them to web your target you want to kill. these pre nerf aera like 97.5% faction webber arrays are able to web a bs down to a speed where you can alpha strike it with your citadels (when used together with painting). go and buy such babies, if not, do not complain about fast moving targets.the second tool, the target painter, helps to hit moving capital targets with citadel torpedoes harder. the small explosion radius of 1000m for a citadel torp compared to the much larger sig radius of a cap is your friend! while it was limiting damage during speed tanking before the nano-nerf, it does not any more after the nerf. excessive sig radius painting of speed tanking targets can be used to overcompensate lack of explosion velocity. this was designed to give afterburners better speed tanking capabilities over microwarps, which allow faster speeds while blowing up the sig radius. so if you want see your citadels hit hard, use excessive painting by skilled pilots in ships with painter bonus, and not by your five tp-900 drones. the formular on the page you referenced is correct, redo the math with painting applied.something similar applies to small pos structures. while they are not moving arround, they still have too less (less than 1000m, the ex radius of the citadel is limiting damage here) sig radius to take the full punch of your citadels. to compensate this, you need painting.on not moving targets with larger sig radius than 1000m you dont need any painting. this aplies to siege mode dreads, to the pos forcefield and to capitals with active cyno generators.everything is fine here, nothing is broken, and nothing needs to be boosted/nerfed. just the description of the siege module should be clarified.2) dread out of siege modeyou can hit moving caps with full damage, isn't it? you also can move your dread arround, speedtanking other dreads who try to gank you from siege mode. and they can try to web/paint you to compensate. so everything fine here too.conclusionnothing is broken, nothing is bugged, nothing needs to be boosted/fixed/nerfed. ok, maybe gun fitted sieged dreads should be nerfed to not to be able to hard hit moving targets any more, not even the large ones... but that's another story. all tools are in game to help with damage while in siege mode. you just need to use them. the need to use them is not epic failure, it's fun. dreads allready are one trick ponies... ok, maybe two trick ponies, you need to turn on trick 1a (siege mode) before you can use trick 1b (lots of volley dmg). it would be boring if a dread could deal full siege mode dmg without any support by webber/painter mates/equipment.dont panic, everything is fine."
4/25/2009,"let me start with a simple assertion: if citadel torpedoes are fine now, they must've been overpowered before.they weren't. they have been made significantly less effective against moving targets. therefore they are underpowered now. qedi could leave it at that, but since you've taken the time to write a well structured post i will answer you fully and point out your numerous misconceptions and your tendency to mistakenly apply your personal ideas on game design. your first misconception: why this is wrong: dreads are anti pos and anti-cap ship weapons. if the devs didn't want dreads to be used against carriers / supercaps they would have made all dreads innefective against those targets, not one ""and a half"" of them and even then only since the missile formula change. if they weren't carriers would have no same sized counter. that is poor design and thankfully that's not the direction the devs took with dreads, no matter how hard you wish it were.let's assume you may be right for a second, it would mean every alliance that has ever deployed dreads to kill a carrier or supercap lacks your in depth understanding of how the game was meant to be played and has, in fact, been massively failing. or you could be wrong. guess which one is more likely.the reality is all dreads were effective against caps of all types, more so than any other ship class. turret dreads still are. therefore an imbalance that needs to be fixed. amazing how you brush off supercaps as they cause all your arguments to break down. they cannot be webbed. they cannot be painted. they are there and cannot be ignored if you expect to be taken seriously. once again for emphasis: you cannot ignore supercaps."
4/25/2009,"anyway:ship webs and painters are band aids, citadel explosion velocity is a throat wound. yes they work on carriers - 3 60% webs and a tp gives full damage against a thanatos. but with that kind of support you'd expect to start doing damage to lower ship classes as is the case for every other ship class in eve. so let's take a look at what would happen if you used those three webs and a painter on a battleship, the megathron for example.how about three webs / three painters.keep in mind these are worst case scenarios with max transversal, and that the phoenix is fitting two additional damage mods.the question is why use citadels when you could use a gun dread and kill not only same sized ships, but do serious damage to battleships and some bcs as well with that same support. the answer should be obvious. your mention of pos webs fails for two reasons: not all cap fights happen at pos. most do, but you cannot pretend fights don't happen at stations, gates, or elsewhere. feel free to look up battle reports if in doubt.the second reason is that major cap battles at pos happen when the pos exits reinforced. see that cpu use on the webs? it means they are offline when reinforced. you really should know this.gun dreads do full damage with no painters, doesn't seem balanced at all but this thread is about explosion velocity and you're off topic.if you're shooting another cap out of siege mode and you're not flying a moros, you're doing it wrong. the reason is simple: you'd be more useful in a carrier or battleship. no, it's not. either citadel explosion velocity is broken, or gun dreads are way too good at hitting carriers and smaller targets and have been since their introduction, with nothing concrete to support the latter.quoting this again: this is where you fail the most. dreads already need support to be effective. wanting them to need more support isn't stupid per se, but one weapon type needing that extra support to hit same sized targets while three do not is massively broken. stop writing about how eve is in terms of how you want it to be in a thread about a balance issue."
4/25/2009,"sorry if i've upset you with my answer, it was not my intention.i dont want ""to apply my ideas of game design"", and i dont want ""writing about how eve is in terms of how i want it to be"". if this was your imression, then i'm sorry. english is not my natural language - i do my best to get into words what i think and i know, sorry if i fail trying. what i've written is what i've learned all the years in eve. but back to topic (""balancing or not balancing citadels""). that's fact. allow me to cite for proof: (from ""new ship classes planned for this year"", devblog #229)sieged dreads are inteded for anti-battleship role? really? no, in a later devblog oveur gets more concrete: (from ""sneak peaks part iii - needful things?"" - devblog #247, original emphasis)so it is not my idea to have sieged dreads as weapons against immobile targets, ok?you can hit slow targets with a sieged dread. that's not a problem at all. it is not a problem even with ganking something like the megathron in your example above. you show 900 dps there. not much for a spider tanking mega. but does dps really care for phoenix ganking a bs? how much volley dmg is it? it's 22k+ per volley per phoenix. bring four friends with more sieged phoenix dreads, and the poor guy in the mega gets 110k within a timeframe of one second between the first impact and the last one. no chance to spidertank that, if the buffer is not large enough. so what's wrong with that? nothing, you need coordination and support to get such kills, it's a fun challenge. or do you really want such kills shall be possible solo? i suppose not. so if you ask for rebalancing citadels towards more dps, then you also ask for much less volley dmg to compensate. it's a bad idea to provoke the nerfbat here, it's nice as it is, and nerfbats are known to hit where noone expects.next point, the 'hitting supercaps with full damage'. can you hit a supercap with full damage? yes you can: wait till he activates triage, clone vat bay or cyno. maybe he will never do it. then you still can hit him with reduced, but good damage, even if you cannot paint/web him. why do you think you should be able to hit him with full damage while he is moving? eve is a stone-paper-scissor game, nothing is perfect here. i've digged arround and found this cite for you:"
4/25/2009,"(from ""more balancing changes for revelations 2.2"" - devblog #494)hmm... so originally not intended to siege caps, but no problem when they get better suited as a side effect on balancing of the scanning system. but still no words about dreads to be the ideal suited anti-moving-supercap-weapon. i've digged arround and found it nowhere. maybe because it simply isnt intended to be one, like absolutley nothing in eve is inteded to be perfect. because perfect is boring.but ccp fendahl shows a much better way for rebalancing than to mess up with explosion velocity: maybe you should just ask to increase sig radius and sensor strength of the supercaps a little? would 10% be enough for you? however, i still dont think it's neccecary:maybe gun based dreads can deal in special situations more damage to moving supercaps than missile based (the minmatar dread is another story). the difference is, missile dreads do not need to take movement of the target into account. the fc can cyno them anywhere on the battlefield, they jump in, siege, lock and start fire. the target cannot reduce the damage by manuvering into another direction. for gun based dreads the fc must do his homework to get them positioned well, so they can deal ideal dmg. both concepts have an advantage/disadvantage, it's balanced.ask yourself, is it really a 'must have' for you to deal 100% dmg into a moving supercap, in all situations? or arent the 2k-2.5k dps enough? it's not perfect, but more than a bs or carrier could deliver. so even the phoenix is, as it is now, a good suited anti cap ship, no matter if the supercap is moving or not.another reason why i would not try to force the devs to look closer on this topic is, when they start to do, they will take a look on the gun based dreads... maybe with the result of a nerf of them if they sometimes hit bs too easy.explosion velocity is the verry wrong screw to use for rebalancing this issue (if it is an issue at all)."
4/25/2009,eve is filled with inactive towers(espacially in empire). i say if you put a tower somewhere it should be active.therefore i would propose that all towers who have been inactive for more then a month should be removed automaticly from the game(including all mods/hangars/stuf in the hangars etc).
4/25/2009,it should be more than just having them removed.people would exploit them by not putting in fuel except enough for a day or an hour.it should lose health over time.... right down to structure.
4/25/2009,"i agree with the principle, but i think it would be more appropriate to automatically unanchor them and let the problem sort itself out."
4/25/2009,would make for a great new sport.... tower hijacks ftw.
4/25/2009,"i have no issues with it, but i do feel it should be an option for players.maybe a render of the station with a render of the ship, instead of real-time.the normal look should default on, but the option to turn it off should definitely exist. my laptop would definitely be thankful."
4/25/2009,supported.
4/25/2009,"one thing that would be very cool is the addition of an alliance/corp marketplace.the ability to add things for sale on the market ""to alliance/corp members only"" and a filter to show only alliance member offerings.what this would allow is the ability for alliance members to post items at very cheap prices for their mates. i don't really look to make a fortune on drops i find, and would rather support my mates, but find communicating what all i have all the time is difficult currently.my alliance has members from all time zones, so asking if anyone has an item available only hits a portion of the members, and only those on line.throwing all your crap into the exchange hanger gets to be a mess real fast.of course these items would have to be outside of the normal sale slot count or your ""open market"" slots would be used up fast.charging a fee and/or tax for each item should keep players from abusing it as a storage area.i feel this would add another perk for alliance/corp members."
4/25/2009,i really fail to see why this is needed as the current contract system does the same exact thing you want. so why should we do something else?--isaac
4/25/2009,"i agree,we need an corp/alliance marketplace"
4/25/2009,it will help. contracts are awkward.
4/25/2009,"i would love this as my character has the majority of their skills to level 5, and it would save a marginal amount of time."
4/25/2009,sensible and logical request. thumbs up./ben
4/25/2009,"this tbh.there really is no reason why all prices should not be displayed in numerals as described above, this is common practice even in rl when you write a cheque for example.-----------------------------------------"
4/25/2009,"thats one of the points the op makes, there are no ""letters"" as such, just numbers that have a similar effect to being snow blind.------------------------------------"
4/25/2009,fix local and cov ops ... then we will talk
4/25/2009,i fully support any attempt to fix an exploit. any lamer caught using a login trap should be banned imho. any abuse of the system is an exploit and should be dealt with rather than over looked by ccp.
4/25/2009,"i think it should work only if your currently training the prereq on the last level before the new skills.so say im learning skill a to learn skills bi need skill a to lv3 before i can learn skill bi can 'only"" inject skill b when skill a is at level 3.i hope that makes sence"
4/25/2009,can't believe i didn't support this yet.
4/25/2009,"good idea, counterarguments at weak at best"
4/25/2009,it's a simple enough idea in concept that there are no doubt coding issues that'll keep it from happening.i can see the attraction--i've run into the problem myself a couple of time already--but there's always other stuff to train. i've been keeping a full queue all the time and using low priority skills as filler when i need to. retains a bit of the training time juggling that's traditionally been almost a minigame as well.not supported.
4/25/2009,i was thinking that having a system to remove unwanted skills would be a good thing to have in eve. for example when you are new and dont really know what you are training you end up training something that in the long run you will never use so maybe you could have it that you remove one skill and it saves those points into a pool that you could use for another skill?
4/25/2009,welcome to assembly hall.please avoid bold typing your posts as it comes across as you don't want to be viewed as the worlds most annoying noob.especailly when you start typing and doing funny funny things like this and that which don't really increase the chances of being noticed.as to your proposal....not supported.if the pilot is new... have them re-roll a new char.... they get the skill double time bonus as it is when they start out.the only mistake is lost time... its not the end of the world unless your an obsessive compulsive neat freak.
4/25/2009,i am talking about a year down the road when you have 18mill sp or more and you end up with a skill that you have no use of.
4/25/2009,"i think this would be kind of a cool feature, it will compensate for when ccp nerfs and entire ship/skilltree out of all usefulness and makes millions of skillpoints worthless to have. players shouldn't be penalized when ccp makes a game balance decision.this is probably the best way to alleviate player hurt when ccp does something like this, if i don't see a better alternative if i get elected ill probably try pushing this to see what ccp thinks."
4/25/2009,"i think it is a good idea, especially for the more common skills where everyone(or near enough) must have. like basic nav and gunnery skills. but also it should be like specialized in some area, where people who use laser find laser books in a cheaper place. or minnie cruiser books are generally cheaper in minner areas, out skirts of the region become more expensive/cheaper depending in your going to or going away from where the book is most use to the race. but things those especially hard to find/expensive books shouldn't be able to find in a central areatl;dr its good idea but on a small scale or race/region"
4/25/2009,"seems like a reasonable feature to add, as long as the rarer books are kept on the market in some fashion."
4/25/2009,"can't support this.first off - this is not about the frustration of flying off to some place to get skills i know all to well why that's sucky.secondly.. skill books are ""seeded"" in each region as far as empires.... your not likely to find amarr books in minmatar space.... however you do... why? because players buy them in bulk and sell them on the market.de what you propose would disrupt that mechanic and potentially cause damage to the game economics.not to mention the fact you run into an issue as far as special skills being kicked around by loot drops and other things.and this also makes things just a bit too easy... it would drive up the demand for free injection of skill books.i happen to like the idea of 0.0 pilots having to risk there necks for that titan skill book or that dread skill book.keeps things lively.if you want to get into the rp business... read up on the back-stories... there's one in particular detailing a capsuleer picking up a skill book : o )unfortunately this is something of a price-tag... and if ccp is willing to overlook that or invent a mechanic to compensate... i have to say no.otherwise... yes i like the fact i don't need to fly off to some dark corner for a skill book.but then... you have to do the same thing for your ships... your equipment... materials.skill books would be the first step... people have toyed with ai shipping companies... and yet you get pirates who demand the ability to attack them...etc..etc..this is a can of worms.... need to tread carefully.i'll be more than happy to change my mind if given a strong enough reason."
4/25/2009,"hi there, forum dwellers.this proposal is simple, make autocannons reload as fast as laser crystals and make them keep on shooting until the cargo is empty of ammunition.if you have, say, 2000 bullets in your cargo, the autocannon will empty it's magazine, reload, and keep on shooting without the need to reactivate de module, until there's nothing else to shoot at, that will give back the auto in autocannons."
4/25/2009,why?
4/25/2009,they are called auto cannons because they automatically shoot until the clip is dry. not because they reload automatically.
4/25/2009,ehhh.... i think your confusing the situation op....first off... autocannons are raipid fire cnanons...your comparing them to laser cannons which have no reload.what your probably wanting to ask is the ability to hot swap ammo quickly.laser cannons use a single crystal per cannon.... auto cannons uses a kajillion buwets that must be precisely loaded into there itty bitty wittle slots for pew pew pew action.
4/25/2009,"there somewhere is this mittani tentonhammer article about the first ever titan belonging to lotka volterra, which was obviously an alliance led by a ccp employee. this was before the internal affairs bureau existed and as far as i know (and that's from reading the article), the employee needed to abbandon the character as obviously, one of the rules is that nobody can know you're a ccp employee, and that no ccp employee is allowed to lead an alliance.as for other rules, i don't know. and about insider knowledge: all changes are known to the public before the changes go live, that is the reason why ships quadruple in price when changes are applied to them, because, some ""the broker"" like characters have so much isk at their disposal that they can pretty much control the market.but since that is also pretty much how people can make money in the real world, it's nothing gamebreaking, but just a ""showcasing"" of human nature, where egoism and greed is usually king.and your fear and, i even dare say paranoia, is also a showcasing of another side of human nature, accompagnied by greed and egoism too, of course, but mainly fear of the unknown."
4/25/2009,"i'm not saying what it is now, i'm saying what it was originally thought up as being, which was an anti-corruption organization.this new york times article pre-dates whatever csm manifestos, because it pre-dates everything else officially csm related(being the first serious mention of the csm ive seen mentioned, anyways)"

4/25/2009,"i got a proposal for ccp regarding the csm council, and i wish the csm council to bring it to their attention. i want to be able to vote blank votes during votation, so you could vote in a vacant seat into the csm council if there are no worthy candidates. from what i have seen lately of possible csm candidates i am afraid sooner or later a completely joke candidate might end up being voted into the boards...thx.."
4/25/2009,id support it if i by default get the seat of the blank candidateedit: this is why we ought to remove term limits
4/25/2009,"armour reppers rep at the end of their cycle not the start and as such you need 400 cap just to initially activate them and then wait 11-15 seconds (for large reps) before they repair any damage at all.one of the ideas proposed was to activate them for the same 400 cap but for the repair amount they give to be spread out over the entire cycle time instead of having to wait until the end of it for the benifit.its a reasonable idea and would be make judging if your tank was going to break or hold against incoming damage a lot easier, along with it repairing some of the volley damage done in between the rep cycles by ships with a fast enough rate of fire to get 2 volleys off in between the currant repair cycles."
4/25/2009,"sentry drones like the bouncer ii have a optimal of 60km+42km falloff and are no more than a turret you drop in space.the alteration i would make is there auto aggro range and the range that they can be told to attack a target to be at least the same as their optimal and falloff. obviously if you were controling bouncer ii's for example you would need to be able to lock the target you wish to assign them to attack, but the auto aggro would not need such. you could obviously only give your sentry drones orders if you were within your ships available drone control range.this would have quite a few nice effects, firstly any ship with the ability and space to use a sentry drone would have a effective (ecm proof) auto aggro effect, secondly they would have a assignable counter (if they have the lock range) to ships out to 100+km with the right sentries of course (looks significantly towards the new ecm ranges on the falcon).ps: i saw this on another forum and stole it to post here as i think its a very good idea."
4/25/2009,agreed.we lose tons of drones and take a big hit on our mining yield because our hulk pilot is on a mac and crashes every ten minutes.
4/25/2009,"a: i don't see this problem other than the usual issues i have along with other people who happen to be running 10.5.6 and running nvidia gpu's.however... if your running ati cards/intel gpu or running 10.4 or both then your not going to get support as they clearly say not supported on the minimum requirements.if you are... well then you should max your ram out... and if your still having trouble... well... again i don't have memory leaks here... just a crash on exit which is... well i'm exiting... so yeah.b: ccp can't do anything about drivers... they only use what is available.... drivers are supplied by the manufacturer and or the operating system developer (in this case apple)c: the largest problem is the fact the game is not native... its windows craptastic code being translated to something partially understandable for the mac os-x platform and until ccp get's off there butt and codes the damn thing nativly... not likely to happen unfortunately.don't get me wrong... i support this... but you mac pilots obviously have a very limited view of whats reality here... your view is just eve online... so don't hold your breath if you don't get it.be happy we've gotten this far.... maybe its time you updated your mac hardware?: o ) or just sit tight.... things might get better yet!support regardless.<--- acsp, actc, acmt credentials and i'm not just ranting to be ranting... i know mac i fix mac, i study it... and i'm not happy with some of there ideas but it's better than windows."
4/25/2009,"to drake...first i'd like to address us mac pilots not living in the real world. when it comes to very complicated issues such as a memory leak in the drivers of my card, yes, you are entirely right, i'm not living in the real world. i don't know up from down when it comes to stuff like that, so when i see eve crashing within a half hour of getting into space, i figure it's gotta have something to do with eve.secondly, i can't update my mac hardware because i am running on a macbook. now i'm no rocket surgeon but eve ran perfectly fine on my macbook before apocrypha was released... ccp patched apocrypha... and now if i step out of the station i crash within a half-hour without fail. i understand that ccp works with the materials that they have at their disposal, but why is it so impossible to get a mac specific patch that works?lastly, as for upgrading the memory, i have 4 gigs in this machine. the issue isn't one of ""having enough memory"", it's that the memory ""seems to disappear"". let me give you an example.i can sit for hours on end in the station with no problems at all, but as soon as i exit the station and go into space, ""funny"" things start happening. i notice that eve starts taking up more and more memory until it crashes. i can watch this happen in my activity monitor and it happens every time.so i guess the issue for me really is, that ccp acknowledged a memory leak, and said they fixed it when they clearly did not. and now, we can't viably play the game. like i said, i'm very much not a computer whizz, matter of fact, i'm barely computer literate, but i do know that it worked before and now it does not.as for the issue of eve not running natively on the mac os, i'm not necessarily asking ccp to pull time and resources away from making the game better as a whole to create a native mac client. what i would like to see however, is a response from ccp telling us exactly what the problem is and why everyone tells me it is impossible to fix. like i said earlier eve ran fine before, and i just don't understand why it is impossible for it to run fine again.didn't mean to lace into you by the way drake, but to me buying a new computer is just a terrible option to even think about. i don't have a couple hundred bucks to buy another machine, and as it stands i'm pretty sure that i am unable to upgrade the video card in my macbook. thanks for the time guys, and thank you lavista for at least trying to help us mac users out and bring it more to ccp's attention!"
4/25/2009,"oh, as a side note, i fly drone boats primarily so that's why i'm so agitated. also, apologies for ignorance!"
4/25/2009,i support this idea 100%plus it could help when you have the dreaded lost socket issue (which has been happening less since the last patch)
4/25/2009,shouldnt this be in features and ideas rather than in the assembley hall??or even game development for that matter?
4/25/2009,"currentlly the importance of some moon minerals is none compared to others of same rarity. take for example r64 moons, dyspro/prom vs. neo/thulium. the fix is simple, change some of the t2 components needs so all the minerals of the same rarity have more or less the same weight, you could even make it racial based. the importance of the resources should be based around rarity and not only about distribution, some regions have more r64 than others and this is fien as it promotes strategic objectives for alliances, but some regions have more of one type than others (i.e. fountain, delve). this makes still possible to manipulate/monopolize the resources, but not as easy as now, as it stands by controlling 2-4 regions you can almost control a big part of the t2 market, this makes life much harder for competing alliances (new & old), but if you need to control 6-10 regions across the whole universe it gets much more difficult (but still possible for large coalitions/organziations).p.s: edit for some typossome addition related ideas which have been proposed and talked about allready:- also, hopefully sov will be tied to planets, while industry will be keept around moons, so low-end mining would make more sense.- there should be a possiblity to incap moon mining arrays by decent sized roaming gangs (i.e. 30-men hac fleets)."
4/25/2009,i fail to see the problem/issue and your solution is incredibly hard to find....no support.--isaac
4/25/2009,i dont really feel like nerfing regions that my alliance / allies have just conquered
4/25/2009,"i respectfully beg to differ. as it stands now, and by ccp's own admission, 40% of minerals comes from loot reprocessing. while i don't want to completely make that impossible, it means that if the miners stop mining and start missioning, by and large they will be able to make up for the rest of the mineral requirement by reprocessing their own drops.i'd like a good explanation for why an entire profession has to suffer as a consequence of a game mechanic which makes the profession as good as obsolete.i read arguments against nerfing loot drop reprocessing because it would raise the price of minerals. when i take off my rosy glasses [and squint against the bright light of reality before my eyes adjust to the glare] i see an entire profession having to perform its humble task in ships that barely have the capacity to defend themselves, are open to risk-free harassment, that cannot operate as a solo endeavour in nulsec where the shiny stuff resides.time and again i read about how few people there are in nulsec and how there's basically not much mining there. obviously there is mining, mostly in fleet operations, but the solo miner just doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell. there is no mystery to it. the miner flies a space frame to harvest a commodity in an extremely hostile environment. i don't have a problem with a hostile environment. i have a big problem with the fact that there is no space frame available that is designed to withstand the rigors of nulsec space. [if -anyone- mentions the rorqual as an argument to indicate there is a ship for miners in nulsec, i'm going to scream very loudly].why is it that the combat pilot can now fly a new configuration of combat ship every day of the year without having to fly in the same space frame twice and the miner has exactly -nothing- that will facilitate low security space mineral harvesting?you implore us to see the big picture. how about this perspective? people express reservations about the price of minerals going up if loot drops were nerfed. why would mineral prices go up? because of the fantastic risk associated with harvesting them. you know, basic economics. miners are looked down upon and scorned but the people who do that are not flying ships themselves that are essentially defenceless in an extremely hostile environment where capsuleers fly ships with vast amounts of long-range fire power [which i don't begrudge them, to be clear]. go ask -them- what price minerals would have to trade at to make the enterprise an acceptable risk for them to undertake. i'm willing to bet that no mineral anywhere in eve trades at half the prices they would require.i see people leaving the mining profession because they make more isk missioning. i can't blame them. as it stands now it would be far easier for ccp to remove mining as a profession from the game because they obviously don't care enough about it to provide an adequate environment for the endeavour to thrive.abulurd bonifaceme meceo"
4/25/2009,"as long as the ability exists to use it in empire from people smuggling them in, i'm all for it. while this could potentially cause some balance issues if large amounts of them started arriving in empire, it would boost smuggling a bit. maybe have some new npc that cargo scans miners in a belt every 15 minutes or so to see what kind of crystals are being used and an appropriate fine is levied if caught. regardless, i'm all for boosting lowsec and 0.0. get more people out of empire and let them explore the rest of the game."
4/25/2009,"not supported. if existing ores with similar such mineral yields aren't enough for low-sec miners, why would more of the same make any difference?/ben"
4/25/2009,"the existing ores have entirely different mineral yields - that's sort of the point. the minerals i proposed are worth twice as much as the best lowsec ore that exists right now, and three times as much as the joke that is jaspet."
4/25/2009,"nox and iso aren't dropped heavily in missions, they are dropped i huge amounts in 0.0 loot. so you're adding 0.0 loot, 0.0 superior rocks to the mix.nox is in way over supply atm in game. a lot of this has to do with the last rock adjustments that were introduced to game. prices are also falling because freighters aren't getting ganked in high sec and jump freighters are making ore transportation from 0.0 to empire very easy. simply put, to fix mining, nox and isogen need to be reduced heavily in the supply chain, both 0.0 and low sec rocks."
4/25/2009,supported.and i love the idea of selecting default launch group.probably put that in the right-click menu on a group.

4/25/2009,"fighters do have a drone bandwidth, its the same as heavies, 25 bandwidth. its why the carriers bandwidth is 375 (15 x 25 = 375) (15 being the highest possible amount of drones on a carrier using 5 dcu's) motherships have 625 bandwidth which is 25 drones x 25 = 625. simplest fix is triage mod zero's out the bandwidth on carriers/moms."

4/25/2009,"thank you for the questions. :)well, darius johnson and i have have very different personalities. i would venture to say i'm quite a bit more amicable than him in dealing with people. we both however want to see the game grow stronger whether it is for empire players or those out in 0.0 space. the ""goon agenda"" runs the same as all 0.0 entities for the most parts. we want 0.0 to be (potentially) enjoyable and fun for everyone. of course we want our enemies to ""suffer"" but within the rules of the game and not by cheating. we want to see the game as fair for everyone who plays it and no favoritism shown. i would like to see the high security players have a little more excitement in their gameplay. the great thing about eve that wow (for example) lacks is the capability to be a truly dynamic environment. blizzard pretty much controls everything a wow player gets to enjoy and the players have limited options in terms of doing things outside the box(the designers created.) the ability to have scripted events (which location are generated randomly) would be a great thing for high sec. players who wish to take part would warp to the ""beacon"" that appeared within the system. maybe the use of sleeper ai would be great for this too. after a specific time the beacon would vanish and by the next downtime and uncleared parts of that event are despawned.which breed? labrador retrievers. :)"

4/25/2009,do you think pos sieging and cap ships need to be changed or do you believe they are fine as they are?
4/25/2009,"motherships need to be changed, and the amount of time it takes putting up poses need to be changed. i'd like to figure out some helpful suggestion that would involve reducing the amount of time spent boringly shooting at a pos, but i havent thought of one and i havent seen one good enough."
4/25/2009,"hi, cat here.i feel that it would be prudent to at least try to explain myself at this point. i've held off revealing too much in my forum posts so far, mainly keeping in the 'cat' character. some shrewd folk have already guessed that there is more to cat than meets the eye, but please remember that cat has been a character with a degree of roleplay involved./takes off cat earswhat would make me a good csm member? (eve based)i am actively involved in most facets of eve as a player. currently i help run a successful industrial corporation involved in mining, production, invention, pos's and such gubbins. i'm quite aware of the issues that industrialists are facing, and have a decent base knowledge of this sector of eve.this is the bit that pains me to admit as cat... i am a pvper. i'm a ganker, a deccer, i've podded people who didn't want to be podded... for those that worked out that leaving eve (who talks about his ganking occasionally) was probably a ""cat alt"", yep. i've been a director of a moderately successful pvp corp for a considerable amount of time. i say moderately successful because we take on a lot of new players, and a few unfortunate choices were made with some wts... i still regard this as a positive, as we've helped many new players blossom into pvpers. i am however very familiar with pvp. i will never proclaim to know all about everything, but i think i know something about most at least.this character betrays me, in that i am actually a coherent, social, and understanding person. i've made a whole bunch of friends in this game. heck, i've even had friendly chats with wts while we're busy trying to kill each other.paragraph tl;dr: i've mined, built, researched, invented, ganked, yarr'd, warred, missioned, pirated, anti-pirated, and made friends in the process.what would make me a good csm member? (rl based)my job has a strong emphasis on problem solving and process improvement. if something isn't working as well as it could be, i'm often the one asked to look at the situation. i understand that this is a great balancing act - improve speed/reduce quality, or that adding steps in a process may increase workload but ultimately improve customer service/relations. basically, i understand that every decision on process or policy does have an impact elsewhere, obvious or not. i can see ccps point of view on many things, but as i deal with (generally irate) customers in my own line of work, i fully understand that customers have needs and requirements and that these must be taken into account.standing policiesi'm going to go out on a limb here, and say that i do not intend to bring any of my own grievances into account. i'm not planning on going into a csm meeting screaming to nerf pirates or whatever. that in my opinion, is not really the job of the csm members to force their own issues on the group.i plan to gather up player issues, apply a triage based system, and present them in an appropriate manner. i think my rl experience with customers and business lend themselves to this approach.my point is mainly that i am not here to enforce ideals, but to listen to the crowd. that's what a representative does, right?in closingas stated above, i am generally aware of most arenas of eve. i have decent social skills, and a positive and constructive approach in dealing with people and situations. i honestly feel that i could be an asset to the csm and to the playerbase in general. i'll open the floor now."
4/25/2009,"came expecting one thing, left moderately surprised. i suppose a few questions wouldn't hurt since this post displays a good level of sense.since you've mined, built, researched, invented, ganked, yarr'd, warred, missioned, pirated and anti-pirated, what would you say is your favorite activity to do in eve?what, in your opinion, are the three biggest issues (balance or otherwise) in eve today?risk vs reward in hisec - nerf hisec or boost lowsec/0.0?how did you feel the ecm nerf was handled and is there anything you would have changed?not sure if you have enough experience with 0.0 to answer these, so they go in a separate section:what are your thoughts on pos spam and the 0.0 sovereignty mechanics in general?titans as a fleet ender - with multiple doomsdays becoming fairly common, does anything need to be changed?motherships are in need of some love. what do you think should be done to make them more useful?"
4/25/2009,"some of the most fun i've had in eve has actually been ganking miners in highsec. the reasons are several; knowing i ruined that guys 100m retriever, then the hillarious local talk afterwards. victim then engaged me using his killrights, so i took his 70m caracal off him. smack increased in local, death threats and such, i waited for a wardec that never happened. in the end i dec'd their corp with my 1 man corp. they paid me off before any losses on either side. that was all very fun.i think metagaming is a contentious issue, i can't really think of a solution that would be successful and popular. (reputation score that is applied to the account, not just the character maybe?)noob corps. they're too good a hiding place.i can't think of a third right now. maybe blobs, i'm tentative on that one though.i definitely wouldn't say nerf highsec. the 'carebear' crowd probably contribute significantly to the market. if you made their lives harder, they wouldn't venture into lowsec, but probably jack up prices. i'm certainly not going to be encouraging more expensive ships/mods. i'd say boost lowsec. i think adding random faction navy patrols would be a positive thing here, as it would make a pirates job to gatecamp potentially more difficult (nb: more difficult, not impossible). this security could entice more miners into lowsec. generally, lowsec is more risk than reward. i think the ecm nerf was long overdue. the falcon was previously too powerful due to its range. i like the idea of the scorpion being a brawler. must say though, i don't fly caldari - but my friends do, and they seem to be taking it quite well.my experience with 0.0 is limited, but i have lived there in a couple of spates. i was part of a smaller alliance claiming some space, starting to get sov but then the alliance heads got threats and pulled out - much to my corps dismay. can't effectively answer your question.titans and a ddd are aoe weapons, so their deployment could damage their own fleets? and they're unable to jump for some time after a ddd, which gives the attackers time to assemble a counter fleet. maybe the cyno timer could be increased? again, not my area of expertise, so my opinions here are formed on what i have read, not what i have done.i know less about motherships than i do titans... so i have to pass on this one.-cat"

4/26/2009,"in certain mission hubs in lowsec and nullsec, macro haulers have infested the area in such large numbers that even lowsec pirates cannot contain their numbers. here is my proposal to solve the problem:for all hauling missions with a reward above a certain small amount(so this excludes low level highsec missions), increase the collateral to one million isk or more, and increase the value of the hauled item to equal the increased collateral.pros:-players are now more motivated to drastically reduce the volume of macro hauler abuse- rather then anti-macroers and people who do it for fun, now disrupting these missions will give you a profit. -fewer petitions will waste gm's time-people who successfully complete the mission will not be adversely affected.-relatively easy to implement, rather then introducing new code, ccp just needs someone to go over the mission texts and change some numbers around-boost to piracy! seriously, piracy got hit pretty hard after the value of t2 modules plummeted and a lot of ship value blows up in rigs now. any sort of increasing the income from piracy is a good thing :d-macroers are forced to stick to low profit highsec issionscons: -hauling missions in general will be harder to carry out in lowsec and 0.0. there may be issues with players not wanting to invest in a scout/some muscle/a jumpdrive capable ship in order to complete a mission. i think this issue can be resolved with an ongoing look at re balancing the reward system for hauler missions."
4/26/2009,"supporting with my main, would support with all my alts if it didnt take so much time"
4/26/2009,"as only macros run these missions anything is fine in my book, supported"
4/26/2009,"while only macros do not run these missions, i would say that 99% of the people who run them in low-security space are macroers. most people who are at the keyboard just deny a courier mission if it sends them to low-security space.i do, however, support this measure. while i may run courier missions occasionally (to boost standing, for instance), i do not go into low-security space for it. supported, and championed for the next csm meeting."
4/26/2009,makes a lot of sense./ben
4/26/2009,"i'm normally suspicious of proposals to nerf macroing, because they tend to have huge numbers of unintended consequences, but this one is utterly reasonable. even if macroing wasn't a problem i'd probably support this - high collateral for valuable hauling missions is actually more natural than low."
4/26/2009,booyah
4/26/2009,"this is what i was trying to say, thanks for saying it better."
4/26/2009,"deffinite support, aside from the impact to macros it makes a hell of a lot more sense than the current system."
4/26/2009,"as a minmatar pilot, i firmly support finding a reason to train for my own race's dreadnought rather than a moros."
4/26/2009,"how ever many topics it takes for the issue to get attention from ccp.and it needs to be raised again, and again, until ccp fix it.edit: link to the wiki entry of this issue being raised. note the lack of a vote on it..."
4/26/2009,much support from a future naglfar pilot
4/26/2009,"shameless, hopelessly optimistic bump"
4/26/2009,"100% agree this really needs to be looked at. the nidhoggur is a lot better than it was but its still silly how much more you need to train to be a minmatar capital pilot compared to other races, and your not even better after all that training your actually in one of the worst capitals.i don't see why they don't just pick a tanking for capitals probably shield tanking would be best but i dont care and give the nag 3 arty guns. it would still be underpowered but at least it would take the stupid **** of training torp v and armor tanking for your carrier / dread out of the way."
4/26/2009,this is the second most requested issue on nozh's balance thread
4/26/2009,already raised to ccp during iceland meetingslinkageiii. display account expiration date on character selection screen
4/26/2009,you have my support on that one dude.
4/26/2009,most definitely support this.. corp roles are such a nightmare.. biggest reason i dont actively recruit.edit: forgot to support.. its late here
4/26/2009,you have my support
4/26/2009,as long as it gets here is all that counts and hopefully this might go into one of there meetings rather than some of the other less important things that ive seen go up lately
4/26/2009,i'm not really an expert on dreads but i think it's safe to say that the people who design them are...dreadnoughts: capital ships created for extended sieges of stationary installations.seems to me that you're bringing a trebuchet to a gunfight. =\
4/26/2009,issue was raised during the meeting on iceland in january
4/26/2009,"disagree, but only because i don't see the problem. yes, inactive towers are a problem, but there is a very simple cleaning procedure already available and it's fun.war dec the corp holding the tower. many times there is no response because ""nobody is home"" so to speak. blast the tower into its atomic components and collect any structures (guns, labs, etc.) anchored to the tower.the very least you get is the fun of blowing the tower and you could easily profit if there are other anchored structures. works in high sec as well as low sec.windjammerp.s. or am i missing something within the context of this topic?"
4/26/2009,have you tried to blow up a tower?
4/26/2009,"there were allready two threads on this topic, but they are older than 60 days and closed because of inactivity.so, once again:please nerf local intelall regional chats (system, constellation and region) should have no visible list of players who are in system to prevent easy intel. the probing system can still be used for intel.if this is hard to implement because of some reason, consider just to change the client to not to draw this player list on the screen. so the information is still present in client but hidden from users. abuse by external tools like bacon would still be possible, but could be fixed later.and please nerf local intel soon, not in five years."
4/26/2009,i do not support this :)
4/26/2009,lol try again...no support.--isaac
4/26/2009,"until proper intel-gathering measures are implemented, i cannot support this."
4/26/2009,disagree.
4/26/2009,"i support this. better intell and scanning tools would be nice, but they are not required to make this change work. the local list is a crutch leaned on by far too many pilots for the wrong reasons."
4/26/2009,strongly disagree.utter rubish. once again completely ignoring the realities that miners and other none hunting pilots face on a second by second basis.windjammer
4/26/2009,i wouldnt mind anyone in a cov ops ship to be hidden untill they speak in local at least then i can actully scout covertlybut yea this owuld be welcome to
4/26/2009,"these people could place probes covering the gates and hit the scan button from time to time. it requires some effort and attention, and you dont get it for free. so it 'feels more real'. and best thing is: it will be difficult to place and maintain the probes using a macro program, so macro users are pretty nice screwed and will be hunted down more often.what would be ""proper intel-gathering"" measures for you?the problem i can see here is: we will not get such ""proper intel"" because there is no need atm. and there is no need because of local. but we cannot remove local because there is no ""proper intel"".... causality chain closed.so we will never get rid of fun and atmosphere breaking local untill we accept to live for a while without intel. once local is gone we get better suited and balancable intel tools."
4/26/2009,"""proper intel tools"" would largely duplicate the function of local, without it all being based on a stupid chat channel. one of the more interesting proposals i've heard along these lines(though still very much a first draft) is here, with some modifications i suggested here - empire-controlled space will give players intel access based on standings with the respective empires, player-controlled space will allow poses to anchor scanning arrays that give you intel, and you'll be able to fit some sort of scanner module that gives you the same. it's more powerful than current local, but actually has requirements on use. and i don't regard this as a chicken/egg problem at all, though i will admit that i phrased my above post badly. i don't necessarily want the intel tools implemented before local is nerfed, though some might be, but they will need to be designed first, and ready to go. it should be a general swap of the two, all at once."
4/26/2009,"yet you want effort free kills of ratters and miners. just go ratting, it's about the same level of effort but you get more kills."
4/26/2009,"a few other people have said ""support, but only if the pre-reqs are in the queue"". what happens to the injected skill when i cancel the pre-req that is currently training and start training something else? are you proposing that the skill queue becomes locked once the skill has been injected?"
4/26/2009,the skill would be ejected at the last hanger you had it or something.
4/26/2009,thnx for the support and you got my vote
4/26/2009,"i think he is not talking about relocating skillpoint but deleting them.relocating... good luck pushing that, won't happen lol. half of the subscriptions of eve-o gotta be people playing eve-mon online / paying for ghost training.about deleting sp, as an obssesive compulsive freak i agree lol, so support (gotta delete these ****in lvl1 skills)"
4/26/2009,i know that ccp will never let you just move points from skill to another and i would not support that as it could be abused very easily. however...if for a fee you get the choice of removing all the points from one skill and getting to put half of them into another skill you want. this would make it so that players looking to abuse the system would take a loss for doing it but at the same time give everyone that either made a serious sp allocation mistake or had ccp change a bunch of stuff in a new patch and made a large chunk of their skills worthless get a little something back for it.
4/26/2009,"skill removal would be used by one person in a thousand, but the problems with it would likely outweigh the benefits. skill transferring, though, is a bad, bad idea. there's no cap - just train the new skill you want."
4/26/2009,"no, no support, this goes against everything that eve stands for. live with your ""wasted"" sp.--isaac"
4/26/2009,"a few days wasted training when you are a noob is no big deal in the grand scheme of things, having a sp pool where you can redistribute sp would just be abused (a lot)imho terrible idea"
4/26/2009,then say so... you said when you are new..... last i checked.... 1 year down the road is not new.regardless... the answer is still no... end of discussion.and if your that ocd over it... you should take a break from eve and get some fresh air.
4/26/2009,i believe the key word you keep missing here is in the long run within the original post but being that this is a proposal i came in here knowing that it was possibly getting shot down as it did so no big deal. anyway thnx for everybodys view and this post can be deleted
4/26/2009,the key word is sticking to the context.you say new people and then you say in the long run and then you say 1 year.that is a contradiction. the longest (single level) skill i've trained so far is a month... i would like to think someone who is training would know that training a skill that takes that long would be damn sure its what he/she wants.i get what your trying to say... but your grounding your reasoning with contradictions.
4/26/2009,"some time ago, there was an unspecific discussion about farmers. as a side effect fathim maidires came with a simple but efficient solution which can be used to fight macro miners and macro ratters. i want to bring it up againt for concrete discussion here:this simple technology is called captcha, you can read more about how it works on wikipedia here:"
4/26/2009,"something must be done, that part with mining license isnt bad"
4/26/2009,"1) good quality macros can read captcha, and rtm shops have professional programmers;2) having to input a captcha occasionally is a bother, having to input them every 10 mining laser cycles is the fastest way to ensure that only macros will mine;3) this is a game, what you propose will remove the fun from mining;4) even if you think differently ccp is constantly evolving the anti macro systems, exactly like the sweatshops are constantly evolving the macro they use. so an emergency hotfix like you are suggesting will do nothing that is not already done every patch. and you have used exactly the right phrase to define the use of this application: no, i don't want my game to be plagued by a message bothering me constantly.even more ""fun"" is the idea that you want to use it against macro ratting. so a captcha every 10 shots by your guns? it would really make the game enjoyable. please explain how you think to avoid people spamming captcha to you in combat so that you can't do anything. it would became at who is the fastest at spamming captcha against a enemy and disabling him."
4/26/2009,hahahahaha no.
4/26/2009,"indeed, good point not to rely on it. on the other hand, the captcha can be enhanced and upgraded frequently when it's transmitted from the server and not generated in the client. it causes much more work on rmt shop side than on ccp side. for private macro users it causes they need an update for their macro tool each time the captcha was changed.it should not be used often. some macros run over night. if you are in a belt and you get one captcha every 3-4 hours so it does not stop you from mining. but the guy with the macro gets income cut down because his macro cannot run the whole night/day/whatever any more.do you know more? would be nice if you could supply some links for further reading.nah, that would be crazy. the captcha request should be rare enough to not to hurt the normal player.hehehe no no. that button should request a captcha check for yourself. you would use it, for example, if you are mining, your hauler alt is full, and you want to alt-tab to it and bring the ore to the station. then you request a captcha on your mining char so he will be not distrubed by a random one while you are underway with your hauler.in no way there should be a mechanism to force a captcha request on someone else in such a way. risk of abuse like you described would be extreme. but your idea to request captcha's on other ppl isnt that bad. it should only be possible in special situations and not just in time but delayed.are captcha's really not worh the effort, not even for a test run on sisi? they are relative easy to implement. a test run for mining in high sec would allready be fine to see its potential and to give feedback what's acceptable and what's annoying."
4/26/2009,"no, insulting and annoying your players in a futile attempt to stop macroing is generally a bad idea."
4/26/2009,"it could be roleplayed in a nice way.for example, while mining, an agent warps in and contacts you. he asks for your mining license. once you legitimate yourself (by that captcha), he tells you he is happy to find you because he is in trouble and asks you to mine away a small but more valuable belt than you have now for him. so you get a mining mission with a real ore belt, spawned for you. and because you are a real miner and not a macro you now have the chance to get some bucks more than you would get when staying where you are.what would happen to the macro, which fails to legitimate its mining license? shall navy spawn and gank him? standing loss? or nothing? this should be discussed."
4/26/2009,you have the two dumbest threads in this forum.
4/26/2009,pretty much what he said. quit copying lasers....--isaac
4/26/2009,"most real autocannons that fire two different types of ammo (ap and he for example) are open-bolt and have a dual ammo fed system, which allows them to instantly choose which type of ammo to shoot. now i don't have any real-life lasers to look at for comparison, but i would imagine that changing the lasing crystal would be a much more involved process for a laser cannon than simply flicking a switch to choose which ac shell will be selected when you pull the trigger and the bolt slides forward to chamber it. i support the idea. artillery should be handled the same way as well, as by definition they don't have any magazine; shells are loaded into the weapon one at a time."
4/26/2009,this is not real life... this is eve online.
4/26/2009,"after a few answers, i see that nobody comes up with a reasonable argument of why it is not a good idea.first off, i know autocannons are not lasers, nor blasters. they have a reduced dps compared with them and they work for the most part in falloff range. granted, you have more damage types to choose from, but that has also it's drawbacks, like even more reduced dps. the same goes to artillery, but its even worst, as reloading time plays a big factor on them."
4/26/2009,just because no one comes up with an argument doesn't mean your getting support.
4/26/2009,how about you don't vote at all if your not satisifed.a blank vote is a pointless and useless vote.... not to mention a waste.
4/26/2009,that has already happened a few times tho.
4/26/2009,"not voting is letting the ""l33t"" people decide. those who dont care about the well being of eve online. a blank vote is a vote! something ccp needs to account for when counting the votes! while not voting at all means... well, that you dont care anough about eve to consider who sits in this board!i know many who are well suited for this job, but cant or wont run for different reasons. and i know many who wants to run just for the fun of it! or for the joke of it! ccp cant say ""no"" to someone who has been elected i think. even a joke candidate. but i want us players to have this choice! now, i know that this time there are at least a few that is well suited for the ""job"". and i know how to vote this time! but what for board session nr. 4? or 5? what about session nr. 6? i hope ofcource we will have good people all the time! that is what we the players and ccp are hoping for! but i dont think it would hurt at all to have the option to give a blank vote if there is noone you like?or is there something i dont have considered when it comes to voting blanks?"
4/26/2009,"i'd be in favour of people being able to decline ballots, as a show of ignorance/disapproval, but electing blank seats is pointless."
4/26/2009,"that is the same thing at least from the voters perspective.the goal is not to necessarily create an empty seat, but rather make it known that none of the potential candidates were to your liking; that is the goal correct?so there needs to be a ""none of the above/abstain"" amongst the voting options. if 50% of the votes for some reason are ""none of the above/abstain"", then there is something wrong that needs to be addressed. you still get a full csm out of the other 50% of the votes.please remember; when you ""support this topic"" it is supporting the overall idea and discussion going on and not just the op's idea."
4/26/2009,it's not the same thing.a nota or abstain is not a blank vote. it's literally as it says.what your proposing would leave an empty seat with an invitation to someone else as opposed to blocking.i'm with hersch however.... nota/abstain is much better.
4/26/2009,"so do you ""give your support to the idea/discussion going on""?nota/abstain being part of the discussion."
4/26/2009,no.... not to the op's idea.but to hersch's idea? yes.
4/26/2009,"for me its ""important"" that only those who seriously considering doing a good job as a csm wins the election, and not a joke candidate. in a real world election most people know what is at stake. taxes for instance. but in a game? someone might take the oportunity of just running for csm with a joke goal: making eve into an another wow for example. and someone might see the fun and just vote on it for the heck of it! simply because they dont care! now, thankfully ccp dont have to listen to the csms, and continue their business as usual anyway. but that seat is now for the next six month filled with an half wit! i dont care if the seat is filled by goon, bob, ra or even an npc corp player! just as long they intend being serious about what they do, and have a serious agenda!hersch's idea looks good too i guess. for me the ""important"" thing is that at least ccp sees the risk. and so does the players.regarding leaving an empty seat... i would rather have an empty seat, than filled by an half wit with a joke agenda."
4/26/2009,"i think worrying about joke candidates is rather unnecessary - i don't necessarily like all 15 of the people elected thus far, but none of them have been especially whimsical about it. looking at this race, not all the candidates have announced yet, and there's at least half a dozen who will win almost guaranteed and who are serious, respectable folks. i favour the ability to decline a ballot mostly because it mirrors standard democratic practice, and to a lesser extent to drive up voter turnout a bit for pr purposes, not because i think that there's a pressing need for a ""you all suck!"" option on the ballot."
4/26/2009,"make the skill queue account wide, meaning that any character on the account can append skills to the queue within the current time limits.the skills of the other characters could then show up on the queue with a red tinge."
4/26/2009,sounds reasonable as it would not be a breaking type of mechanic...... and its within the rules of the current system.prob is... api key data-stream..... not sure if ccp can pull it off.but i can dig it.
4/26/2009,"actually, i just logged onto the forum planning on submitting this issue, since i've had some annoyances with training alts lately. yes, definitely supported - better cross-account skill management would be very nice."
4/26/2009,"4000+ people asking the same questions all the time, between spam and people asking but not listening makes it very hard to make anything out of it. making it race or region based should cut down the number of people there considerably."
4/26/2009,good idea.it was hard to get coherent responses as the posts and spam flew buy.
4/26/2009,"the concern i have is isd coverage - it tends to seem like there's only one isd in the channel at a time, so if it were split you wouldn't have isd to answer questions all the time unless they got a bunch more of them. if that can be dealt with, i'd favour splitting the channel to make it move slower."
4/26/2009,"bring back the nice litle recoil animations we had pre apoc they were very nice imho, made capital guns looks way cooler, ccp please add it in the options, if i am mistaken please, somebody, tell me"
4/26/2009,supporting my own suggestion ofc
4/26/2009,"as topic says, currently each account can take three characters where many other mmo with simmilar character based system can offer more character slots than we have in eve. proposal is to add one slot more for each of yours and your friends account. good thing for a cyno/market/scout alts or everything else you need. of course only one character can be trained."
4/26/2009,supporting this great idea
4/26/2009,/signed
4/26/2009,so you are proposing the 4th character for free where now people pay for them? don't see it likely to be implemented.
4/26/2009,"other mmos have more character slots because they have limits on what one character is capable of. if you could spec into every class in wow at once, i'd wager they'd have a lot fewer character slots for you to use. also, even if this was a good idea, it wouldn't be worth bringing up, because ccp will never nerf their own income stream like that."

4/26/2009,signed
4/26/2009,"alpha's only matter on passive shield tanks, that is what is missing in this argument. when you lose shield hp's your ship will auto regen them based on a formula. that formula breaks strength around 25% shield capacity. so while you were at 30% you may have been regenerating a huge number of hitpoints, below 25% you are generating hardly any at all. that is why alpha's matter in this case, the faster you get them below that point the sooner their tank is broken.armor tanks have no such mechanic and as such the alpha only affects whether they die now or after the next cycle. what is being proposed here would have two positive effects, neither of which would be substantial enough to matter. the first would be slightly longer cap stability since cap works the same way as shields and you would be eating it more gradually, removing your own ""alpha"" of your cap. the second would be that any active repping ship could potentially avoid being blown up for a few additional seconds over what it would take now.lets think about this, if you are going to get blown up before the end of the next rep cycle then a few extra seconds isn't buying you anything. i like the idea of trying to bring active tanking up a bit to match better with passive tanking but this suggestion does very little to accomplish it.as was pointed out, right now you can cap boost and burn that whole boost on repping before it gets neuted away and wasted. the suggested change might favor passive cap regen mods a bit more but they would still both be items on a loss mail."
4/26/2009,no support. bad idea and sentry drones shouldn't work like this. --isaac
4/26/2009,this is what drone range extenders are for. giving them this huge of a buff really can't be justified.
4/26/2009,drone extenders are for extending the range you can control them at by 20km per unit not the range they can hit at.if a sentry drone has a natural optimal and falloff of 80-100km it should be able to fire at ships within those ranges or what is the point of having those ranges in the stats?.i like this idea as it gives any ship with the ability to use a sentry to have a med range low dps option in its hold.
4/26/2009,i like it.
4/26/2009,"it's the same as any other ship that fits long-range guns but can't target to their maximum range. a rokh fitting 425s and spike can hit to 194+30, but can only target to 112.5 - people don't ask ccp to double its lock range, they fit sensor boosters. besides, even without fitting modules, it's quite possible to get a natural control range of 85 km(max-skill ishtar), which makes use of all the natural range any of the sentries have."
4/26/2009,"memory leaks are not a csm issue, they're a technical issue. wrong forum."
4/26/2009,1: to your first statement: i never meant it to say your living in a delusional state. i'm saying that most pilots are stuck in the sense that eve is all they see when in fact your not dealing with eve.... your dealing with the ####y code called windows architecture that is being duct taped and tied together with spit and bailing wire and just barely pulling it off. those who don't have the legitimate background (unlike some people who rant and rave about things they obviously have no knowledge in) tend to go off the walls and ignore details that answer there questions.odds are the memory leak is not eve related.... but caused by the translation engine. windows is a total idiot and jackass when it comes to memory management... and that is a bit of a problem when your dealing with a mac platform lording over it. it will do the stupidest things when it comes to memory. and as such ccp may never be able to be rid of it.2: odds are that your macbook gave a false impression. eve may appear to be running fine on my mbp here... but watching the console logs says otherwise. while i may not crash (knocks on wood) or have this memory leak show up... its frakking around when it shouldn't be... and if i really push it hard.. it does become unstable. since you can't upgrade it... you run into a problem... your pleas will be ignored due to the fact that your likely running outside of ccp's minimum requirments as i outlined.they did not officially declare the intel gpu's or ati gpu's as supported hardware.... yet several pilots have managed to pull it off... but not without alot of problems.ccp reserves the right to say no to anyone outside the declared boundaries. it's not fair... it sucks.... but its a fact... and they probably did that for the fact its alot less frustration to code the fixes for it.is it impossible to patch? no... but that depends on where the problem is.... again.... your talking about windows... a piece of #### platform that is nigh impossible to predict and control. you fix a few dozen problems...and a half dozen show up... as evidenced by the last patch.and those same problems show up in native windows platforms too... just not so obvious and burried by vast amounts of virtual memory and other head for tail os crap.3: your computer is having to deal with the new shaders kicked in... if you don't have the current hardware required to run the game... you can't blame ccp for the problem.so your memory leak may not be a memory leak... more likely a gpu run away error. and as i 've said before... windows is as dumb as a brick when it comes to that. and when you emulate windows... you get the idea. run away processes cause memory leaks... just a hell of a lot faster than youd expect a leaky process to cause.4: native would fix all of the above..... removing windows from the equation forces the software to obey the rules of the os along the standards set forth... giving the kernel control and not cider translating information to the kernel. removing the middle man makes it nice... but that means rewriting the game to do it... not likely to happen. they would rather patch the problem and move on. that could change however... os-x 10.6 is coming.it's ok... i get alot of flak for being a pain in peoples side.... but they also know that i'm right 9 times out of 10... and it really irritates the hell out of them.and i'm not so polite about it either.you should plan on replacing your hardware regardless... because i can easily predict you will not see results for a good long with snow leopard on the horizon.... ccp could permanently lock out outmoded hardware.and it is well within there rights to do so.feel free to eve mail me... maybe i can figure out what you got going on.
4/26/2009,"yeah i agree, i trained t2 large proj simply coz i like the muzzle flash and i liked how the tempest looked, ofc a week after i finished large auto spec 4 they change all the effects to the new crappier ones."
4/26/2009,"i'm not talking about nerfing nothing, only every moon mineral with certain rarity should matter to a point and not only a couple of them. anyway i obviouslly don't see how anyone on pl would agree with me lol, but csm is for balancing the game (amongst other things), not pushing your own agenda.isaac do you think it should be possible to control a big part of the economy just controlling 3-5 regions? there are more than 40 0.0 regions so... i'm not talking about changing moon distribution, neither the mechanics behind mineral rarity, just adjust it.as for the fix, there is not any complexity on it, you only need to run a simple spreadsheet and can be done in minutes, then you adjust t2 components composition and that's about it."
4/26/2009,"wow, that made absolutely no sense. lots of words thrown together. i'm totally confused by what your saying and what the issue is. btw, live with the fact that super-alliances exist, this will not change that problem. --isaac"
4/26/2009,"i wasn't aiming at you there and i wish you luck on your endeavour, that is to say suicide ganking salvagers."
4/26/2009,"ahh, you must mean advanced salvaging (rank 15) right? must take months to train that up.i don't read guides. it's like cheating at solitaire. actually, you're right. i don't scan, but from what i understand you use directional scanner first. why would you probe a ship with no wrecks around it?clearly i meant t2 drones and faction ammo.so now that the mentally deficient have had their say, anyone else wanna share their opinions?"
4/26/2009,"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.-------reasons why :1) ninja salvaging is a de-facto profession2) the 1 in 1000 times that someone actually scans you down and salvages your stuff (in a hostile manner) is not a good enuff reason to nerf an entire profession3) some of us actually ninja salvage in a non-hostile manner, ie make bookmarks, come back later, see if the guy bothered to salvage his stuff, i see the business as more of a ""scavenger"" than hi-sec pirating.setting me to flashy red for scavenging wrecks that ppl leave to rot is discouraging and not fun.4) l4 missions in hisec have no downside as it is, and i say this as someone who does l4's in hisec. if someone invades my deadspace 1 in 1000 times or even 1 in 100 times i'm not gonna freak out, quite frankly half the time i don't salvage anyway.i don't mind other people sipping from my stream once in a while, so please stop freaking out if i sip from yours.it's so difficult to get human interaction out of eve, sometimes you almost have to grief someone to get them to say hi and most of the time they just curse at you for being personally inconvenienced.it's a game. a game. you know ""tra la la"" makebelieve wonderland. so what if someone salvages your wreck, why do you even care, just get another mission and kill more million isk rats, you're not gonna run out of money by making %15 less income for 1 hour in your life."
4/26/2009,"as previously stated earlier in the thread, xavier hayes is running for csm! can you please add name to list? i'll post weblink and thread link shortly :)cheers,xavier"
4/26/2009,"i believe the drone ui needs a lot of love. i'm not entirely sure of the best way to address it but i have some ideas. having the name of what they're aggressed on would be a big help, for one. next there needs to be better notification when they're targeted by a hostile so you can start reacting before they start taking damage. their distance from you, and their target's distance would be nice in that ui. it doesn't need to be cluttering up the overview which is enough of a mess when there are drones all over the battlefield. the ai really needs some help. any ability ccp can add for controller to give the drones scripted instructions would rock. ""if you start taking damage: evade."" i don't mind this question at all. in fact i'm rather open about my disability and welcome any inquiries concerning it. i've been to ccp hq twice now. once during fanfest 07 week and second time during fanfest 08 week. both times the reason for my visit is winning the ""office tour auction"" ccp ran to benefit the child's play charity. :) they were very accommodating both times, especially considering a few ccp employees helped me get up a spiral staircase in the office because the elevator was down due to construction."

4/26/2009,"then he can reply when such activities aren't occupying him and if he is not prepared to do so then he shouldn't be running for csm. a candidate whom refuses to, or cant make time for discussion with other players (outside of take care, i should hope he has broader horizons than that and wants to take the pulse of as many walks of life in eve as possible) is a poor candidate indeed. if this is the case perhaps another representative of take care should be runing.erik is running for csm, whatever spin is possible to put on the issue he is the csm candidate and take care is a think tank, focus group or quango if you prefer. on the day erik will have to decide what issues to raise and those he chooses to do so will be given a spin all of his own.as laudable as you efforts to reply for him, or for take care are, erik needs to engage with his electorate in discussion."
4/26/2009,"hello everyone. a brief note of support for take care and the election of their candidate, erik, to the csm. you folks are doing an excellent job looking out for the entire eve community. thank you. if i may be of some assistance to you, do let me know. cheers!"
4/26/2009,/me waits for erik to answer her questions.
4/26/2009,"thank you, guys, for all the praize.one quality of mine is that i, usually, take my time to carefully craft posts. just as i would do to prepare a meeting with the csm or ccp. this does usually take two hours or more. and i am doing this, because my answers are aimed at all my voters, as much as i am addressing your questions in this thread. as you have mentioned yourselves, take care has built a pretty consistent image in the past two terms, thanks to eva. and this will not change with me as a csm.that i have one account only and a real life as a business process consultant might be a second quality. for some at least. and those with two or more accounts may assess for themselves, how much time they would have for activities like checking forum and other players' opinion in order to prepare a csm meeting. no pun intended.as take care, we do have the time for this. because eva and i work closely together and debate the issues at hand. hence, you will also see a lot of ""eva"" in issues we select and solutions we support. naturally. and her experience both with the game and how the csm works are highly valued ! thanks to our combined effort, i will be able to start into work of the csm directly. and i can be on business trips during the week and still support your most favourite solutions towards other csms and ccp on the saturday meetings.the two-term restriction is not bypassed by take care. any election will see the best arguments win. i am sure that this election, just as any other, will see most votes on the candidate who is the better organized one. to the candidate who best knows to network. who thus will best know what the pressing issues are. if alliances are putting up a candidate or two, it is up to you to decide, if you want to support the power-block with your vote or rather an association of real-life people who want to build the better game.all specific issues which you bring up, we will treat as part of the currently running csm term of eva, or i can take them into another term of take care, if you vote for us. it would be sad, were your issues lost in this thread, now would it not ?p.s.: i'm a cat person (british short hair) but else it would be a doberman."
4/26/2009,bumping is best ping (unless it's humping)vote vuk
4/26/2009,"well sure, a rep should be listening to what is being proposed/discussed by the playerbase - but i really think they should have a list of topics that counts as their own agenda as well.in csm-1, jade constantine got my vote. she presented a list of issues that she intended to bring to ccp, and most of them (but not all) were things i agreed with. sounded good to me.in csm-2, i voted abstain. no candidate put forward a platform of ideas that piqued my interest. (i voted abstain, instead of just not voting at all, to demonstrate i had seen what everyone had to present and didn't care for any of it). lots of good people ran; none really stood for anything, though. (my opinion, obviously)honestly, i'm not going to vote for a candidate who doesn't present an agenda of their own, openly and honestly. i expect that from a candidate. it's great that you intend to listen to all the proposals/issues that get brought up in assembly hall, but that should not be exclusive of what your own thoughts and proposals are.when i look at the winners of csm-3, i want to be able to look at the list of names and say, ""oh yeah, i voted for pilot-x 'cos they said they would bring up issues x, y & z - things that i care about"".of course, ""things that i care about"" might be very different from what other pilots consider to be important (lolrp), but i want to know that there's someone in there who represents me... and i need to know that before i vote. i want someone in there who will take care of what i consider important, without me having to lobby incessantly on forums to get their attention. i'd rather log into my internet-spaceship and blow things up, knowing that a candidate is working on it already on my behalf so i don't have to.yup, you do have to listen to the proposals & issues as they come up, but you gotta actually stand for something yourself as well.p.s. please draw me a pic of a cyclone blowing up an evil slaver.

4/26/2009,"well istavaan hit the dust for undisclosed reasons, apparently he did something bad, presumably winding up a bear the list of c&p votable candidates is getting smaller and smaller."
4/26/2009,ffs...just as i was getting really excited and looking forward to voting i see that you are disbarred from standing
4/26/2009,please go away.
4/26/2009,really not necessary. i'll send you the questions.
4/26/2009,as a candidate i too would like to participate in your interviews.
4/26/2009,"i see candidates that appeal to the pvp crowd and those described in the thread title in many areas of the forums and in game, entering into discourse with a great swathe of players from many backgrounds in eve and experiencing many areas of the game and its community- most of which they personally disagree with.i would like to encourage those csm candidates for whom lowsec is a scary place full of (probably sociopathic) -10's, those that promote a platform for discussion that centers on the industrial or pve and those who present a manifesto lacking in changes to pvp aspects of the game or matters of importance to the groups mentioned in the subject to.....come and talk to us!there is a vast, largely untapped demographic awaiting you. many of these people only read certain areas of the forum or only participate in narrow areas of the eve community, they are under represented and a powerful voting force.those csm candidates wishing to embody the democratic nature of the csm would do well to talk to players of all backgrounds.with that in mind, i urge you to lay your eyes on c&p or to give it its full name, crime and punishment.what does c&p want to see from the csm and you as a prospective candidate is a question you might ask yourself. go and ask them."
4/26/2009,"imo the crime profession is valid and has a permanent place in eve.disagreements are mainly about what and where that place is.imo the only buff lowsec needs is an interbus courier system, because logistics in lowsec is such a pain in the rear.other than that i think it's great. nice rats. decent ore. npc stations. sporadic pvp that gives the defender the advantage. what else could you want?only thing really hindering lowsec is the difficulty in replacing ships and equipment, you basically have to be in an organized pirate corp to get supplies, otherwise you end up having to make 20 jumps to buy a shield booster.at first an interbus service would be a boost to pirates, but in the long run it will encourage anti-pie corps to settle in lowsec, which means more fights for pirates, and safer freight lanes for bears."
4/26/2009,"yes drones have been neglected for awhile. where's those salvage drones they had planned?what really annoys me is when you dc your drones are left behind to get popped by npc's until you log back in and try to reclaim them. and if you happen to have been in the last room of ae your pretty much screwed. i think this unfairly treats players in a situation thats beyond there control. if ammo disappeared in a persons ship when they dc'd they'd been screaming at ccp.i know previous csm's brought this to the attention of ccp and suggested idea's like being able to reconnect to your wayward drones when you logged back in but ccp's excuse was that it might create more server load. also not much of a solution when you have to start a mission from the first gate again.so how about if when you dc, npc's don't target your drones unless they had done so already before you dc'd and they would be left alone until you returned to retrieve them. ccp would be happy cause the drones would still be floating in space so someone could come along and steal them. (the developers seem to like that stuff). it wouldn't make and difference if your in pvp. something else i think ccp would like. and it should reduce server load. wouldn't have to have the server wasting cycles running the npc's trying to pop the drones.just one of the many ideas i would like to present to the guys at eve."
4/26/2009,"3 mil in drone skills heredrones are great in both pve and pvp, imo they warrant no buff. could maybe use better ai.thank youc7"
4/26/2009,"drones ftw!i'm your candidate- i use drones all of the time, totally agree that they need work on overview etc. generally, a great weapons system although you need to know what you are doing with the ship setup, due to tanking reqs etc. em drones could definately do with love. i'd also like to see some inprovements/variations on e-warfare drones.xavier hayes"

4/27/2009,"/signedmissiles was too much nerfed. ccp must ""less nerf"" it a few to correct them, without have to remove the tank capacity of afterburners.they just have to change a few the formula to make primary the signature radius, instead of the velocity like it is today. velocity should be at second place. with that, we will be able to shoot the same type of ship than us at real damage."
4/27/2009,"not signed. adapt or die.twas said to me that i had to adapt or die when several nerfs pwned my setups and skill distribution.coincidentally, the minmatar have ships that, of all things, rely on split weapon systems between the supposedly fail missiles (i have no problem in a huginn or phoon) and the projectiles-which have the lowest dps, poorest tracking, lowest clip size and so on and so on, for the nominal plus of not requiring cap.......so yeah. deal with it and stop being such whiney little b*tches"

4/27/2009,"you have my support tigerclaw, i think there are several things in the corp/alliance stuff that needs to be addressed and maybe rethought a little."
4/27/2009,"if i remember right, this was already raised and the conclusion was that ccp could add in onlining queues for pos modules, but anchoring queues would be hard to implement, and that's where it stopped? how about this:-decrease anchoring duration of pos modules to a few seconds long or so, so people can put things in place uninterrupted-increase the onlining time of each pos module equal to the amount of anchoring time that was just taken away-implement onlining queue"
4/27/2009,whee
4/27/2009,"why patch a broken system, when what it needs is a total overhaul?also, queues for pos stuff is bad in my opinion. the reason why there is an anchoring/online timer, is too increase the barrier to entry for putting up a pos.putting in a queue removes the majority of that barrier. hence, it's no good."
4/27/2009,"tell that to the pos managers that have to tend to a stupid pos every ten minutes for five hours. people don't want the barrier to be how much boredom you have to put up with. the pos system has been overhauled enough, it doesn't need another complete overhaul.the delay in time is still necessary to prevent people from putting up instant deathstars. this retains the time delay, without chaining a human being to it. there's already a hard 5-pos limit for alliances, and during pos wars large alliances usually max it out anyways- soul destroying has never been a real barrier to space video game players. stront timing, fueling, and defending still have to be done normally and they are still perfectly legitimate barriers to pos spammage.if you don't take out the soul destroying aspect of pos managing people will keep doing it anyways because their ceos push them to, and they'll stop when they quit the game. hating the game shouldnt be an element of the game."
4/27/2009,"linkagealready brought to csm, passed the voting and forwarded to ccp."
4/27/2009,spiffy :3
4/27/2009,"i beg to differ.please tell me why that a pos overhaul is the single most requested feature towards the csm for the last 12 months?i agree. poss are soul destroying. but that just goes to show that they basic concept is not well designed, seeing as a needed barrier to entry makes it want to stab yourself after just a small amount of time.the pos system is a legacy system which was added very early on in the game. anybody in the software business will know that legacy code is expensive to maintain. as such, chances are that a complete overhaul is the answer in the long run.and ccp having agreed to a complete overhaul of the sov system, i can't imagine poss playing a large role in the future.with poss not going to be the method of claiming sov, onlining large amounts of poss won't be required. that makes this issue rather redundant."
4/27/2009,"ok i should elaborate on what my intentions are. i am looking for the smallest possible changes one can make to the game, that produces the biggest return on investment, and i try to use that rule when i think of stuff to post here. i could say ""overhaul poses"" but unless i have an elaborate plan for a new game for eve to play instead of poses online, then i need to come up with concrete solutions based on the current system or i am just wasting my time.i do not think ccp are going to do a complete pos overhaul after putting so much work into our sov1,2,3,4 system, re-working the way pos modules can be manned and placed outside pos shields, and anything else they did to support those features.honestly i really cant think of a less worse system for holding sov then poses. one of the big things about eve is how players can take and hold space. markers need to determine who owns this piece of space, and it needs to be hard enough to remove so that you dont have wildly fluctuating tracts of space. if poses are replaced with something else that something else will take a long time to remove and replace as well. i think this issue is really more a fundamental issue of the game, when opposing forces can assemble a huge force while the other is asleep, and different alliances can rule different timezones."
4/27/2009,"if there was such a role, people in holding corps for alliances would not need to hand out director roles to everybody just to get the standings setting work done. the disbanding of band of brothers was funny the first time, but its really a sign of a broken game mechanic when ceos are forced to give more permission then necessary just to get necessary things done, just because the necessary roles are all bundled together with unnecessary ones. also, this change should not be retroactive"
4/27/2009,"i was pretty surprised this option didn't exist when i was setting up permissions for my corp.it seems like a lot of permissions given out have to be given with broader roles then i would have preferred, so this is just one part of the bigger issue."
4/27/2009,supported.
4/27/2009,got my vote.
4/27/2009,"corp roles need a massive overhaul, but this is a good start."
4/27/2009,"i think something does need to be done. i like the idea of them ""decaying"" over time.how about a high level skill like ""unanchoring"" allowing you to unanchor something that is offline? or maybe a corporation theft / hacking skill, where you can break into a pos / corp hangar in space that is offline, allowing you to fuel up a pos that no belongs to you, or simply have a look whats in the corp hangar.."
4/27/2009,"i like a combination of these two solutions: 1 - make them degrade over time, so that a neglected tower can be destroyed by a smaller and smalller force over time2 - make them hackable so they can be stolen"
4/27/2009,declare war. shoot tower. win. not supported.
4/27/2009,"this has also become more common in worm-hole space when a corp manages to ""lose"" their tower when worm-holes unexpectedly close. not sure from personal experience, but i suspect that it's also harder to bring in the necessary firepower to blow a tower up in wh-space ... rather then having them simply removed after a month of inactivity, i like the idea of somehow letting them have a value of sort to whatever enterprising pilot can come along and un-anchor, hack or take over these abandoned towers."
4/27/2009,abusing contracts as corp/alliance market replacement is really awkward.
4/27/2009,"i'd prefer to make corp contracts easier to use than implementing this. the functionality exists, but the interface could be better. that said, a separate marketplace isn't the answer."
4/27/2009,"i'd use the thumbs down checkbox if i had one.definitely not supported. i had a list of reasons why this is an obviously terribad idea, but i doubt the op would understand."
4/27/2009,"you don't want local? go to w-space!current problems:1, probing in pvp is only usefull to find carebears in plexes and such. you can not probe ships without an expanded probe launcher (220 tf). it should be the other way around.2, hit the scan button from time to time? you have to be very very lucky to find a force recon, bomber, or any ship using cov-op cloak which is visible for like 1 second during an op taking hours.3, carebear ships have virtually no chance agains pvp ships, espetially miners and haulers.4, show me the risk in this situation for the pvpers: carebears mining/ratting in system. single pvper cop-op with covert cyno sneaks into system and checks out the targets (no local, ship cloaked = no way to know for the carebears), pvper opens covert-cyno his gang jumps in in bombers/recon, ect.. (no local, ships cloaked = no way to know for the carebears). pvpers own the carebears.proper intel gathering suggestions: 1, auto reloading ship scanner2, fof(friend or foe) or fou(fried or unknow) identification when using probes or ships scanner.3, long ago i suggested proxi sensors/probes: you drop probe like a mobile disruptor buble that automaticly relays you info about any ship passing through it's scan range(200 km)."
4/27/2009,i'm pretty sure that ccp are already working on this and the holdup is more to do with designing a viable active intel replacement than anything else.
4/27/2009,"not supported.no alternative means for gaining similar-level intel. pos-scanners of some sort (that fill local for those who have enough high standing) could work, if they not tie it to sov (think about npc regions), but they would also give defenders a significant advantage.you ""delayed-local-everywhere"" guys play this game with local minimized, right?it could backfire, you know. how many times do you look at local without noticing it?"
4/27/2009,"not supported.nerf of local would make indeed eve 'more real'.problem : reality is not fun, and more a game become real, more he become harder, so less fun. a game must be a good compromise of difficulty and effort to please everyone, and local permit it.local is fine, period."
4/27/2009,infallible local intel tool ruins any pretense at stealth.
4/27/2009,"definetly needed. having local as an intel tool really makes no sense at all, mineing and ratting groups should just use their directional scanners combined with combat probes and actual scouts on gates. 1 combat probe dropped at max range (a few spread around system if the system is too big) will inform you of any new ships that appear."
4/27/2009,"having experienced the adrenaline rush of hunting for and being hunted in the local channel free environment of wh space, i fully support this implementation across at least 0.0, if not all of eve. there are the aforementioned problems assosiated with the resisdents of the systems struggling to get intel, but it is a two sided coin. this game is ultimately about teamwork and time and time again it has been proven that the side that works together best prevails. if this means better use of scouting and intel gathering so be it. in 0.0 this could include the use of tactical bubbles to slow down the approach of the enemy giving time to assess their numbers. i think there should be the facility while docked in station to switch to an external station camera to see what is outside - it would be very simillar to when you look at an object with the camera locked but free to rotate. maybe no overview but the ships would reflect your current overview brackets.as is stands the directional scan is a bit weak, but i have heard other players propose some sort of active scan mode (consider what we have now as a passive mode) that would perform regualar ""pings"" of the area alerting the player to other ships in the vicinity.all in all i think some people will need to adapt their play style a little bit and stop treating eve as a single player game but it should do a lot to prevent the hordes of cloaking macro ravens in 0.0 cloaking before anyone gets a look in.100% support"
4/27/2009,"this would be a beneficial change (and i still support ""recent speakers"" mode for 0.0 local)"
4/27/2009,i love running around in wormholes while cloaked. delayed local is great. however there's certainly a case to be made about the fact that new intel-gathering systems needs to be implemented before anything else.
4/27/2009,"here is the risk. ""carebears"" have cloaked protective fleet of recons or other nasties; hunting fleet jumps in and attempts to kill ""easy"" target, gets free trip to fresh clone instead. hunters think twice next time."
4/27/2009,"let's make it like in wurm online: if you're cloaked, you're ""cloaked"" in local too i like idea of scout a system withoung being in local any maybe you add a 60 seconds timer until you're in local if you don't recloak so you can launch probes."
4/27/2009,"maybe introduce delayed local gradually.start by with 0.0 only, or cloakers only..."
4/27/2009,"hi, i think it could be useful to add a new channel in the forums for those programmers that build eve related utilities.there are a bunch of them already, being in the same channel would make them easier to find for those that are new to the game and want something else, or for those that just are looking for updates.i made one a few weeks ago, i'm a programmer after all, but it wasn't after i posted it on the forums that i found that there was like 3 more doing more or less the same."

4/27/2009,"do you really think eve could handle such a huge drop in tritanium production? mineral and ore market is already upside-down.my suggestion would be a less monotic. more fun and less time-sink gameplay. make the monotic log term activity automated.loot collecting and salvagind: it was designed for macro. aproach, tractor, collect loot, salvage. suggestion: automated by design. a spetialized ship with spetial modules with large cargo that auto loots and salvages all your whecks around, fast and easy. it is no fun to get 30+ failures (5 min) when salvaging a t2 frig wreck.mining: it was designed for macro. watch your miners go zooom zooom and every 3 mins empty cargo to a can."
4/27/2009,i really hate captchas
4/27/2009,"it was me: ""...you get a popup message from scc where you will be asked to confirm your mining license...""like everything in eve, the captchas should be embedded into roleplaying too. it would be just another building block for content creators and used where appropriate.but i agree, lot of care is required in use of captchas, otherwise they will be insulting and annoying.i've seen it. fahtim meidires described his's idea, but there is no need to take it too literal. the important part is the core of the idea, the captcha. how it could be used and what effects/side effects this would cause is what we discuss here.i missed any comments of the devs regarding macros, could you link for us please? it would be worth to take a look on. and it's hard for us normal players to see macros disappear, if we are not in the macro-gank-business or using macros ourselves.yay, it would hurt. but since they are no macros in fleet fights (i hope so...), there is no need to trigger captchas during pvp.this works only, if you can look on your screen from time to time. if you rely on the macro working for long time while you are at work/school/sleeping/whatever, then your income gets cut down significantly.to have more time to adapt the macro to counter captcha does not matter. the captcha image generator on sisi needs not to be the same like later on tq. it should be modified frequently either. for sisi a simple one would be ok. this would drive macro developers crazy over time.there is only one really reliable way to counter captchas: the macro relays them to an operator, who solves them, and gets the correct password back. the macro supplier needs to run a 24/7 service pay the operators. that gets expensive. he will charge his customer, the user of his macro tool, with a monthly subscription fee. how many macro users would pay real money for that each month?eve would adapt like it did after fixing the t2 reaction exploit. the prices for mins would shift, but they would still be limited by what ppl are willing to pay to replace ships they lost.mining would become more profitable for real players.something like that is allready in game. see datacores, moon mining and production.if you introduce anchorable belt harvester into game, then everybody will use lots of them. income will be limited by the time you sped to haul the ore into your station, and maybe by fuel (if the harvester needs it) and resources (if they are as limited as they are now).me too! they will never come ingame either - not even with 1000 supports in this thread - but it would be cool to have them on sisi - isnt it?"
4/27/2009,only if you ask for a captcha request for each time you open fire or buy/sell on the market.
4/27/2009,"autocannons are fast enough as it is. besides, let's try and keep different weapons, different."
4/27/2009,"this is sort of an extension of my macro hauler thread, but the idea is a little more to address the larger problem of isk farmers using macros and low paid laborers, and it may or may not already be implemented, as it's sort of an ""internal"" sort of thing. here's the general idea:isk farmers using laborers and macros have certain behaviors that casual players do not have. if these behaviors can be determined, then accounts can be monitored for them and put on a shortlist for gm investigation(not autoban or anything like that). accounts found using this method must be handled leniently, since this method relies on probability and many legitimate players also play for long hours, repetitively, for the sole purpose of gaining isk. there also needs to be some sort of remediation for players who claim to be unfairly banned, since farmers probably wont invest a lot of effort into recovering ratting account #3543.i believe the future of isk farming will be in 0.0 ratting, level 4 missions, macro mining and wormhole space. the nature of eve makes it difficult for players to monitor other players. usually it seems players just resort to petitioning everybody with poor english. we need gms armed with tools to flag isk farmers and remove them at the source, rather then deal with the repercussions after the isk has already been generated and sold. the behaviors that are monitored for should always be refined in response to new data determining their validity, and the specific things monitored for will probably not be published, to slow down the evolution of isk farmers behavior used to evade ccp with.here are some behaviors i can think of that isk farmers/macroers have that players do not have. don't withhold support because you disagree with some of these- they are all written off the top of my head and only ccp can determine if they are valid or not after enough mining their server logs:-an active account that is logged in and performing actions for hours, without allowing appropriate time for sleep, for more days then it is possible for a human being to stay up 23/7-ip address shared with a large number of other accounts, also performing the same action, possibly with the same skill build and setup, for hours and hours-hardware profile identical to previously banned isk farmer/macroer account-no kills activity, no wallet activity beyond isk gaining and transferring it to another character which also receives isk from other similarly behaved accounts(there will need to be some further refinement to this idea to exclude flagging even the most repetitive ratting alts). i'm pretty sure the nature of relationships created by isk transactions between a farming ring is different from that of normal players, even when those players are organizing alliance logistics or something like that. but i would need a lot of server data, and probably a phd in statistics to be able to determine that. how about sending your economics guy to find that out, ccp? :d-massive usage of contracts to send isk, using items which it can be determined without a doubt aren't worth the isk that's being transferred over them-for market macros, measuring the time passed between the putting up of a rival sell order and the adjustment of their own. measuring the number of ""refreshes"" requested-little to no chat activity whatsoever(or certain kinds of repetitive chat, this is sort of borderline i think)-i doubt any isk farmers use credit cards to pay for their accounts. not saying all timecard-ers are farmers, but if someone uses cash it lowers the probability of being one very much.there's no substitute for good police work. but when you have a huge population, and you're already getting complete reports on all their activities, a good system for finding the most suspicious accounts will be a step forward from relying on player petitions only."
4/27/2009,"clearly, i support myself.vote for me~"
4/27/2009,do you honestly think that ccp doesn't do this already?
4/27/2009,there's not been any mention of it that i can find. if they have then all power to them. but if they haven't then it would be stupid not to suggest it.
4/27/2009,do you really think that ccp is going to discuss how they combat macros? that's like the us government to go out and say how they spy on terrorists
4/27/2009,"in this forum lavista vista has a problem with mazzilliu.lavista you say ccp must be combating this already, well try paying a few visits to the low sec courier mission hubs and see how good a job they are doing. +1 from me"
4/27/2009,"hey lavista, maybe you don't realize this: being an ass doesn't make you more right."
4/27/2009,"seeing as i used to pirate in low-sec all the time in areas infested these macro haulers, i know how bad the situation is.however, that doesn't make my point less right: ccp is doing stuff. you just won't exactly notice, because that's the nature of how they works. please refer to my above comment comparing this to the terrorist situation."
4/27/2009,lavista vista has a problem with smartassed punks who don't know what the hell they are talking about.not supported for assuming ccp is stupid.
4/27/2009,"looking at this thread made me a little speechless. on the one side i know from visiting for example insmother or ingunn, there are in the eve universe suspious activities going on, which could everybody see, if he wants to, also gms and ccp, since years. on the other side, you, annoncing this issue ... uhh, what is your real intention, hm? i would never vote for you. bye."
4/27/2009,"personally, i don't see any problem. isk farmers don't take any isk from my wallet, and don't see me off at all. i don't need to buy isk, and even if i did - surely the gtc's are the way to do that? ccp is doing alot. look at all the banned accounts and gm withdrawals from wallets from people who buy isk from isk sellers?ok, on your following points..-an active account that is logged in and performing actions for hours, without allowing appropriate time for sleep, for more days then it is possible for a human being to stay up 23/7i sometimes log in straight after dt, and stay there moving stuff about on autopilot with my freighter - so if i don't touch any buttons for a while, does that make me a macro? no.-ip address shared with a large number of other accounts, also performing the same action, possibly with the same skill build and setup, for hours and hoursso, people (like chribba for example) who have multiple (5+) accounts, all mining is now against the rules?-hardware profile identical to previously banned isk farmer/macroer accountthis one made me laugh the hardest - do you think computer businesses, in a crazy attempt to make money - sell more than 1 computer built the same? so, if one computer gets banned, everyone with that computer has to get banned? hmm, way to go on that one. thanks, i haven't laughed like that since i was a little girl.-no kills activity, no wallet activity beyond isk gaining and transferring it to another character which also receives isk from other similarly behaved accounts(there will need to be some further refinement to this idea to exclude flagging even the most repetitive ratting alts). i'm pretty sure the nature of relationships created by isk transactions between a farming ring is different from that of normal players, even when those players are organizing alliance logistics or something like that. but i would need a lot of server data, and probably a phd in statistics to be able to determine that. how about sending your economics guy to find that out, ccp? :dmy hauling alt doesn't have any kills, doesn't have any outgoings other than passing isk to my main pvp account. i keep my alt in the starter corps so i can mission etc and fund my pvp without hassle. so - what you're saying is, this is bannable? using an alt to make isk and not kill stuff is a bannable offence now? no.-massive usage of contracts to send isk, using items which it can be determined without a doubt aren't worth the isk that's being transferred over themlike jita you mean? so, everyone scamming in jita should be perma-banned. i agree. but scamming is a part of the game. -for market macros, measuring the time passed between the putting up of a rival sell order and the adjustment of their own. measuring the number of ""refreshes"" requestedi agree with this - i think increasing the amount of time between altering markets would be a good idea. meaning that traders can only update every 20 minutes - would make it less appealing to macroers i believe.-little to no chat activity whatsoever(or certain kinds of repetitive chat, this is sort of borderline i thinki don't chat on my alt - i don't like the people in the n00b corp, and who else is there exactly?-i doubt any isk farmers use credit cards to pay for their accounts. not saying all timecard-ers are farmers, but if someone uses cash it lowers the probability of being one very much.i don't understand your reasons on this, so i'll not comment.oh, and not supported. why should ccp alter something that is a game mechanic, and doesn't affect regular players more than what they are doing already?"
4/27/2009,"this is a lot of stuff in that post but most of the points can be addressed with this:first, i said each description of behavior was just off the top of my head and ccp will need to do the refinement of these criteria. but every eve player with experience knows that certain non-legitimate players do certain things that normal players simply don't do, or can't do, even in the edge cases. if ccp has any such tools active they haven't told us, and of course they dont have to tell us if they dont want to. but in case such a thing does not already exist then it should, and it doesnt hurt to make sure or ask.just so youall dont get mixed up in details, the proposal itself is putting a system in place to detect suspicious behaviors. the specific behaviors themselves are minor details and entirely at the discretion of ccp. also im not really understanding all the hate in the thread that inst accompanied by reasons explaining why coming from the same two people. theres lots of reasons to hate me jeez just let me know which one~ if you just want a troll festival i will retaliate by stating drake and vista are doo-doo-heads. you will never be able to beat that"
4/27/2009,"most people who actually care enough to help out put some time and effort into their ideas and not ""thinking off the top of their heads""anyone can rattle off ideas on common problems... few actually put some thought and effort into it to make it rational enough to be reasonable."
4/27/2009,"the specific details of what behaviors should be monitored are not something anybody without access to ccp's log information can really determine for sure. i think ive said something like that twice already, so you can see there really is no reason to get really specific about that at this point except just to give an example or a general idea."
4/27/2009,supported!
4/27/2009,"please, bring them back! the old trails looked awesome. i didn't mind if they were jagged sometimes."
4/27/2009,"so, since you have absolutely no clue how the scanning mechanic works and the skills/ships required to do it well, how exactly are you qualified to comment on the difficulty level of ninja salvaging?let me put it another way, to scan and salvage effectively you must train several scanning skills to v, salvaging to v, be able to fly and fit a cov-ops ship which means training several ship and fitting skills to iv, and training several navigation skills to iv or v. in general, the time it takes to train these skills to the minimum needed is roughly commensurate with training the minimum for lvl 3 missions. this does not include the actual player skill required to scan someone down which takes some time and practice to get the hang of.just because we don't train combat skills doesn't mean we can just train salvager i and be off and running any more than it means you can train missile launcher operation i and start running lvl iv missions."
4/27/2009,"over the past 4+ years, i have had a lot of experience in many facets of eve. i love this game due to the evolving nature of it, coupled with the ease of changing from one 'sphere' to another when wanting to try something different. my previous experience as a csm alternate where i proved i could work constructively and actively with others should make me your first choice of candidate to vote for. xavier hayes is my market privateer/builder/inventor character. i have two other characters currently involved in wh space, missions and low sec pve/pvp.i'll be looking out for issues aiming at improving low sec, pirating, missions and drones especially, but will consider any other issue in a fair and open-minded way. i take playing eve seriously; representing player issues to ccp is something i will do with a similar approach. i'll also be pushing fellow csm members to act professionally at all times, be active and engage with players. should i get elected chair, i shall step down and call a vote immediately.add your intention to vote for xavier hayes below. as a token of my appreciation for your support, i will be entering all registered voters into a drawing to win 30 day pilot licenses, t2 ships and other items (to be drawn by an independent third party)."
4/27/2009,"a number of players have been asking me in-game if i am representing any one playerstyle. in short, i'm not going to bang on about what factions i am going to represent on the csm, for the simple reason that any faction/playstyle/group of players that suggest good ideas will get my support. that's not to say i don't have ideas of areas of the game that i think need some work (eg, sov, low sec, drones, rply support etc). unlike some other candidates, my intention isn't to push forward carebear issues and facebook/ambulation crap (which, frankly, i view as well down a line of issues).i'm a level-headed guy who thinks csm members have a duty and responsibility to act on behalf of players in a professional manner at all times. i have no 'master' pulling the strings in the background and will push issues that will enhance eve for players."

4/27/2009,his got my vote
4/27/2009,"that you want to get things done is good in my book, and if you do get elected i hope that you will stick it out through the negotiations and deals that you will have to make in order to get your points on top of ccp's agenda. you have certainly played the game long enough to know a lot about weak and strong sides of the game.about some regions of eve sucks and others not, well it was already covered above so i will just add that the way it is now gives a lot of diversity through the choices we as players make when we decide somewhere in eve to call home. a good home for one person sucks beyond for another. that's just as rl, so i would like to hear more on what type of diversity would you be pushing for?as for risk vs. rewards, i don't really get what you hope to achieve by pushing more people into lowsec? what is the purpose of that? by doing such a move, eve could very likely en up having less players, which would make the game smaller for us all. if one wants to fight in empire there is a game mechanic for that, by bribing concord to declare war on someone. it sucks being on the receiving end of that, but no complaints, as it's part of the game. i don't really see that moving even more activity of combat type(ie l4's) into lowsec/0.0 would bring anything more to the game? it's my understanding that still the amount of money to made in 0.0 by far outstrips what you can make in empire!?!? does it not?looking forward to your reply and i wish you luck, but am not convinced that you have a clear enough agenda which actually will bring new value to the csm, so i stand as of yet undecided."
4/27/2009,i should actually read the whole thread :(
4/27/2009,quote=true.
4/27/2009,haha okay. how will you send them? evemail?
4/27/2009,"i'd be interested to hear about what people think on the suggestion that the current election system is very likely to favour a polarized and thus ineffective csm. having only one vote forces voters to vote tactically, voting for a candidate that has a strong following instead of those they find represented their own issues best. i imagine giving each voter as many votes as there are seats on the council would likely yield better results: - better representation of the voters' will- more impressive vote numbers (csm members will have more legitimacy than just a couple hundred votes by their own alliance)- better chances for less polarizing, more consensus orientated candidates since they will be not the first, but the second to fifth or so choice of many.- hardly any extra effort needed to implementwhile the second csm certainly seemed like a quiet but harmoniously productive bunch, i more vividly remember the first instalment and the sometimes vicious disagreements that were fought out on various levels. seeing as the political situation among capsuleers in new eden is no less divided into polar opposites, elections in the current system will more likely wield representatives of those factions, almost ensuring bitter rivalries being fought out in the council along those exact lines.now i strongly encourage heated debate in most places, certainly in politics. but you must not forget that the csm is not our parliament, but our executive, and thus should work as a team seeking good (even if controversial) solutions to perceived problems and then presenting them to ccp as a united front. they should not check/balance themselves mutually - this should be left to us capsuleers as their direct electorate.oh, and besides, i really can't decide if i should vote for the take care or the star frraction candidate, so i want to be able to vote for both ;)"
4/27/2009,"if you give people nine votes, you'll just wind up with slates of nine candidates. do you really want the council of goon management? nothing against goons, per se, but they're the ones in the best position to try. i was skeptical of the system at first, but it actually does make a lot of sense - it ensures that all the major groups get represented. allowing slates would destroy that. also, strategic voting is annoying, but it's impossible to solve. every system suffers from it, bar none - it's actually been mathematically proven."
4/27/2009,"while i don't think that currently, there were enough candidates from any faction to fill a slate, nor that any single interest group such as an alliance held enough influence to convince anyone apart from themselves to vote for a monolithic slate, i can certainly see the problem. we might come up with some solutions to this, though. limit number of candidates per alliance? disallow slates on forums and linked pages? who knows?interestingly, goons have not fared too well in past elections, given their numbers. i'd like to see what maths say just how dangerous slate voting would be in such an enviroment."
4/27/2009,"i think a lot more new players and bears would be willing to get into pvp if it wasn't a monster blob-fest 90% of the time. crime is fun, we all want to be involved, but industry pilots rarely have the means to fight a -10. :lthat interbus idea is great, though, and i'd like to see that happen."
4/27/2009,"fixed for you there :)mazzilliu is the greif candidate. i've done lots of stuff, spying, metagaming, pirating, etc. my killboards can be viewed on pandemic legion boards, and my spy alts could be credited with the leaked info from dead alliances such as bruce, rise, puppet masters, requiem, and other minor alliances i forget to mention right now that pl has faced in the past. i've also been a member of the sniggerdly/sniggwaffe pirate corp for a pretty long time.oh and im a girl in real life. an evil girledit: oh and here for your entertainment is a really old link i found of one of my past conquests. itt i made a now dead alliance black star alliance diplomat sing songs for blue standings. then i didnt set them blue and we kicked them out of 0.0."
4/27/2009,"well, that's true enough; even if they did, though, some people enjoy market pvp more than real pew and it can be hard to get your own blob going (and solo pvp is a bit of a laugh if you don't have at least some support on call)that making the diplomat sing songs thing is hilarious, though"

4/27/2009,i think you should mail petur...
4/27/2009,"your post doesn't speak of that you submitted your application the same way you did for csm2.assuming you did that for csm3 too, you should email petur indeed."
4/27/2009,"lmao, it was not voted down because it was not important, it was voted down as it wasn't a valid issue. ccp are aware of the issue and are working on it. csm exists to notify ccp of issues. raising this issue would be a complete waste of time as ccp already know the issue exists. the same reasoning was used not to raise the 'issue' of eve not running properly on some mac configurations.csm exists to help ccp, not to spam them about things they are already actively working on."
4/27/2009,"the csm also exists to bump things up ccps priority queue, and we all know what kind of priority ccp gives to anything fw related."
4/27/2009,"you're right ankhe, what they should do is retask the people working on solving lag in general to solve lag in fw only grow up."
4/27/2009,"this is not on my top three, but that does not mean i can not do anything about it and influence a change?my views of the matter is that fw need more depth, content and meaning aswell to somehow opening fw to alliances. as a former roleplayer i know there are a lot of roleplaying alliances that would very much like to participate in fw as an entity. nope, not me. nope, not me either. participated in fw on the minmatar side in 2008, but nothing major.faction warfare is pointless, which is why i haven't taken part! if you really think that one needs to be in it to see it, you are wrong."
4/27/2009,"well, it seems that erik finnegan is the only one that even mentiones factional warfare in the candidate description. good for erik of course, but bad for the game as a whole.fw has a specific type of lag though that is a rather specific problem."

4/28/2009,vuoto i don't understand your comment about drones are you saying they need to be on all afs? if so wouldn't the enyo and more importantly ishkur consider that a nerf on them since its a drone frigate? my idea would be maybe a limited dmg bonus for using t2 ammo or possibly a reduction in the penalty some t2 ammo has. like at the momment my ishkur with t2 150s which isnt important does 740m/s with a normal ab load javelin s (20% speed penalty per gun loaded with it) into all 3 guns and it goes down to mid 300s say give af no speed penalty or lower it to in an af 5% or 10% or a reduction in the tracking penalty these kinds of changes could help all the af's and i don't just mean the higher dmg t2 ammo in the case of say spike s which has a massive range bonus have afs increase that as well or add say an af speed bonus. would make af more attractive and useful as well as make t2 ammo more enjoyable to use in them. galisonps i use the ishkur as an example as i can only fly the gal afs and use t2 hybrids so i haven't looked at the t2 ammo of projectiles or missles but i'd guess their bonus and penaltys are about the same in general.
4/28/2009,"judging from the big balance thread in the game development forum, t2 ammo, and t2 damage ammo in particular, is going to get looked at/boosted, so i don't think any bonus related to them is really going to happen."

4/28/2009,i do not support this change -- unless the change involves making the nag horizontal and not vertical. the combination of the proposed changes & keeping the nag vertical will make it the best dread in the game and throw off balance.

4/28/2009,"anyone in a medium to large sized alliance has probably dealt with the headache of pos passwords. if you want to let blues into your poses you have to give them the password and they have to set it. if the password is stolen, any hostile even with a negative ten standing can sit in your pos shields and bump ships or break lock on him until you change the password-potentially kicking out afk friendlies.espionage is fun and all, but the system just does not work very well. i propose a new option is added to the pos interface, where you can check a box and enter the minimum amount of corp or alliance standing in order for the pos to grant access."

4/28/2009,"ausser, i appreciate your posts even even though they go against my proposition because it is now clear you are genuinely concerned about this issue. and so am i.i will attempt to be as clear as possible in giving you my reasons for posting this thread.but first let's take a look at the dev posts you brought up. the posts by oveur are contradictory (dreads being anti-battleship then only anti-pos) but aside from that i do not give them much weight because they precede their release and the concept of dreads was still being changed.however fendahl: confirms what i was saying, dreads were ""originally intended"" as anti-capital ships. that's the concept they decided to go with in the end, rather than ""anti-battleship/cap/pos"" or just anti-pos/sieged dread.why i brought up the dread vs battleship example: every ship class can be effective against a lower sized one with proper (web/painter) support. there's nothing wrong there since it requires teamwork, coordination. i do not want the phoenix to be an anti-battleship platform. that's not the point of this thread.the point was why go with a phoenix which requires support to deal similar damage to a gun dreads firing at a carrier when you could use that same support and a gun dread to be effective against not only capitals, but also some sub caps. i do not want citadels to be effective anti-battleship weapons. i do not want them to have more raw dps. what i'm asking for is for more effective dps when firing at moving capitals of all types, so that their effectiveness is similar to that of gun based weapon systems as it was before the missile formula change.the graph i posted on page one gives a good picture of the problem: if you're firing at a moving capital there's a very small window where citadels are better (extreme short range), at any other range guns are far, far better.you're right in that missiles and guns have different advantages and that against a missile dread you can't maneuver to reduce damage. but when you're taking damage from multiple gun dreads you cannot maneuver to keep at short range / high transveral from all of them. on the other hand the disadvantage of citadels isn't reduced by engagement size.the problem isn't that citadel damage is calculated differently, that's perfectly fine. the problem is how much damage they lose compared to guns against moving capitals without any sufficient compensating advantage. overall different weapons systems should be roughly as effective, currently this is not the case at all.i don't know where you picked up that i wanted citadels to deal 100% damage to moving supercaps. i don't. only that they be about as effective as guns and currently they are not.let's put it this way: given a choice between two weapon systems, both of which are effective against pos and sieged dreads, but only one of which is effective against moving caps of all sizes. which would you train? why explosion velocity is ""the right screw"" for this problem: it's the explosion velocity that causes the large damage difference, not the raw damage nor the explosion radius. however a simple way of making citadels effective against moving caps while keeping their effectiveness against battleships the same would be to:1) increase the explosion velocity.2) increase the explosion radius."
4/28/2009,lol exactly. high sec towers need so many ships to remove.
4/28/2009,"let them decay and if they reach a certain point, make it like pos equipment without a tower..... you rep them up then can unanchor them and steal it. if the corp is still active then they have a chance to keep the tower, otherwise you have to work for it to steal it. and there is always the war dec option for those that don't want to steal the towers"

4/28/2009,"1. cloaked signature. impossible to pin down, but shows up faintly on the combat probes.it won't give away a cloaked ships actual location, but it will give anyone with the nerve to bring a scout the knowledge someone could be peeking in on them.2. thus far, the complaint has been intel tools, but i firmly believe that the current intel tools are fine, if actually put into practice.add 1 signature for cloaked ships, and i'm sold. otherwise, no support.

4/28/2009,"if you did it correctly you could have skill redistribution without abuse. say, you get half the skills put into a skill pool, and that allows you to train twice as fast. it gives you the benefit of allowing people to use worthless skills with a real sacrifice (lose half points) and without insta-training (only train twice as fast)."
4/28/2009,"i'm proposing a simple ""quick bar"" of player status icons (gang mates, corp mates, wartargets, positively or negatively assigned standings, alliance mates) on the top of the local channel user list.this would allow pilots to notice corpmates and hostiles on local system more fairly and quickly. if there are 20+ pilots in the system, people with names starting with z are considerably less likely noticed than pilots with names starting with a. this is because scrolling the local player list is a b*tch. the icon quickbar would show only 1 icon of each icon type, no matter how many pilots with a similar status icon there were in local. the feature would not alter the gameplay, balance or in any way actually. it would just make everyone's life heck of a lot easier in systems with lots of players. it would also allow you to make your local channel window smaller, freeing more gui space for other stuff.the image below is ""photoshopped"", so imagine there's 99 in local, not 9."
4/28/2009,boost local tbh
4/28/2009,"hmmmm.... i would support this with no local chat maybe. then you don't know if there is 1 or 100 hostiles, you just know there are some."
4/28/2009,"yes, as there's a thread for ""nerf local"" as well, this idea would work perfectly there too! but for now, i'm just supporting my own proposal as it's not really a gameplay change, but a gui improvement."
4/28/2009,no. there's too much easy intell in the local channel already.
4/28/2009,but the thing is spaceships do have easy intel. radars pick up transponders and we should know exactl who is in a system=
4/28/2009,no.
4/28/2009,"do they? says who? i can't count the number of times in a sci-fi show/movie an ""unknown vessel"" has been picked up on long range scans. the first thing i would do if i owned a ship in lawless space (0.0) would be rip out the transponder."
4/28/2009,absolutely. this is simply a more user-friendly way of accessing data that is already readily available.
4/28/2009,"gameplay and intel wise, in my opinion there's just no difference in having this feature. i have a long experience on empire wars and 0.0 as well. you *always* check the local if you know you're about to be in danger. it just takes you a few clicks more on every jump, and forces you to distract your actions every 5-30 seconds whenever you're in 0.0 or otherwise in war - and only if the whole local pilot list doesn't fit in the window. so most often no change at all. just more gui space for you.and you still want to make life more difficult for yourselves? if the ""no""s are just to vote against the existing local channel pilot list, i understand the votes, but the gui improvement resistance i don't quite get... so please enlighten me with more detailed opinions and explanations why no? thx!"
4/28/2009,"if local is going to be kept as an intel channel, this is how it should work."
4/28/2009,"yes but i only support if both together. this is a good idea if no local, but with local it just means you don't have a few seconds to jump onto someone before they scan up and down local chat again."
4/28/2009,supported

4/28/2009,"yeah, but my objection had nothing to do with rp - companies who intentionally annoy their customers tend to be companies that don't stand up very well. i don't see that this proposal would have anywhere near enough benefit to justify the frustration level you propose to add."
4/28/2009,"and how the server will know if i am doing pvp or not?if i am fighting something player owned the server will think i am doing pvp?then it will be very easy to circumvent your captcha, send 1 drone against a ship that has aggressed you and you are free of the captcha (it will not be hard to set up, it would simply require 1 extra account in a drake escorting several macro miners, shield regen and resists will do the rest).on the other hand a captcha at the wrong moment while figthing in a mission can spell doom for a regular user. it the captcha appears when you are using guns/missiles/drones they will be always a problem. apparently you have a limited idea of who use macros.yes, it will probably work for a time stopping small time macro users (i.e. those that set up a macro and go to work, study, ecc.). but it will not deter the professional macro user, people that has sweatshops where a single person follow 20 accounts with the help of macros. they will have a person keeping an eye upon the 20 accounts and probably will even have a warning system to alert them if something goes wrong. they are the big problem as they sell the isk for real money and use high end macros combined with low wage workers to squeeze every penny from the game."
4/28/2009,"a living, breathing, dynamic universe.1: empire areas.in empire we have 1.0 to .5 security generally. this is fixed.i would like to security related to faction warfare performance and indigenous population figures.the better the fw results, the higher the average security rating is that empires systems a bonus is also applied if the average population of pilots over a period of a week.if the formula is balanced right, true hi sec will shrink a bit and there will be tracts of low sec areas between hi sec systems as a by product yet with lucrative agents/ores.concord response/population adjusts accordingly.jita would be almost perma 1.0 given the population as would nearby systems, the further afield the more chance of a system being low sec. there would potentially be swathes of low sec to get to another empire/trade hub area.meaning empire can alter, low sec can alter, high sec can alter.2: asteroid belts/moon miningsimilar to swg resources, the mapping of ores changes each week, randomly. rp will be that a resource was overmined, new stuff is awaiting discovery. this would encourage nomadic behaviour.it would end resource hogging by the filthy rich as you would have to discover new areas and mine them as they change. not sit on a big heap of gold. when areas change, pvp is generated as a result. active corps/alliances stand a better chance than the inactive ones. bloatcorp with 5000 members but 150 active will suffer against newcorp with 200 members (theoretically).3: sovereigntyposes would not count toward this. they are purely for moon mining/defense/hangar arrays. they would have listening posts too to allow a corporate/alliance system status window displaying non-allied pilots in system. local, is of course, delayed and is no longer the intel tool it was.sovereignty instead would come from alliance activity in the area over a period of time based on percentage level of alliance members logged in and undocked.e.g. bloat alliance with a membership of 5000 but only 150 logged in and undocked with an average playtime that week of 7 hours would perform less well than new alliance with a membership of 500 where 50 members who were logged in and undocked for an average playtime of 30 hours.tied to activity with a system/constellationexamplemembership - not counted150 logged in and undocked/not in pos, played average 7 hrs = 1050 sov points50 logged in and undocked/not in pos, played average 30 hrs = 1500 sov pointsfull sovereignty will allow the building of an outpost. sov points would be calculated by accruing over a rolling 1 month period. the number of points to achieve sov needs to be set could be 6000 say.summaryadding dynamism to eve can correct a lot of wrongs and lead to a whole lot of pvp. the only reason people build a static empire is because the game requires it. more fun can be found by having a core ""empire base"" and arranging logistics back to base from other areas, arranging war strikes, making new friends and enemies and having a corp rated on their activity level."
4/28/2009,sec status is not based on population.sec status is based on security/law enforcement.you could roll through 2000 pilots in 0.0 or low sec and it wouldn't change a damn thing... its because there are 2000 pilots rolling through town : o pgood intention... wrong way to go about it.not supported.
4/28/2009,"war mechanic:these are simply just ****ed up.first off, why would concord ever allow war in their territory? isnt the whole point of concord (ships made with the help of all factions) to keep the peace? and if they wanted war why are they not involved?.secondly, why am i forced to take up arms and do pvp in highsec when all i want to do is pve and marketing?, i dont see a mechanic forcing people in 0.0 to do pve and marketing instead of pvp, wheres my module of see i am here, now you cant pvp but have to pvp until i decide to move or you have pved for 5 hours ?.and even if it is so, why again is it that when you finally say okey **** it, lets blow these idiots away pull out the heavy guns and go do something you have no interest in doing and really dont enjoy, then it is impossible to stop the war in this way :/i mean if you declare war on some one and they destroy everything that you have come too you door and kill you, then the war is over, there is no one left too fight. but not in eve.why isnt there a mechanic that says, if some one declaring a war on some one else and isnt prepared to fight but just hide in a station, that the war then is ending?.how the **** do you explain that some one is running a war against some one put dont have the capacity to actually fight and it is not because you cant find them gurilli war but because concord protects them in the stations :/there should be adding some different mechanics too the war system.first of a mechanic which state that if some one declare war on you, you can pay concord the same amount of isk to disallow it, meaning they decide the amount to start the war, minimum of what it is now, and if the opposing site is willing to match that, no war will be allowed by concord.secondly, if you are in a war and dont have a ship in space in the region of a office of the opposing force, for more then 30min within 24hours, the war will end automatically by default and the winning site will get the deposit set up too start the war(the last part can be removed)..there should be a minimum player amount in a corp before it can declare war or be declared war upon. (say 30-50 to make it a actual corp and not just a little gang of people).as it is now it would be like me and 20 friends deciding to declare war on some one and then going at it, this wouldnt be called a war but a gang fight.these are the alternative i can see from just disallowing a one way war (meaning disallowing a war which is not wanted from both sides, which would actually give more sense giving the background and the rules of nature when have you last seen a war from one country to another where there was no conflict of any kind to help start it?)"

4/28/2009,can i has your stuff?
4/28/2009,"much as i hate griefers who use the wardec mechanic, and have been their victim more than once, i have to say no, to all of the above.in rp terms, concord regulates, not prohibits, wars. prohibiting wars is unrealistic. and in game mechanic terms, a huge part of the essence of eve is involuntary pvp combat.i think you're expecting a victory or loss condition as it exists in other games. eve isn't other games; it's more realistic. you can stop wars the same way wars end in real life: when the aggressor decides it's not worth fighting anymore. if you're having trouble, you may not be ""fighting"" it the right way. there is no universal ""end this war"" button, and there shouldn't necessarily be. if you're making the war worthwhile to your aggressor, you're losing - be that fighting (if the griefers are in it for kicks), paying tribute money (if the griefers are in it for the money), or allowing the aggressor control of your other resources (like moons or territory). instead, you can try making the war dreadfully boring to your aggressor (by refusing to engage), or dreadfully expensive (by joining an alliance to raise the cost to them), or dreadfully painful (by hiring really good mercenaries to pummel them into the stone age).it costs an aggressor money to keep a wardec active, even if no fighting is going on and they or you are blockading the other at stations. you wait it out. sieges take time, a lot of time.simply paying concord off is unbalanced; rich corps can act with total impunity toward poor corps under those circumstances. at least under the current system if a rich corp tries to end a war with money, the aggressor gets it and sets the terms (which may include things other than money), not concord - which is fair, because the aggressor earned it. a comprehensive contract type called a ""peace treaty"" (a promise not to declare war, enforceable by concord, which can include a variety of terms besides money), might be a different way to do this, though.seiges and long distance wars are legitimate - wars shouldn't be invalidated because combatants have few or no assets in a particular region at a time.many mercenary corps have very small numbers of members, and those corps need to be able to declare wars to do their work legally. and i don't like the idea of giving any corp immunity to wars because of their size; that's an arbitrary, unfair, and very easily exploited mechanic.as they exist now, there are ways around the war mechanics. if your corp is at war and some members don't want to be war targets, they can leave the corp and form a sister shadow corp, or for immunity to war declarations just return to the npc corps.yes, the wardec mechanic sucks because it's a pay-to-grief system and needs to be reexamined. this has been said many many times. but i'm afraid i don't see the logic behind your proposals, even as a fellow carebear myself."
4/28/2009,this is not the game you are looking for.hello kitty online is that way ---->
4/28/2009,"how come that every time some one adds a proposal that could remove some griefing stupid ass ****ers as you have to put something idiotic like this in the post.go f yourself.now that's out of the way.personally i feel there is a need to change some aspects of the war declaring, namely that it is so easily exploited, war is about taking others out that are in your way, not to make casual pvp and pirating in highsec.this should be adjusted for that.personally i would just remove high sec wars all together, or let it be a agreed to war mechanic.the pve'ers is what pays for this game, and they are the onces getting the boot at every turn."
4/28/2009,"the minimum it cost is laughable compared to what you get, a free card to attack anything in polized space, without any reason to do so :/."
4/28/2009,what about the ones who think war is about making isk or the ones who don't like smart mouths in local? you are in my ice fields and i want your corp to cease to exist. i see your corp flying around in faction fit mission running ships and i want your faction mods. one of your corp mates shot his mouth off in local to the wrong people and now you are all paying for his stupidity because your ceo refused to kick his dumb ass out of the corp.sometimes wars are started over the smallest things. about the only thing i want changed about the war dec system is the little babies that see npc corps has get-out-of-jail-free cards. once a character hits a certain age (say 6 month) they have to go into a corp that can be war decced.
4/28/2009,"dude if i smacktalk you on the street i am pretty sure you don't pull a gun on me and shoot my head of or start a war.a minimum will have to be done for it to be worth declaring war.normally irl the problem would be other parties joining in and the fact that you can die and be gone forever, that including sanctions against a country where as it is unable to trade with other countries etc.if we got a mechanic in that would allow us too decide which corps we would like to sell what too in market, then yes this would be fine, since you could freeze those people out.but as it is now it is just annoying.and the whole idea with them hiding in a station or logoff tricks etc. to avoid the actual fight is just lame, if they started the war but don't have the man power to actually fight it, the war should be over.since this is something concord allows normal ""drive by's"" just doesn't fit into the describtion of a war"
4/28/2009,"right here is where i stopped reading.no, i take it back. within some areas in certain cities in the usa i would pull out a gun and shoot you in the head if smack talked me on the street. so please stop with the real world crap in an internet space ship game."
4/28/2009,"well if hello kitty online wasnt what you were looking for--------->then world of warcraft is the other way<--------ok ok on a more serius note yes something needs to be done about war dec mechanics ... meaning people not beoing able to hop corp several times to avoid a war that they brought upon themselfs.. ie; attempting to recruit another corps members, smack talking corp/alliance members or deccing a weaker corp then when that corp joins an alliance, running off and trys to get away from the revenge dec"

4/28/2009,stupid ass section is that way sir<----------reported.
4/28/2009,sums it up nicely.to nerf war-decs would ruin the game... to buff them would ruin the game.a balance needs to be struck between the 2 parties.otherwise your asking to get flamed.
4/28/2009,"never been invloved in anything csm, never even looked here before, but in true eve fashion, im jumping in feet first all the way from the top diving board.this may have already been said, and if it was, then it wasn't said very well as it aint been sorted out yet (not that i am saying it better) the gist of it is, they need an overhaul and to be on par with the main empire factions, but true to their course.stage one is allow it into faction warfare (no idea how fw works, becasue ive no interest in the main empire factions) expand that black rise hovel and give each pirate faction a system, a forward operating base if you like. ally it up raiders, guristas, sansha playing off agianst angels and serps (maybe an advantage to latter to compensate for manpower)standard fw mechaincs as i imagine them to apply, corp has appropiate standing to the faction, but also the corp memebers must be outlaw, or the avergae corp sec status must be outlaw, whatever is more practical.the npc pirate factions will still mainly exist in 00, you will not be able to start the game as a pirate, but as the four core races.next thing on the list of how to make eve better for me and all, when lp store was introduced, i asked why could i not buy db mar's from the raider store, but i could buy an from the amarr story. i was kindly informed by ccp greyscale (i think) that items in the loyalty store, were placed there as the only way to get them, as there arn't faction navy spawns to rat where there is pirate spawns. that makes sense to me.however from an in character perspective, if i wanted a guristas faction fittings, as i was roleplaying guristas, i would have to go out and butcher my ""allies"" or buy them off contracts, supporting people anti to my cause as they quite clearly killed guristas. solution, pirate items in pirate loyalty store, put an increased price tag on them if you wish.i'm not diputing the fact that the pirate loyalty stores are shiate, as implants and faction ships are immense, but with so many navy faction items about, what harm is it for the pirate ones to, there same stats, its all just in our heads that db is better than ts.allow production of the snyth drugs in pirate owned stations, make it a mission arch or such, ie go out and mine this gas, go out and hack for this reaction, maybe get dropped on my a long range navy patrol etc, bring me back all the ingredients and voila, heres some drugs, keep them, or an option to deliver them to my mate (100 odd jumps away, other side of the world) for bonus isk, aka smuggling is now in its infancy.this all came straight out of my head, but you have the ball now, run with it, improve on it and support it.very much obliged.edit: was editing for spelling mistakes, gave up"
4/28/2009,i endorse this idea
4/28/2009,"i support this fine idea, as there needs to be mopre variety in my sandbox"
4/28/2009,much better than most of the useless guff that gets posted here
4/28/2009,you know... i've always wondered why there wasn't fw for the factions other than the 4 empires.seriously... it would spice things up for sure.
4/28/2009,supporting boosted pirate lp stores.
4/28/2009,"i am more thinking of ""why is this needed?"" and will you reduce their dmg even futher to compensate for the lack of reload time?.it's a balance issue, if you want instant ammo switching you will properly see a static type of dmg to compensate for it (like ken/expl dmg and nothing else for projectiles).which i highly doubt will happend or will be wanted from the minmatar publicedit:personally i would love too see minmatar only do ken and expl dmg :d knowing as a amarr how easily i am thinked when meeting people knowing i can only do em and therm dmg, it would be awesome to do the same to those pesky minmatars ;)but a lot of balance would be needed for this to ever happend and it would destroy the difference in the weapon systems (and make minmatar a lot weaker if dmg wasn't tweaked a lot)and again, why is this needed?"
4/28/2009,"having a constant feed to ammo in cargo, but keeping the 10 second reload time for swapping ammo type would be good. but tbh autocannons aren't that bad or needing of a buff when compared to artillery."
4/28/2009,just be sure to switch their primary damage source to em...jorm
4/28/2009,"the situation you describe is certainly possible (using the market to generate a large amount of isk which you then use to manipulate gameplay), but the openness and detail present in the market makes it so that it is just as possible and doable by any player - employee or no. this is by design.if you're talking about their access to the database as something in their favor so far as data mining to determine and predict trends, it really isn't. they could get the same information off any relevant webpage that you or i would go to all without having to go to any extra steps like writing the queries and interpreting the information themselves."
4/28/2009,"once again, that's entirely wrong.the csm concept was first made up just after eve was released. it was never an anti-corruption organization like nyt made it out to be.and there was a mini-csm after release, where ccp selected people who would give them feedback, much like the current csm."
4/28/2009,"ok, if you want to call any group of people ccp uses to get feedback from a csm :v"
4/28/2009,"actually it was called the csm, the group was picked by pann and met online for a meeting chat with various devs including tomb. the chat was largely unstructured and the 'delegates' usually sourced questions from the players to ask ccp in the week or two before as well as during the meeting on irc. the running joke was that someone had to ask about titans every session."
4/28/2009,"one thing regular players can't do is buy or sell materials based on price changes on upcoming buffs, nerfs, changes in roid spawn numbers, and batch numbers, that said i doubt too many ccp staff are doing that, why risk a job over isk that is easy to get as it is."
4/28/2009,"might be a ridiculous idea but i thought i'd post it up or its already been thought of.so essentially what i was thinking of was maybe having the boss or fc/wc's in fleets being able to set starbase forcefield passwords on mass rather than each individual pilot setting it. obviously would only be useful in a few situations such as jump bridge passwords and setting it before you warp a fleet back to a safe pos.there are downsides to this, if someone got the boss flag and changed everyone's password while inside a friendly non-alliance pos you'd see a lot of complaints but i'm sure someone with a bit more know how than me would be able to think of a better way to implement something like this.#anyway that's the idea, anyone else?"
4/28/2009,"and it also means if your using someone elses jump bring or pos, they only have to give the password to 1 person."
4/28/2009,"that's like saying following:""the us government should really spy on terrorists. they could like tap into their phone and maybe even their internet! but i don't know since i don't actually know a lot about it""."
4/28/2009,i dont even know where you are going with this

4/28/2009,"we need an official confirmation by pl leadership that she is, indeed, a girl.and if it is the case, then we will vote because..a girl..on ze internet."
4/28/2009,dang it! now i have multiple candidates i am considering voting for.
4/28/2009,"sure, pirates hang out in high sec piloting freighters all the time. effectively, your proposal increases the risk for gankers while also increasing the amount of more or less mutual pvp. i.e., safe things are safer, dangerous things are more dangerous. for me, that makes the game less appealing, but that's a value judgment. to each his own. what i find amazing is that this is a priority. of all the things going on in eve, you think this even rates mention. needless to say, i won't be voting for you, and everything i suspected when i saw your corp ticker just got confirmed."
4/28/2009,"so your complaint is that instead of the player with the kill rights coming and crying to the forums about being ganked he will be able to hire someone to go out and get his revenge for him?i don't see how it makes ""safe things safer"" and ""dangerous things more dangerous"" unless you mean it is adding potential consquence to actions? ganked that poor 1 month old player in his caracal taking tentative steps into low sec? he contracts out the kill rights with some ""minor"" reward to bounty hunter / merc corp that hunts down the pirates, without suffering a sec hit for doing it. how is this a bad thing?heartstone's example may not have been a good one, but that doesn't mean the ability to put up kill rights for trade/competition/etc shouldn't be explored by ccp.anti-piracy corps are generally laughed at because in the end they become pirates themselves because taking offensive action in low sec (or high sec) against pirates lowers your sec status. adding mechanics to allow players and corporations to actually take an anti-pirate stance would add to the game.fx. good two shoes inc (gtsi) is anti-piracy, currently all it can do is set bait traps and not conduct an offensive campaign to push the pirates out. with transferable kill rights, gtsi can offer isk for the kill rights (pay-for-kill) or even a service to complete a kill right (paid-to-kill).it is not intended to help piracy."
4/28/2009,"to be straight, i don't think it's a terrible idea. it makes anti-pirate possible, which is good, it makes kill rights meaningful, which is good. but it does make an already extremely safe game even safer. i don't have a huge problem with it, and if it was combined with some other proposals to make currently risk-free activities a little dicier i would be all in favor.my issue with the proposal is that it is nothing more than an incredibly minor tweak to a problem few people have and that few even noticed. it betrays an attitude of ""everything is fine, just make it a little safer."" the csm was created, as i understand, to serve as a player driven honesty check and a means of surfacing major player issues to the developers. this proposal indicates that heartstone, like many of the csm candidates, are not running for the position of honesty checker / player representative, but are instead auditioning to be unpaid junior assistant gameplay developers. i'm interested in a csm candidate who wants to listen to the playerbase, and bring major player issues to the developers' attention. as far as minor gameplay tweaks out of left field, that is what i pay ccp for."
4/28/2009,"pirates are not the only ones who generate killrights. many people will engage in low sec activity that could generate killrights for a number of reasons including, for example, a player who chases his target, who may well be a pirate, from 0.0 to low sec. i have personally had many kill rights both against me and for me in this way. the pirate, if he has a sec status that allows him into high sec can then return the favour to the pilot should he happen to meet him. if his sec status doesn't allow this then we are back to the actions have consequences thing. maybe it wasn't, in truth, the best example of the theory in practice.to address your other concerns about me wanting to be a ""junior game developer"" i presented that idea to simply show how my thinking works. the idea was an amalgam of what has been proposed before by the community in many forms for the last three or more years. i took what i considered the best parts of various ideas and combined them to come up with a possible solution. it will not be my place, in my opinion, to put such a design forward immediately to the csm for a vote should i be lucky enough to be chosen from the very respectable field but as a player, like yourself, i have every right to float my own ideas for people to consider and if it is considered a reasonable solution to an ongoing problem then i will, with the communities blessing, move it forward in the same way i would any other proposal that i considered to effectively and satisfactorily deal with an issue that people consider there is in the game. to put it blunt i don't believe for a second that any one person has the knowledge or ability to unilaterally dictate the direction the csm should advise ccp in. i also don't believe the entire body of the csm has that ability either. without input from the playerbase the csm will not function and it cannot represent the playerbase. i see the duty and role of csm as being a buffer between ccp and the players whilst at the same time allowing the players voice to be more focused and louder when there is an issue that the players want raised. hope that helps."
4/28/2009,"lark hit the nail, the big reason people despise your views and carebears in general is because they tend to have a rather one sided slant; scammers, pirates etc... more often then not understand the importance of the industrial aspect of eve and have alts to exploit and support it (they just don't feel the need to shout it from the rooftops); whilst your efforts to engage with the pvp aspect of eve throughout your time in the csm are laudable, i can't help but feel you only do this simply to placate those who would call you out on it otherwise."
4/28/2009,"it is obvious that those of us who understand the take care concept, already got our answers. on the other hand most of those who insist on hearing your views, are not in the least interested in anything that comes out you or ankhe. at first, i was curious whether the arguments of your opposition would lead to anything constructive. unfortunately i understand now that their only aim was to engage you, in a rather shallow polemic about ""who has got bigger this or that"", carefully avoiding any logic that could lead them to a genuine conclusion about you and the take care party.therefore, once again i offer support from me and my tiny corp to the take care objectives. stand fast."
4/28/2009,we're currently working very hard on our next movie and thus won't have that much time to answer the forum rabble.fortunately the movie should answer some of the questions in this thread.
4/28/2009,"one - ank, they let you into afc? wtf? it is a bit surprising to me, some of their members seem very rp focused. you don't actually have to answer the question.two - can either ank or erik speak to what take care thinks should be done concerning industry and npc-pc interaction to include standings interaction?"
4/28/2009,"i prefer not to answer with the full details but some unfortunate real life events of a former afc member are at the basis of it which requires me to be in the afc at least temporarily.short answer before i go to bed, plus it would be unfair to the rest of the waiting people too if i wrote a lengthy text on this... more will come later once the rest has been answered.i've been lobbying hard to get standings available to non-missionrunners and think it is undesirable that there missions currently have a monopoly on standing (with the exception of fw, but fw cannot provide unlimited standing and neither can cosmos, which is just missions imo).ideally i want to see carreer options opened up so players can research and produce for npcs and receive standings in return. that and mining missions should pay more and the mining/astrosurveying agents shouldn't hand out so many combat missions."
4/28/2009,"[insert platform here]i'm primarily a carebear, i dabble in pvp. i play eve for the people i play with, not necessarily to ""win."" having the game be fun is my primary concern. that being said, ask me any question an i'll do my best to answer it."
4/28/2009,"was expecting this thread to be funny and full of trolls, but i'm actually impressed."
4/28/2009,i would like to vote some griefer and or troll? but are you sure you dont have a hidden agenda? also what kind of hidden agendas do other csm canditates have?
4/28/2009,"doesn't the fact that you tried to play yourself off as a girl in her mid-teens (whilst you're actually a 21-year old guy) to get some attention on a internet-spaceship gaming forum make you even less csm-worthy than when you were playing ""in-character"" to be annoying just try and get people to notice you?i'm not naive enough to believe anyone running for any type of office (even in a game) but doesn't this totally disqualifies you from engendering trust or respect amongst your peers - going from ""juvenile prankster"" to ""vote-worthy-community-member"" seems a bit of a stretch."
4/28/2009,"i always suspected that cat was a rp character! i agree with the issues raised* and will vote for cat at the csm elections. * let me put it this way. i have a feeling that this cat fellow is probably a safer bet to vote for than, say, vuk or issler."
4/28/2009,larkonis how goez the campaign? did you have any luck shaking down the united for campaign contributionz? neo spartans throwing you any rallliez or partiez? fill us in!!!
4/28/2009,"near 10% of your csm introduction consists of swear words. voting for someone who is incapable of formulating his ideas without getting rude is not my idea of voting wise. next to that you're unable to spell correctly the word 'sovereignty', which is, as it reads, your greatest beef with the game.in short you come over as a rude, angry, twelve year old.maybe you'll get my vote next time when you've grown up a little bit."
4/28/2009,"it is ""ok"" to suck to a certain degree. still, i feel that a 0.0 region should excel more than a high security system with lvl4 agents. as i mentioned, a high security system can probably sustain over 100 players. 100 players ratting in 0.0, well, i think you need more than one region.as for diversity, i'd like each region to have some sort of speciality besides different npc's. drone regions is a good example, their npc's drop components instead of loot. that is something unique, and that is what i want to achieve for each and every region. some people like drone regions because of this while others don't; different riches, same value = uniqueness.but my vision behind diversity is more than isk related. looks, feels and aswell as station and stargate models; i want it all to be unique and special. i want people to feel and see the difference between a screenshot of venal and curse. diversity and depth is key.when i first started the game, i flew around wanting to see and ""explore"" space. after a couple of jumps, i noticed all the systems pretty much looked the same. i've never enjoyed travelling ever since. :\a mission runner in high security can make some serious isk without ever risking himself to other players. in 0.0 you risk your life and ship to reap the benefits.in empire space one can get 40-50m per hour without risking your 100m isk ship. in 0.0 space one can get 30-40m per hour by risking your 100m isk ship.the point is not really about ""i want to fight"". it is to make it more inline with 0.0.there are many different ways to achieve the same thing. i want it achieved. how it will be achieved depends on ccp with csm influence, aswell as you the voters (dependent on who you vote on). e.g. #1 do not remove all level 4 from high security, only the once with quality 0 and upwards and spread level 4 agents equally around their respective region. in some systems you can run 4 level 4 agents at the same time. that can be changed. note: high security only.e.g. #2 keep the level 4 agents as is in empire space, but increase 0.0 spawn rate or size to make it ""greener""."
4/28/2009,"my english is not great because of foreign. go figure.i swear a lot? i probably do.anyways, flamebait alt, 1 out of 10. gg!"
4/28/2009,"bumping because im awesome, and still taking questions and stuff.also, left daco and joined tri. to get more pew pew in."
4/28/2009,i see the official candidate list is finally announced. with that i can move forward with my committment to drive the formation of the voice of reason party. i will have forums set up by the end of the week and everyone interested in being involved including other candidates are encouraged to register and participate.with all the candidates this stands to be an exciting election!issler
4/28/2009,"+1 interweb-credz. she can read a thread folks.can you see it yet?mr. turrek, any idea how many candidates you'll make it through, or are some of the more minor ones going to be left out unless they ask to be included?"
4/28/2009,i'd be happy to submit to an interview.
4/28/2009,drop me a line in-game so we can set up an interview. and thanks for running this.
4/28/2009,"during the last csm race, there was a csm public channel, for candidates and voters to discuss issues about the election. i think it worked fairly well, so i've started it up again. the channel is called ""csm public"", and i'll be in there a fair bit. feel free to jump in, hang around, and even advertise it a bit. also, candidates, if you want to be channel operators, just let me know and i'll add you to the list."
4/28/2009,"there was some questionnaire for last csm canditates that had something like 30questions?but is there currently any easy way to compare current canditates, perhaps a some kind of a table or a chart or?"
4/28/2009,"you can generally expect some people to ask questions en masse later in the campaign. that said, if you're not happy with the amount of info, feel free to ask more questions of candidates and post the results. there's no official media here, just interested players. a quick chart might be a useful tool, though - ask 5 or 10 questions about big topics, stick the candidates down the side, the questions across the top, and let players decide who they like. actually, this sounds like a fairly cool idea. would you mind if i stole it?"
4/28/2009,"traditionally, csm candidates are to face death itself in the form of a neverending stream of tough challenges by various forumites that most likely have already almost but not entirely made up their minds on who to vote for - and who not to. this is a good thing. here i go:please comment on every statement (or on those you feel like commenting) not just how strongly you agree or disagree, but also how (un-)important you deem the issue. of course, if you want to elaborate, do :)eve is a massively multiplayer game. there might still be some nutjobs playing this solo, but ccp should focus on their strengths and not waste time and effort on improving gameplay for this minority.when all is said, eve is still first and foremost a game. as such, every interaction should mainly provide fun for the player. immersion and continuity are a nice illusion, but they should clearly take the back seat to a streamlined gameplay.while eve currently still has some bugs, the game as a whole runs very well indeed. sure, lag is an issue, but that's not going to change as players throw ever greater fleets at every new hardware and net code ccp comes up with. instead, focus on new stuff to make life in new eden more interesting and attract a steady stream of new players as well as keep the veterans happy. roleplayers (not just those that ""pretend"" they were a piloting a spaceship, but those that talk the talk and walk the walk of their chosen roles) are an important asset to eve to provide the universe with identity, tradition and atmosphere. they should be rewarded with gameplay mechanics that improved their ability to roleplay.eve is a world of cut-throat competition and thus should reward most those who take the greatest risks and still succeed. the current insurance system reduces the cost of losing ships to such a degree that the risk of combat becomes negligeable for everyone save a noob in her first battlecruiser. this is absurd and needs to be fixed: he who loses ships more should pay more for insurance, making business sustainable for insurers. oh, and possibly improve ships the longer they stay in active service.ccp has pandered enough to the noob audience lately - it is time they get their sights back on the vets among us playing the endgame. they are the one who create the great stories of eve that are so unique to this game and that will inspire the next generation of players.even once wis comes to pass, our ships will still be the main in-game representation for most players and groups. there should finally be a way to customize their looks, even if just with the choice of a paintjob template and a couple of colours. this will not be a cause for lag as has been shown and players will be able to switch display off client-side. since everything is random in eve, every solar system tends to look and feel generic and almost the same. exploration actually acerbated this. it is time to amend this, give regions, constellations, systems and planets some individual flavor. maybe just actually fill those info tabs with some interesting background. or, better, make them differ from another in a way that actually has an impact on gameplay. npc corporations are an awful nuisance to all but a few. they are a safe haven for gold farmers and griefers in empire. introduce a rule that prevents players to stay in or return to npc corps indefinitely, maybe after 5 or 10m skill points. new eden is populated by trillions of npcs. ccp should quit hinding them on planets but make them visible and useful. npc traffic in population centres, more and more varied interaction with npc corps and more importantly planetary supply and demand in trade goods would all be nice. eve is a sand box, not a theme park. we don't want to be told stories, but write them ourselves. ccp should just hand us the sand and and the tools.more to come..."
4/28/2009,"i have to be at work in a few minutes, but rest assured i will be responding to this at the first opportunity :)back from work, on with the survey!1) i disagree. i've spent some time in npc corps, and they are populated not only with people who have just started the game, but people who, for one reason or another, choose to play largely by themselves. many of these people are industrial geniuses who, frankly, sustain the high-demand, low-cost market of tech 1 ships, modules, and rigs. they keep our markets going. furthermore, you could consider mission runners, like myself, to be largely solo players. i will engage in group pvp and mining operations, and will support my corp, but most of my time in eve is spent by myself, doing my own thing. level 4 mission runners represent a very large portion of the isk flow in the game, and alienating them would completely trash the in-game economy.2) i think the question was poorly worded. immersion and continuity assist in making the game fun for me. thus, improvements in these places help me to enjoy the game more. however, i agree with the sentiment that its a game, and if you're not having fun, you shouldn't be playing it.3) i primarily agree. operational optimization is obviously a priority, because nobody would care if they introduced 20 new kinds of ships if nobody could log on to use them. however, new features are more interesting and make me want to play more than ""btw we upgraded our blade servers! our networks can now channel the consciousness of the entire population of earth!""4) on the whole, i agree. the amount that i roleplay varies wildly with my in-game activities. for diplomatic relations and recruiting, i can get very into it. in missions and mining, however, the math-wars aspect of eve takes over, the immersion is lost, and as such, so is the roleplay. i think that roleplay gives a reason to create conflict in eve, without forcing conflict, as it does in games such as world of warcraft. i like that cooperation or conflict is entirely up to the participating parties.5) improving ships that remain in active service is something i've mused over in the past, but implementation would be tricky. what if it changes ownership? what if its unpackaged, fitted, and named, but not undocked? this would become too much of an experience points system that i think many people come to eve to escape from. the insurance system is the saving grace of many newbs, and does not really handicap immersion in my opinion. variable rates based on pilot ship losses is possible, but only if the current insurance system were also modified to account for tech ii losses, assigning an average market value at the time of insurance, something like that.6) the deeper i get into this survey, the more militant these opinions seem. there is no ""endgame"" in eve, that's part of the beauty of it. there are plenty of ""veteran"" players who choose to spend their time in empire.7) i think the system is fine the way it is. there are plenty of avenues in eve for self-expression. you want new colors, buy tech 2.8) in-depth info tabs would be interesting, but i find this to be hardly critical. the ""sameness"" of systems is broken up by the star color, background nebulas, and racial constructs, which is sufficient for me.9) incredibly militant statement. npc corps are also a haven for people who wish to escape wardecs and game politics. taking them away would create more problems among the playerbase than it would solve.10) i agree. more npcs than the occasionally ""caravan"" fleet and racial police forces/concord would add to immersion, better supply/demand mechanics would boost trade.11) i was under the impression we have the sand and the tools. some people just forget that you need to get the sand wet to sculpt it into anything."
4/28/2009,"1) disagree, because of how strongly you phrased it. eve is primarily multiplayer, but we shouldn't freeze out the solo players. i'd like to see at least half of all new content be at least somewhat soloable. this is a fairly important issue. 2) agree fully. storyline is important, but it's secondary. this is a very important issue.3) in terms of performance, agreed. there's a pile of implementation issues of other types, but game performance is relatively good, and i trust ccp to improve it at every opportunity. it can't be neglected going forward, but it's not something that the csm needs to push for. this is a very important issue. 4) mostly agreed. while i find it kind of crazy, it's a legitimate gameplay style, and a decently popular one. it should be supported well, though not at the cost of gameplay mechanics being implemented properly. this is a fairly important issue. 5) mostly disagree. you need to be careful playing with insurance, because it's disaster relief. if you lose your ship worth everything, you at least have the cash to buy the next grade down of ship(a bc to replace your bs) and grind back up. this is a case where gameplay trumps storyline, i think. i'd be fine with many changes to insurance - making it market-based instead of ""base price""-based, for example - but i think this goes too far. this is a fairly important issue. 6) disagree entirely. this year's noobs are next year's vets(or this year's vets, given the prevalence of alting), and keeping a steady flow of players into the game is essential to the long-term health of eve. besides, it's not like t3 cruisers are newbie material. this is a very important issue. 7) agree slightly. it'd be nice. that said, i'll take ccp's word on lagginess over the forum community's, and there are also concerns over dev time that relegate this to the back burner. also, you lose the ability to tell t2/faction variants apart at a glance. this is an unimportant issue. 8) agree somewhat. again, it'd be nice, but this sounds like a monumental amount of work for what is at root just a flavour issue. i don't imagine the man-years necessary could be justified. this is an unimportant issue. 9) disagree entirely. npc corps serve valuable roles, both for allowing solo play among those who don't want the hassles of a player corp, and for allowing vets to coach new players in a fairly casual environment. yeah, they can be abused, but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. this is a fairly important issue. 10) agree. low priority, but it'd be nice to have civilian traffic kicking around instead of just interactable ships, and a more natural structure for npc good trading would be useful too. low priority, but a bit of effort here would be useful, i think. this is a fairly unimportant issue. 11) i suppose i agree, but that's too vague a statement to really take a strong stand on it. yeah, this isn't a game with a railroad plot, but there has to be some structure. it's about drawing the line between ""dev stuff"" and ""player stuff"" in the right place, and the right place isn't covered by a neat little slogan. this is a fairly important issue."
4/28/2009,"although i've never really spent much time in lowsec (never could master the concept of ""gate guns"" lol), i certainly understand the griefing mentality. for me, killing belt miners and ratters has always been an extremely fun past time. i love the roaming gang and fully understand that carebear tears taste wonderful. my favorite kills of all time arent the titans or the motherships-- its the orcas, rorquals, jump freighters, faction fit marauders, and navy ravens.just because my sec status is 5.0 doesnt mean that i dont like to grief-- it just means i do it in a different neighborhood :p."

4/28/2009,that's not how i expected the lowsec ores issue to be raised at all.
4/28/2009,"i too feel that drones are due some love. they are a vital combat tool for almmost all gallente pilots, if not all the other races. they could use some spit and polish to make them a more usefull tool once again."
4/28/2009,"i'm your candidate. i'm a hardcore gallente with over 42 million skillpoints- trust me, i've used drones every once in a while.i believe that drones in general require a revamp, including a better ui (although i've experienced the previous iteration of the drone ui, and i can tell you that the current one is much improved) and more intelligent recovery methods. of course if you automatically retrieved drones when you warped, or automatically reactivated them if you jumped back within range of them, that could be easily exploited into more ohnoes overpowered gallente pvp... but having the option for the system to automatically issue a recall order to drones whenever the warp drive is engaged, that seems like a viable solution to me. sure, it won't work 100% of the time, but it means that you won't lose all your drones, every disco. i've felt the pain of being in a large room with 5 ogre iis deployed, only to have the power fluxuate in my home, and returning just in time to see those same drones die horribly.vote garthran, he feels your pain in the matters of drones."
4/28/2009,"no no i'm your candidate as i'm a hardcore gallente with over 43 million skillpoints. seriously though drones are considerably better than they ever used to be but there is certainly some room for improvement. the main thing is, and here i agree with garthan, that the recovery method needs looking at in regards to emergency warps. additionally i'd like someone to finally find a way to stop them humping each other. the recent change to the drone range scoop to 2500m rather than the 1500m that is was previously has certainly helped some of the problems i used to have especially with warrior iis where they simply wouldn't return to my drone bay and just ping-ponged across my screen until i shot them in frustration this has also helped when deploying sentries from the moros. so in summation vote for me because... ummm... i have 1m more sp than garthan and therefore feel you pain 1m sp more..."

4/29/2009,"there should be risk in everything, even minimal. what risks are there in looting other peoples wrecks while in a npc corp, getting suicide ganked?100% support."
4/29/2009,yeah .. you're a douche bag ...
4/29/2009,"whoo! i just won 5 isk of a corpmate, i was sure that you wouldn't have a polite, logical response. thank you."
4/29/2009,what do you expect when you troll ... i'll give you 5 isk to go away ...btw ... thanks for the bumps .. it warms my heart to see my post on the front page
4/29/2009,and yet no progress on this subject so far....
4/29/2009,"100% support on this one.i (or we) was the one who waited for the wt to undock,i (or we) was the one who shot the mofo after he agressed,i (or we) are the one who must pay for the damage to our ships.granted we can do level 4 missions to get the money but after you have done 200.... well after you have done that many come back and tell me you want to do another.once youv'e takin out the wt's capablitys to fight back so you can safely clear up the wrecks, you find that before you even looked at the wreck its gone and salvaged.we have all see the speed at which this can be done at 4-4 in jita, navy in dodixie or btt in rens, even efa in amarr."
4/29/2009,"so many replies... so few good arguments against this change.flagging the thief only to the corp of the ship that was destroyed is generally pointless. that guy just had his ship blown up. if he is lucky he is in a nearby station building another, if not he just woke up in a clone far, far away. his alliance mates are probably fighting for their lives while his ship is being looted. that means that as the game mechanic stands there is no risk to the thief. flagging noob alts in npc corps will not stop loot theft any more than flagging can flippers does. what it will do is force the thieves to watch what is going on a bit closer. when they do make a mistake they will have their rookie ships destroyed. since they are not really losing anything the risk vs rewards is still very low.i would go a little bit further than what the op has proposed. i would like to see the loot thief flagged to both alliances and have his docking rights suspended for a short time, just as if he had fired on someone. this does not stop people from looting but it would provide a reasonable amount of risk for the potential gain. maybe we would even see professional loot thieves flying well tanked ships. i am not against the idea of loot theft, just loot theft without risk. /support"
4/29/2009,"vuk,i'm in perfect agreement with the part on motherships, without a dedicated role for the shiptype the use of them is neither warranted nor practical.titans, the more that show up in game and the longer the debate continues i find myself wondering on whether they really are so bad or whether the bulk of the negativity comes from historic drama and damage. especially since the majority of titan pilots go awol once they finish building the ship or finishing the isk race to buy it ... i agree that for the class of ships they are they are very close to glass cannons, then again .. considering their intended purpose that does fit with risk versus reward. if you want to take a big (huge) shot at a fleet you have to accept that if you take that shot you have to prep it as best as possible ... or loose the ship in around 30-40 seconds. the doomsday itself has not been the magic red button in 0.0 for a long, long time now, in spite of there being a lot more titans now then ever before. thing is, that making sure a dd is effective takes quite a bit of preparation and some very solid teamwork. without that it is merely a psychological deterrant, something which any pro team can easily shake off and/or work around.at the same time it is amazingly easy to avoid a dd, as long as the fleet is on the ball and is working together smoothly. only the best possible baiting and trapping can really make a dd effective, and given how much work (and still .. risk) goes into that it strikes me as not being out of the ordinary for risk versus reward.i've flown titans, i've been in fleets getting titans thrown at them like silly, i've been in fleets that killed titans. i've been in ""let's sit and eat up dd so we can see if we can trap titan"" situations. aside of the notion that a ship of such a size should be a monster in terms of hitpoints i can't say it's been much drama. back in the days of remote doomsdays ... now that was something else :p0.0 and all its toys are part of what ccp describes as ""endgame content"", a ""level"" where the rewards can be huge, where the teamwork goes above all and where the risks reflect both the potential in reward and the intrinsic requirement of teamwork. even the idea of losing an entire fleet in a minute does not strike me as being out of place, considering the rewards and teamwork elements - if organisations are smart - provide for ample means and opportunity to replace that fleet. both in terms of isk and assets, typically within minutes.what i do think is that here is perhaps a niche found for the logistical element of supplies and replacements, in the light of supercapitals. then again, considering how hard it is to really wipe out a fleet maybe not.either way, i am sure it is all a matter of perception and personal experience, given how this week alone quite a number of titans and motherships went down contrasting sharply with the related subcapital losses perhaps we are making too much of the issue.still there is one thing which really nags me in the back of my mind, which is the most sensible approach on addressing the topic of the doomsday itself, the ""chance/heat/module/damage"" suggestion that was provided. while it did at first strike me as a very common sense idea, it is also pretty visible that it has zero consideration for the really fundamental problem which lies at the basis of all this .. human behaviour.reduce the effectiveness of something which still carries more weight then anything else and human beings .... overcompensate by bringing more of it, and then doing it again with again more of the same.until some concept is put together which takes titans out of that negative spiral of human sheep behaviour, no sensible solution will be found, and that leaves at best only room for kneejerking type of fixes (eve has had its share of those ....)."
4/29/2009,few others also started the same topic:
4/29/2009,"to counter that, there was an added 20sec warp scramble which affects the titan too. yes more people will bring titans, but that means more titans are exposed. the problem atm is exposure levels and the risk of said exposure. i say bring it on."
4/29/2009,1000% yes
4/29/2009,"yes, a list. i still want the four hour rule though, or maybe something else to replace it. but don't add all the missions to the list, just a random selection of 3-4 missions, and you can refresh the list every four hours (maybe increase the timer).as for the rest, um, yes sure. most of it./supported"

4/29/2009,"good idea. but i don't want to be constantly reminded, every day, that i've got x many days left before i have to pay ccp again.so it would have to be an optional feature - something you could disable from the esc menu so it won't appear next time you log in.edit: forgot to support it!"
4/29/2009,"yes, i support this feature! either this, or medium/large tractor beams. makes little or no difference to me. could even be both."
4/29/2009,it would be nice but you could have a similiar skill for salvaging. one that will give +5% to your range... would also be nice.

4/29/2009,"standings is a lower level of trust then assets when youre a large alliance and you have to set a ****load of standings, and you just need someone on at any given moment able to do it."
4/29/2009,good idea
4/29/2009,"the corp interface is in dire need of some help, and this is a baby step in the right direction."
4/29/2009,why?: there is no true armor tanking missile battleship currently so it wouldn't be overshadowing anything else and it would bring something unique to the table. and... khanid ships are gorgeous. something like this:8/5/7 bonuses - 5% siege launcher rof and 10% armor hp per level of amarr battleshipis this prioritary? of course not. but it would be a nice thing to have at some point down the road. :)
4/29/2009,"if they ever implement a third t2 battleship, i assume it'll be khanid, since carthum and viziam have theirs already. that said, don't expect it at t1 - missiles as primary weapons in ships other than half the caldari and a third of the minmatar is a thing of t2 ships, not t1."
4/29/2009,or it could be introduced as a new faction battleship. i remember greyscale talking about adding the khanid arbitrator as faction cruiser (this was a while ago) but that never happened.
4/29/2009,oh yes.... sweet idea.
4/29/2009,i would love to see a t2 abaddon. we already have t2 'geddon and a t2 apoc. why not a t2 abaddon?what would we call the t2 abaddon if it ever comes out though?/signed.
4/29/2009,khanid ships rock. i don't fly battleships but i totally support this.
4/29/2009,"very ditto. i'd love to see this, but admittedly it's pretty low-priority."
4/29/2009,would have to be a faction ship or a teir 4 bs. never going to get ccp to give a t2 khanid bs.

4/29/2009,it should be flouro yellow with hot pink hilights.
4/29/2009,now that's a brilliant idea...
4/29/2009,it may be hard to believe but miners mine ore because they need the minerals for production or isk. also if you setup a bait you do it because you know there are targets roaming around who notice it and i don't know about you but a mining op running while hostile are around would look very suspitious for me.also with the barges having a paper tank how could you possibly defend agains a hit and run attack (bombs/torp alphastrike) that takes ony a few seconds to execute with the attackers having plenty of time to set it up without having a logistics or other ship perma-repping the barges?the gatecams are being setup in systems with high trafic and good chance of getting targets. just a detail you forgot to mention.
4/29/2009,"you're missing the whole point. it still adds risk, because you don't know that your target is alone. whether or not he is actually alone is absolutely not the point.i think a local channel that tells you who is in your system without fail is the absolute stupidest idea ever. pilot 1: ""i've felt a disturbance in the force. it's as if a dozen ships jumped into my system at once and then were suddenly a threat to me""pilot b: ""yeah, that's just local; better dock."""

4/29/2009,"i'm in favor of this. btw i've never fallen for a scam myself, but it doesn't just affect traders, and it most certainly doesn't just affect local. i had a look on navy issue ravens yesterday, and there where about 100 (no, i'm not being funny) wtb raven contracts priced at 1 - 1mil isk. i've read somewhere that the contracts system takes a heavy toll on the servers, and i'm sure 100 bogus contracts does not help, let alone all the poor sods having to filter through all those lame scam attempts./signed with paw"
4/29/2009,the channel spam needs to be stoped.
4/29/2009,"hello!those who are familiar with the banks in eve know that they offer loans for collateral. now, the collateral is contracted and sometimes i have multiple items by multiple clients in the same station and i need to find the correct items for the correct customer. wouldn't it be easier if finished item exchange contracts would have a ""revert this contract"" option, where the person who accepted (in this case the bank) could pick the items that were contracted to it automatically and change a few parameters only?i know there is the ""loan"" option already implemented, but with a limit of 365 days and the fact that i cannot create the loan for the customer to accept but the customer has to create the loan (just tedious in explaining over and over again), is not suited for what i am looking for.it's only a minor change and i hope there will be a few people who would support this.thankssentry"
4/29/2009,"alternatively, make it possible for me to create the loan contract for the customer and allow an infinite loan duration for the loan contract.:)"
4/29/2009,"not sure about infinite, but multiple years isn't a bad idea."
4/29/2009,"i would support it if the loan just had a non-expiry time. make it so i as the corporation can loan out equipment to my corp members for an indeterminate amount of time.seems simple enough, and i don't know why they made loaning via contracts limited in this way."
4/29/2009,"these sound like perfectly reasonable changes. i'd prefer the unlimited duration and having lenders be able to make loan contracts, but reverting should work as well. supported."
4/29/2009,"hmm, i'm curious myself why loans are restricted...but then again, 1 year is a fairly long time. support for the topic. but i doubt its a high-priority need for eve online.--isaac"
4/29/2009,"i now have about 2 years of skills i have no current use of, and haven't for the same amount of time. but it's handy to still have them in case i ever need to use them again.also, do you really want ccp being inundated with even more unneccessary petitions along the lines of ""i accidently deleted a skill / my friend deleted my skill when i was afk / i had my account hacked and all my skills deleted"" etc?the idea of accidently deleting my skills is horrible.the other part of your proposal, to give sp to any other skills you choose from the stock of sps you gained by dissolving unused ones is nice, i admit, but not practical.i could kill my amarr battleship 5 skill, and remap it to another race, like gallente, in order to fly their capital ships, and if you did the same with the gun skills etc. you could ""hotswap"" skill levels whenever you felt like it. it would mean a pvper would only ever need to train a quarter of the game's skills, then switch out to whatever they want for that particular day, month, year (assuming you would put a time limit on how often you want to do it).it's not a terrible idea, it's just impractical and ccp have partially solved it with the neural remap function already."
4/29/2009,"just to be clear, as csm you would support fotm skillpoint reallocation?some setup gets nerfed? no problem, just reassign all your skills to the new great big thing!is that your position?"
4/29/2009,not supporting this one... i sounds a good idea but don't think this will be used that much for beginners who have mistrained in the beginning. perhaps older players will easily use this to remove a skill from something they don't use anymore so they can learn to fly something else way faster. if this would be implemented than a proper set of rules should be implemented. suppose i cant fly a bs but have lots of mining skills so i remove them so i can fly a bs. after i have done some mission i remove the bs skills and train some mining skills. this is not how the game works... beginners will perhaps loose 2 or 3 weeks of training witch is really not that long...
4/29/2009,"it is the year 3000 and what not (dunno rly), and we don't have an incoming hostiles warning system? very much supported. and for all you ""nerf local"" band wagon buddies: why don't we remove lowsec and make mission running/highsec mining the only viable income source in the game while we're at it?no thanks. wow is that way"
4/29/2009,"the part of this that i don't get is why people like to assume every ship has a ""i'm hostile!"" broadcast beacon attached to it... yes, a ship should be able to detect the type of ships in the nearby area of space. no, a ship shouldn't automatically detect who is flying the ship and whether or not they are hostile."
4/29/2009,"i like the idea of a changing world, imho eve is still way to static and could (read should) be more dynamic.planets and moons don't orbit, security status never changes... this could use some improvement. so i support point 1.but the other points... the need to be revised.<lolmood>i smell a one man corp with 50 accounts in cloaked covert ops running 23/7 snagging away 0.0 space.</lolmood>one final remark, this would have a serious impact on the way eve online runs. i doubt that for the moment it is even possible to implement this into eve."
4/29/2009,"i'm not talking about instantly changing sec status. i'm talking about sec status rising (much at the rate corp standings do) over a period of time to match the level of population. this is to help prevent parking accounts to raise sec level.in empire, that will preserve some hi sec areas for the players there. in 0.0 (as is currently) it will create a hi sec system where an alliance/corp bases itself.everything else will generally be in a state of flux."
4/29/2009,"people base on the edges of highsec, you would have a lot of people suddenly undocking in their expensive crap and dying because they dont know the new sec status systemwhich i think is totally awesome purely for greif purposes, i just dont think ccp would go with it."
4/29/2009,reread my post very slowly.i didn't give a measurement of time... if i had... i would have said so.2000 pilots squatting in a system for a day or 2 is just as easy as them rolling through town.this mechanic will either be abused... or painfully slow.
4/29/2009,"i suggest you reread my post, very slowly.i do give an indication of time. i give the comparison to corp standings. yes, very slow. to help prevent exactly what you describe. have you any alternative ideas to offer?"
4/29/2009,it wouldn't be as sudden as that. sec would creep up and creep down over a period of days/weeks.
4/29/2009,"yes, but one day after downtime some .5 system somewhere will all of a sudden become .4 and people too scared to undock in lowsec will be 'trapped'also if a .4 turns into a .5 outlaws really will be trapped."
4/29/2009,"true. how about this then?in a .5 system about to ""turn"" on the next dt, a trend arrow is displayed on the system sec rating info (top left of screen)?"
4/29/2009,"people dont log in every single day, especially casual players in empire. also if youre in a station no sec rating shows unless you go through several menu items to look up your system."
4/29/2009,"come on, think outside the box for a moment. it's quite safe.ccp have stated they are looking for big ideas from the csm. not tweak this, not tweak that. big ideas that alter lots of stuff about the game.don't make the mistake of smothering any potentially exciting change in the cloying material of current ui or minutia. it's ccp's responsibility to resolve those problems, not that of the playerbase.if the ui had a big, unmissable box right in the centre of the screen displaying the sec rating with massive flashing neon arrows showing change direction and the change was so gradual and slow it took more than a day would you then be happy? actually don't answer that, it doesn't matter.what do you (people in general) think of the overall concept?"
4/29/2009,as much as i hate to admit this... i agree with miss alt posts's alot.the idea sucks... and it would mess up the mechanic something fierce.but your not open to arguments... your too busy pushing your idea.
4/29/2009,"no, as much as i would like to see a more dynamic eve online, your idea is open to abuse and overall a bad idea. not much to say.--isaac"

4/29/2009,"do you honestly think that a person like that(who was an alt on csm1, mind you) would get on?i think it would be awful if it made him get on the csm. yet it would speak volumes about the community, sadly."

4/29/2009,"i'm not worried about this - chip mintago, xavier hayes, and anyone else throwing around money like it's going out of style are just going to succeed in making themselves poorer. this is why secret ballots exist. at least xavier is being somewhat smart about it, not giving away anything if he doesn't win. i remember being worried about this sort of thing when the csm project first started, but i was wrong - it's just not an issue."
4/29/2009,"lol this is not a problem for csm to deal with. btw dude, politicians use bribing every election. they promise a lot and give back very very little. no support. ccp doesn't have anything to change. just don't vote for the dude(s).--isaac"
4/29/2009,i'm accepting bribes for votes!
4/29/2009,"lol. why are you guys so afraid of having your free cards to grief nerfed a bit? wars aren't, and never where meant to be random griefing licenses. they where meant as a way to take down highsec pos's, fight over territory, settle a disagreement or disrupt a 0.0 alliances supply lines by denying them access to trade hubs.there ought to be objectives to a war, and a way to declare a victor. and if you declare a war without engaging, there ought to be some form of punishment for it, because yes, as long as wars have been around this has been the case. if you start a war you better make damn sure you finish it, because you can run, but you can't hide from the people you've upset.all though i'm not sure this is the way to go about it, i've not seen any better suggestions so far.thus, this gets my support."
4/29/2009,"agreed.griefers always accuse carebears of whining, but if anyone suggest cutting down on their lollipop allotment a little they howl like toddlers."
4/29/2009,"well yes, i do look at the contracts. i've never gotten scammed myself. but that's the problem: my eyes are bleeding from looking at the bloody contracts!"
4/29/2009,"very simply suggestion, make all one sized modules, sized and balance them too their size and fitting requirements:sized should be as normal, small, med,large and capital sized.this should be applied to every one sized module in the game."
4/29/2009,supporting my own thread
4/29/2009,what the blithering heck are you getting at now?because if it is what i think it is your saying then hell no.
4/29/2009,"i don't think this makes much sense. not only is there no need for it, but it would cause ccp some extensive time spent re-balancing each module and then they'd have to re-balance each ship's cpu and powergrid to probably wind up close to how the game is today.sorry crest."
4/29/2009,"i can't even tell what you're asking for, but anything i can think of that sounds even close seems like a profoundly bad idea."
4/29/2009,"he wants there to be a s, m and l version of all modules in the game (aside from some role-sepcific ones, like interdiction sphere launchers and siege modules).so basically, you'd have a co-processor l, that would have different powergrid and cpu requirements than a co-processor s, which would be intended for a frigate rather than a battleship.atleast, that's my understanding. i don't see how it would work though, or what it would improve."
4/29/2009,nice guess... but i still have no bloody idea why or what.i was thinking he was trying to scrap the high slot mid slot and low slot.somehow i don't think english is his primary language either (just observing not trolling here).
4/29/2009,"well, that does seem to fit with the op. it's a hilariously bad idea that completely misses the point, but i suppose that's no surprise in a crest thread."
4/29/2009,fully support. shame the thukkers are no longer a real pirate faction or i would have flown for them in a pirate fw ;)
4/29/2009,the thukkers would be a sweet faction regardless hehe.
4/29/2009,one way too solve this is too give the mission runner a key card that activates the first gate in the deadspace pocket that is then returned too the agent when the mission is completed.simple elegant and the scavengers can still scavenge after the missions runner finishes the mission and leaves the wrecks behind.
4/29/2009,"x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.seriously, how many mission runners spend the time salvaging wrecks? anyway, wrecks aren't owned as such, and the mission runner always has the option to start destroying the wrecks when a salvager turns up.the ninja salvagers need good skills to probe out mission deadspace. if it bothered a mission-runner too much, that mission runner could ask them to stop, offering them an alternative if they continued...if you get my point.if you really wanted to salvage and do missions, fit a decent ship that will allow you to do both at the same time. salvagers have a hard job clearing non-existant wrecks..."

4/29/2009,"interesting and very quotable really.ankhesentapemkah's repeated raising of the skill queue issue resulted in the implementation of a queue in the recent apocrypha expansion. suicide ganking was made more balanced, without completely removing the practice. battleship-sized rats were added to low-security, and 0.0 game mechanics will be the major focus for eve's next expansion. many smaller issues have been brought to ccps attention and will be worked on in the future, such as factional warfare and the problems and repetition related to mining and missions.is it your contention that ank alone made ccp implement changes and features as you list above? you seem to suggest that the countless players and threads on issues, and the other csm members that supported and voted for an issue were irrelevant in the whole process? it's pretty relevant to your campaign, as this is what you base your proven track record upon."
4/29/2009,"sounds like a good candidate, he gets my vote."
4/29/2009,/tips hat
4/29/2009,"me, personally, i'd have a harder time voting for someone who took the game so seriously that they couldn't separate their real life from this digital fantasy land.it is all imaginary and pretend, after all. but someone who can't distinguish the two, in my opinion, is probably more disturbed and untrustworthy than a player who is mature and capable of keeping his video game life separate from his real life.that, of course, is just my opinion. but then again, i don't expect any character to be even close to their real selves. girls to guys, guys to girls, *******s to preachers, pirates to hard working good-hearted fathers, nice miners to insane criminals.the moment you step on the internet, you start playing pretend. some of us can simply take it farther than others."
4/29/2009,i kind of agree with that. but telling everyone that in real life you're a 14-year-ol girl who still goes to school when you're actually an older guy... there's something weird about that. i don't think either this person is fit for csm and may have some issues.

4/29/2009,larkonis ftw
4/29/2009,larky we got ur back and our vote you not some *** who sits in one system and call them self good lol what q joke they were and still are. its kinda fun you talk so much smack united yet you never really leave ur little hole. its cute even when i was blue with you guys at one time i thought you guys were ****ing ******ed empire space ***** you call urselfs so great yet ur sill in empire ahahahaahahhah you no better that a npc. plz mate i owned plenty of ur corp mates and if i come back ill personally knock you on ur butt. any way you guys are no better than comander preditor lol what a joke untied has become
4/29/2009,"larkonis: you are a fine pirate and a fine leader. you are fierce, strong, brave, risky, and shaken by nothing. but this is not why these people are choosing you. they are chosing you because they want someone new. they want a person who will actually represent a large portion of the eve population. the 0.0 guys care only for their own alliance and alliance battles. ""how to make pos killing more fun"" or ""how borders can be better kept."" they do not understand that there is more to eve than just 0.0 life. as for the carebears, they are worse. they only think of those in high sec space due to the fact they have no idea what life is like in the areas of low sec. they only think of economy and industry. when they think of eve, they see isk rolling into their laps. we do not have that luxury. when we think about eve, we think about ship modifications, strategies, diplomatics, terriotorial gains, camping, and more i cannot even hope to think of. we think of harsh and ruthless combat. we are the ones that are truly free. or we should be. but by letting people ignore us and by letting them believe: ""oh its just pirate scum"" we never get the respect we deserve. by electing canadites such as finnegan who is ank's favorite puppet (if not alt), nothing will change. by electing mazzilliu, we let those in 0.0 run our eve lives. i for one am sick of it.the 0.0 alliances think we are pests and the carebears are scared of us and shut us out. we don't have a voice. but not any longer. not if we elect larkonis. if we elect someone who actually knows one of the greatest sides to eve, he will give us our voice. he will speak up for us. though i barely know the man, i do know (through fighting him and fighting alongside him in a war against a moltov invasion) that he is a man of determination and will not let up to anyone or anything. so finally (after ranting), i throw my undeniable support to larkonis trassler. and as with exodus, i agree: we have your back. as pirating, rum swilling, wench defiling renegades, we support you. good luck!"
4/29/2009,so as i did my application while being drunk i didn't believe that ccp would accept it but somehow it slipped through the cracks. i will be taking this seriously now.* a relook at minmatar bses* revamp of bounty system: i would like to see the ability place a bounty on a person and any person can accept the contract and the person who has the bounty can attack you and you attack them in any security status like a mini war dec. limit it to 3 people.* more control options for drones* make the corp roles and titles controls a little more user friendly.* i want to see in ambulation the ability to get drunk and it having negative affects on you for a period of time.* kill mails when the opposing ship self destructs because sucks when a leviathan starts self destructing when it touched armor.* i'm open to all ideas and usually just lurk the forums because posting on eve-o forums looks iffy i usually post on battle clinic.* i will be checking the forums daily in the morning and after work because my job blocks the eve online site. post any questions/flames/ideas in this thread.thank you and have a good day

4/29/2009,/votegl les. :)
4/29/2009,it is indeed likely that minor candidates will be left out. i had previously been using omber zombie's thread at the top of this forum for the list of names. i checked the official list today to find it contains 40 names. i have 7 returned interviews in my inbox or already posted. i'll be working on sending more evemails tommorrow night/morning. i'll post for each person that returns me answers. i'm very glad i settled on a form layout given the total number of people involved.
4/29/2009,"csm 2.0 will be meeting with ccp for the last time of our term in a couple of weeks, we have a list of issue we need to prioritize, so we thought we'd give everyone a chance to help in that prioritization. if you head over here you will find a google spreadsheet which you can edit.basically, you get to number issue 1 to 16. 1 is the most important, 16 is the least important. once everyone has finished editing the page, we look at the final figures and from lowest to highest we rank the issues for discussion. why are we prioritizing?we have a time limit for the meeting, so the idea is to get the most important issues discussed first. some take a long time, others not so long, but this way we are making sure the really really important things get discussed.what to edit:in the bit which says (name) you can put your name, then in the boxes below that you can enter in your numbers (1 to 16). there's a total number of 'points spent' at the bottom of each column to let you know how many more points you have left to allocate.if we run out of name columns, i'll add more.the spreadsheet will be locked at 16:00 on the 30th, so try and allocate points by then. the final points will be tallied and added to our own priority system.cheers,csm 2.0"

4/29/2009,"i don't remember the csm voting to do it this way (tries to find this in any meeting minutes). but no worries, the pilots of eve have every right to have direct involvement.issler"
4/29/2009,read your email :)
4/29/2009,"umm, hide station environment and restore old graphic options are the same thing. we might want to reduce the categories to 15, if it's not too late. otherwise, good list."
4/29/2009,they are 2 separate things and were voted for separately
4/29/2009,"sorry, there is no ad hoc vote via email process. business is conducted at official meetings.issler"
4/29/2009,"then your processes suck. a vote is a vote, and being able to have a vote without the need for a meeting in real time is a rather useful thing when you have reps scattered around the world. i can't speak to formal csm processes, because so far as i can tell you don't have any, but if an email vote isn't good enough, i suggest you make it good enough.seriously, how has this body managed to go a full year and two councils without ever sticking in a sentence about roberts' rules of order to make everything actually function? it'd be one thing if you worked everything by consensus, but you don't - a full year later, and people are still carping about what votes count, whether you can abstain, and other trivial nonsense that should have been dealt with in the first minute of the first meeting a year ago. absolutely unbelievable."
4/29/2009,"again, read your email"
4/29/2009,"1. (solo play) i dissagree, solo play is important as well. remember the actions of a single player can have effect on a larger number of players.2. (importants of immersion) immersion and continuity are very important for a segment of players in eve. they need to be always considered by ccp when changes in eve are introduced.3. (bug fixing verses features) defects in eve can seriously reduce the enjoyment of the game. stability isses can drive people out of the game. lag has made some promises of eve never materialized (huge fleet battles). quality has to remain a focus for eve even if it delays the introduction of new features. also new features should be tested until they are stable enough to really be enjoyed.4. (encouraging rp with game mechanics) i love roleplayers. i wish i encountered them more often. i would support elements in eve that encourage role playing, particularly in the area of player choices, for example making some choices more rewarding when they are consistent with the backstory of the races, npc corporations and factions in eve.5. (insurance not consistent with risk/reward) i agree insurance needs to be reviewed. i recently finished a war where ship losses of some classes of ships were not considered an issue, which resulted in some tactics i would have described as careless.6. (new player focus) eve is hard and that is one of the things i love about it. i would like to see more focus put on the ""middle of eve that i think represent the most players. very few pilots ever really get to experience the ""end game"" so i would be cautious about that being a ""primary"" focus for new experiences.7. (ship customization) it is embarassing to me that there are still no options to customize ships. there are technical solutions that would go a long way towards allowing players to make their ships unique without introducing lag. i think it is time ccp made this happen.8. (adding variations in systems and exploration encouragement) systems need to become more unique. again this is embarrasing for eve to have the same skybox everywhere with just a basic color change. exploration also needs to be made interesting. eve should make you want to see every system sometime in your life.9. (npc corps as safe havens) i would support looking at ways to get people out of npc corporations. in particular i think you could make it that parts of eve are not available to you if you have achieved some level of experience and are in one of these corporations. either that or make a new class of npc corps that can be involved in wars in some manner. npc corps should have more downside than they currently do. 10. (evolving npc interactions) a long time back there was a reason to hunt the convoys that still can be seen near stations. i like the idea of introducing more sophisticated interactions with the npcs we currently don't see. for example opportunities to affect markets with actions against trade vessels or changing systems politics and affiliations with enough player actions.11. (player generated story lines) there is no doubt that player generated content is the future of mmorpgs. eve needs to tap the incredible creativity of the player base.i hope these answers give folks voting a better idea of what i think and what the player base can expect if i am elected again the csmissler dainzefounder of the voice of reason party in eveceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordcsm ii member"
4/29/2009,"1. while mmos are always about group play, there will always be people who wish to do things on their own. ideally it is best to develop content for both, rather then 1 or the other. if this balance can be achieved then nothing can stand in your way.2. why cant we have both immersion and streamlined game-play? with enough creativity in both areass quality in both can be achieved.3. so far i feel ccp has done a good job of fixing bugs as well as always bringing out new content. new content is a must, but at the same time bugs cannot be ignored. while some bugs are difficult to hammer out, and sometimes take along period of time, they are still worked on. ideally a team working on bugs throughout development would help clear them faster, but that is not always feasible. a good option is to prioritize bugs in a fashion that ones affecting the player base the most would be dealt with, and all the while new content being developed. a stronger quality assurance testing is also a good way to eliminate bugs before deployment.4. i definetly think a more active reward system be implemented for roleplayers. having done some rp before in other games, it definetly increases the emersion of the game. its not always felt welcome in some aspects of eve, but none the less it is still done, and cudos to those who keep it alive 5. i am not sure on this one. insurance in most cases covers the cost of the ship itself (in a tech 1 standpoint) and not the modules. in tech2 ships, its totally worthless, as it doesnt cover the cost of the ship. while the insurance payout is nice, a lot of the times its not worth while. perhaps a system would be implemented to scale the insurance payout depending on premiums, similar to auto insurance  6. ?7. i dont agree on the point of customization for colors. id hate to see the hello kitty ravens flying around the universe. while peoples sense of humour is sometimes entertaining, you know its going to be overdone, and eventually make eve look childish and silly, instead of the dark, gloomy deadly space mmo that we all love 8. we know that the planets are due an overhaul with visuals, but step back and take a look at the scope of the universe. there are tons of systems in the universe, and while some feel generic some are absolutely breath-taking. a good medium for making more unique systems might be to generate a randomization protocol that picks and chooses different items and tosses them together, creating a more unique feel to future systems.9. i agree with this to a certain point. some people who play dont feel the need to move on to player corps, and you cant blame them, but in the end, the isk farmers is an issue to be dealt with at some point. making people leave the npc corps would be a feasible idea.10. you commented on lag earlier in this survey, and now you want ccp to toss more ships into space and cause more lag? while it would make areas more realistic, i dont think this would work out quite well. id personally like to see more npcs in wis stations, along with more interaction with them, which would make things more interesting.11. this seems like a good idea, but from what i see, a lot of alliances/players are already doing just this (look at goonswarm/bob)"
4/29/2009,"1. i really dislike ""need another friend"" kind of play because in eve it just means you should invest in an alt. i want solo play to be doable and team play to be more rewarding. -important2. eve should be fun, entertaining and involving; not wait-2-hours-to-unanchor gameplay aswell as shoot x at y with z for xzy time. -very important3. fine-tuning of gameplay and content should be done. but what eve needs the most is more depth and diversity throughout the universe. -important4. of course they should. roleplaying makes content, content makes depth, depth is key to not get bored. -somewhat important5. higher insurance for those that die often makes sense, but i do not deem this issue very important. -not very important6. one (two) word; depth and content. -very important7. this is nice to have, but not really important. -not very important8. depth and content; uniqueness and diversity throughout eve. amen! -very important9. i always hate how freighters can roam freely safe from war declearations. i guess this _could_ apply to high skillpoint players. take a look on my thread started about freighters in npc corporations."
4/29/2009,"interesting statements you made here, especially considering your name. although i'm not running, i would like to put in my .02 isk worth.1) it's been found that mmos actually sometimes encourage solo play. some people want to get their way to the top by their own blood, sweat, and tears. as it is a multiuser game, it does not need to be constant interaction. you can reward group efforts, but don't discount the soloists that grind away to achieve something.2) to an extent, i agree with this one. the fiction sets the tone, but there's a reason why roleplayers are somewhat rare (explained below).3) disagree. the smooth gameplay should accompany the new releases. if there has to be less new stuff per patch to make for a better gameplay, so be it.4) there are a few roleplayers out there, but not that many. the reason for this is simple: there is always something more to be doing in the game. it's a viable alternative already (especially with fw) for those who roleplay, but it should not be treated any different than any other role.5) agreed. there should be some kind of variable to ship insurance costs, such as number of ships lost in the past timespan or security status of said insuree. insurance is important to the game, but at this rate, no insurers would be able to stay in business for more than a day or two.6) this is a business, and as such, the attraction of new clients is as crucial as any other business. veterans already get lots of rewards (wormholes, capital ships, etc), i think it's about time ccp focused on the new player, and i commend them for doing so.7) paint jobs is one of the issues i fought for during my term as csm delegate. personalization should be allowed (including storefronts with ambulation), but has been given a backseat. hopefully, this will soon change.8) individual flavor is nice, but again, look at this from a coding perspective. coding something relatively 'simple' (the ascn titan, the monolith, the eve gate) takes a huge amount of coding time for something that most won't even see during their gametime. the skyboxes do need to be redone, but other than that, i think the game is fine as is.9) this idea has been posted many times, and shot down each and every time. npc corporations provide many reasons for players to find their own niche without hassle. i've played the political game, and enjoyed sitting in a station while gankers orbit outside. in addition, if you did put the sp limit, how many sps do you think it takes to fly a mackinaw, raven, industrial, etc? you would only annoy and alienate what seems to be 1/3rd of the players of this game.10) npc interaction might be fun, and has been proposed in the assembly hall (the colonization thread), but populating space with tons of ships would make systems even more of a lagfest nightmare. could you imagine jita with shuttles zipping about in addition to the players? there's a reason trade hubs no longer have even asteroid belts.11) yes, the players should have interaction with the overarcing story, but should not write it themselves. some prime fiction needs to be handled by developers to avoid contradictions and such. i rarely see a day where a player corporation/alliance aren't in the login screen news, and it makes for a good mix. if it isn't broke, don't fix it.these are just my opinions, but as a delegate, transparency has been my goal throughout my term of representation. who knows, maybe even some of these answers might shed light on reasons why the game is as it is for some players. overall, an interesting and interrogative query."
4/29/2009,is it just me or do the vast majority of the csm candidates seem too be pushing a pvp everywhere agenda?
4/29/2009,then vote for someone that doesn't.
4/29/2009,"i'd like to point out that i don't push a pvp agenda. i embrace pvp, but its not my primary occupation and therefore not my primary concern."
4/29/2009,"i also don't push a pvp agenda. i'm open-minded on issues and will support any issue i believe (or am convinced about) will enhance the *in-game* experience for players. i won't be supporting facebook crap or the like.i also won't be claiming to have personally changed x in eve for players. this is just plain dumb and ignores the fact that countless threads were created and commented/debated on issues by many players before a csm member adopted it. some of the changes seen since the implementation of the csm were already being considered, and this is clearly evident in the early meeting minutes with ccp.i'll also be calm, reasonable and mature in my responses, both to players and csm members. a professional approach on issues is what you'll get from me!"
4/29/2009,"the pirate types may be the most vocal, but they're hardly the whole field. there's plenty of other options if you look around."
4/29/2009,this is the truth. many of us running for the csm are not doing so to push our own agenda. those of us who have looked into what the csm is meant to be about and believe in it are here to help facilitate the communication between the playerbase and ccp. if you have an issue or issues you want to raise then do so. get in contact with a csm rep or two and ask them to support your thread. if they say no then ask them why not. bear in mind the number of issues that can be raised is limited so you'll need to get some backing from the playerbase as well in order for the topic to be considered. csm reps are not here for themselves. they shouldn't be here for one group of people either. csm reps should be facilitators and analysts.
4/29/2009,eve is pvp whether it be in ships or in the markets.
4/29/2009,there havent been much sign of that so far.
4/29/2009,"i host a show on eve-radio every sunday around 12.00 -> 15.00 gmt.i want to extend an open invitation for csm candidates to come on the show for a discussion. the plan is to have 3ish candidates on at a time. the discussion will go on between 1 and 3 hours, depending on availability and how many people sign up.post here or send me an evemail with when you want to come on. all discussion will be over skype."

4/30/2009,"if it affects base agility, this would be perfect for abs and mws.just a suggestion. i don't think this issue will gather enough steam to get any real action, but it's worth the shot."
4/30/2009,yes.
4/30/2009,its not yours till you scoop it.killin the enemy is only half the jobno vote to dumbing down pvp
4/30/2009,"yep, i'll sign that."
4/30/2009,"i read that, but that is not exactly a countermechanism. instead it supports the human behaviour twist, even reinforces it.an fc has 4 titans ready to throw on the field for the usual triple dd + 1 standby. since they are going to have added time on the field, he is going to make sure he not only has a dedicated carrier support group ready but also a second titan group .. just to be absolutely sure he can control the field and what comes on it. should his targets escape a dd, or have a trap ready, or even just be quick in replacing ships from a pos, he will strive to control the situation.ergo, again we are back to being sheep. truth be told dd's and titans are not the problem, it's us flocking them which is the problem. if we want to work around that, we should look into not making it worth bringing more then a given ratio to a field (think of a game design element which kinda works like the nodes in eve when you dd so much the thing comes crashing down :p)"
4/30/2009,"i love the mom changes. for titans i say boost their defensive ability and just let them fit siege modules instead of dd. afterall what the hell is the point of xl weapons without siege modules? absolutely none, bs weapons do more damage. maybe ccp thought about fitting titans with siege mods and then scrapped it. why else would they allow for xl weapons to be fitted?"
4/30/2009,maybe your doing something wrong but anywayrule number 1 . dont fly what you cant afford to lose.bs cost 20 times as much as a cruiser but they dont have 20x ehpthe more and more you spend on a ship the less you get back in terms of additional firepower and tank.this is true at any ship level and there is a reason.the reason being if dps and ehp were proportional to cost new players would find it more or less impossible to get into the game in any meaningful way.yes moms are expensive but the 20x they cost over carriers is fair for the 2x dps and 1.5x tanknot signed
4/30/2009,"you're right, battleships instead have about 10x the eft, 2-3 extra tankable slots, triple the dps, and about 4-8 times the tank of a tech 1 cruiser, not to mention a much larger drone bay, and god knows what else i've forgotten. titans do not get siege, nor should they. they do not get a huge bonus to hp over dreads. no extra slots beyond highs and maybe an extra 1 mid or low. they're slow, they're stupid, and they're 1 and done. their 1 weapon is so ridiculously overpowered and under performing it's really a joke to even try to expound on the 100 post before. mom's are even worse because baring a cyno jammed system, they have no greater role than a carrier. in fact, 2 carriers are about 1/8th the cost of a mom, insurable, have the bonus of rr each other, equivalent firepower, etc. so the question becomes, why a mom over a carrier. oh yeah, and carriers can dock which is far less risky than a cap ship maintenance array. this allows the pilot to be far more flexible and effective for far less cost."
4/30/2009,"supported, just about everything else have small, medium and large versions these days"
4/30/2009,"why yes, i would love to fit 160km tractors at 4 km/s on my marauder"
4/30/2009,so would i! :)(already supported)
4/30/2009,implement it and make fitting requirements hard i suppose
4/30/2009,no.
4/30/2009,"i support this. i also support yorda's suggestion from another thread to:quote from yorda:2 gun slots 100% damage role bonus5% shield boost amount instead of missile rof3/6/5+15% cpu/end quoteit seems that this would clearly define the role of the naglfar, and ccp could only object because it takes away the split weapon systems that they originally designed."
4/30/2009,"supported, but keep the nag as an armor tanker, us nidd pilots would then have to train the shield skills according to your plan.."
4/30/2009,"*le bumpe*nudgin dis to the toppa da pile, as its important like,"

4/30/2009,meh then you have the problem of how can people sit a titan in a pos to open jump bridges without letting blues into the pos. seen kenny do that alot - looks really paranoid but it works.

4/30/2009,"need to be able to access it either by each member and bring up their access for every station, etc.. or by station bringing up which members have what access..."
4/30/2009,this area needs looking at. but hardly a radical idea.
4/30/2009,"what's the big deal? so you have to change your password every so often - cry more.supported.there's some epic pl hate going on here, it's pretty obvious, and it's a lot more pathetic than a bunch of alt support. account security is a serious issue, above and beyond whatever is going on in 0.0. grow up, haters.edit: forgot the thumbs up."
4/30/2009,sounds like a good idea.
4/30/2009,good idea. i need to change my password more.
4/30/2009,"i, too, support account security."
4/30/2009,"or just give graviton physics a bonus to tractor beams, which would make sense.either way, supported."

4/30/2009,"nah - these, like gscs, need some kind of upkeep associated with allowing them to continue to hog up limited space.leaving the tower offline tying up a moon, only turning it on to defend if you get wardecced, is kinda lame."
4/30/2009,war dec the corp and blow them up.
4/30/2009,"i like the idea of removing the tower after a month. but i am worried that people will keep resetting the timer by placing a small amount of fuel in the tower.instead i would suggest that if a tower is offline at downtime it will take damage. the damage should be hard enough that a solo player in high sec would have to spend at a good chunk of his time rring the tower to prevent it being destroyed.i'd also suggest having the damage applied to the shields, armor and structure even when the shields and armor do not hit 0, just to put in more work for the guy who didn't fuel his tower."
4/30/2009,also works... but i prefer gradual loss of health after 24 hours of being offlined.
4/30/2009,"can't fully support this, sorry mate. what i would support is a proposal to have control towers lose structure or be unanchored after a certain time period. allowing scooping and/or easier destruction. the latter would be more important in hi-sec where dreads/carriers cannot be deployed."
4/30/2009,this is my topic.i support my topic.
4/30/2009,already raised in csm1.
4/30/2009,want/signed
4/30/2009,then lets raise it again and hope it gets done.
4/30/2009,"uh huh. a game with a stupid feature like that couldn't possibly last very long. and certainly not six years or more...hmm, maybe it isn't that big of a deal afterall."
4/30/2009,"you too .what prevents you from opening the map and checking the number of pilots in system in the last 30 minutes? and you know if the target is alone. pilot 1: ""i've found a carebear mining op.""pilot 2: ""wait it could be a trap!!""pilot 1: ""checking map ... situation a: ""10 ships on scan, average number of pilots in system in the last 30 mins 12. nope it is note. opening covert cyno. jump in."" situation b: ""10 ships on scan, average number of pilots in system in the last 30 mins 40. it is a trap!!!! x up we need numbers!!! they won't know what hit them.pilot 2: ""ok."""
4/30/2009,"you're right, lets get rid of that too ... but at least that's a little more iffy than a smack-dab-in-your-face list.this is such a ridiculous statement i won't give it more than this derisive mention. your logic needs work."
4/30/2009,"personally, i like delayed local. maybe 15 minutes."
4/30/2009,delayed local for a period of time depending on your ship size.
4/30/2009,"delayed local, whether by time or ship size strongly benefits the hunter/roamer/invader and penalizes locals/ratters/minders/defenders. ""recent speakers"" mode is a better solution and works equally for those already in a system and those who are jumping in."
4/30/2009,"i am against this proposal right now as it makes finding the target you want to pursue (for example enemy militia or your war targets) pretty much impossible.having to be in the same grid as someone to know if you want to fight him or not is absolutly ridiculous. the only people who want this are killboard-*****s who don't care who they're engaging because they have no tactical or strategic objectives to their conflicts.also there's a huge difference between wh-systems where everything needs to be probed and you're pretty safe if you're on your toes, and k-systems where you have fixed things such as stations and belts, where the attacker would have a huge advantage.at the very minimum before this can be implemented you need to:1) have a way for people in stations to scan the outside grid2) change asteroid belts so you can't simply jump someone in a couple of seconds (as a suggestion, make asteroid belts like cosmic anomalities, you can detect them with 1 probe or the onboard scanner (maybe having a survey scanner gives a scan time/range bonus to the onboard scanner to make it easier for miners ?), but you do need to scan them first - no more right click warp to them).3) probing for ships with combat probes and directional scanner gives you pilot information (alliance/corporation/sec status - preferably early in the scan for probes, not when you get a warpable hit)."
4/30/2009,"i think in order to consider this situation fairly we need to stop putting the onus on people to explain why the idea is so much better than the current system while everyone else quote-snipes them, and instead go for a reasoned debate as to the merits of each system, preferably avoiding subjective generalisations such as 'more fun' or 'unfair'. here are a few to get you started:instant local:- makes the game safer for players who want to avoid pvp- already in game, so no development time needed- helps war targets find each otherrecent speakers local:- realistic- allows cloaking ships to actually be invisible- introduces more opportunities for pvp- proven to work in w-space- makes scouting actually require some skilledit: just realised i was an idiot when quoting someone."
4/30/2009,"if their is a faint sig added for cloaked ships, id be 90% sold.not sure about the cloak/cov ops cloak argument.a way to know whats outside the station before you undock, would i think be needed though if local was finally fix'd.what about a gate activation warning if u hold sov3+ in a system to all alliance members?or is that protecting those carebear 0.0 players to much still?"
4/30/2009,"a consistent number/value display is definitely a feature that will help just about everyone.and why they don't just write the decimals all the time is beyond me.imho, the same could be said when entering values on the market's sell screen and send money, the screen should expand the value to the full format with thousand separators and decimals. having the value written out is less of an issue to me."
4/30/2009,"allways displaying the amount in millions/billions to 2 decimal places would be enough to stop this kinda nonsense me thinksso 1,989,999,999 will display 1.99 billionso 1,999,999,999 will display 2 billionetc."
4/30/2009,part of the reason this scam took off was due to it getting posted on scrapheap imo
4/30/2009,"i think the exact words thing would be a good, low budget fix to help mitigate the scamming.however, this is popular because it works: it will become less popular as more people learn of it, and fewer fall for it. a post on c&p claimed a guy had made over 10b in a couple weeks doing that: i don't know about you, but that blows my mission running income out of the water. why wouldn't you do it?one solution currently in the works in md is the creation of player made trade channels, such as the scc lounge. this forces players to actively app an admin to join the channel, and gives the player community the power to enforce a no-spamming rule, with minimal risk of a player block grief voting folks out of the channel. the more we look to player moderated channels, and away from system (non-moderated) channels for interesting trade opportunities, the sooner we can just ignore the noise created by these spambots.but, thumbs up for words on the contract - it's how we do checks, and really any large sum of money, in the real world."
4/30/2009,"based on the fact that not displaying two decimal places in contracts is a oddity compared to the rest of the eve ui, i support this."
4/30/2009,"i think allowing the lender to make the contract would be great.i am not so concerned about the time limit, nor do we realy need the revert option if this reversed loan contract is implemented.what would be great though, i think, would be a fee to be billed to the person receving the isk at the end of the duration (intrest payment) and a request extention or extend option next to the fail option that is there already.this option when used would reset the status of the loan after it has expired (so new period and a new fee bill at the end of that)"
4/30/2009,"i think it would be an utterly dreadful idea, for several reasons:(1) everyone flying the fotm(2) at the moment sp don't equal levels, because no matter how many you have you cant do everything. your proposal would go a long way to changing that.(3) make your choice, take the consequences: a fundamental tenet of eve.(4) would greatly advantage older players over new players.not supported. strongly opposed."
4/30/2009,"i petitioned to have two skills that i don't want removed, just because they are an eye sore. i have caldari frigate injected, as well as small hybrid turret 1. i will never, ever use these and just want them removed to prevent the eyesore that is my character sheet. as for pooling and reallocation, no effing way. but pure deletion, yeah, i'll go for that."
4/30/2009,and then people wonder why it takes so long before petitiones are answered
4/30/2009,removing sp is pointless and something you will likely do when drunk.reallocating sp will never happen.
4/30/2009,"i don't see the point in this, i have tons of skills i never use and have trained to lvl 1 sometime or another, especially since i tried starting out as a miner/manufacturer.about the flawless skillsheet and eyesore get real and stop training every damn skill on it to lvl 5 just to make it ""look perfect"", you are wasting your time."
4/30/2009,ok as long as you dont get 100% skill points back.recycle skill points at 50% would be cool.as long as you dont have any other skills dependant on it.
4/30/2009,"agreed. no skill is truly wasted, and you obviously (at some point) wanted that skill.the most serious problem i can see is draining off prerequisite skills while keeping the more advanced ones. for example, if you could drain off spaceship command without first losing all the skills that depend on it (and there are a lot of them, when you look at the inter-relationships).so no. not now, not ever."
4/30/2009,"can't support this. feels too much like respeccing in wow, which then brings on the whole host of constantly switching specs for different aspects of the game.bonus lolz for feeling like you wasted 18mil sp on a ship/game mechanic that got nerfed. that is the flipside of fotm - when you know some aspect of the game is too good to be true and go for it anyways, be aware it may be rebalanced."
4/30/2009,"here is the issue:currently players in an npc corp can use logistics capabilities to aid players actual player corps, without any repercussions or risks of combat.why not make it impossible to use logistics modules/ganglinks from npc corps to player corps. gangs across player corps would have no problem repping each other, while using npc capes won't help them anymore."
4/30/2009,solution - corp b gets npc pilot with ganglinks to give corp a something to whine about.
4/30/2009,"fix'd, and supported."
4/30/2009,are you one of those sad people who likes being able to run around doing what you want with impunity without anyone being able to shoot back?pathetic.
4/30/2009,well when you put it that (efrim's post) way... i guess it makes sense.i guess i'm used to seeing whiners throw a fit when its obvious you should do like wise back at im.alright.. i support but so long as its that way and not the other way.
4/30/2009,no... i'm one of those people who points out the emo-rant-rage posts who have horrible writing skills of a troll.
4/30/2009,"thanks for phrasing it so well, i'll amend the op."
4/30/2009,"as much as npc corps provide a certain safety mode, players can also simply endlessly slip between corps to dodge wars: i fail to see how this solves anything other than making dishonorable folks do more of what they already do (jump corps to dodge war decs)."
4/30/2009,:<maybe you can give me english lessons.
4/30/2009,.nope... i have really bad grammar and spelling myself. : o )
4/30/2009,i would also like use of logistics/ganglinks across players corps to cause aggro - would you support this?
4/30/2009,at least the flaming/trolling is keeping this thread on page 1.
4/30/2009,"if they're ganged with a war target, you can shoot them.i see no problem here."
4/30/2009,untrue.
4/30/2009,"that's the way it use to work, has it been changed? i cba to check in game.and the problem with npc corp logistics isn't that they're possible, it's that repping doesn't cause an aggro timer so they can dock at any time when threatened."
4/30/2009,"to re-direct back to the central topic, ignoring the flaming, and the misunderstanding.the point here is not people slipping between corps, or repping each other. it's people in gangs, that have gang bonuses. i.e., something that increases weapon damage or resistances.there is no penalty to ganging with several out of corp people and getting stacked bonuses for a fight. the person giving a bonus is not targetable as someone giving direct repping. while it is only passive buffing, there is no reason the person should be without risk. whether passive or active, if you're part of a fight, you're part of a fight. this would only make it so everyone in the gang is target able, not just those who rep and shoot. all of them. it won't matter what corp they are in, if they are in the gang during a firefight, and nearby, they can be shot.this should not hurt anyone. if you still want to have an alt hiding in another system giving a bonus, that's your prerogative, but at least now he will blink red for those doing the fighting."
4/30/2009,"logistics onto a war target currently flag you for aggression, which is just fine. gang links might work with a similar solution - anyone providing gang bonuses to a flagged player is also flagged - but that's touchier, since it's something that happens passively. for that matter, it'd probably bring back the lofty scam. convince a player to lead the gang, steal from a can, and have your buddy shoot the sucker leading the gang. something might be doable here, but you'll have to be careful abut how you do it."
4/30/2009,i like shooting people
4/30/2009,"i support the op - running ganglinks should not be without risk.however, i think that rr on a target causing aggression doesn't go far enough.the reason being that it is still easily exploitable, you can undock, rep, dock when locked and fired on, and repeat.i would propose that any form of logistics results in the same effect as shooting/tackling the target - a 1 min timer which prevents them from docking."
4/30/2009,"not supported. i wouldn't really care about the sec status stuff, but your moon minerals idea is terrible. making them shift would force interruptions in the supply, which would cause the prices to spike even more. i don't really care if your tiny alliance doesn't have the manpower to take an r64. get bigger, get a capfleet. do not try to change the mechanics to suit yourself.say it with me. supply and demand. you reduce supply, prices spike, and there are way more people out there whining about high t2 prices than there are whining about r64 lockdown."
4/30/2009,"all i have seen so far is ""this sucks"" not really any informed argument as to why and possible alternatives. so until i do see reasoned arguments i will continue to push this idea, yes."
4/30/2009,state how please and let's think of ways to combat it instead.
4/30/2009,"massive, totally incorrect assumption there, don't fog the issue with unfounded comments.i agree there may be fluctuations, but the supply would also be be largely freed from megablob control. unless of course, the megablob are active then they can easily take locate and take control of the resources. seems ok to me."
4/30/2009,"heh, i just realised you would have the classic mafia style ""drop land values through crime, then buy out the lot"" game going on.it sounds interesting, in a way, but if .5 can flip to .4, more needs to be done about graduating that line down. currently there is too massive a difference between concord being guaranteed to show up, vs guaranteed not to show up. grey that line, and dynamic shifts would be more acceptible."
4/30/2009,we can make all the informed arguments we want.... your hearing aid would still be turned down.it's not our fault your blinded by your self imposed brilliance.
4/30/2009,"lol, quite funny but only 1/10 and totally incorrect. so come on, any tweaks to this? major or minor? anything that can make eve dynamic? limit only to security at first and let the big boys sit on the pots of gold or maybe another idea for moon/belt resources?"
4/30/2009,"hmm. interesting idea and thanks for pointing that out. yes i think another poster covered that too and you are right, it's an issue that needs addressing somehow. i'm pretty much stumped though...unless the idea of fluctuating sec ratings is limited by range to current areas classed as low sec/hi sec/0.0. would that work or would that make the whole exercise pointless?"
4/30/2009,"i actually kinda like this idea, but i'm sure it would be a major technical untertaking. it would need to be balanced very carefully, both in terms of how slowly system sec changes occur and how large population shifts have to be to alter system sec. it's a very radical idea, but i think worth talking about. i worry about ways such a change might make the game less dynamic, however - high traffic could permanently eliminate low-sec choke points, for instance. i'd be curious about ccp's opinion.also an interesting idea. again, would need to be very carefully balanced.this is the one area where i disagree with you. sovereignty is a very touchy subject, one that ccp's already thinking about, and i think there are other, more elegant suggestions on the table for changing how it's structured. i'm a fan of the model where sovereignty is maintained by control of gates, for instance, but there are a lot of ideas out there, and ccp's already going to do whatever ccp's going to do about it.i'm giving you a thumbs up anyway overall; some creative ideas here.i was almost afraid that drake and i were going to agree on everything after the last couple weeks. guess not. =p"
4/30/2009,"1: empire areas.i'm with tesseract on this. a good idea. needs careful implementation. commentary needed from ccp too. needs work.2: asteroid belts/moon miningi think that would work for asteroid belts. mixing and matching those is a good idea. i remain unconvinced for moon mining though.3: sovereignty.as tesseract d'urberville mentioned, if there is something on the table from ccp - maybe your suggestion won't be needed.it needs more thought anyway imho.overall, interesting out of the box thinking and worthy of more discussion. i support some elements of this as stated, giving you an overall thumbs up."
4/30/2009,"i have a proposal that i think would go a long way towards making war decs work as intended:declaring an empire war should work in regions, and should require establishing an empire based (high or low sec) pos in that region. add a diplomacy module or some such that would be mounted to a pos. the aggressed corp would be made aware of which pos/poses are allowing their aggressor to operate.the main point of this is that it gives the aggressed something to attack, as was claimed in some other ideas some kind of victory condition, that can allow them to win and end a war, and return to normalcy. by contrast, a lot of merc and pirate corps use wars to take down pos and grief, but they themselves have little to lose if they don't have a pos up or conduct any empire side logistics, and can often therefore maintain aggression indefinately.recapping:the aggressor will have to defend at least one nearby target to maintain the war.the aggressor will have to maintain logistics to at least one pos in the effected area.i'd do this in place of the existing isk for war mechanic, though perhaps requiring separate diplo modules for each aggressed entity.issues:what if an oligarchy claims all the moons in a region, and becomes invulnerable to war?a: there would need to be a balance where a handful of low sec systems were considered within the range of such a high-sec blockade, either base it on jumps or ensure there is enough low sec within each empire region. you can strike low-sec pos without an empire war. might need some tweaking to prevent massive security hits.i can't hire mercs/friends to defend me if they don't have presence in the region?a: correct! this would work both for pirates and anti-pirates: in order to operate in spite of concord in high sec, you have to own at least one asset in high sec, giving your targets a fair vulnerability to counterattack. so if a merc counterattacks a pirate corp, the pirates have a way to try and retaliate against the mercs too!"
4/30/2009,"well, and of course i'm going to support my own idea:)"
4/30/2009,"there are many changes to the wardec system that could be useful. this is not one of them. poses are annoying enough as a mechanic for 0.0 fighting, they don't need to be expanded to cover highsec too."
4/30/2009,as intriguing as this idea sounds... forcing wars to take place with established assets to defend... it would cause alot of headaches and be too drastic a change.not supported... but clever..i'll give you that.
4/30/2009,"it's an interesting idea. it would certainly reduce spur-of-the-moment grief wars, because the declarant would need to be engaging in soul-crushing pos maintenance at the same time, and griefers that are in it just for the fun won't do that.destroying a defended pos without the help of dreads, though, is extraordinarily difficult. it invites blobs and soul-crushing fleet battles. and i don't like the idea that it becomes harder to hire mercs.i think this proposal is an unintended blow to the most legitimate use of wars: to challenge a dominant corp (or alliance)'s control of resources. requiring the declarant to maintain a pos makes it much more difficult for a small corp to legitimately challenge a big one for resources in areas of scarcity - a small corp can fight smart using small gangs, but forcing them to defend a static position, especially against a well-heeled opponent, puts them at a huge disadvantage.i like that this is a creative take on a difficult problem, but not the solution to that problem."
4/30/2009,"sorry, but anything that forces people to do anything i will simply not support. your idea would be crushing and cause a lot of crying. --isaac"
4/30/2009,"i had to fly around to get all my skill books so you should have to suffer in the same way^^ is what most of your detractors will really be feeling when they come up with an excuse as too why this is a bad idea.its not, it would make much more sense than the current situation, i also hate flying to agents in this age of ftl comms.good idea supported , trade issue is irrelevant skill books make up about 0.01% trade in eve."

4/30/2009,this probably should be posted in jita park.

4/30/2009,"hello heartstone. long time, no see.how do you feel about ice? specifically, ice mined (sometimes macro-mined) in empire, purchased by null-sec, and jumped to 0.0, in complete safety, to support massive tower buildups and pos-spamming?you see, rather than mine their own fuel, it is easier, with current jump mechanics, to simply purchase from empire. that way you don't have pvp'ers having to defend fragile mining craft. with the generous bounties null-sec offers, it is far easier to simply buy what you need from empire.should a needed resource be this risk-free? do you think this allows null-sec alliances to claim more space than they use? does it allow a death-grip for super-alliances which keep the small guy out?if ice belts in empire were removed or severely cut from the inexhaustible resource they are today, do you think that would 'shake things up'? cause fighting over resources?would raiding an opponent to prevent him from mining fuel have an effect? would he be forced to 'lock down' his ice belt systems? would this offer a reason for people to roam in gangs other than just killmails (i.e., the ability to hamstring an opponent)?how would you feel if someone proposed removing ice from empire?"

4/30/2009,"tbh, i'd vote for someone that has actually played and experienced pvp instead of fw..."
4/30/2009,"i'd like to expand on my platform a bit more. if tl;dr is the case, my previous post is an adequate summary.i want to continue to make eve inviting to new players, without reducing the complexity and depth that has caused the current playerbase to stick with it for so long.i want to continue to reinforce ""soloable"" content in eve. while the players in eve that play in small, casual groups, or by themselves, are not the most vocal group in the forums, they do exist, and they do need love now and then. we've seen many additions encouraging large group play, and while i think large group play is great, its not the be-all and end-all. i like my tech 1 production. it has low overhead, minor effort, and as a result small profits. but i don't have to operate daily mining ops and 2 poss in 0.0 to do it, so its fine with me.drone aggro in missions. a relatively small issue, but one that many fulltime mission runners can agree, is a problem. in the past we've been promised fixes, as random mission spawn groups aren't supposed to aggro drones, but it has taken a distant backburner to many other in-game issues. we mission runners would like to be able to use our drones in missions without having groups immediately kill them, and then fail to re-aquire other targets when the drones are recalled.i know one of the issues that is rolling through the forums is 0.0 sovereignty. i'm going to say right now that i don't know anything about it, and have not experienced it, so i don't have an intelligent stance in it. sorry.expanding faction warfare. in pirates of the burning sea, the port ownership system allows traders to deliver ""unrest materials"" to local npcs to increase the chance of the port becoming contested. a similar system, allowing traders and miners to participate in faction warfare, would be great as well. i recognize that the basis of faction warfare is structured pvp, but many people would also like to participate merely for the roleplay aspects, which i think should be encouraged.expanding npc presence in eve. i am an avid fan of freelancer, and one of the great things about that game is the presence of, and interaction with, npcs behaving as normal people might. in eve, the player is a pod pilot. the elite of the elite. chronicles tell us that there are many pilots and spacefarers out there who are not capuleers. and yet, except for npc police, concord, and the occasional trade caravan encountered outside a station... civilian, everyday, normal people seem to have vanished from the face of the universe. our only interactions with them are saving them from herons deep in contested sansha deadspace complexes, or transferring them to a processing and screening center 3 jumps away for a meager reward. i would love to see more npcs. npcs you can talk to. chance encounter missions, rather than just missions issued from agents. maybe a transport ship with a structure fire sits 25km off of a station, you approach and hail him, and he tells you about how he's the only member of a convoy to escape an ambush, and he asks you to intercede on the behalf of his compatriots.changed insurance mechanics. variable rates based on market averages, determined at the time of issuance, not the time of collection. a system that possibly accounts for recent ship losses and security status when assigning premiums. insurance is a great tool to help newer players stay in the game, but it needs to be changed to make losses feel a little more real.more may be added later."
4/30/2009,ok if any one needs me i am in game as well most days from dt until late
4/30/2009,"this is an overview of my platform as a candidate for the third council of stellar management. for more information on any of the points below, just click the links. why i'm runningpolicy: user interface- i will work for the implementation of a modifiable user interface, to allow each player to play the game in the most comfortable and efficient fashion for them. this will be carefully monitored to ensure that macroing is not made easier by this change. - i will work for the implementation of improvements to existing areas of eve's user interface, especially the poorly-implemented areas like evemail, the in-game browser, and the official forums. policy: csm internal- i will ensure better communication between the csm and the player base, both by creating more accessible reference materials for players to see what the csm is doing, and by streamlining the assembly hall process to allow the csm to see what players want more effectively. - i will look into the possibility of moving the csm debates to a publicly-viewable forum, to allow better debate among csm members and to allow players to better see what their representatives are doing and why. - i will attempt to create a streamlined process for small issues that don't require much debate, so that they can be considered more easily and not ignored. - if i am elected as csm chair, i will resign the chair and allow a vote of the csm members on who ought to be our chair. policy: gameplayi have opinions and policies about many areas of gameplay, but the below are some highlights. - i will look into ways to make lowsec more habitable by players. this will include both an increase in lowsec profitability, through mechanisms such as new ores(thread) and better exploration sites, and the ability to gain ""lowsec sovereignty"" to allow players to defend their space without losing as much security standing. (thread)- i will work to add new epic arcs to the game which will allow players to recover low faction standings with a significant time investment. (thread)- i will look into new skills which can reasonably be added to underused skill trees, such as corporation management and trade, with a special emphasis on the addition of charisma-using skills. - for all other proposals, i will work to improve the game as a whole, rather than one favoured part of it, i will ensure that proposals i make are well-considered and reasonable, and i will consult with players on proposed changes. about methank you. if you have any questions for me, feel free to ask, either here or in-game."
4/30/2009,what kind of charisma skill set do you think would improve the gameplay in eve? or do you only think of changing the primary stats of several other skill trees into charisma?
4/30/2009,"i wouldn't change any existing skills - it opens too big a can of worms in terms of players picking their attributes to train a skill and then not being able to do so properly, and it doesn't make sense in terms of the fluff either. instead, i'd like to see new skills added, mostly in corp management, but also a few in trade or social. leadership would be nice to add to, but there's really no new skills you could put in there unless you added a new ship class. under corp management, there's room for half a dozen skills related to pos gunnery(e.g., ""+5% damage/level for laser turret arrays you control"") and probably eight or ten skills related to a new feature of corporate management i'd like to implement(there'll be a thread on this topic in the next few days). there's probably room for 2-3 new social skills, such as one to make it possible to reject missions more often, and 2-3 new trade skills, which i'm drawing a blank on right now but i've seen a few good threads on in the past. i think that they'd all help the game in their own right while also helping to balance the charisma problem effectively."
4/30/2009,"ccp has stated that they know about these issues, and have a team working on improving them. while it's good to reinforce these issues, we aren't supposed to be vultures about them.this seems to be the same thing many other candidates are trying to achieve. realize that in these meetings we talk about some very sensitive subjects, and they have to be reviewed before the public can know the results or even what was said. also, the mechanics may be debated, but they are firmly in place and work, so not much can be done about them. some things might work, but this is mostly spitting against the wind.this is the meat of your run, it seems. you have some valuable ideas here, and some improvements could stand to be made to many of these issues.in that, i have known herschel since before the election where i was voted into office. i think he has the potential to be a great csm candidate."
4/30/2009,"go eve-search for it. cat pretended for months to be a teenage girl, claiming ""she"" was cute, claiming ""she"" hadn't been able to play because she was grounded, ad nauseum - there's a difference between pretending to be an internet hardman and indulge in ad hominem attacks (like me, say), or someone (like you, say) who just loves to talk (post) a lot for the sake of hearing themselves talk (post), and then someone who does what cat did and adopts a whole new personality just to elicit a certain reaction.i don't personally care that he likes to pretend to be a teenage girl to annoy people/get attention, but that kind of behaviour makes me not want to vote for them or have them representing the player-base as i find their motives questionable."
4/30/2009,"you know, i really do like to read my own writing. but then again, i admit that ruze is absolutely nothing like the player who posts through him, hahahah ..."
4/30/2009,"thank goodness i'm not like cat at all. i couldn't handle being so happily naive all day. i'm actually far more dark and brooding. all i do is roll cigarettes and shrug.anyway, i don't really want to derail this any further, but i have some remarks regarding some of the above postspeople came to a lot of conclusions on their own. things like being grounded etc, these were just excuses for me not logging on this char... i planned silly anti-pirate ops, which i could never attend, and that was part of the joke. i thought saying i was grounded was funnier than admitting i had stuff to do on another character.i don't think i've stated what my age was, except maybe in rancer local. i decided to go <16 to try and stop them asking me to ""post ****"" the whole damn time. as for gender, i do refer to myself as a she. mainly because i selected 'female' when i made this character. not to wax lyrical over my posts satirical, but cat is the polar opposite of what a lot of people consider a 'proper' eve player, and that is where the fun has been. a lot of the attitudes towards me have been generated by the forum populace, rather than directly by me. i can post once in a thread, and the next thirty posts might be about my single post. that's not my fault. there are people out there that take me far more seriously than i take myself. with that said though, i mentioned some of my real life experience in an attempt to demonstrate that i can actually put my mind to something serious, and do a good job at that."
4/30/2009,"i dont think i got it, but: what is the top 3 points in your agenda to ""improve/change"" in eve ?"
4/30/2009,"you know, based on the op in this thread, i'd likely have voted for you. but really, the lengths you went to to maintain the cat persona frightens me a bit. not to mention that it was borderline trolling. i freely admit that i took the bait as well, got smacked down for it too and made you break character to actually post a coherent reply.i guess i just can't grasp your motivation for intentionally ****ing off a large percentage of forum dwellers, the same people who are likely to bother with voting."
4/30/2009,"cat just get some ideas out of your head:1. what are the top 5 things that need to be rebalanced in eve?2. should local chat be changed/removed?3. how would you fix the risk/reward system, which is currently broken?"

4/30/2009,one item i would really like to have implemented is a pirate module that temporarily jams ship communications so when an affected ship is attacked in high security space concord does not show it's overprotective face and you blast the frightened little carebear with impunity. this might be an easier change to implement than the concord bribery discussed earlier in the post and it would only apply to one ship at a time. like a warp scrambler. ohhhh the possibilities

4/30/2009,you've got my vote extreme
4/30/2009,"here's a list of a few game innovations i'd like to see added to the game, and only adding one or two would be great.please review and comment, but if you comment please be good enough to explain your point of view -- i'm not worried if you agree or disagree with me, but i do want to see some more thought put into responses other than trotting out the ambiguous crap of ""well, i'm not sure ccp can or will do that"". 1) ring mining. yep, we've got cloud mining, ice mining and asteroid mining -- i think ccp has a good creative opportunity in adding the mining of rare and/or unusual materials from the rings of ringed planets (example: saturn).2) renegade concord. just once in awhile i'd like to see a ""rogue"" unit of concord just haul off and start busting empire heads. huge potential for political story arcs from ccp's side of things -- nasty crap if you, the player, are in the wrong place at the wrong time, but wtf, ccp is always billing ""eve"" as a dark and cruel world so where's the harm? ;) ;)3) player habitats. much like those ""residences"" you see in some missions, i'd like to see mini-structures like these for players as an option. launched like a pos in empire space (you need standings and charters), or anywhere in 0.0 as usual, and the player always needs some ""pos fuel"" to keep the lights on. i don't suggest as much fuel as a pos, but that depends on how it's designed and if there are any secondary structures or ""upgrades"" available for the player habitat. great way to colonize 0.0, too, which i know many folks are always yammering about.4) rare materials in loot drops. as an alternative to the infrequently mentioned concept of allowing high sec moon mining, i think for the harder missions (level 4's) some of the loot drop generation tables could be reworked to include drops of moon minerals, advance materials, or whatever.afterall, these big nasty pirates come from ""homeworlds"" in deep, dark places beyond the enlightenment of empire space, so just how hard is it to rationalize that any particular ship, let alone bs's and ""faction"" ships, are carrying some of these rare materials as cargo/loot? not hard at all.5) reducing loot drops -- see various forum threads on that controversy -- allegedly as a means of rectifying the oversupply of minerals, specifically rare minerals, that would otherwise be coming from 0.0 sources.personally, i don't give a rat's azz -- but in the interest of ""game balance"", 0.0 can not be the only source of 100% of all rare minerals and/or advanced materials.whether it's something like minimal amount npc sell orders of such materials (not a real big fan of that) or simply the rework of the mission loot drops (see my 4th point, above) for high level missions -- i'm just asking for a bit of balance in availability that has nothing to do with 0.0 supplies.6) q-ships. for those not familiar with the term, it's an armed merchant ship, with all the external appearances to appear harmless while it's heavy guns sit hidden on deck.i'd like to see this kind of ship added to the game. plenty of fun here, and plenty of skills could be added. basically, i propose the ships graphics look just like various ""haulers"" of several sizes, but that they are pure deception because they (the q-ships) scan that way.however, q-ships captains could have some unique skills to learn that enhance their ability to ""fool"" any scan into believing they are a harmless hauler, while the usual list of suspects would need to train some better scan skills, or even a new skill or two, to improve their chances of ""seeing through"" the q-ship deception. adds a whole new twist to the ""ganking"" profession when you suddenly find yourself being gunned down by ""that harmless hauler"".enjoy, debate, trollify, ad nauseum ad infinitum. thanks in advance."
4/30/2009,"1) are you intending to add new materials, or just find already existant ones in different places? either way, it would be a neat immersion quirk, but hardly seems a priority to me.2) concord are pretty harsh. i think that they would do a good job of watching their own ranks. inserting random ""you die now"" events in the game, especially in highsec, would do nothing to encourage new players or entertain existing ones, in my opinion.3) i've seen these suggested before, and having now spent some time in lowsec and wormhole space, i can agree that these would be useful. anchorable for the player, not for the corporation. limited powergrid and cpu. incapable of moon mining or supporting reactors. inherent cargo hanger/ship maintenance array. something to that effect.4) some loot drop diversity would probably drive mineral prices back up (question 5) and would create a small, expensive, but low-risk source of rare materials. i like this idea.5) see above.6) i've seen these proposed before, and i have to again say i disagree. the mechanics to create the ""deception"" would be a pain to implement (the game says you're flying one thing when you're flying something else, and what a person sees depends on his skills? seems complicated to me.) and in order to gun down a ganker, the q-ship would require some pretty good combat qualities. i'm thinking around battlecruiser abilities, to be honest. we have transports already designed to avoid ganking by means of escape mechanisms. if you want to kill gankers, don't fly transports."

4/30/2009,"so, much, cringe."
4/30/2009,yes we got a new movie.i really should have added a scene where we whack some trolls.
4/30/2009,"i'm hardly their biggest supporter, but that is completely uncalled for."
4/30/2009,understatement
4/30/2009,"agreed. totally. despite not liking what the ""take credit"" party represents for the csm an attack on someone's accent of their non-native language is pathetic in the extreme. please come back when you can speak dutch and german without an accent."
4/30/2009,"[sarcasm] yes! finally, somebody takes credit for all the changes that were implemented in this game. obviously, the take care party were the sole ones for credit for the 0.0 changes, the skill queue, and so many other improvements to the game, aside from the fact that the party didn't exist before the new elections came up.take care - your party for all credit for changes in eve! [/sarcasm]sorry, but that seemed amazingly egocentric, considering that the csm is a team effort. most of the issues you boasted about you alone didn't pass, and the ones that didn't pass weren't mentioned (medals, etc). you had a good run, now let somebody else take the limelight."
4/30/2009,"bunyip, i also raised this point in erik's thread...yet to recieve a response from him though. given the documentary evidence in past meeting logs, you are suprised at the egocentricity?i'm wondering why take care felt the need to start another thread for this announcement...doesn't erik have his own thread...oh, wait..."
4/30/2009,"we've merely stated what we have been working on and contributing to, we're not saying anywhere that we did it all on ourselves. take your bickering elsewhere, as it really isn't productive and i won't bother replying to these outlandish statements from now on.oh and take care exists since july 2008 and erik has been my advisor for a long time now. i'm sure you all remember my old campaign site. got any more fantasies?live events - handed over to me by jade and wrote a nice addendum for that, so checkapocrypha feedback - check, who raced through the epic mission arc again?dev/player communication - check, working even now to gather questions for petur and set up a system that the next csm can use...skill queue pt2 - check, plus the reply i sent to ccp the first time...so what are you talking about that i didn't raise those issues???the movie wasn't even officially released yet at the time due to technical difficulties with the flash player (you may notice the absense of play controls?), i can't help it that some forum guy finds it and this turns out to be a massive troll thread eh? as far as i can see, siigari isn't a member of take care, now is he?seriously guys, your negativity is astounding."
4/30/2009,removed. navigator
4/30/2009,"1. every account of this game i know of states that it's definitely not fun to play solo all the time, but everyone goes out solo at least once in a while. solo pvp and solo moneymaking ought to always remain viable options.2. i think that luckily spending more energy on one does not really detract from the other, since it's completely different people working on the two.3. just because people throw ever-bigger fleets at each other doesnt mean we should just throw up our hands and give up. eve's massive battles on a single instance are one of the biggest things that makes it unique and a top competitor in the mmorpg marketplace. maybe improving the lag will not help people outside of the largest alliances, but it isn't people running solo missions that put eve in the videogame news either.that said, the new player interface still needs a lot of work to flatten the learning curve.4. aren't they getting ambulation soon(tm) anyways? they seem to do pretty fine on their own, they are better at creating their own ideal worlds then the rest of us players. some of the most stable and long lasting alliances in eve are roleplayers, and i guess that tells you something.5. losing ships has become quite a joke for t1 ships and large alliances with their reimbursement programs, etc, but for the little guy losing a ship is still a big deal. also the insurance program helps keep mineral prices stable. while removing it would make my alliance's warfare options more interesting, i'm against it due to the wider reaching consequences for eve.also consider the fact that t2 ships are better, preferred by players, and their cost does not reflect the insurance payment- so you could say a lot of ships in use today are already not very insurable.6. ccp should pander enough to the noob audience to encourage a slow growth of players. not too fast to overwhelm ccp's capacity, but not too slow to decrease the overall population. considering all the eve ads im seeing on every webpage ever for the past few months, ccp wants or needs more newbies. i think this sort of decision is really more in the realm of the financial then the player vote.7. having more features is cool. dictors with the pl phage on them would be cool. but i dont really care a lot about it, and i imagine it would take a lot of time to go through every ship model to do the changes.8. way too many systems to do this. if they did that for every system, they would have to do it randomly too :)9. ok so we will have a crapton of alts and newbies in one member shell corps, that will dissolve if they get wardecced. eliminating npc corps didnt work for caod, it wont work for the game.10. more crap on my overview.11. i thought roleplaying alliances already did this. also eve politics itself is a storyline we are writing ourselves. we got plenty of tools."
4/30/2009,"1. (solo play) disagreed - the difference is not as hard as your statement suggests. take the market as an example, where massively multiple players make a difference, without the use of any interactive mechanic like the corporation system. i prefer to think in activities and content. and there should always be a portion of the game suitable for soloplay, because not everyone can or wants to wait for a bunch of friends to team up.i also think you underestimate the amount of solo or semi-soloplayers (players that play mostly solo content such as missions, exploration and solo-mining but are part of player corps or hang out with groups of friends) in this game. from my experience this is a rather large group. and a group which is often marginalized here on the forums or simply brushed aside as 'lame carebears' and whatnot. solo pvp is a problematic part of the game which i hope should be improved through tradable kill rights, redesigning the bounty hunter profession.2. (immersion) agreed to some extent - we all hate grindgames, and silly and tedious tasks. unfortunately, eve has a lot of silly and tedious tasks: just think of pos setup and the logistics involved to maintain them. the ui should be another focuspoint, especially on the r&d and industry side.then again, and as garthran has said, the backstory is pulling all things together and provides the consistency for all activities. when some action takes time (e.g. anchoring), then it should be for the purpose of someone else possibly interfering with it before you complete that action.3. (new content) disagreed - perhaps not bugs, but ccp's gamedesign is not perfect and they implement too much unfinished content. forgotten factional warfare, not-so epic mission arcs, tech 3 and sleeper loot are examples of unfinished or poorly designed content. while the game should stay moving forward, i would rather have ccp finish existing things properly before rushing more half-baked goodies out the door. as i said in another thread, finishing the existing content needs to be done in a way to still attract new players. this demands both well design and the right marketing to sell the update as new stuff.so instead of giving us tech3 (which only affects a small upper segment of the players anyway) they should have overhauled old content that annoys a lot of players, such as the development of 0.0 space and sovereignty (which we are finally getting at the end of the year), the mining mechanics and lowsec ore problems, and finalizing things such as factional warfare. the extensions possible and required here can still be designed to make the whole aspect look new.4. (role play) agreed - once again, this is a matter of preferred playstyle, but i think there should be much more social networking tools available that benefit all playersin general and roleplayers in particular. we all know that the bio is severely limited. just like the standing system, which is also overly complicated, especially if you want to sync it with a few of your friends or allies. there should be more ingame tools available to give your character a personal touch, a more refined history (could mean success and criminal record), and keep track of what your enemies and friends have been up to lately.5. (insurance) agreed - insurance needs review. some ships can be produced for around the same cost as insurance pay-out, which is unbalancing in a conflict and opens the door for all kinds of undesirable gameplay. on the other hand, any changes to the current system should be subtle and cautious: as long as the risk/reward balance for factional warfare players has not been adjusted, the insurance system is heavily interleaved with that part of the game, and young pilots, too, require this parachute.[...]"
4/30/2009,"[...]the real-world car insurance system provides interesting improvement aspects: the rates are higher not only depending on car types, but also on the car type's and any particular driver's crash history. the region in which you live also influences the rates, and the rates decline over time. now, thinking of eve, ship type's and pilot's crash record are easy to determine. as is the age of the ship to insure or the renewal of the insurance on the same ship. the region in real-life could be simulated with standings: as long as your actions improve your standing to the insurance's faction (this should largely apply for fw) you get bonusses on insurance.6. (end game features) disagreed - ccp should not focus on either group, nor do i think they did so in the past. but they should develop content for all players. the (sovereignty) end-game needs a lot of work, but the new player experience still is not what it should be. learning skills are just an example of game mechanics that discourages new players.7. (customizable ships) agreed - and ankhesentapemkah has found out that ships are already painted, as their textures are mostly just greyscale, with the client turning parts of the gallente ships blue, etc. and the interbus shuttle is not only another example for the paint job (with a corp logo on there) but the market price shows the importance of this aspect.8. (art work coherence) agreed - ccp already has plans to actually show some constellation things in the backgrounds instead of the generic skyboxes we currently have. likewise, npc-occupied space should have more to show that than just some different flavour of rats at the belts and exploration sites.9. (npc corps safe haven) disagreed - npc corporations are thriving communities of solo-players which compose a much larger chunk of it than the griefers and spammers that give npc corps their bad name. a lot of casual players simply do not have the time nor the interest in player-run corps, and i do not think this valid playstyle should suffer in any way because of some bad people that abuse the npc corps. luring people out of npc corps can be done in more subtle ways than suggested. there are other and better suggestions on how to aggravate null-sec war supply. and makro mining can be complicated otherwise.10. (complex npc interaction) disagreed - while the intention of this is amiable, this would tend to foster solo play, reminding me of the old days of railroad tycoon. i think, player-player interaction can largely be improved at less server cost and with more immersive drag and long-term fun. npcs should be used as a medium to exercise impact other players and not be the goal for your actions per se. take care has already pointed out factional warfare as a part, where more environment and backstory impact could be implemented.11. (sand box) agreed - all the npc stuff is nice, but in the end it should be the player that is the one to determine the outcome. to me, personally, colonizing wormhole space is a lot more exciting than fighting just another kind of npc, read sleepers. while big alliances already provide some player-to-player content, participating there has too many other dependencies. i am all for programmable npcs that allow the players to write content for other players (including rewards for both parties, of course) and similar tools like that!"
4/30/2009,"thanks for your replies, everyone. some surprises there, i think, and i'm glad for the extra information. i hope others will find this interesting as well.edit:mayhaps i ought to clarify. those statements are not my own opinions. they are there to allow candidates to position themselves between total agreement and violent opposition. some i do agree with, others i find absurd. some i'm not sure of and some i don't really care either way ;)will make another thread with more of those i think."
4/30/2009,"i disagree i think serenity, omber and deirdra have all shown these qualities."
4/30/2009,i most definitely am not a pvp everywhere candidate. i'm all about eve staying enjoyable for a wide range of play styles and interests.issler
4/30/2009,"help me here. i'm a little confuzled.i'm reading a couple of these posts, and i keep seeing four little words popping up. ""i have no agenda."" and it bothers me.why don't you have an agenda? how are we supposed to know what you support, and don't support? how are we supposed to know who you are, and what you'll argue for?how, if you have no agenda, are we supposed to know whether we'll vote for you or not?maybe i'm getting confused. i thought the csm was a 'representational government'. government, of course, being used loosely. for representatives to work, the players come together and they each vote for the guy or gal who is the most like them, who supports what they support.to vote for these people, you have to know what their agenda is. it's the only way to know who to elect!how does it work, then, if they have no agenda? are they noncommittal? are they likely to swing one way or another, at the drop of a hat? are they saying that they are open to bribery and coercion, since they don't particularly stand for anything anyhow?if you don't elect the representatives to speak for you, why do you elect them? to just take votes on a forum visited by probably less than 5% of the playerbase and conclude that this is majority opinion? i would think that if ccp wanted majority opinion, they could achieve it easily through simple in-game polls. don't you agree?so, change my mind if it suits you. tell me why i, or any player, should vote for someone who is merely going to pose as an inefficient and probably biased (though admittedly so) ballot box?why should any player care for or support those who won't stand up for what they believe in and truly be representatives of the population?do you have an agenda? i would love to know it, cause i don't think i could vote for a candidate that wouldn't stand up and admit what they truly want and desire."
4/30/2009,lets cut to the chase: everybody is biased.i ran for the market discussion folks. i also tried to represent the mac people. however it was obvious that they weren't vocal enough for the others csm members to even consider that they have problems too.
4/30/2009,"that would be an example of representation, though. whether it's representing a minority or a majority, it's still representing a valuable and necessary portion of the playerbase. not just 'popular opinion.'"
4/30/2009,i have a clear agenda. i have identified a segment of players that i intend to represent. i have posted a lot about my thoughts and have my past actions in the csm ii to show that i have acted in a manner consistent with my platform.if anyone wonders what i think or who i want to represent i encourage them to read my past posts.issler
4/30/2009,"i'm not interested in focussing on specific areas of gameplay, as what seems to be overlooked by most people running on specific agendas is how those changes have effects on other parts of the game they either have no interest in or don't realise exist.with that thought process in mind, i find i can sit back and evaluate each proposal in itself as well as how it will interact with all the other game mechanics of eve. i'm not saying i get it perfectly right every time, but i find that blindly arguing for 'x' because it will improve 'y-style' gameplay without actually thinking about what it will do to the rest of the game overall is negligent.so, i have no 'agenda' other than overall game balance and the improved experience of everyone playing eve."
4/30/2009,"i largely agree with you. consulting players is important, of course, but the single best way to consult with players is during the election. sure, it's easy to laugh at 8% turnout, but do you think 8% of players participate in forum debates? you're lucky on some of these issues to get 8 players, never mind 8%. in order to represent players best, they have to be able to judge you at election time - they won't keep on top of the assembly hall 365 days a year, but there are some who will read your platform and judge you based on that. i'd vote for a friend based on simple trust, but for someone i don't know i want to get an idea of which way they're going before i give them my vote. this is part of the reason why i tend towards such long platforms - yeah, the forum regulars know me, but the average voter has to figure out what they're getting based on nothing other than what i say. they may not agree with all of it, but they should at least get a sense of what i stand for and how i'll do the job if elected. (as an aside, this is why dishonesty is so bad in politicians - their word is most of what we have to judge them on, and if we can't trust that, our vote is worthless because the people can't judge the politicians until after the fact. democracy is based on the people being at the root of the decision-making process, but a dishonest politician shatters that link, and subverts the democratic process.)i think a lot of the reason why the csm was formed was to cut through the static of the forums and get a better sense of the will of the players. it's easier to get the will of the players when the players have to think about policy twice a year, and can just play the game the other 363 days. but if candidates don't have policy, they can't make their decision at election time sensibly. it's nice to be consulted, but what it often boils down to is ""in order to have a voice if you elect me, you have to spend six months as a forum regular"". conversely, voting for a candidate with a known agenda means that you can make your opinions known and walk away with the ability to trust that your voice will not be lost simply because you'd rather shoot things than type things. none of this is to say that a lack of an agenda implies that you're a bad candidate. oz can hardly be described as a bad csm member thus far, platform or no. i'm just saying that it feels wrong to me to ask people to vote for me without really telling them what they're getting out of it. some voters may like it, and that's fine for them, but i want to know what i'm getting before i cast my vote, and i want to make sure that anyone who votes for me has the ability to do the same."
4/30/2009,"it seems like the different sorts of ""agendas"" boil down generally to pvpers vs industrialists, pirates vs carebears, or however you want to define people wanting to boost their own style of gameplay. but this is a videogame not a country, and our differences are not so vast in comparison. everyone wants to fix broken game mechanics, noone wants useless ships, noone wants ships that are better then all the other ships.oh and for the record i'm a 0.0 big alliance pvper with past experience in piracy, solo pvping and some industry. some of the issues i talk about will only really make large alliance warfare improved (without making the game worse for everyone else), and other issues i talk about improves the game for everybody. i really cant imagine any csm candidate voting against a good idea that would benefit everybody, just because it doesn't benefit his specific agenda more. so i dont think its really that big of an issue."
4/30/2009,"i read agendas not as broad demographic blankets, i.e. the pirate agenda. everyone has those. its the basis for running. my agenda is solo play, carebearing, new player experience... empire space with a little low sec. the agendas that many claim not to have are specific political affiliations in-game. for example, it would be hard to believe a member of organization x if he told you he is interested only in improving the game in general, and not creating advantages for organization x. generally these political agendas relate to large 0.0 alliances. and in that regard, i lack a political agenda. i don't live in 0.0 because i hate 0.0 politics.i hope this has helped to answer your question."
4/30/2009,"i would like to participate, but i work a night shift, and am generally asleep during that time period. if we could arrange a prerecording at a later time, i would love to participate."
4/30/2009,"i would like to draw attention to the questionnaire that was sent out in the interests of the csm election (along with my answers):if you'd like to participate in my interviews of the csm candidates, just send your answers to me at simpleliberty@gmail.com.what is your ingame name?psycho*****links to your forum thread and site."
4/30/2009,this probably should be posted in jita park.
4/30/2009,"umm, wrong forum for this. go to jita park. this is for issues that need to be brought to the attention of the csm. unless your claiming to be an issue?...--isaac"
4/30/2009,"the many areas of eve online harbor different types of players, carebear and pvper. pirate and industrialists ect a big debate that has been going on for a while is how to get more people interested in lowsec/0.0 space. a lot of people are tired of seeing players sit in a npc corp and amass a ton of isk and other items without really having to risk much for it. while some might view this as a problem, others might view it as game mechanics.now, i am not saying that it wouldnt be nice to get more people out to lowse/0.0, but it is intimidating. hearing about the 1000man fleets beating each other to death with large clubs (or in this case, titans, capitals ect) it does seem very daunting. hearing about roaming gank fleets and gate camps blocking your way seems scary to a pure industrialist, which is why they stay in empire space.now i play mostly as an industrialist in empire. dont roll your eyes at me with that statement, as i have lived in 0.0/low sec for almost a year far back in my life in eve. i was part of an alliance that tried to make a go of it in pure-blind, venal and tenal, teaming up with iron and the other forces at the time. while it was decent for a while, things got to ugly for to long, and the alliance couldnt hold up, and eventually fractured. this caused a lot of my alliance friends to split off to other corps, and spread out throughout the game. i moved back to empire, and have pretty much stayed here, just minding my own business. the corp i was with previously joined another alliance, and i partook in as much pvp as i could, wanting to learn this fine craft and to become a more active member of the alliance core. in the end things toned down a bit more and i still spend time in empire, doing my things.with that backstory out of the way, low-sec/0.0 space is a daunting area for people with little knowledge/experience of what to expect. there are a lot of people who are interested, but dont want to take 1 step into lowsec and end up getting it chopped off 2 seconds after they enter. i think a good step to fix this is to change the local to be more like wh-space, where y ou dont know who is exactly there with you, friend of foe, or it could be empty. to me, this makes it a bit more interesting, for both pirate and non-pirate. pirates will have to develop more finesse with their craft of removing people from their ships/pods, while non-pirates will gain a sense of adventuring into the unknown, not knowing who or what is there. it might garner a sense of security not seeing all the bad-ass guys in local waiting to pounce on your meager pod."
4/30/2009,no local will only end up with less people venturing to lowsec
