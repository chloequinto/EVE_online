4/1/2017,"so i've got a question, when did the narrative in regards to ""earning a plex"" change?back when i got started, i asked the very same question, and the answers i got where inevitably ""it is possible to do, but it isn't easy, it will likely be a year or more before you have the skill and experience to do it in any reliable fashion. don't focus on that for now, just enjoy the game, learn to play, and before you know it you will be there""well i didn't take that advice, i was determined to plex my way to glory, and so i mined, and i missioned, and i built, and was so risk averse that the mere thought of low-sec made me feel sick. and i never did get that plex, and it burned me out, time and time again i would try, and time and again i failed.until eventually i did take the advice, and i started playing the game for the joy of the game, and i learned to stop fearing low-sec, and null-sec, and i started exploring wormholes, and having more fun than i ever did before, and yes i kept doing industry because i actually enjoyed it, and low and behold 3 years on (with some large breaks in between) i looked at my wallet and saw i had enough to spare for a plex... but by then i didn't care anymore, i was more than happy to keep up my sub and use that isk for more fun activities.now, 7 years in, i have 8 characters plexed, and my main which i still keep on a subscription. and am enjoying the game more than ever, but the narrative seems to have changed. now when new players ask ""how can i plex my account"" they get bombarded with suggestions and ideas, far more than any new player could even make sense of. and the vast majority of those ideas, are frankly not feasible for someone brand new to the game.its not a matter of sp, but of player experience that makes most of the isk making methods effective, and if the newbros keep chasing that isk, they will never learn to love the game the way we have, which means they will just burn out and never gain that experience.maybe the solution is for us to go back to the way things where before, maybe we need to be a little bit less helpful, and more hands off, tell them to just enjoy the game and have fun with it for what it is, and worry about that fiddly isk and plex buisness later. with alpha accounts its even easier to do that than ever since real world finances aren't even as big a concern anymore.eve is about the journey, not the destination."
4/1/2017,"as a rather new player myself, i'd argue that the downpour of support from veterans is what got me hooked on this game. it's been fun chatting with people about their experiences, reading blogs, and applying bits and pieces of what i see to my own game. i **** up a lot, and i've found some advice to be garbage the hard way, but i feel like i'm getting better at the game and enjoying it while i do. players obsessed with isk and plex will have a tough time regardless of how much support others give them, as you've pointed out - it's the players looking for a good time who you provide the most value to.i wouldn't give up on being a helpful bittervet just yet."
4/1/2017,"there is a difference in terms of support from veterans vs. ccp, imo. the former is interaction with another player, the latter is not. interaction between players is good in that it is likely what keeps players in the game.the plex narrative is largely bravo sierra in that no new player is going to buying a plex with isk (without at least selling a plex or two first--i.e. he could do that and then try to play in the plex market). appealing to ""think of the new player"" is a common basis for a plea for some change to the game some player wants....usually to their benefit."
4/1/2017,"exactly, when i started, yeah there where people out there plexing their accounts, and even then it was a selling point that it was something you could do.but it was always promoted as something further down the road, almost end game content as it where. it was never promoted as something realistic for new players to work towards. but thats exactly what i see happening now, and sure, some people manage to accomplish it, but for most its just raising false expectations, which is bad for player retention in the long run."

4/13/2017,"the problem is not overcrowding, the problem is that there is no enough sand in high sec to build sandcastles from in the sandbox. so people are forced to take their shovels and buckets and venture in to lowsec to get more sand where they actually end up not only not getting sand but losing their shovels buckets and carts along with the fun and excitement of the prospect pushed back to no sand highsec.yes i have. and every time it ends up with a fight. every time. as a newbie it always ended up with me dying. and for what? i mean there is not even a valid reason here. just a couple of days back some of my friends went to low sec, they were ganged within 5 minutes of being there. when asked why, the answer was ""because its fun"" their assailant being someone with hundreds of millions of sp, thousands of kills mainly just in that very system, my assessment is, that system is claimed by that person who spends their days not harvesting it or using its sand to build something but waiting for unsuspected newbies to come for that sand in order to just kill them in cold blood just like that because he can..and he finds that fun. killing ventures and frigates and mining barges with full t2 and above ships and equipment. i analysed that persons victims etc, it was all just weaker targets.i am sorry but that is an awful waste of sand. how many players probably quit because of that very person who in reality may even be making enough from all the kills to be buying plex and not even actually giving any revenue to the game. funny how dystopias work both ways ;)i have teh right to give feedback as a player. ultimately, i will pack up and go to a better game that fits my idea of fun, but while i am here, i will give feedback. i am not expecting that this feedback will be listened to or that something will be done to address any concerns my friends and i may have with the fun of the game. however, i have been playing mmorpg';s for more time than eve itself exists and i do like to contribute with my feedback to the ongoing evolution and development of the games i play. i am not expecting that you agree with me. but do not think that your points are more valid than mine. you are but another player on equal standing as me. you are not better, you are just different with different likes and preferences.i find many people challenging me with this kind of approach ""who are you to suggest such a thing"", so arrogant and self-centered it is amazing. but i am not here to point fingers at any one person. i just share what i think is union in the game and what others and i think would make the game more fun from our perspective. and i think i have the right to do so as a player on equal footing as anyone else playing eve. the game's universe maybe a dystopia, but reality is not. and unless you come over and start paying for my omega accounts you cannot tell me to shut up or tell me that it is hubris for me to express my feedback."
4/13/2017,"there has not been many counter points worth replying to because the counter points make assumptions and provide false premises. my suggestion for expanding high sec is not about having more space. i expressed in many replies. it is about accessibility to more content. the game is boring in high sec, and those who do not wish to engage in pvp or be pked dont have much choice really for more fun.expanding highsec to include more lower systems will give access to people in empire space to more content. and i am talking about a total experience here not just pve.i do not wish to push people out of their fun, if that is what you think. this is not my type, i am not a dystopian type player, a criminal or a scoundrel. you can keep all that to yourself if it gives you fun.i am the cooperative type of player, the builder the organizer and honorable type. you will not see me attacking an unsuspecting newbie, or miner, explorer etc in low sec nulsec or wh space. i find that behavior cowardly and criminal in nature. i will fight for two reasons, in self defense or for the defense of someone else. soi would attack the coward ganker and the criminal. i like to pvp but also for a good reason, not mindless slaughter and certainly not for bragging and all that bull i see on youtube etc. we should be applauding people who courageously defended the miner from the ganker. and the place is full of videos of gankers patting themselves for having killed a victim who had no chance to fight back in the first place thinking that they just accomplished something great. it is dumbfounding to watch... i best most are wow rejects..who came here to ""gank"" and brag about it... *rolls eyes*..anyways.having said that. yes i am very open to consider alternative to make the experience in high sec richer than it is. and while i may have a hard time justifying lowsec, since i find it is filled up with cowards, criminals and scoundrels in game, i have to consider these people also as players and as such i am not better than them either and they have the right to their fun too.if lowsec is your fun by all means keep it. but then if high sec becomes richer in terms of game experience do not come complaining that no more victims come to low sec to be ganked. right? i would expect you would have no issue with high sec having same access to mineral resources and missions and opportunities as low sec, the only difference being security coverage.you are claiming the right to exist within what you consider fun. but in that case you must at least recognize also the same right of others even if their view of what is fun is different than yours. does that sound sensible and fair?i understand this as expressed above. so the alternate approach is to leave lowsec untouched and make high sec much better in such a way so that it doe snot feel constrained and limited and boring. see, many people in low sec say that they do not like to play the game in nulsec, because large alliances and fleet stuff is not their thing, but then go and demand that high sec players should not have rights to fun and should adhere to the established order..their order in reality.and that is unfair, don't you think? you do not like it when i suggest that you should be pushed to nullsec, because you do not like to adhere to that established order. now you probably understand how high sec players may feel too in turn, when low sec come and start spewing about, ""live with it"", ""it is a dystopia"", ""no safety"" "", deal"" etc,..from my perspective here it looks like low sec players are demanding from high sec players to deal with it, but then are crying themselves when expected to deal with it in turn. it cannot work like that.and this is what ccp needs to finally realise. the game attracts many kinds of players, it has to offer a niche of many different kinds of play styles which are not affected directly by the others, but remain open and are not insular as to permit players to jump from one another as they evolve or their preferences and likes change within eve.the days where you force everyone in to one way of playing should come to an end."
4/13/2017,"there is plenty of sand in highsec. there are vast swathes of space that are empty and full of resources for you to mold into whatever it is you want to build. the sand in lowsec is essentially the same, with some looser rules on who can smash each others' sandcastles. why should you get to take their near identical sand, and kick them out of the sandbox just because you don't like such rough sandcastle play?what you are looking for is new types of sand, or perhaps more toys that work in your section of the sandbox. and it looks like you are getting it with an empire-focussed expansion that is coming our way next winter. will it make you happy? i have my doubts but ccp has pledged to give the players what some of them say they want. at least though, they are not doing it by wholesale demolition of large sections of the game like you asked for. please tell me how many quit - i'd love to see your numbers. because, about 10% of the player activity takes place in lowsec. that is thousands, actually tens of thousands of players who pay their subscription each month so they can build, fight, and gather stuff in lowsec. there is your hubris again. how do you have the right to tell these fellow paying customers that what they like is a ""waste of sand""? i get it, it isn't your thing but you have to be so blindingly self-centred to think what you like is what everyone else is looking for in their video game. of course you can give your feedback, but i am equally allowed to give mine and call you out for what you are: someone who is trying to gut the competitive aspects of the game that brought and keep me here and transform it into something else they want it to be. what you are doing is equivalent to walking into a restaurant or say tennis club that has been operating for 15 years and telling them they are doing it wrong. it's one thing to suggest that they add a particular dish to the menu or repaint the clubhouse, while it is something completely different to demand that the chef stop cooking meat dishes because you don't like the smell, or for the tennis club to demolish a third of their tennis courts and put in bowling alleys because you actually prefer bowling over tennis. one is giving feedback and ideas for added value to the place, while the other is asking for fundamental changes that negatively impact the current customers/members. but yes, feel free to tell ccp their long-lived and profitable sandbox mmo is doing it wrong as is your right. however, don't be surprised to be ignored just like a decade-and-a-half of similar agitators who have begged, pleaded, argued, threatened, and yelled in these forums trying unsuccessfully to get ccp to throw out their vision of a full-time pvp sandbox game and virtual universe and turn it into something else. further, don't think you won't also draw the ire of the players who do love this game as it is and who don't appreciate selfish players asking for the current game play to be removed, because you will draw ire and will continue to do so until you figure out that eve isn't going to change for you and move on to another game that is more compatible for what you are looking for."
4/14/2017,"eve is a sandbox game unlike wow which you reference earlier. as such it is totally valid to play the <U+FFFD>criminal and scoundrel<U+FFFD>. and calling players cowards makes you an ass, btw, if not an *******. these are completely acceptable and intended by ccp. further, the greater danger of ls is due in part because ls has better resources than ns. granted you can just go and obtain those resources solo, you<U+FFFD>ll need effort and teamwork to take advantage of what ls has to offer.yes, i would have an issue. you should not have access to those kinds of resources with the current levels of protection you enjoy in hs. it would have an unbalancing effect on the game imo. you seem to be unaware that the economy is a significant means by which players interact. yes it is pretty anonymous, but that is a feature not a bug. do you know who built those t2 strip miners? do you know who ran the moon mining operation that provided the moon goo used in the the t2 components? do you know who did the pi work that went into the fuel blocks? i am going to guess that for most if not all of those the answer is, <U+FFFD>no.<U+FFFD> the eve economy is a ginormous mass of player interacting with each other providing each other with what they want and need to play the game. letting a section of the game suddenly become more productive without a commensurate increase in the risk would mean that people would flock there to enjoy the greater rewards and lowered risks.you want those things<U+FFFD>.ls is thataway =>no, you have this one wrong. you are free to do what you want and hopefully that is what you consider fun. however you do not have the right to avoid player-on-player interaction. nobody has that. you can try to avoid player-on-player interaction if you want, but you cannot avoid it by intervention of ccp. if you do not like this, there<U+FFFD>s the door.hs does not need to be buffed. if you want to get more out life in hs figure out how to do that. that is your job. figure out how to bring in pilots to your corporation/alliance, figure out how to make playing with these players more rewarding and interesting. do not go to ccp and say, <U+FFFD>i want to stay in the safest part of the game, have access to resources and isk making opportunities like the more contested parts of the game, oh and make it fun too.<U+FFFD> go read about this being a sandbox game. that last bit, <U+FFFD>fun<U+FFFD>, that is up to you.as for fun, see the above about player-on-player interaction, nobody is saying you don<U+FFFD>t have the right to try and have fun in the game, just that you cannot shield yourself from what other players may want to do to you. most of us find this creates an interesting, challenging and dynamic game environment where we can compete with others and also cooperate.and no it is not unfair if somebody says, <U+FFFD>it is a dystopia, no safety, live with it, etc.<U+FFFD> that is what it means to play in a sandbox game. deal with what? ccp intervention on your behalf? yeah, that<U+FFFD>s just wrong. see if a player comes along and <U+FFFD>ruins the game<U+FFFD> you have the option to <U+FFFD>ruin his<U+FFFD>. but with ccp that option is gone."
4/14/2017,"this is a joke right? there more sand in hs than anywhere else in the game if by that you mean various resources. you can buy just about anything in game in hs, except for perhaps collector<U+FFFD>s items. since all the major trade hubs are in hs and every ns alliance needs those hubs to sell the resources they acquired but do not need and buy those resource they do need. go have a look at the economic reports ccp quant puts out. huge amounts of stuff moves in and out of the forge alone. i did a back of the envelope calculation and the rl value for one month was $33 million (yes, $33 million real u.s. dollars). do there is no need to take your shovels anywhere, imo. you just need to find a way to get enough isk to purchase what you need<U+FFFD>.and there are plenty of ways to make isk in hs.and there are ways to take advantage of ls without dying every single time. i routinely do invention in ls because the manufacturing costs are lower in ls stations. you just have figure out how to minimize your risk. one way to do that is group up.then you are doing something wrong. i used to do pi in ls, never had an issue. i do invention in ls, i lost one ship out in dozens of trips (not counting cyno ships). heck even my cyno ships are rarely attacked.and your friends who went to ls...did they have voice comms? were they in fleet? did they have a scout in a ceptor or a cloaky? did their ship types make sense or were they kitchen sinking it? and please sp is not nearly the factor that many make it out. i have over 147 million sp, but when i<U+FFFD>m in a thorax all my sp for large guns of all racial types are useless. my sp for both minmatar and gallente dreads are useless, the sp for gallente and amarr carriers...useless. the sp for hacs, recons, ceptors, dictors, and bombers are all useless.this is wrong on a number of fronts. if the people <U+FFFD>claiming<U+FFFD> that ls system are using it as they see fit that is not a waste of sand...it is what was fully intended by the game developers. it is up to you to go in there and take it from them or negotiate access. as for plex you are absolutely and totally wrong. every plex in game has gotten there by somebody giving ccp money. more money than a subscription. so if a ls player is making enough isk to plex his account ccp is not only getting their revenue, but more than a subscription. and you do know that ccp<U+FFFD>s own analysis has shown that combat tends to be good for new player retention right?okay, but i can also comment on your feedback<U+FFFD>.like you don<U+FFFD>t understand the nature of the game. that you think you have a right to play the game and avoid player-on-player interaction when it suits you. that game is not eve. never has been and hopefully never will be. if i accept the consequences of flying up to your ship and shooting you in the face...working as the developers have intended. either get used to that or as you indicated go find a game that is more suited to how you want to play."
4/15/2017,"my suggestion: optional chat beeps, like turning on/off blink for chat, a small, morse code-like 'dit' sound when a message appears in chat optional sound effect when someone enters local - i realise this may actually be game changing in some way, however my justifications are below. my justifications:my situation is quite unique, since i am visually impaired (blind in left eye, severely impaired right eye). i get by with my own accessibility features and adjustments i make, however, i can only see a portion of the screen at any given time, for example, when i look at the hud (health etc) that is all i can see, or looking at hte overview, i can only see x amount of lines of the overview due to using a magnification program that blows up a portion of the screen to fullscreen.because of this, i miss the following:- duel invites, fleet invites, conversation invites - i often have to ask my fc to invite me several time sbefore i can reach the fleet invite window in time before the timeout.- i miss chat, although chat isn't entirely crucial to the game, fleet chat is, and it would be useful to hear when a message appears - i realise that many players would hate the game beeping all over hte place, so i suggested it so that you can turn it on/off like you can right-click a chat tab and turn blink on/off - and have it off by default - can you imagine jita, so i empathise with others why this would be incredibly annoying.there are other ui elements that could benefit from a small notification sound, but these 2 in particular are of particular interest to mje.as i mentioend before, i get by with my accessibility products, if i could somehow script the ui with my accessibility product, then i wouldn't be here, however games just don't work well with accesibility products and can't be scripted like other programs - and please don't confuse an accessibility script with a mod/bot script. it is completely different. how an accessibility script works is by the mangifier or other program 'scanning' the screen like obs/xsplit does to record and doesn't actually interact witht eh game itself, and when a certain portion of the screen is activated/moved/other means of detection, then the accessibility product would zoom in there or make a sound or something - so it actually has no actual code injection or anything to interact with the game itself.although i promote accessibility, i am not one of those that ask the impossible, i wouldn't ask ccp to make an api to work with accessibility software, though if they did, i'd be one of the first to liaise with them to make it fair and not give dissabled players any kind of advantage over 'normal players'. if you understand how a headmouse works, you understand what i mean by scripting accessibility software to detect changes. it works similarly to a light gun back on the old consoles - except purely in software.i look forward to seeing what people think of this suggestion, as i'm sure some players wouldn't mind this feature despite being able to see the whole screen.(normally, i use the 3rd party warp audio volume to let me know if anybody has warped in, however this is bound to grid, and not by local entirely, so although this is useful, it's not a full view)"

4/26/2017,"ok, i know this subject has arisen countless times before and that alone should emphasize that this is a problem to the game. i notice that the habit of ""cloaky camping"" is one of the biggest s i have encountered. case in point is the system rnf-yh. this was formerly a very active ratting system. consequently there were frequent roaming gangs attracted to the area and we had many enjoyable fights. since one cloaky camper has moved in, the system has essentially become deserted and the volume of available content has sharply decreased on a day to day level. now i have no issues with the actual campers provided they are actually active (hell, i sometimes cloaky camp too). but in many cases it is obvious the individual logs on first thing in the morning and then goes to work or whatever, leaving his account running afk. this just sucks. it only serves to deny content to others and detracts from gameplay in every way.i will highlight here that my own corp has lost players to other games directly due to this practice. while it might be easy to just say ""htfu, this is eve"" do we really need that attitude when we are already facing declining subscribers?therefore i would suggest a simple fix in that cloaks are altered to cycle like many other modules, but say a 30 minute cycle time, and then must be reactivated manually with no autocycle function available but can be deactivated manually and instantly to drop cloak. this will still allow camping but ensures the camper is actually present! otherwise his ship will decloak allowing him to be scanned down. a simple solution that will serve to create content as opposed to destroying it.just a thought.cheersulf"
4/26/2017,"yes, yes we do. i know it seems like it would be a good idea for ccp to make you safer, and your ratting/mining more lucrative, and thus you richer, but it is the exact opposite of what makes eve an interesting and worthwhile game. if everyone is safe and only subject to consensual pvp, and has more resources than they can use due to 100% safe resource generation in nullsec, then not only does ship-loss not matter, anything you do has no meaning. it's not even a competitive game at that point, but just a exercise gathering useless stuff. there would be no meaningful content to be had, nor would the game be very interesting if everyone can fly and lose the most expensive ships without a second thought. it would be like the strangely lifeless version of eve you find on the test server - it's still eve but without perma-loss and assets with value, it is just a pretty, but not very compelling experience. cloaky camping is the only counter to the 100% safety afforded by local. i'll agree it can pretty frustrating, but without it you can always warp to safety before a hostile can get on grid to interact with you. nullsec is suppose to be the most rewarding, yet most dangerous space there is, but when local serves as such a powerful source of safety, it is pretty hard to say that it is succeeding at that with a straight face. cloaky camping is literally the only risk to your income generation, and with the current record levels of isk flooding into the game from nullsec bounties, the last thing we need to do is remove that only risk for operating in nullsec.i hope the long-term plan is still to release observatory arrays and nerf local and allow that free intel to be clawed back a bit with some vulnerable infrastructure. then, i think it would possible to add a direct counter to cloaky camping while still keeping some risk in nullsec. until then though, i see little chance of ccp deciding that nullsec needs to be even safer by nerfing cloaky camping, and even if they did it wouldn't be by hamstringing the usefulness of cloaking devices which are central to much other gameplay, especially in wormholes. there are counters to aggressors that don't involve fleeing to a station or safe spot every time a non-blue enters local. perhaps you should consider getting your corp to invest some time in them instead of watching all your corpmates drift off to other games because you are all too scared to put anything at risk and succumb to a self-induced and terminal case of boredom.if anything, new eden is suffering from a lack of conflict drivers and a glut of resources. we need to be more at risk to each other and resources more scarce if there are to be reasons to fight with each other and use all these tools of war we keep accumulating month after month. we definitely do not need more safety anywhere, but especially not in highsec and nullsec both of which are too safe for the amount of resources they generate by far."
4/26/2017,"i<U+FFFD>m not here to request a buff to low sec mining, or provide suggestions to fix them. i<U+FFFD>m just stating some of the current issues i see with lowsec mining, at least before they add the new moon mining refineries (which may or may not help).issues:mining in low sec isn<U+FFFD>t as dangerous as most people think. as long as you stay aligned (higgs anchor rigs help!) and warp out whenever a neutral or red enters belt you will be pretty untouchable unless the enemy ships have fast locking.ores are also on paper more valuable than high sec ores. so why isn<U+FFFD>t it profitable? well compared to highsec and nullsec mining, you are likely to be off grid more often when mining in low sec. you will be warping from belts a lot more often from enemy players than in high sec (occasional ganker) or null sec (occasional reds in system, plus you also have intel channels).so the reason why mining in lowsec isn<U+FFFD>t profitable is because the the isk per time in belt isn<U+FFFD>t good enough than the alternatives.the market isn<U+FFFD>t great for buying ores from miners (because no one is mining) and hauling in and out of lowsec isn<U+FFFD>t worth the risk (better to mine the ores in an anomaly elsewhere).no reason to protect miners (because not profitable enough, and miners not unlike other eve players are selfish and probably won<U+FFFD>t share the gained profit of more valuable ores). players can do more valuable and fun activities than babysitting miners.hopefully this will be considered when the csm works on stuff involving mining and industry in lowsec.tl;dr points: time spent in belt isn't worth it local market incentive not there no reason to protect miners [my suggestion]"
4/29/2017,"teckos pech , i agree with the other points, howeveri think you can not conclude from winning your first pvp encounter towards low sec experience.entering the wrong low sec system you get a fight. on others you can stay all days and not have one issue for days.it realy depends. there is so much to learn about how to work in low sec that it is intimidating for a lot of people.especially because these things are not obvious. and you can not take your experience for granted.you have to stay allert in low sec.best is to learn from experienced people. the current information out there do not teach how to behave in low sec. to learn this you need to invest and loose some ships.low sec is in my opinion after wormholes the most dangerous space. then follows 0.0 and high sec.on 0.0 space a system can be more secure then high sec, or less secure. so i also disagree with the risk 2 reward balancing in this. however 0.0 security is work while the security in high sec is for free.however keep in mind that security in eve is always a dynamical thing. and not to be taken granted.so fly save!aischa"
4/30/2017,"i was referring to ccp's analysis of players less than 15 days of age who were ganked in hs. the end results were that those who were ganked stayed the longest, those killed legally (war dec, dual, etc.) stayed almost as long and those who were never killed in their first 15 days stayed the least amount of time.i'm not saying gank all the newbies, but that shielding them from it won't help with retaining players. here is he presentation."
4/30/2017,"i know the presentation. again.look at what was looked at:players 15 days old.probably new player and not alts.focus was ganking.<1% was gangked15% was killed leagalythe rest was not killed at all.i'd say you can not generalize this research.in general what you can say is that harasment is not a problem in eve.you can not say that pvp is not an issue for new players. i men that in the sense of knowledge. i personally assume that a lot of people (look carebears) have issues with combat.i do not mean this negative, more constructive.there is a huge difference between getting ganked, getting into a high sec war and travell through low sec.and this is imho something were your example does not match what you want to say.all the bestaischa"
4/30/2017,"really, it is interesting you left out the conclusions about player retention. those who engaged in combat in their first 15 days stayed the longest.eve is a boring game really. what makes it interesting is the player-on-player interaction."
4/30/2017,"1) if it is ""very obvious"" that they are just logging in then going to work, then why should it disrupt anything? they are at work after all.2) your suggestion has been made hundreds of times before, and its just as bad now as the first hundred times its been made.3) there is a dedicated thread to post your cloaky camping whines... i mean suggestions."
