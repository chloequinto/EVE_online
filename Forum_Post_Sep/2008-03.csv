3/30/2008	"what's your real name? the csm documentation states that you must run under your real name. (edit: page 14, halfway)i don't see it listed on your campaign site, it'd be a shame if we wouldn't know who to vote for"
3/30/2008	"one time a soul of fountain guy got snippy with me in some forum thread that i no longer have any detailed recollection of. strike one.the big website states that you have a join date of 2002, indicating that you have access to a time machine. you have clearly used this machine to carry the eve server back to a year before eve was launched and join then, and yet you have never offered anyone else an opportunity to use this wondrous device. strike two.i am posting in general discussion again, obviously the worst forum on the internet, thanks to your thread. strike three. (tbh)"
3/30/2008	"in the summery pdf (page 3) it is further ""defined"" asso i prefer to wait for that"
3/30/2008	"tornsoul, you fa relic, who dug you out of the moltballs?"
3/30/2008	can be much worse then this forum.anyway: do you also have anything you want to do in csm that not everyone else also wants? now the only way you are different from part of the others is that you dont do pvp.because if i look at your list: then i am pretty sure every candidate says that.
3/30/2008	"not so much a time machine, as an alternate universe machine there was an eve before this eve... in fact there was several... (also called beta )"
3/30/2008	"ah, in true ccp style, the summary includes information not in the actual document"
3/30/2008	"in fact i haven't seen anyone specifically state so.but apart from that, i'd (naturally..) surely hope that other csm candidates would value the same issues.would be a great start on the csm if everyone would agree on what needed to be done - dont you think?"
3/30/2008	"ts, your comedy value is below sealevel, no chance man. old lemons are still lemons :d"
3/30/2008	make that two soul of fountain guys
3/30/2008	"i havent seen other topics like these (havent been looking for them), but i just guess everyone has those points you have. then the simple question, why vote on you when others got the same points? if everyone agrees with each other this is going to be a really boring election..."
3/30/2008	"thats actually a pretty good point.i think that once the campaigning really starts to heat up, a few topics will emerge that the different candidates differ on, and over which much argumentation will ensue right now however, i agree, it's a bit meh meh - not really anything that makes individual candidates stand out much from each other.maybe you can get the ball rolling by bringing up a few subjects/issues of your own?and i'll give them a lookover and give my opinion."
3/30/2008	"got to go sleeping, so this is my last one for a while, but for example:1. how do you want to improve low sec, and especially risk/reward2. what to do against laggy fleet battles. better hardware = more people who join the battle = same ammount of lag. so i suppose that somehow you need to give people a reason to split their forces, but how to do that :)edit: and since you arent doing much pvp (only pvp i do is losing my ship :p), same question for jita and some mission hubs lag."
3/30/2008	"ah - good stuff.and definatly potentially controversial 1. this one would take almost a thesis to answer tbh...and my answer might not be in the direction you expect.in line with my campaign motto ""the big picture"", this is what you need to look at first and foremost.and one of the fundamental flaws with ""the big picture"" of eve is the current population distribution.ie. way way way too many people in empire.why is this? well it must obviously be that for most people it's simply ""better"" for them to be there (and each have their own defination of what ""better"" is)so what has this got to do with low sec?well... i think it's not so much a question of improving low sec, but rather ""give incentive"" to go to other places of eve - to be able to have a living to your liking in other parts of eve.and when i say ""give incentive"" i dont only mean positive incentives...sometimes you need to ""force"" (or rather coerce) certain groups of peoples behavior, in order to obtain whats best for all in the long run.i'll give a very specific example of this (which can't stand alone mind you)i belive that ccp's view (or at least their implementation) of the current jump lines/high ways is fundamentally flawed - and is a major component in why we have this f... up distribution of people in eve.way back when, in the very early days of eve, we had far less super highways than we do today. many many of those where added later.at the time it made *some* sense, as eve was less populated at the time.but even ccp realised something was wrong, and did a bit of re-wiring.this re-wiring removed luminaire as the trade hub, but simply replaced it with jita.ccp simply didnt go far enough... and, i believe, dont understand (or disagree) with what really need to be done.we dont need *more* jump lanes, we need less.once the above is solved, i think you'll see low sec ""evening out"", and it will no longer be a question so much of improving low sec, as of improving every where else as well.there... told ya it would be long... and it's not even 1/10th of what i could add to the subject... which is a bti of tangent from what you asked... but never the less is part of the long term solution2:while not much of a pvper, it doesnt mean i dont have a clue about pvp game mechanics :-) and an opinion.in fact i've incidently posted an idea exactly on a way to get rid of the blob some days ago.it wasnt very well recieved i'm afraid...defeating the blobi still belive the idea has merit though.sometimes tough problems require tough solutions.in the end it's about tailoring the game in a way that takes advantage of ""human (competetive) nature"" in order to ""coerce"" the playres into certain patterns of behaviour thats to the overall advantage of the game - and ultimately the individual players.unfortunatly human nature is also generally adverse to change... as i think the replies to my suggestion implies..."
3/30/2008	"get yourself listed in winterblinks thread as well tournsoul, and good luck!"
3/30/2008	"""definitely"" ""definition"" ""believe""""received""""believe"" ""competitive"" ""unfortunately""the illiteracy is strong with this one.i thought csm needed hamsters who could spell correctly.edit - ""members"" just became ""hamsters""."
3/30/2008	"oh woe be me, i've been found out... english is not my native language if elected i'll make sure to make a point of it to not have myself appointed as the secretary or vice-secretary of the csm (i guess i should add ""more humour"" to my list of things, as we could def need some more of that )"
3/30/2008	"you get trolled way to easily, ts"
3/30/2008	it bumps the thread though - doesnt it?
3/30/2008	"you look too much like me. even the two words used to describe you are identical to what i would use.good luck in the campaign, worthy adversary... or future colleague."
3/30/2008	i get this overhyped duracell bunny - aura from you. do you do *******?
3/30/2008	"welcome to the race tornsoul, nice to see another familiar face in the contest. good solid applicant and long term supporter of the eve community. its a privilege to have you as a rival in this one torn! good luck!"
3/30/2008	"in all honesty, most people take spelling corrections as insults. (which they are not)you didn't, so that's an extra point for you.cheers. :)"
3/31/2008	double 0.0 space and add a blob of empire in the middle of 0.0 (30+ jumps from current empire) and your'll get my vote.well at least give it some thought.
3/31/2008	omg its teamspeak timmmmmmmmaaaay. :).
3/31/2008	"he dug himself out, this chance to be on the front page is bringing all the dusty old timers out.i don't know whether the campaign will ""heat up"" as you seem to expect. and, the truth is that you can't really formulate a strategy about what to do about lowsec until ccp says what their plans are with the factional warfare patch. because that could be anything from a minor change like adding a few agents here and there, to a massive revamp of the map and the distance and lowsec regions between empires, to even worse, who knows, removal of concord and the all out switch to a pure faction system. and then, ""coerce empire dwellers out of empire"" won't make sense anymore, if there is no (one) ""empire.""anyway, good luck, whatever."
3/31/2008	haha soul of fountain
3/31/2008	"oh, and one more thing, all you candidates have all these links to your nifty ""campaign"" websites, but you know what? we're lazy, and most of us won't bother clicking. you don't see political candidates in rl on tv just wave and say ""hi, please click on the link at the bottom of your tv to see my agenda."" no, they butt into discussions and they get right in your face and they push their views so you know them without lifting a finger.go answer in the ""how would you fix lowsec"" thread, and all the other threads that have sprung up recently, people. sheesh."
3/31/2008	you've got my six votes.
3/31/2008	"i've always appreciated the work and honesty with which big has done its thing for eve at large and respect the job it has done for the eve community.that said i think that while big does expand eve in unique and interesting ways big is not in it because they are altruistic. the bottom line is big is a self-serving entity that happens to provide a unique eve service. while that is totally fine i am not sure it waves a magic wand that implies your motives are nothing but for the betterment of eve.as candidates started announcing their candidacy i started to wonder to myself where these folks have come from. in case i missed something i took to looking up their posting history and here is yours.i want to see candidates who have been fighting the good fight long before csm and a free trip to iceland was on offer. your posting history tells me you have done no such thing. if we take away the postings in events (which are big specific) your posting history goes in the crapper. lots of caod posts...doesn't really get interesting as for the overall community till your posts to market discussions and those are thin when spread across the years. i looked at your gd postings and looks like you made five in all of 2007.i'll grant gd can be a hassle with trolls and what not but nevertheless some spend time trying to throw out ideas and discuss issues. they place themselves on the line and take what comes. some ideas are good, some bad, plenty of flames but many stay with it.your lack of gd/ships & mods and other gameplay related forum posts i find disturbing. now i cannot see what ideas you have floated or how you handled the inevitable flames. i do not doubt your sincerity in your campaign website but mostly it is kissing babies and glad-handing. i want someone on the csm who has proven themselves in trying to better eve long before trips to iceland were a part of it. part of that is the eve forums and i am sorry to say your attempts there are sorely lacking. looks like another alliance interested in nothing beyond their own, narrow world in eve.on the upside for you this lack of posting history is not unique to you and although it concerns me more than a little at least you have a golden reputation for honest gameplay. that is no small thing in my view.so i will wait and see. best of luck to you just the same."
3/31/2008	"while posting on the forums may be part of a candidates appeal i don't think it is necessary. being loud and easy to spot on the forums can be annoying as it can be informative. i think ts would make a good csm as he is intelligent and well thought out with his ideas. he can come up with weird and wacky ideas that upon discussion don't come to fruition. or they get changed based upon other peoples suggestions at least he does within our corporation. i believe that shows someone who can accept constructive criticism and as such may make a few more posts, i don't know .i know more than most people that ts is a trustworthy, honest and straight up guy so i agree with you there, they are often rare commodities in eve. i'm sure people can point at mistakes he has made but i'm sure the same can be said of everyone."
3/31/2008	"well, i am not interested in folks who are just ""loud"" on the forums. some can and do provide well thought out posts that aim to improve eve overall. some ideas are crap, some good, many need tweaks and that is all fine. the point is if ts has this wealth of ideas i would have liked to have seen them on the forums. weird and wacky or not it is all good. often just the kernel of a good idea is enough to get fleshed out by the community to something that works.ts (and to be fair other candidates) are advertising their desire for a better eve but till now they seem to have mostly kept these pearls of wisdom to themselves. supposedly ccp reads the forums and will pay attention to good ideas. i'm not so sure they really do as i have seen numerous great ideas come and go with nothing from ccp (heck, people were pining for sec cans to get cleaned up and everyone liked the idea...only took ccp 3 years to get around to it). nevertheless i think a candidate's bona fides for their concern for eve would be better served with a track record of trying such than what amounts to an advert and just hoping they actually have a clue."
3/31/2008	"unfortunately, those who have good ideas don't seem interested in this csm thing. probably because it requires travel, revealing rl info, and more work than neccessary.for me, the best candidate would be one who's had it with ccp's crap and would be almost hostile towards them, not with language, but in pursuing the issues and making sure that stuff finally gets done. determining what the issues are is somewhat easy: take any thread that reaches 10+ pages in 2 days, and there's an issue being discussed in there. the problem is getting ccp to do anything about it fast.i hate their ""soon"" policies.i hate that we still have this overview bug that hasn't been fixed yet."
3/31/2008	"it was fun podding you in tpar as you left the station back when we were in cfs. if you win the csm, will you make yourself available for further podding at some point in the future?"
3/31/2008	welcome to the party
