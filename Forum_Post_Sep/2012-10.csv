10/1/2012,"yeah, i forgot about the whole buying and selling kill rights and new bounty system thing. this will be very helpful once this stuff goes live."
10/1/2012,so thats why i see like 80 people in a mutual war with the new dec shield.... i was wondering about this lol
10/1/2012,however the defenders should then have to pay for the dec. (unless both sides choose to be mutual)
10/1/2012,"no no noyou won't see the pod since your link to the camera drones is now severed, what you would should see is the pretty much the similar stuff from the matrix: especially since the pod probably starts shutdown sequence a few seconds before the actual hull breach, to prevent data loss for example. as such you would actually lose all the intercoms/overviews/channels (similar to the toggle we have right now for screenshots) and then blackout and awaken in the pod, which is collapsing around you. spilling the contents and your now doomed husk to be: you would subconsciously struggle (note we aren't in gas-filled environment, as such we won't automatically eject due to pressure difference: it would be more akin of breaking an egg and contents slowly oozing out. ). the temperature difference should not matter since there is no decent medium to absorb our heat fast enough, as such the actual cause of death would be pressure difference: blood-stained vision and general blackout. (no air in the lungs afaik we are filled with oxygenated goo so chest won't explode ) to summarize: you are neo, spilling into huge vacuum around you (remember how bs look like while you are near pod, now imagine the pod debris with similar size beside you) mesmerizing sight of space (maybe w/o nebulas: we don't have enhanced vision) which turns red and then black very fast....................and then you wake upabout the hair: i personally think it is too much because we can always say that facilities can be preprogrammed to try making the exact replica of yours truly. otherwise capsuleers not only will loose hair - they would lose the tan,musculature, and tattoos. redoing that as soon as you wake up would add only a little bit to the immersion but otherwise will be a major hassle, especially for these pilots that need to return to the battlefield asap"
10/1/2012,and how would you recognize someone who bought a toon?actually that might be good i could buy a toon from someone with a good reputation (chribba for example) and proceed to **** and pilliage on his good name?
10/1/2012,the margin trade scam can also be seen and avoided if you pay enough attention and are wary..... this is not an exception!!!!
10/1/2012,the thing with thing i see wrong is being able to put down orders for things without affording to pay for the minimum amount you want to buy. the game should run a balance check every x times and cancel all orders that would fail if someone tried to sell stuff to them.

10/2/2012,"playerbase - 1ccp - 0the playerbase thoroughly and adequately warned ccp that the wardec changes would do little or nothing to combat what was already broken about the system. sure enough, the wardec mechanics were left to one employee who didn't listen to external criticism in the typical pre-incarna style.we've gone from an inexpensive broken wardec system to an expensive yet still broken wardec system. that's all. nothing was ever truly fixed and here we sit with the exact same problems as we had before the ""wardec revamp"".summary of eves last four expansions:"
10/2/2012,"the easiest fix would be to remove the ability to make wars mutual. let all wars play out while being paid for by the aggressor, so you get 7 days of open warfare, the defender can call in assistance just like now (this is one i totally agree with) but after the 7 days war, the aggressor either pays again or the war ends. if the defending side then wants to take revenge they can wardecc the aggressor back, possibly paying wartime allies to assist and wardecc the original aggressor too.an answer to the transfering of wars may be to make so it just doesnt happen. the corp who is decced continues to be at war but teh alliance they join are unafected. corps leaving alliances however should carry the war with them until the original 7 day term is over.i also think that for every entity the defending side brings into a war, the aggressor can also bring in that many allies but make it so that any allies the aggressor may call in can not bring the total number of pilots to above the number of total defending pilots including allies.in short, defenders being able to call in aid in a war is right. wars should however not be able to be made mutual, thereby locking peple into wars that may well end up with people not bothering to log in. revenge can be taken in many ways without silly mechanics.these simple changes would (i think) stop the exploitation of war mechanics but still leave war as a viable and extremely fun part of eve."
10/2/2012,"...continued from abovegreat, so the next major problem is wardec copying/transferring....right now, any entity can transfer a defensive war to any other entity. this is not how wars were intended. i merge this unintended mechanic with the infinite mutual wardec to trap people indefinitely. sadly, ccp will read this sentence and think ""awesome, all we have to do is stop one of those activities and wardecs will be fixed"" which is absolutely not the case. to transfer a war from a corp to an alliance, have that corp join the alliance to transfer a war from an alliance to a corp, have that corp join the alliance, and then leave to transfer a war from an alliance to an alliance, have a corp drop the wardec'd alliance and join the other i know this is not how ccp intended the game mechanics to be, because otherwise they wouldn't have spent so long creating a mercenary marketplace. with this ability to transfer copies of wars there is no longer a reason to ever be a mercenary when you can literally just join the war, with an infinite number of defenders again, for free. this completely renders the mercenary defender system obsolete, congratulations.wardec copying was implemented to create that concept of ""commitment"" for entities at war. you can no longer escape a war just by leaving the alliance. obviously this isn't working as intended. this allows for wardec copying/transferring as described, and also an ""octopus defense"" where an alliance breaks into individual corps, thus increasing the effective cost of wardeccing the members of that alliance by many fold. this is rare, but it's an obvious defense.we don't want corps to escape wars by dropping out of alliances (hereby known as ""droppers"" for brevity), but we don't want them to be able to join other alliances with these wars either. so these are our options in order of my preference: we forbid droppers from joining another alliance for a week (consider it analogous to corp hopping restrictions) we continue as is, allowing perfect copying/transfer, instead preventing mutual infinite wardecs we retract the war against the dropper after x time (72hrs perhaps) we allow the war to continue against the dropper, but don't transfer it to a new alliance they join (this is unlikely because it lets a corp in an alliance be in a war independent of the alliance) we retract the war against the dropper (old system - bad) we prevent dropping from a wardecced alliance (very bad) there are more variations on these themes, but the goal here is to prevent infinite wardec copyingas for wardec'd corporations joining alliances... this is probably fine with a few notes. first, it should inform the aggressor that the target has joined an alliance, the moment they're application is accepted into that alliance. this gives the aggressor a 24hr forewarning. also, as mentioned above, we should also be removing the restriction preventing corps from joining alliances while in a mutual wardec - as it no longer makes sense.surprising your enemies while in space:these are considered exploits so don't do them. but let's code the rules into the game to make it impossible and save the gms lots of time: you're sitting in space next to a target who's at war with a corporation you have an application in to. the ceo accepts your application and you instantly begin shooting the target - he had no possible warning or defense. exploit. you're in a corporation that's had their application accepted to join an alliance who's at war. you're in open space next to one of their war targets, the application goes live, you instantly begin shooting the target. exploit. you're at war with an enemy, you drop from your corp so you're not at war, undock next to them, their ui isn't updated yet, they shoot you and get concorded without warning. exploit. any variation of these are considered exploits due to the lack of possible warning to the opponent. the barely legal work-around is to dock, get accepted, undock, start shooting. it basically only adds seconds to your case, and your opponent's local list won't have updated, but the gms consider it legal.the solutions to these are pretty simple. if a corp applies to join the alliance you're at war with, it should send a notification out to the aggressors the moment the application was accepted, warning that in 24hrs they'll be facing a whole new set of targets thanks to them absorbing your target's war. don't allow a corporation at war to accept an application for a member while they're in space. or at least have it queue up the acceptance for the next time they're docked or offline. force an update on the local list whenever a local member joins or leaves the war against you. this would prevent much confusion and grey areas with the abuse."
10/2/2012,"wars with dead corps...wars with dead entities are theoretically impossible, but still totally possible. dec shield is currently at war with a closed corp. whenever the last member of a corp leaves that corp all wars against that corp end. [removed text]it's also kind of foolish that a corp can disband and then reform 10 seconds later. corp hopping is limited to not being able to rejoin for 7 days, so why can we reform new corps instantly? this has led to a large number of aggressive wars being fought with only alt corps - especially now that any real corp would be trapped infinitely.more dead corps...it seems it's still possible to leave dead corps floating all over the place, including inside an alliance.this could potentially be very useful for us, as we could keep a bunch of dead corps in alliance to maintain majority vote for executorship, without actually dedicating any characters to it. we'll have to test whether or not their votes actually still contribute to ownership of an alliance...the procedure for re-creating this bug is to have a corp apply to join the alliance, then have them close out the corp, and it will join the alliance as a dead corp. downtime does not wipe the corp from existence. you can also boot these dead corps from alliance, they'll have copies of the alliance's wars. and if those wars were mutual then you've suddenly locked everyone into a mutual outgoing war with a dead corporation (which no player can ever correct this problem - so be prepared for mass gm petitions).surrender mechanics...any surrenders offered to an alliance are easily flouted. have a corporation drop from the alliance, accept the surrender from the alliance, re-apply with dropped corp to alliance, resume war. this is easily fixed with my top suggestion to the fix to wardec transferring. unknown what surrenders to corps that join an alliance do - i will investigate...with the toggling mutual option, the right click mutual menu doesn't function at all. this has led to much confusion for people that leave dec shield. the only option that does work is to use the drop down menu at the far right side and to uncheck the mutual box:"
10/2/2012,wardecs pre-inferno were very annoying because of the pos exploit.but...the system was better.better.
10/2/2012,"it really wasn't better. fix the transfer of wars and the system we have no will be pretty much perfect as far as i'm concerned. at the moment the only people (generally) who think the old system was better was highsec wardec bully-boys who dont know how to pvp against people who actually want to fight.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
10/2/2012,"those are some very confident assertions. very confident indeed for someone who is wrong. the lore says that the pod actually injects and euthanises the pilot miliseconds before the pod's shell is breached. so you really would just see your sight quickly black out, but you wouldn't wake up standing up straight in your cloths in your captains quarters.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
10/2/2012,"eidric, thank you for your contributions. everyone else, pay no attention to the very faulty science eidric is espousing. in fact liquids have pressure too, and space is cold, but can be hot depending on proximity to a star and wether or not you find yourself in a shadow, but i wouldn't ask the devs to get into that. as i recall, arduemont is right, pod pilots are euthanized in the split second after the pod detects a hull breach, but before the pod is totally destroyed. also, they are also depicted as wearing masks that cover their eyes, so i don't see how the perspective would switch to their own eyes still on the field, seeing as how they are blinded, poisoned, and had their synapses melted by the cognitive state xerox machine. eidric, i don't mean to pick on you bud, but your assertions, though interesting, are wrong on a lore level as well as a basic 9th grade physical science level.but we can all agree that there's room here for improvement! :d and the way it is now is just lame...highsec is owned by players now. systems 0.5-1.0 are new order territory. all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code. mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community. see www.minerbumping.com"
10/2/2012,"the idea isn't bad but is it really necessarily to add rp fluff to ideas in the assembly hall?it seems a bit counter productive to the whole ""explaining your idea clearly"" thing..."
10/2/2012,"then perhaps ccp should stop alowing us to train while we are afk/offline since we are playing but not playing?ever hear of snipers? do you really think they stay awake 24/7 or never leave their position to **** or **** or sleep or eat or anythng? yes snipers go afk but the enemy doesnt know if or when they do it. hell the sniper could move on and they often do since it is dangerous for them to stay in one position very long yet the enemy doesnt know this until they actually go out and verify! combat forces also use decoys and various forms of deceptive practices to deceive, distract and or delay their enemies.afk cloaking is a valid gammng tactic so go get some cheese for your whine :-)one last point. i played wow for years since it's begining. for years the useless noobs would come into the forums and moan and groan about this change or that change that needed to be made because oh the current system is soooo hard or unfair especially for the noobs. so what has happened now? wow has become watered down and stupified to appease all the useless morons with iq's south of 30. i left wow and came to eve because i got tired of playing in kindercare and wanted to actually think for myself.so my point is that i hope ccp doesnt listen to all the whining of the noobs and keeps doing what they are doing :-) and all the ignorant low iq noobs can go back to wow!oh and for the one moaning about you posting in the wrong place, ignore him! when a game has been around as long as eve there is very little that hasn't been discussed already except maybe new content and even that gets old fast. in reality very few people actually research old past post first. most just want a fast current reply often times from new players who probably were not around when it was last discussed and i see no problem with it. if you don't want to read it then move on. honestly...ediots that whine about trivial crap like this are about as usefull as the forum grammar police!"

10/2/2012,"hello,i play eve since years now and one of the first questions i did to my self during the first months playing this game was:how can a ship like a titan, carrier, battleship or even a batlecruiser can have just a pilot?after years, i keep asking my self: why after so many expansions, crew hasn't been added?i have full respect of ccp and the game they did is just awesome ( i came from different mmorpg experience and this is the most intresting one), so there must be more than one reason but i came to the point that after reading so many post in the council ofstellar management about small improvements was time to post mine about crew.here i will put the concept, point by point, hoping to find more players who will support the idea.- from the fitting panel a link to the crew panel. similar to the fitting window, it might show a 2d interior ship with free spots in key roles: propulsion, gunnery, shield, hull, electronics, ecc.. in every spot you could put just one officer who might give you one special bouns: gunnery: tracking speed, damage, reload efficency ecc... propulsion: agility, speed ecc... armor: hp, repair amout ecc... basically the same bonuses you receive with rigs.question would be: why add something which adds almost same bonuses of rigs?i think it will enhance the characteristics of the ships and the style of play of each player. in addition you might decide to balancethe bonuses of each ship.- the crew would have a daily,weekly or monthly cost: you hire, you pay.the crew can't be killed or dismissed, can only be sold (but while on the market you keep paying for it).- the crew gets experience for every battle is envolved,more experience, more bonuses, more costs, more values on the market.- the first officers you buy from the market start with 0 experience, it is up to you to let them grow.- the crew can be killed or wonded. during fights, after receiving a perfect hit, you might loose one of them.i would have more ideas to share, but i want to keep the post simple, basically here you have my crew concept which i hopeswill at least put some ideas in the mind of some ccp programmers.thank yourvnsm"
10/2/2012,"i like your idea of giving a particular ship ""experience"" credit... so if you had some particularly lucky or effective ship that had many kills without dying, it would have some small bonuses over a factory-fresh hull of the same type. but only in your hands or something so you couldn't go kill fifty noobships and then sell the ""improved"" hull in jita for a markup. would be nice to give specific ships a history. eve is nothing if not a vehicle for player-created history after all."
10/2/2012,that doesn't make it a bad idea
10/2/2012,"so lets discuss it repeatedly again :-) i agree it would be nice to do a name change blizzard had all the normal objections to allowing it as well; but at the end of the day it all boiled down to their bank account and they now allow it for a fee oh and guess what, their game world didn't end!if the real world allows for a name change with even more possible negative out comes how bad could it really be for a game?ccp just think of your bank account and i know you will do the right thing :-)"
10/2/2012,"not until my fourteenth or fifteenth year did i begin to come across the word 'gallente,' with any frequency, partly in connection with political discussions.... for the gallente was still characterized for me by nothing but his nationality, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, i maintained my rejection of nationalist attacks in this case as in others. consequently, the tone, particularly that of the caldari anti-gallente press, seemed to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation. i was not in agreement with the sharp anti-gallente tone, but from time to time i read arguments which gave me some food for thought. at all events, these occasions slowly made me acquainted with the man and the movement, which in those days guided our corporation<U+FFFD>s destiny: tibus heth and the caldari providence directorate. the man and the movement seemed 'reactionary' in my eyes. my common sense of justice, however, forced me to change this judgment in proportion as i had occasion to become acquainted with the man and his work; and slowly my fair judgment turned to unconcealed admiration. today, more than ever, i regard this man as the greatest caldari ceo of all times. how many of my basic principles were upset by this change in my attitude toward the provist movement! my views with regard to anti-gallente sentiment thus succumbed to the passage of time, and this was my greatest transformation of all. the gallente have always been a people with definite racial characteristics and never a social institution with any integrity. due to their own original special nature, the gallente cannot possess a sound social institution, if for no other reason than because they lack idealism in any form, and hence belief in a altruism is absolutely foreign to them. and a social institution in the caldari sense cannot be imagined which lacks the conviction of survival through unity in some form. indeed, the gallente do not prepare their children to look after each other, but only for a practical and profitable life in this world. the best characterization is provided by the product of this education, the gallente himself. first, therefore, the gallente goes about making up to the people for his previous sins against them. he begins his career as the 'benefactor' of mankind. since his new benevolence has a practical foundation, that the left hand should not know what the right hand giveth; no, whether he likes it or not, he must reconcile himself to letting as many people as possible know how deeply he feels the sufferings of the masses and all the sacrifices that he himself is making to combat them. but even more: all at once the gallente also becomes liberal and begins to rave about the necessary progress of mankind. if we consider how greatly he has sinned against the masses in the course of the centuries, how he has squeezed and sucked the blood again and again; if furthermore, we consider how the people gradually learned to hate him for this, and ended up by regarding his existence as nothing but punishment of heaven for the other peoples, we can understand how hard this shift must be for the gallente. the purple-haired gallente youth lies in wait for hours on end, nefariously glaring at and spying on the unsuspicious girl whom he plans to seduce, adulterating her blood and removing her from the bosom of her own people. the gallente uses every possible means to undermine the racial foundations of a subjugated people. the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the gallente. and so the gallente advances on his fatal road until another force comes forth to oppose him, and in a mighty struggle hurls the heaven-stormer back to hell. the caldari state is today the next great war aim of their underhanded subjugation. it requires all the force of a young missionary idea to raise our people up again, to free them from the snares of this international serpent... hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the caldari people: 'by defending myself against the gallente, i am fighting for the work of us all.' thank you, galaxy pighighsec is owned by players now. systems 0.5-1.0 are new order territory. all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code. mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community. see www.minerbumping.com"

10/3/2012,"sigh here we go again then i guess you haven't read the 2nd link: space itself isn't ""cold"" or ""hot"" it can't be - the temperature can only apply to matter, vacuum is absence of matter (or very very tiny amount) as such space itself if very very good insulator. there is a reason your coffee stays so hot in thermos for such long time - due to vacuum in the hollow walls.yes eventually the body will radiate enough heat to freeze but it won't be fast enough at all. i am not sure you know the meaning of words you say: google sublimation - it cannot apply neither to water nor mercury inside barometer. and liquids don't expand in same way as gasses do, they might experience depressed boiling point + increased evaporation causing the said goo to actually boil outside (and this could lower the temperature of it btw) but that would depend on the goo itself and its surface tension (which would probably be higher than that of water)you know how canon works? it is main intent is to describe the current game effects if you follow it to the letter you will wind up with exact mechanic we have now - maybe your memory is still weak and you simply forgot you waking up in the lag and only started properly remembering things when you are up, dressed and back in your cq.funny thing again but your initial design was also contradictory to the cannon but you kinda ignored that. in fact your version is even more far fetched as you imagine the now corpse not only injected with toxins but nerve fried. while still maintaining stable connection to the camera drones outside of the pod. seems very unlikely to me.while the idea of a neo awakening could actually hold ground even with neurotoxins, because think about it - who actually tested the results? and how can they be tested? we are talking about seconds even milliseconds here: maybe toxins are not fast enough to effectively shut the consciousness down before the pod cracks open. but it can't be proven because capsuleers do not retain that memory - memory has been transferred before application of neurotoxin.about nerve damage - don't forget, that one of the things our body knows how to do best even without consciousness is to collect information from sensory organs (unless you specifically kill these). maybe the dying body will not be able to process it but while sensory system is active it will see it. besides capsuleers might start to develop some sort of resistance to the memory transfer as technologies get better and our brain is better adapted for such transfer (if you remember correctly your jump clones aren't really damaged that much by it, this could also ""help"" )note i didn't try to kill your suggestion at all - i tried to elaborate it, enhance it even. in turn you are calling stuff ""lame"" because it apparently a bit different from your suggestion. if you are that stubborn - i am afraid you idea would never work at all. learn to adapt"
10/3/2012,"why should we do that when the old post will probably be locked (which makes no sense). people create new post because they want their views seen and or have further questions. so if having multiple post annoys you dont come crying to us about it, talk to the genius's at ccp who lock post for no good reason!"
10/3/2012,"the link u put is useless.... i am speaking about crew you can manage and chose. i know crew has been a past topic, but reading the post/proposal in the assebly hall makes me laugh. a lot of small improvements are requested, ship crew would allow to customize you play style.in addition, i am not speaking about managing hundreds people, but just officers. imagine to have only two spots available on a cruiser and a choice between a dozen officers. it would make your ships much more customizable.btw, it is just a point of view but i don't understand why u don't want nothing about xp. eve players build their experience while playing eve, so why don't do the same with npc crew officers?"

10/3/2012,i was glazing over someones whine thread about pve in general discussion when a thought occured to me. while probably not a new idea...i think it would be not only awesome but fun to see npc rats warp in and get involved in large fleet engagements. i am sure it would cause additional lag and such but it would still be cool. the npc's wouldn't want to take sides but instead randomly target and fire on ships in active combat. perhaps even give chase within the solar system. anybody else think this might be pretty cool to see?
10/3/2012,no.neeeexxxxt!!!!
10/3/2012,good argument. congrats on your fail.
10/3/2012,"no: 1.) npc's are generally dumb.... and in the case they have an ai, they can be exploited....2.) npc's don't add anything to the fleet fight... either you bring in soooo many that it is an annoying clusterfuck, or they don't change a thing....3.) fleet fights are about pvp.... which is what they those players want.... they are not about shooting npc's... which is what those players are choosing to not do.... why would you force that crap on them?? 4.) why would anyone want this??? if you want to shoot a fleet of npc's, go warp into a plex... if you want to shoot them with your fleet, warp your fleet into a plex...."
10/3/2012,"1. ai is being implemented for all rats as per a recent dev blog. that ai can be updated and configured further in the future as needed.2. npc's would add a random element of danger. more interaction with the game world itself during fleet fights. regardless of whether you are a strict pvper or not, npc's and the factions they represent are a part of the game world.3. see 2.4. see 2."
10/3/2012,"npc's spawn at belts and gates (commonly), and other celestials (less commonly). there are tons of ways to interact with them already. and in order for them to be a ""disturbance"", capable of adding even a modicum of danger to a standard fleet, they would need to spawn en mass with a much better ewar ai. i'm certain this would be abused in some farm scheme.... if you want more random elements of danger, then ask for random events that are manageable and meaningful in size. for example, have you ever seen an incursion gate camp?? they slowly build in size, and become extremely potent with fast locking tackling frigates that'll catch cold-warping fleet inties and heavy hitting bs's that can nuke a fully tanked drake before it can power back to the gate. this is more along the lines of what you should request.... not npc's joining fleet battles...."
10/3/2012,well if you want to request that then be my guest. what i am requesting and what i want to request is npc's getting involved with the sovereignty warfare in nullsec fleet battles. those npc's are part of factions in each region and should be interested in the conflict occurring there.

10/4/2012,i and my indie alt approve and support this proposal.
10/4/2012,"this is best idea i've seen on this forum ... ever .definitely +1this will allow extend game-play to planets - from harmless pi structures and outposts to extremely expensive (and build-ed trough many months/years) planet-size cities overgrowing poses and stations in size and capabilities (with defenses breaking titans like matches) + armies of dust mercenaries fighting for corporations interests ... this will be game changer for eve, no doubt."
10/4/2012,"also one thing for me: it will be probably long and bumpy road to build meaningful cities (courscant-sized city could take years to build), so it could be nice to being able to merchandise city/planetary structures ownership. so you could simply sell/buy existed structures shares on market/contract, instead making military escalation only viable option to take them."
10/4/2012,"ownership transfers have been included. so players can sell and transfer cities to other players/corps/alliances if they were so inclined.and i believe its coruscant.yes, i hope it would take quite a few months/years to grind a city into a planet sized city spanning all pi grids on the surface. then again, such a city would make techmoons look like small change."
10/4/2012,"owned. when i said you were wrong, i just meant they'd be dead before the capsule even breached.i wasn't questioning the science of it. i tend to do a fair bit of research before anything like that.anyway though. being podded really does need to get upgraded. it could start as simply as the screen quickly fading out as you reach very low structure. they can work on changing the captains quarters bit later if it comes to it. i would love to have a room attached to the captains quarters that the fresh clone wakes up in.lets face it, coming to standing up dressed in your captains quarters is ridiculous. if your nervous functions are that poor that your short term memory is that bad after waking up, how exactly would you get dressed, and walk over to your ship balcony to look stoically over at the hangar?""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
10/4/2012,"actually that is entirely plausible to find yourself standing fully dressed without memory how you did that. if just the memory is affected, but not reasoning sort of like early onset of alzheimers.and still living body emerging from the pod is likely too: although there is also a similar possibility of the body being destroyed by the actual ammunition (exactly on the moment of hull breach). problem with the suggestion of additional stuff in cq lies very close to the problem of incarna itself: there are numerous people that never leave the pod in stations - and many never will even with incarna getting a second breath. for them it is the space game only. as such there will be a quite large chunk of people, who will not even notice the difference. in fact even detest it if it would be a requirement. since they would not see it as immersion but additional hurdle after death that is handled by the stuff they never really liked in the first place.and afaik the most deadly battles usually happen in places where rp is not as common (bubbles help greatly) so our primary target audience should actually be the 0.0 population - and speaking from my previous experience of nullsec life - they will treat it as waste of time. the cinematic before death however would be actually treated differently due to psychological reasons as well: they are still on battlefield, perhaps seeing the final moments of the battle, and the change in perspective due to size difference would not only add immersion, but also contribute to the cinematic effect of ones life in battle. while the cinematic after battle would be usually psychologically treated as dead cutscene: you are already at the station - how come i have to watch it and not just jump into next ship - my people need me!just think about it from coolness factor - what is more awesome to add to the game - image of the epic battle above you, or the image of you getting dressed and wobbly walking from the ""axlotl tanks""."
10/4/2012,"they're not locked. go look.""they're probably locked"" is a daft thing to say when you can actually check. if they were locked that would be a very strong argument indeed, but they're not. so you might as well have not opened your virtual mouth.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

10/4/2012,"to a capsuleer, taking a titan out, is like going for a walk. capsuleers don't fly these ships like a traditional person would, they don't have controls or buttons to press. a capsuleer's brain is directly connected to the ship.when a pod pilot fires his weapons he does it like you or i would clench a fist. when they start their mwd they do it the way you or i would go from walking to running. human brain to massive machine motor control. a capsuleer knows when he's being fired at and from what direction in the same way we as human beings sense when a fly lands on us somewhere, they feel it.although pod pilots do have crews, they don't need them essentially. more or less, they are there for long term maintenance. they're probably more engineers than pilots. i'm pretty sure some pod pilots would have their ships manned by drones.that link is talking about the average crews of ship, that aren't piloted by capsuleers.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"

10/4/2012,"the problem: if a player is spammed with a large number of conversations, their client may lock up and become non-responsive. organized groups of players occasionally abuse this tactic to prevent players from responding to an attack. according to xolve, the solution: 1.) ccp should declare this tactic an exploit, and temporarily ban (3ish days) all players that participate in any verifiable convo bombs. any player participating in these convo bombs know they are abusing and exploiting the conversation feature to create lag and obstruct the client of an opponent. this is a clear violation of the terms of service: 2.) ccp should work on fixing the conv feature to prevent this from lagging out a player's computer. relevant threads: in f&i: when is an exploit an exploita mittani article discussing gm correspondence that moreless declare this an exploit."
10/4/2012,"first you need proof of if this ""mythical convo bomb"". according to your sources no cap pilot recieved a convo during that operation. there for there is no proof that this actually took place. lag in eve is a mystery sometimes appears for no reason."
10/4/2012,"i propose that you reformulate this thread to a neutral tone. right now it comes out as a public cry about your coalition's loss. firstly, your boo-boo makes this proposal look like it was motivated by vengeance, not a flaw in game mechanics. secondly, your tears make it look like what you're really after is ccp reimbursing your carrier losses and banning those who kicked your sorry bottom. thirdly, your hurting bottom tries to hide the fact that your fleet was lost due to them being 20km away from pos shield and capping out - not ""convo spam"". fourthly, your crying shows incredible double morals, as convoing has always belonged to cfc repertoire.if you want to make a serious proposal, take your personal vendetta out of it."
10/4/2012,"i agree, hearsay is not evidence of wrong doing.... ccp has logs, and assuming they can verify it, they should punish it. people that feel they are wronged, should file a petition for ccp to investigate it. there is no reason for 100 people to suddenly pm an opponent in the middle of a battle other than to disrupt their client. if that ever happens to you, you clearly have the grounds to file a petition, and all those involved should be appropriately punished (like with a temp ban). in truth, ccp really shouldn't need to tell people this is wrong, as it is clearly a violation of the tos, but some people need to have there hand held."
10/4/2012,"ironically, this hasn't happened to me or my coalition, i just get annoyed when people cheat to win. agony's not involved in any sov crap, and frankly blues suck balls... i don't think ccp should reimburse any ship losses, as anyone that takes their ship into a fleet battle should accept its going to die. perhaps i'll tone down the post some... i'm really just peeved that people would attempt such tactics..."
10/4/2012,"i agree that the convo bomb tactic isn't making the game any better but worse. but giving retroactive bans - especially when both sides are known to use the same exploit - doesn't sound to me like a ""solution"" that you claim it to be."

10/4/2012,"let me start with the standard disclosure. i love eve, i've been playing for 6 years without any unsub type break. i've spent most of the last 4 years running 4 separate accounts. i'm not crying about anything, i'm not whinging about anything.there are many aspects of the game that i feel need improvement, some of which we've seen dev love applied, and some of which we will be seeing dev love applied at the end of this year.there are others that i'm aware ccp are looking at, such as corp management panel & pos's.however, one of my gripes i've not seen any movement on, well, ever, really.that is the political relationships between the 4 empires.ccp loves to remind us (and for good reason) that new eden is the biggest sandbox environment in the world.why is it then that the factions are still tied at the hip?we've all read the same chronicles, the same novellas, and the same novels haven't we?we're all aware of the same political, social and economic rivalries between the 4 empires aren't we?so why is it that amarr/caldari and minmatar/galente are still tied at the hip?i would dearly like to see some separation applied between the empires.an in-character point of view:i graduated as a capsuleer a little over 6 years ago having been selected after getting excellent marks in the apititude and physiology tests implemented by the state war academy. after i'd completed my training i became a private contractor in support of the state, taking to heart the lessons the state imparts about working for the good of the state, applying my best talents and skill in furtherance of the goals of state and accumulating the rewards that i risked life and limb (and hull) for.when the shock of the matari thukker fleets happened, the assaults on the concord station, the retrieval and exodus of the long thought dead starkmanir tribe. i felt so strongly for them, i had a great desire to support their initiative for freedom. oppressive religious slavery being against the ideals of state.sadly though, when i endeavoured to provide support to the minmatar republic corporations, whether providing security or minerals or logistical support - those acts were frowned upon by the amarr and for reasons that escape me, my own state slapped me on the wrists also.had i been shooting state forces? then surely i would understand, but yet when my firepower is applied to amarrian loyalists vessels (or worse, their associated blood raider pirates) which is an act i have undertaken repeatedly for my own state, i still get slapped for it? this is a situation that strikes me as both irrational, and in the long term untenable.no-one i work with within the state holds any love for the amarr, no-one like a slaver or a bully. so why is it our politicians feel a need to kow-tow to them? tibus heth certainly doesn't feel that need!it's time for a change.[ooc]please csm, dig in to this, talk with ccp, let's remove that link between the empires, give us capsuleers that extra freedom to support who we want without being punished for it irrationally."
10/4/2012,"if you want to run a corporation like a business, then the prerogative to do so is on you, not ccp. besides, most ceos don't want that sort of information made public, not even to their own members. there are trust issues along with outside influences to deal with if said information leaked out.if you're looking for advice on how to run a corp, i wrote a guide which is stickied in eve new citizens q&a resources."
10/4/2012,"when a thread is in violation of the forum rules, it usually gets locked. such examples are:threads with excessive trolling.threads with no content.threads that aren't posted in the correct subcategory.threads intended to verbally attack and berate others.threads created specifically to link to .threads full of hate speech, personal information, offensive material, and/or rantings.excessive number of threads pertaining to one topic.thread spamming by an individual, an individual plus his alts, and/or a handful of players collaborating to flood the forums.threads created to spread false rumors with intent to troll.though that's not a complete list of why threads get locked, it certainly covers the most common reasons why."
10/4/2012,i didn't say summon. the faction rats would just be there harrassing anybody they target at random. they would not be there to pick a side but have their own goal of eliminating both of the other opposing forces. maybe even do what the sansha incursions do and drop in their on capitals and supers. to prevent farming of these rats or abuse they would need to not drop any loot or salvage and offer no reward for their destruction. they would also need to dissapear after the fleet engagement is over to prevent them from staying in a system.

10/6/2012,"what's the point though? if it's just a must have thing, with a set cost and no new gameplay mechanics, there is no point adding it. you might as well say, that crew costs are already included in the hull cost and leave it at that. no wasted dev time, no wasted gameplay potential, same end result. i think whatever the chosen mechanic is any sort of xp grinds are bad and should be avoided like a plague. the problem with xp gains for crews is, that it just leads to xp grinding by any means necessary. instead of playing the game normally and doing what they enjoy, people will endure almost anything to grind for xp. even when they don't like it, they will do it and dislike the game for making them do it. getting around this problem is easy though. don't allow crews to gain xp. instead have different types of crews with different advantages. for example: standard crew comes with the hull and provides the normal stats, but alternate crews can be used to alter existing stats in some way. bonuses to some areas with negatives to others, so even the standard crew sees a lot of use. just an example for something different without trying to crowbar in an xp grind mechanic to the game."

10/6/2012,"recovering implants seems a pretty low-imagination way to use the idea of corpse salvaging. much more interesting would be to use the burned-out implants and other biological material from player corpses to manufacture new (highly illegal) types of advanced implants, or bio-control interfaces for new types of ships or modules.a resource gathering profession driven by purely pvp activities would certainly be something interesting."
10/6/2012,"it's not pretty low imagination, ideas come and evolve with brainstorming it.your idea could be added as some sort of invention with the body recovered implant as if they have been used they are not ready to be sale again.- either they have a refurbishment in order to sale it- or invention that give advance implantrecovering poucentage in that case could be important and the cost of refurbishement doesn't flood the market.with that, you could place another market in the hand of capsuleer.but and there's a big but there, some people will go on headhunting in order to kill to recover implant.so on the other hand you need to put in place some safe guard about it.you don't want some people to exploit it.the emplementation could be done in two stages, first recovery and refurbishment and then later when the market is more mature the possibilities of invention throught bodies.but as i said in a post earlier, we shall have the possibilities to offer a resting place for the corpse."
10/6/2012,"due to a dozen of recent hotdrop'o'clocks and cries about counters to cynoships, i thought i'd bump this a bit."
10/6/2012,"i don't think ccp should get rid of the system, but it has to evolve, that's for sure.because you could exploit the bounty or farm it.i know people talked already about it but here some idea :the bounty should be link to kill right, the killing righth should have an extended time.its not because we have clone that life should be easilly disposed.either you use the killing right to have your moment of glory or you make a deal with concord, an exchange.that doesn't apply in 0.0its then that new rule should apply.in the killing right, the one who give the last blow got the maximum, the other half each.you pay 10% of the bounty and concord the rest, that should give incentive bounty.when a kill right is trade. those guys start to flash red to everybody. it's not only a bounty, it become a hunt.with a safety guard, when you killed the guy with his bounty you are not flashing red to he's corp mate or alliance.and then the bounty is done, or the guy has to wait in station for his bounty to end, but when the deambulation will come if he goes out of his quater, he could be targeted as well at with any gun or knife that will be available.tool for the bounty :concord should have a board accessible inside ship (fighting class ship only, no industrial or mining ship). it allow you to know that less than 3 jump from your position in a system or a station (if docked) a bounty is waiting to be taken.and we coud have the same board accessible from captain quater but with a range of 10 jump, the change of region don't count only the number of jump.a bounty link to a killright is right to my point of view it's probably fair in the game."

10/7/2012,2
10/7/2012,i laughed a little at the extra 2 cup sizes...they aren't big enough already? either way the plex for breast cancer is a great idea. in fact i really wish ccp would start doing plex drives for multiple benifits all at the same time. keep them open indefinately. that kind of thing would really get attention towards eve in a good way.
10/7/2012,"i hope you realize that any frig, destroyer or cruiser would be instapopped by sleeper bs in a c4-c6. warping fhrough gatesis a mad idea anyway. anomalies in a c5 or c6 are way different from the ones in c1-c4 wh's. the scram, neut. if you do them in a wrong way or shoot one of the triggers by accident you may have a hard time or loose the fleet in the worse case.someone on page 3 compared anomalies to incursions. imho i think incursions are a lot easier, no risk to be ganked either.wormhole stabilizers is a bad word. it's more an 'invasion-tool' than anyting else. but even then, there is no other reason i would know how to use it than for invading and making sure i can get a few caps in when my enemy is sleeping. it saves the time needed to colla[se and scanning time though."
10/7/2012,"eidric, pig's ideas are better than any of yours. instead of debating science, how about you debate the effects in which he refers? its obvious this game isn't pinned down completely to science, otherwise stations would actually orbit planets and moons and my spaceship wouldn't slow down when the engines stopped or i would at least see some retro rocket fire i mean come on! so stop trying to show off how smart you think you are because you half-*** read some science articles and admit that the effect could use some change!"
10/7/2012,"i agree with the possibility to hack an off line pos and module as well.when a pos goes offline, there's a 7 days timer before the hacking process could be done.- a hacking pos skill, higher the level, less time to do it, but it should take twice or three time the normal time you need to install it this skill has to be link to several other skill at lv4 or 5, it has to be a real job and the training time is 5but i think the chance of recovering what is inside should be offer.- you have to have the hacking pos skill at lv4 and the training time is 7 each lv give you a % of recovery, the lv5 give 50% for exemple."
10/7/2012,there is a fault in your reasoning. afk cloaking is the only activity where someone does not benefit from being afk. how do you actually know if the player is afk or not?
10/7/2012,easy its the fact that ppl dont know if the person cloaked for up to 23 hrs in system is active or not and they cant scan him down but its not the cloaked ship that stops them mining its the black ops fleet that he could jump in so all that really needs to be done is put a black ops jammer into system sov and then no one will care if the cloaky is active or not because he is basicly usless against even a half decent sheild tanked barge.
10/7/2012,i have to admit that doesn't hurt the active cloaker.
10/7/2012,"there doesn't need to be a point for something like this. its just a matter of ""realism"", especially if ccp does say ""your ships have crews! god!"" it also could create potential markets and trade routes if these items were only ""produced"" (read: educated and prepared for space travelling) at certain planets/constelations. else nobody really thinks a ship has crew because:1. you mine asteroids.2. you build it, possibly slowly from asteroids.3. you enter it and exit station all in under a week.there's never mention of anyone in there really. but either way, its one of those things. the sole bonus i suggeted would be somethign that simply enable a ship's bonuses and doesnt' really complicate things. or more hilariously:maybe you could have 4 ""crew races"" which when applied to a ship gave it bonuses to each of their race's weapons. ever wanted to fly a stabber with blasters? (ugh). get a gallentean crew, i'm sue they know how to fit the things."
10/7/2012,"for industry pilots out in the cold dark zero zero... getting access to trit, pye, mex in null sec is overly difficult because the lack of it in grav sites and the fact that corps are rarely given access to large patches of 0.0 systems where they can freely roam systems and mine asteroid belts, unlike empire space. on the flip side... grav sites yield an over abundance of nocxium zydrine and megacyte ores even at the lowest index levels. this is partly intended so that their is a flow of null sec mined minerals to empire, but with industry indexes, a change in loot tables, and the growth of 0.0... thousands of systems with poor belts now have access to an unlimited supply of high end minerals and no realistic way to make use of them. all these 0.0 minerals go to the only system that can support their sale, jita.along with flooding the jita market with high ends, most null sec industry corps & alliances buy low ends from the same market in bulk and do what is called mineral compression. this pulls billions of low end minerals off the jita market and converts them to meta 0 mods to then be shipped to null sec. when this is done on a large scale this puts stress on the market hub and leads to large movements in mineral prices.my proposal is...a re-balance of the contents of these complexes in order to make 0.0 production less difficult, make ore\minerals that were once considered rare more difficult to access and profitable, at the same time bring mining up to par with recent changes to anomalies where pilots making the most isk are at the greatest risk, thus increasing pvp in eve.first, re-balancing to to make production easier...first of all let me explain that i am going to be using the drakes as a analog of the common t1 build-able item so gravimetric complexes and my changes to them can be compared to each other. now to the complexes themselves.small gravimetric sites are the easiest to attain and maintain yet they can't support production at all and are overstocked with way more high ends then can be used. you can not build 2 drakes off of the 8 million m3 in this site.my proposal to change the small site in a way that makes it a key site for all pilots wanting to do production in null sec. in order to do that it needs a change in it's current contents. this also helps to conquer my second goal of making abc ores and their minerals more difficult to attain and more profitable. a modified small would drop from 8 million m3 to a total of 5.5 million and minerals in the right ratio that 20 drakes can be made. it takes 15,000 arkonor, 25,000 bistot, and 15,000 crokite out of circulation for all index level 1 systems just for starters. when comparing the current small at 870m isk for 8 million m3 and the modified small at 5.5 million m3 and worth 1006m isk, one would hardly miss the high end minerals at all. future outlook - if the minerals drop to nov. 2010 levels this site would be worth approximately 600m. below is a list of the asteroids that would be found in the small gravimetric complex in units.veldspar - 9,000,000scordite - 7,000,000pyroxeres - 2,500,000plagioclase - 3,500,000omber - 125,000kernite - 175,000jaspet - 100,000hemorphite - 65,000hedbergite - 65,000gneiss - 30,000dark ochre - 35,000crokite - 10,000bistot - 5,000arkonor - 5,000second, make rare minerals rare again...we have already taken a huge chunks of high end ores out of the system by modifying the most basic gravimetric complex and reducing its yield of high end minerals it offers. here is where we slowly put it back in, but do it at a ratio that means less of an extreme over abundance as before and allowing each site to yield reasonable amounts of low end minerals to support it's use in t1 production locally. what we should end up with is an overall reduction in high end minerals that can be achieved but a larger potential for profit with corps that can maintain high index levels and build off the minerals they mine.third, put pvp back in 0.0 and increase the risk for miners...corps and alliances willing to upgrade the index to 4 & 5, do large scale production, and produce large amounts of high end minerals will literally be placing themselves on the map. maps used by pvp corps and alliances that roam 0.0 looking for index levels and systems showing large activity.in the end?what does this do for the industrialist...players wanting to build in 0.0 will have better access to low end minerals. an ability to seed 0.0 markets with items mined, refined, and built locally.what it does for the isk miners...miners will be driven like never before to increase index levels to access ores that are once again considered rare and valuable, but currently over mined and worthless, being accessible to anyone with a hulk and ore prospecting array i.what it does for pvp in 0.0...as the changes made in the past in sov levels used to limit anomalies availability shifted pilots in to smaller spaces, isk miners wanting to earn the highest amount of isk possible will be interested in upgrading indexes beyond level 1-2-3 and turning themselves into targets for roaming fleets. the pure industrialists only interested in actual production will be less effected."
10/7/2012,if you are new player or old player that looks for a corp and you flavour of the game is incursion and you want to join a corp that is specific for this part of the game it<U+FFFD>s not availble in the recruitment search.there is corps just for this part of the game but since there is no option to search for them its not easy to find them either.
10/7/2012,"try the alliance and corporation recruitment center, you have the wrong subforum friend."
10/7/2012,"no it<U+FFFD>s not in the wrong forum.this is simply an option in the ""search"" window where you find corps recruiting that is missing.you can search for specific corps that do faction warfare and so on, but you cant search for specific corps that specialize in incursion running.so this is very much the correct forum to bring up the subject and see what ccp thinks."
10/7/2012,"i much prefer the 'salvaging' approach to the 'looting' approach - to be honest, i'd like to see the same for shipwrecks where, instead of plucking intact modules out of a wreck you only got smashed up components which you would need to process much like salvage is processed currently. plucking an old implant out of a body, wiping it down and selling it on is a bit linear for my liking.either way, there needs to be a modification so that '[player name]'s frozen corpse' becomes '[player name]'s mutilated corpse' after it has had the useful materials scraped out of it."
10/7/2012,"i think scatim's idea of using corpses to make new contraband is more interesting because it adds a new dimension to criminal activity in eve. right now if we want to be unethical dealers of illegal goods, all we have are boosters.make it so that clone grade/sp and implants at time of death affect corpse quality somehow too, so there's a reason to seek out older/richer players' corpses and discourage farming alpha clones off your alt."
10/7/2012,"agreed with both of you, some sort of grade in corpses could give a better market.to have a mature market you need more corpses available some could be recover from wreck or from some mission.and you could add some flavor if i could say that, like scentist body give implant for science and research, tourist give accuracy like targeting. an exotic dancer could give implant for inertia etc...the contreband could be part of the trade, but i think it could be link to some skills to hide contreband in general in ships and special container.i always found annoying getting caught at a gate for moving forbidden stuff without havintg the possibility to hide it.a skill for contreband ability - give access to the second skill at lv3a skill for the ability to hide contreband in ship - give access to the third skill at lv2a skill for enhanced containerthis three skill at lv 5 give you 100% chance of not being caught."

10/7/2012,"it would be better to have capitals (and subcaps doing black ops) to have a jump time rather than teh cyno timer. the further you are jumping from the longer it takes to arricve on the field, the larger teh ship the slower the travel time.ive never been a fan of instant travel. stargates could stay more or less instant with teh reason being the absolutely massive power available to them as stationary objects that have only one purpose as oppose to a starship that has so many other things it has to cram into its hull."

10/8/2012,"i personally think if a pos owner lets the fuel run out... they don't deserve a 7-day ""safety"" timer!!!!! there already exist plenty of pos applications that allow eve players to track exactly how much fuel is in your pos.... eve generates notifications when a pos is running low on resources.... there is no excuse for letting a pos run out of fuel, and if you do, you should be risking it's loss!!! as such, i recommend the following: a.) offline towers should have no shields... if you don't fuel your pos, you should be very worried about someone stealing or destroying it!!! b.) i'm not a fan of hacking pos's, but i'm not completely opposed to it. i prefer just reducing a pos's ehp enough to make it easily destroyed... but i also realize that most people wont want to waste their time and ammo shooting a pos without some type of motivation. since there are waaayyy to many abandoned poses in space, hacking a tower is reasonable compromise that encourages people to scoop them. note, hacking needs to be a criminal (concordable) activity. this means you need to wardec a corp to ""hack"" it's tower in highsec, which gives more than reasonable notification for a highsec corp to ""fuel"" their offline pos's. c.) what is the point of sleep mode??? rf exists to give people a chance to protect your in-space assets... and you can fuel a pos to do the same.... not fueling the pos is akin to not stronting the tower. sleep mode should not be a backup pos state that the pos enters when it runs out of fuel, but should be a specific, minimal operation mode used to maintain the pos inexpensively. sleep mode should have major penalties to the pos (50% shields, all pos modules offline, no pos force field), in exchange for much cheaper fuel (and maybe even an rf timer). the fuel capacity of a pos in sleep mod should not be more than a month, with the idea that players put a pos in sleep mode on purpose, to essentially reserve a pos's real-estate while not leaving the pos vulnerable to hacking."
10/8/2012,"easy fix, a pos with no fuel will degrade orbit, after 2 weeks of orbital decay the pos will fall into the gravity well of the moon it orbits and drag all the modules with it."
10/8/2012,"i personally don't have a cloak-able ship on my combat alt that i enjoy using so i can only speculate on what i have learnt so far, the only way in which i can see there being a method to possibly appease both sides is to have a emission rating or heat rating on the cloak. this could then build up over extended use of say a hour or what ever length of time is suitable, you could then have a scanner to scan for these emissions or heat build up. the template is in place if they used a similar model to the planet scanning for resources where by white spots indicate heat/emissions, this would also mean if these emission are produced by all ships then the best place for a cloaker is on main routes. alternatively if its heat based the sun or volcanic planets also produce heat as do big facilities.and not to ruin continuity in low/null sec have interference on the scanner that makes it a lot less accurate so that you could only scan down to withing say 1au of the target. that way the high sec care bares get their counter measure that is partially effective, and cloaking ops are not totally compromised.i mean if they use the heat side of thing for the build up afk cloaking could still happen if they leave it near say a star but then one scan would give that away in the sense no heat spots else where on the map.anyway what you think? viable to both sides?"
10/8/2012,"someone 'actively cloaking' behind ememy lines doing some recon work may very well be cloaked up for more than an hour. you have now nerfed an active cloaker.same thing for someone cloaked in a wh. he could be stalking the local residents setting up the correct time to pounce. your scannable heat signature now alerts the residents that someone is cloaked in the wh. you just broke wormholes!um, how is this anything but a nerf to cloaking???jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

10/8/2012,"its not my fantasty. it's ccps, and they're not going to change the game lore because one bloke on the forums is having a hissy fit. according to ccp and their officially published fiction, non capsuleer crews are massively inefficient.taking this issue away from a lore perspective, adding crews means more things for ccp to balance. balance is already a bloody nightmare that ccp are now putting a very large amount of time into, so its unlikely they will find this idea even vaguely appealing. if you think dragging the icon of a person into a new fitting slot will be ""fun"" and then spending extra time in eft trying to work out what the new optimum fit for all your ships will be, then your too easily please. not to mention the fact you will be adding another level of complexity to a game that ccp is already putting effort into making more accessible to newer players. i could rant forever about why this is a bad idea, but i'll stop there.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
10/8/2012,"the thing is, that people doing scams aren't actually hurting anyone with the trade that fails. in that transaction you have the items, you try to sell it to them and the sale fails. you're still left with all your items and you didn't lose any money in the failed transaction. so everything stays the same for you. you have been exploited, but the exploitation happened before the failed trade and no game mechanics were circumvented.why is that relevant? it's relevant because it determines what actions are acceptable in treating such a minute problem. minute because it in no way interferes with the well being of the market system, doesn't steal anything from the person being tricked and is very easy to spot beforehand. any solution must therefore be equally good for the health of the system and be balanced with the severity of the problem it tries to solve.that is partly why freezing their wallets or putting the in to negative balance seem like bad solutions. freezing a wallet is a problem because everything in eve demands the wallet to fuction. all kinds of small costs and taxes are involved, so you can't play the game without a positive working wallet. it doesn't seem appropriate to stop the other player from playing the game, just because he put up a market order with no losers. negative wallet is much worse, since it presumably pays the seller from money, that doesn't actually exist in the game. this is an issue, since it's concievable, that you can make orders, that allow you to print increasing amounts of money from nothing and you wouldn't need other people to do it. it doesn't matter if your wallets are red at that point, since you can buy plexs and make new accounts and continue exploiting. in case you didn't know training a trading alt is very fast let alone a character who simply needs . the trading branch is so fast to fully train, that it doesn't even warrant an attribute respec. i'm sure ccp could crack down on people exploiting such a system, but again it's potentially a gamebreaking solution for an insignificant problem.i'm not saying there can't be ways to have consequenses for people doing it, but what you suggest as solutions are more damaging to the market and the game, than could even theoretically be. it's not a problem that must be fixed at all cost or the game can't function. it's an easy to spot scam, that doesn't do any damage to the system or the player falling for it. it's just a bait to get a greedy player to buy some overpriced items, that he can resell to recoup his investment. all i'm saying is that any potential solution to the issue must be appropriate to the nature and severity of the problem."

10/9/2012,i start to wonder if only a csm member or if a developer is aware of this idea...
10/9/2012,"max,i totally agree with you, your petition would really improve the game-play, and it is what ccp have to do to the next expansion, i would really appreciate if the eve community move in this direction,i have spent some time trying to find a way to gather some ideas about what is expected of the pos revamp that the last csm claimed as a goal. i would really appreciate your opinion there, also if the csm read this i would really appreciate if they take this effort to cpp, and some dev use it to speed up their job.... link: [discussion] - new pos system ( block built - starbasecraft)thx o7 new pos system new sov system"
10/9/2012,that would work but what is the fun in that?
10/9/2012,can't support this. if you cant fully fuel a pos why should you be alowed to claim the moon.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
10/9/2012,"guys, ccp plans on reworl the whole pos system, if you read the last csm meeting minutes you will see that.please take a look at this tread: [discussion] - new pos system ( block built - starbasecraft) new pos system new sov system"
10/9/2012,or we could just not implement stupid mechanics that do nothing but nerf legitimate playstyles because crybaby bears need even more safety than they already have.i know its a shocking idea
10/9/2012,"like i said i think cloaking is fine as is but that to one side every development in war has a counter measure, at present the cloak rules supreme with no counter measure. by adding a way to counter it you can still use it and do things fine but just means those that use it with less shall we say strategy get a kick in the butt.personally though drone swarms work well against cloaks well enough that its a viable counter provided you take certain other steps.either way i was merely adding a option of compromise that could work"
10/9/2012,"so all an afk cloaker has to do is point at a random spot in space and switch on engines. no longer stationary... no heat buildup.you could counter that by saying, well that dosn't count, they have to warp at least once an hour.now its a massive nerf to active (non covert ops) ships that have managed to get in place undetected and are waiting cloaked, to spring on someone... or performing intel-gathering.jint hikaru - miner / salvager / explorer / spacebum in the beginning the universe was created. this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
10/9/2012,"ok. i understand ccp needs to make things more simple as they need to add players to eve and make more money, as i understand crew is a concept which would need to be balanced properly but i don't work for ccp (so i am not asking myself how can i balance it properly?) and i don't play eve because is simple (actually i would play it more if it was more complex).i addition, i didn't discovered crews by my self, it has been hugely discussed already, i decided to make a new post as i did't find any post about that in the new forums.by the way, try to follow this point: eve is a complex game.... in the beginning. once you understand how it works, isn't that hard to play and this is the reason why old players (not new) ask for big improvements. i understand that ccp need to make the game accessible to everyone but look at that under a ""marketing eye"": who do you care the most? players who paid for years the subscription? or players who try the game for a month or few and than they quit?i think both need to be listened, and for example, as someone suggested already, you may have crew in biggers ships (from bc for example) so you will avoid the crew management to anyone who is new to the game.i mean, we are discussing just the concept of crew, i put an idea but i am sure it can be improved, hoping to have something extra to deal during my game play."

10/10/2012,+1 from me... looks great!
10/10/2012,we keep looking for an easy updatehrolt ceo live free; die proud
10/10/2012,"copy-paste from my post in this thread:a very painful realization.being at war with dec shield makes us no longer able to declare new wars.you might say ""sure, you can still declare wars!"" technically, you're right. but each corporation that leaves dec shield creates its own war. and each new war that is created raises the price of declaring a new war by 50 million isk. today, about seven corporations left dec shield. when i went to declare war on a separate target, i noticed that the cost to do so would be 400 million.this is already in the realm of impossibility to be able to afford. but the worst part is, that if this continues, we will no longer be able to take mercenary jobs, since clients will not pay such high war fees even if we do the actual work for free.so, zerg, what this essentially means is that if you cycle about 20 alt corporations in and out of your alliance on a weekly basis, all of dec shield's currently-trapped targets will have war bills so expensive that they won't be able to declare new wars."
10/10/2012,"zerg, it's obvious you and your fellows have put a lot of time and efforts into finding and using the broke-ass mechanics ccp has foisted on us (yet again) concerning war-decs. what i want to know is how long it is going to take them to fix this c-f so that wars can actually be useful again?has there been any conversation between the csm and ccp about this?"
10/10/2012,"i talked to veritas and soundwave in vegas this last weekend, and went over many of the major loopholes and the such. soundwave gave me his business card and asked me to email him more information. i'm currently working on a more concise write up so i can mail it off to him, was planning to do so today.as far as urgency, they were all of the mindset that it wasn't a pressing enough issue yet, and there weren't enough complaints or public outcry to warrant shifting gears to address the issues quicker. so at least in the short term i wouldn't expect anything to change, but we'll continue to push for fixes anyways."
10/10/2012,"not what i wanted to hear, but thanks for the answer and for continuing to push the issue. keep fighting the good fight."
10/10/2012,"seriously? is this thread still going? do us a favour and look up the old ones, everything you anti-cloakers are saying has been covered literally hundreds of times in previous threads. do some god damn reading. i am done baby sitting you lot and slowly and patiently explaining why the hundreds of terrible ideas you people come up with are crap.i just don't get it. what is so wrong with you people that your so damn scared of 1 person in a system? if someone is there and you want to run anomalies, move next door. is that really that scary?""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
10/10/2012,your forum-fu is weak. i found these 2 threads right away.
10/10/2012,"oh! really? i didn't know that! now that i have this ""what to follow"" list i am sure i will win the game!!revamp and rebalance it is something will always happen, especiallly in a game like eve where you have two major expansion every year. ccp is iproving and adding new stuff to the game, i am wondering if one day the will add crew to and personally i think they will do that.so, even without crew, you still need to revamp and rebalance old contentsmaybe they try, but adding more skills will always put new pilots in the back.read all the posts and you will find out that this ""issue"" has been already discussed. there are several ways to not ""bother""newbies with crew and/or other stuff. crew would be not mandatory (like rigs)this advice is totally useless, but thank you for it. i really appreciate it.the reason of the post is not: ""i want a crew cause i would like it"", the post is about something which could be added in the future in one of following expansion. crew would add surely something nice to the game. think about having a fight with the chance to loose one of your officers and his bonuses. it is something which can't happen with rigs or modules (unless u overload them ofc). crew would add the ""lucky"" variable factor which is actually missed.a game is a game ofc but adding any realism isn't bad and ships have crew. in a fight crew has a big role, would be nice to add something like that in any big eve fight. the concept isn't really usefull for pve fights, but mostly for pvp fleet combats.if you can't understand that ok, but please keep your intresting post somewhere else. in any proposal forum would be nice to see suggestions to improve the idea and not useless post. i"
10/10/2012,"thank you for your kind words durcon. we can all do our part by traveling to the gallente starter systems in a proud naga, finding a gallente noob in their first frig, and blast them in the name of the state. explain to them that you did it because they are gallente, and that everyone in the game will continue to hate them until they choose another race. also, tell them that it is socially unacceptable to mine in highsec after you've been playing longer than 6 months.highsec is owned by players now. systems 0.5-1.0 are new order territory. all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code. mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the eve community. see www.minerbumping.com"
10/10/2012,autism
10/10/2012,i tried to skim it... but was overwhelmed by rp stuff..... is there anything relevant to the assembly hall forum in that thread?
10/10/2012,"good afternoon csm,is it possible to deliberate or consider changing incursion mechanics so that if a fleet enters a site, they either have a timer or are exclusively tied to the site until they down it or leave?i'm not sure how to actually make it work, but it'd be pretty fantastic to implement something along those lines.cheers"
10/10/2012,i'm sorry... can you please explain what the problem is??
10/10/2012,"eve is dying. lowsec is drying up, 0.0 is dead (unless you're part of the cfc or hbc blobbing each other) and in 2 months you can make 50bil, flying in circles doing nothing productive.and we are pissed.here are several propositions, with ways to execute them:1) faction farmingcurrently, everyone and their mother/brother/daughter/sister/cousin/aunt is leaving whatever it is they are doing to get in on the isk farming train that is faction warfare. you take a frigate, fit a warp core stab, and orbit some plex's until they are capped. then one day you take control of the system and cash out. there is no incentive for the opposing faction to defend their space (because they are doing the exact same thing in their own space)what needs to be done?reduce lp gain from capping the plex's by 80%, while increasing lp gain from killing attackers by 250%, scaling with rank vs rank. if a rank 10 kills a rank 1 (please excuse me, i don't know the level ratings or crap), you'd gain say 25% lp. but if a rank 1 kills a rank 10, 250%. this is solely on defense against other players. this will reduce the lp -> isk farming that is currently happening, while bringing life back in to the spirit of factional warfare.2) npc nullsec vs sov secthere is absolutely no reason to go to npc nullsec other than to engage in some random fights and dock up when you get outnumbered. should sov space have the 'best' systems? sure, but to an extent. there needs to be an incentive to move to npc nullsec. for example, if you are in syndicate, there should be more serpentis related events. weather it be more serpentis plex's, better rats (i mean, it is the serpentis' area of operations, you know they have fleets there) as well as exclusive gallente related moon goo. same goes for the other npc nullsec regions. you could also decrease the true sec of systems the further from npc space they are, reducing the number of botters out in the ass-end of nowhere.3) promote piracywhat if there were some npc factions that encouraged piracy? similar to faction wafare, but more on a non role play level. for example, once you have pirated 100 targets, you could gain access to smuggler gates, creating shortcuts to other areas of low/null sec. suddenly you could be pirating in decon, and gain access to jump from decon to reblier. i know that is a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea."
10/10/2012,"i know there are plans for fw changes in the winter expansion, but this is something that really needs to be addressed right now, as it is an exploit."
10/10/2012,"i still can't believe fw lp farming hasn't been nerfed, it was known early on that it was broken and it hasn't been touched, even reducing the tier bonus to 20% instead of 50% would've at least helped. i actually ignored it for 2 months expecting it to get hotfixed as soon as i started trying to take advantage. it's 1 month after i started lp farming and i have sold 10bil worth of items from fw and still have another 70bil worth to go.ccp letting this go to winter is just massively incompetent."
10/10/2012,"what really irritates me is that they have deemed the lp method an explot, told how it's an exploit, then proceeded to announce that nothing would be done until the winter expansion."

10/11/2012,"so here it is i was sat up thinking about this game and i realised after reading the time line that its far far into the future, yet there are no aliens in the game at all.so i was thinking maybe it is time to add some in, i was thinking about perhaps some species that is hostile and mounts incursions. or possibly a region discovered through a wormhole of ancient gate of some kind.now for ships and weapons i was thinking about what is not currently covered in the game i mean you got guns and lasers even missiles so perhaps a organic race. as for if they are playable or not i do not mind if they are or are not would just be a cool event to see first contact with a alien species.anyway thats all i got for now.p.s sorry if this come up before i run a search for alien and nothing showed"
10/11/2012,"why?we have 5 major factions... 4 of which are playable... each their own distinct dramas and political issues... and a multitude of sub-factions that haven't been completely fleshed out.also... i feel that adding ""aliens"" would distract from the distinctly ""human story"" in eve."
10/11/2012,"yeah i can see what your saying about there being a lot of factions and such already, i am just thinking it would give the dev's something to aim for in a long run as a cool event. i mean they could do something like for the introduction of the species play them themselves and launch a invasion into a area for example.also a new species in the game could also open up a load more option for wh exploration and in general would add things to the game. as for the distracting from humanity side of the game if they were non playable it would just be a fun bunch of rats and a tool for devs to use for events."
10/11/2012,"the eve universe has a rich and well planned/thought through lore, precipitated by ccp. three books (if only two good ones), and plenty of extra. ccp aren't suddenly going to ""add"" allies into it. besides, when you say aliens, i presume you mean beings of equal power and intelligence to humans. if not, then there are already alien creatures, the slaver hounds are certainly not just dogs, and they even have (if subtle and unassuming) in game representation. in the fiction there is also plenty of mention of other such alien creatures.the devs already have plenty to aim for, they dont need any extra fluff. they have a massive backlog of things they want to get done, and i doubt adding a whole new alien race is part of it. as for wh exploration, the sleepers are there, and we may well be getting a method of exploring sleeper stations, sleepers may not strictly speaking be aliens, but they're really not that close to human either. for those of you who don't know, i'm not referring to the sleeper drones most wh occupants have to deal with on a daily basis.""in the age of information, ignorance is a choice."" www.stateofwar.co.nf"
10/11/2012,"i assume that you believe that aliens should look green/pale/gray with big bulgy eyes...? aliens are all over new eden. if you were born on caldari prime, then amarrians, minmatar, gallente, sansha nation, blood raiders, sleepers, and drones would all be considered aliens...many may share origin, but how do we know that the aliens in real life don't look like us too... wooooooh :tinfoilhat:"

10/11/2012,"while, i agree that changes need to be made, and this is coming from a wormhole ceo, and fw director (my alt is sam sabre), i do believe that eve is far from dead. there are multiple wars going on in nullsec, but i do agree that it will be nice when a goon/test civil war occurs to break up the blocs a bit, and rest assured, like every bloc in the past, it is bound to happen eventually.i would suggest a bit of patience with ccp on the changes this winter, as i sincerely believe it is going to spice up gameplay. the state of fw is still alive as far as pvp, but the isk faucet that exists is overboard. people will abuse it for another month or so and then it will be adjusted and the gameplay will change.i can assure you that ""eve is dying"" threads have existed as far back as i can remember and eve is still here, so i wouldn't stress it..."
10/11/2012,"this is a thread on making smuggling a viable profession (who doesn't want to be han solo?)to begin - we first need to understand what smuggling is and why it's simply impossible to accomplish in eve online.smuggling is the art of moving contraband or conveying person(s) illegally into or out of an area secretly and illicitly. why does it not work in eve online?npc customs officials are faction npcs who sit at gates who scan a random (player) passerby. this is completely unavoidable and while there is no guarantee that you will be scanned, there's also no way to prevent it or lessen the chances. further more, there is no way to actively avoid it either. when you are scanned by a customs official and found to have contraband you will be targeted, scrambled and webbed. at which point you be given a choice to either release the contraband in their custody, be fined and take a standings hit (which can be pretty hefty depending on the item). if you refuse to give up the item, or jettison it from your cargo, you are attacked and will almost inevitably lose your ship. in more extreme cases they may just attack you outright if the contraband is deemed severe enough.so, what needs to be fixed? how can we fix it?1.) we need the ability to be able to do one or more of three options: a.) avoid the customs scans entirely. this could be done by revamping the customs system to apply to the same system we operate on with ecm/sensor strength. b.) reduce the likeliness of customs scans. this could be done by operating on a standing's system, with higher standings in that particular faction reducing the chances of being scanned. think of it as being part of the neighborhood watch and actively taking part in your community, you couldn't -possibly- be doing some illegal, right? c.) reduce the chances of success from customs scans. this could be done with the same system we operate on with ecm/sensor strength - using it in a manner to trick the customs official's sensors into a false scan.2.) revamp the consequences for smuggling. a few things can make this more appealing: a.) reduce the capabilities of the npc customs officials to a more forgiving manner for not making it past the (revamped) scan system. remove scrambling/webbing but keep the option to be fired upon if confiscation is refused. b.) security standings hits should operate not just on the contraband itself but on a 'x' strikes basis. if it's your first time getting caught, the standings hit shouldn't be so severe. if it's your tenth - the nation's probably not going to be happy seeing your face over and over again. c.) operate on the new crimewatch system. with the revamped customs scanning system players should have a chance of being issued as a ""suspect"" in smuggling and if caught should escalate to being a criminal. this will give incentive to bounty hunters operating as more than just bounty hunters, but as public defenders and private investigators.on another note, please see my thread on revamping boosters: [proposal] revamping boosters and their production!"
10/11/2012,"there are a number of pressing issues with boosters and why they simply aren't worth manufacturing/utilizing by comparison to simply purchasing them from an npc manufacturer.to begin, in brief, they are difficult to make and require a hefty amount of startup isk to efficiently produce even the weakest variants. to that end, their usage is largely dependant on the person using them and not the person who is manufacturing them. further adding to the ailments that come with boosters is that the materials required for them can only come from ladar sites - which requires a specialization in and of itself to successfully reap the rewards (minor as they may be) from. high-secstart off by buying or manufacturing a control tower that is capable of running all of the necessary starbase structures that will allow you to produce boosters. this can be as little as 200,000,000 isk just to get the base set up, not including fuel costs. to add onto this issue it's not practical to set this tower up in high-sec (if at all, not sure if you're even capable of setting up drug labs in high sec) what with the illegality of your product (unless it's synth). tack on the cost of factional starbase charters (as well as standings with said faction). finally, to make the issue of high-sec drug manufacture even more difficult is that you simply cannot get past customs at the gates. where-ever you set up your manufacturing starbase, that's where you'll be selling your product from now on. low-secokay, so let's try low-sec. now you have an entire entourage of other difficulties. there are simply no real restrictions preventing a pirate corp (or someone who's role-playing as a concord lackey) from removing your starbase from the equation entirely, so now you have to defend it. how do you do that? tack on the cost of turrets and/or have a sizable amount of friends who are willing to back your project up.now we've run into another issue - and that's whether or not risking ships/pods is even worth defending such a finicky project in the first place. your only customer base is in low-sec/null-sec as you can't effectively get your product into high-sec and, let's face it, there's npc drug production going on that is always going to best you. considering that all of this is going on while you're trying to find a (unreliable, mind you) source of materials and you'll probably wind up spending more isk, time and effort just making the boosters in the first place.the actual issueon the assumption that you're lucky enough to get a safe, consistent means of producing boosters you're now going to have to find a buyer. this is a horrid process by itself as the high end boosters have side-effects/drawbacks which make their usage a little less rewarding. you have a chance, at random, of gaining one of four major side-effects if you botch it. there are skills to reduce the severity of these effects and to reduce their chance - but shaving a 20% likeliness down to 15% isn't all that rewarding, especially when the severity of such side effects are based on similar scales. for the record, those numbers are at both skills at level 5.in today's world, products aren't made to revolutionize the world anymore. innovations are made to make products more effective and efficient, money is spent to reduce costs and difficulties. so how do we do all of that to make boosters viable in new eden? here's some ideas.1.) we need a way to manufacture/produce boosters (at least low end ones) without needing a starbase. 2.) the chance and severity of a booster's side effect shouldn't reflect the users skill, but the manufacturers ability to craft it, or used in tandem with the user's skills.3.) there needs to be a method of getting illegal products into high-sec with some manner of success that we, the players, can affect the chances of. see my thread on smuggling: [proposal] revamp contraband/customs scans!4.) materials used to make boosters should reflect how powerful the booster itself is. two ways we can do this is to decrease the difficulty in procuring said materials (such as alchemy with moon goo) or to increase the amount of materials currently in the universe.edit: spoke with another player about the ladar gas clouds and a really good idea that came up was to have the gas clouds both more frequent and a bit more static in the form of actually acting as part of the nebula of the particularly region. sort of like asteroid belts but not so much. this would incentivize the production and usage of boosters to a ""i'm going into combat, i -need- this advantage"" regularity."

10/12/2012,"it's no secret that in eve whenever the topic of mining comes up, many players simply roll their eyes. among all the activities in eve, it would appear that mining is the most passive activity of all to the point where if you are mining in accordance with ccp rules, you will most likely have your web browser open in one window while keeping an eye on your ore hold on the main game screen all the while taking note every moment or so if any hostiles are in the area.although ccp has recently given a few ""gifts"" to miners lately, it is unfortunate that there has been no report of any changes to game play. i think that mining should be more like other professions in the game in that it is more interactive and that attentiveness is rewarded by speeding up the rate in which the ship is able to extract ore.this post has nothing to do with going after the players using bots but i do believe that by making mining more fun, it can reduce the amount of people using such tools. i believe that people simply use them because mining is dull and boring and the income generated is still less than folks who run higher level missions.the purpose of this post is simply to generate ideas from the rest of the player base on what sort of changes you believe could make mining more interesting and interactive."

10/12/2012,"aspects of development time needed? no art, no game mechanics, no new aspect to the game that needs to be player tested. the same team assembled that has been adding additional new anomalies and updating agent missions could handle the changes in gravimetric complexes."
10/12/2012,"this is a predictible result of the barge buff, as the same deflationary tool set available to high-sec miners is available to null-sec miners as well. because value = demand / supply, it stands to reason that there needs to be a mechanism to limit the uptake of minerals. i do not believe that in light of the current exhumer yield and hit points that such a mechanism currently exists in either null-sec or high-sec.in a sense i support a rebalancing of some sort, but until the deflationary mechanism itself is addressed by adding considerable new risk to miners in both high-sec and null-sec, i see a rebalance as a 'band-aid"" solution at best. inevitably every mineral and ice product in the game will be deflated to a point approaching its floor. like locusts, miners will consume resources and glut the market until the resources are worth nothing and then move on completely unhindered to the next victims. this will happen in high-sec and null-sec alike because there is insufficient risk to miners in either locale.this is not a partisan issue. this all comes down to value and ease of acquisition.he who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller. -darth gustav's axiom"
10/12/2012,"the situation you describe isn't hypothecial but rather a daily ocurrence. fleet 2 has the option to go to another incursion system, get moar bigger gunz, or my favourite - more guns *and* people that have proper skills for the ships they're flying (the number of incursion runners i've seen flying battleships with sub-optimal cruiser skills is staggering). this may come as a shock to you, but contested sites are just as much pvp as if i shoot your spaceship in the face."
10/12/2012,"csm representatives, please consider directly asking ccp to have a moment's thought about value:value is not some philosophical ideal. at its core, value is a simple function of mathematics. it can be reduced to a very simple equation:value = demand / supply.observe that with this model, if supply is constant and demand increases, value increases. likewise, if supply is constant and demand decreases, value decreases.on the other side of the coin, if demand is constant and supply increases, value decreases. likewise, if demand is constant and supply decreases, value increases.more advanced manipulations, where delta values of supply and demand are compared, are possible with only slightly more mathematical ability. the model will remain consistent regardless, and reliably accurate in a predictive sense.where these principles apply directly to goods, they also apply to the professions surrounding the harvest or manufacture of those goods. this is not just a problem that can be resolved by hoping for equilibrium. new players rely on a vibrant economy when they select a career path. new miners in-particular probably don't want to hear that nobody's mining anything right now because there is a supply glut. i feel comfortable in asserting that this is an intuitive glimpse into the new player's psyche.lately, it seems that certain design elements might be losing sight of this fundamental principle. supply seems to have less and less barriers to successful acquisition on many, many fronts. nowhere can this be argued moreso, however, than in high-security space.on behalf of eve players and independent of partisan bias, i wish to invite the csm and ultimately ccp to run the thought experiments using the model above. i believe that given the chance, anyone will find this equation's predictive value to be highly accurate. beyond that, i think these principles should serve as a guide for future development. the devaluation of entire professions is a serious matter and should be taken as such by every player in eve if we want to keep this game's economy (both virtual and real) healthy for the long haul.should ccp inquire as to methods of modulating supply and demand, i believe risk to be one of the best methods imaginable. hopefully the csm does, too.thank you for your consideration.he who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller. -darth gustav's axiom"

10/12/2012,elaborate.
10/12/2012,"when there is risk impeding the collection of resources, supply uptake is naturally inhibited. this ensures higher prices, meaning higher value. it also ensures that successful miners are more highly valued by association. because the ore they mine and the ice they harvest is more valuable, so is their profession as a whole. its contribution grows due to the dynamics risk invokes on supply and demand. when risk is high, supply goes down and demand goes up. that's good for business, unless you fail. obviously if you fail, though, you're contibuting to the health of the economy by helping to keep prices high until you manage to succeed.or so the equation says.i've +1'd both of your comments. thanks for the feedback and the questions.he who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller. -darth gustav's axiom"
10/12/2012,"value does roughly equal demand / supply... but its modified by inflation... as in some of these other threads, one of the major reasons for the changes in ore prices over the last several years is because the value of an isk is diminishing, and not necessarily because of changes in supply and demand."

10/14/2012,this can be done by introducing additional risk into the profession of mining.risk adds value because it requires skill to overcome.risk is a healthy barrier to acquisition.he who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller. -darth gustav's axiom
10/14/2012,"what sort of risk are you referring to? pve missions, for example, are more interactive and i believe that what makes them more enjoyable to do as compared to mining where you just sit there mining. the inherent risk in mining is really dependent on the conditions in the local area. wormhole mining is the most dangerous followed by low-sec and finally null and high sec. i can tell you that the fear of being attacked does not add to the ""fun"" factor of mining in any way whatsoever. i would say that it actually make mining less fun and less desirable of an activity due to the fact that other activities such as mission running or exploration are more safe since you are not a sitting target.the point of the thread was not to talk about the risk vs. reward of mining but to simply say that i think that the fundamentals of mining have been unchanged since eve first came out. the mining barge was the only recent addition. i believe that mining could be made more enjoyable by perhaps adding a second method of collecting ore from the asteroids which requires more interaction. i didn't want to throw ideas out there but just to give an example perhaps mining could also be performed by flying a new type of ship that applies a charge to the asteroid and the asteroid is remotely detonated. the resulting fragments would then need to be run through a ship equipped with a sort of grinding apparatus and tractor beams which would pull in the chunks of ore. the speed at which this is done would depend on the skills of the pilot. to make it even more challenging, perhaps even some pieces would need to be avoided as they would cause damage to the grinding apparatus if they were to be processed. this method of mining would be much more involved because the pilot would be focused on destroying and then processing the resulting debris.this is just an example but i want to know what anyone else out there thinks. i think that keeping the passive method of mining may be alright but i am hoping to see an alternative method which will speed up the process with the necessity of having the pilot interact more during the process. i don't want to see mining become something as nebulous as the overall manufacturing process but something that is more enjoyable for those wishing to take more control of the operation."
10/14/2012,"here is an idea (without raising anybody's hopes that anything like this will ever be implemented):get rid of the static ore yield. make the yield of each individual asteroid change over time. the change should be random, but a smooth transition - so a high yield asteroid will stay that way for several minutes and then the yield will smoothly fall off, it won't just suddenly drop. the asteroid's yield is then multiplied by your ship's yield to determine how much ore you get.next, change the survey scanner to a single target module. the scanner will tell you the yield of the targeted asteroid, and if you keep running it, it will draw a graph of yield over time. you can then observe the pattern and see if it's rising or dropping.this means that in order to get the most ore for your time, you have to keep an eye on several asteroids, and switch your mining target as the yield of your asteroid decreases. this would have several results:* afk mining is still possible, but your yield will be much lower than that of somebody who is actively watching the game.* mining in groups is even more beneficial, as more people can keep an eye on more asteroids at the same time, and all switch target when one asteroid increases its yield. this requires at least a basic form of communication (broadcasting the highest yield rocks), thus is at least a degree less ""boring"" than the current system.* a new fitting consideration is introduced: do you fit more scanners and devote more time and attention to scanning and getting the best pick of the belt, or do you fit for more raw yield on your miners and survivability?* as an unintended consequence, 0.0 mining can be easily fixed: just make the average yield of asteroids in lower security areas much higher. so a veldspar rock in a -0.9 will, on average, produce more veldspar than one in +0.7. however, a dedicated miner watching their rocks should still be able to pull decent amounts of ore from a highsec rock compared to an afk miner in nullsec."
10/14/2012,"buff to barges have absolutely nothing to do with any of this at all... the market change i speak of has happened slowly over two years and not over night or post patch. also, the hulk saw no increase in yield so no increase in it's ability to pull rocks out of a belt or gravimetric site. so, you can scratch that idea off the board.value = demand / supplyi agree that the free market should be allowed to do what it is supposed to do, but not to a point it breaks game-play or the overall balance to the game itself. ccp's interest in balancing risk verse reward and the pure in-ability to do t1 production in 0.0 are problems that needs to be solved.my proposal- reduces the quantity of high end minerals available- increased difficulty to access those minerals- gives us a way to make use of it where it is mined so less gets shipped to empire- increases the risk of isk mining.the locusts effect is not a industry thing. some mmo players will go to where they can earn the highest income for least time spent, and will follow that until it crosses a risk vers reward threshold that has too much risk for what they are comfortable. pilots out in null are willing to take that risk but the reward has fallen to a point where it is left to question the isk for time spent aspect. the only reason for this issue is the design of the complexes created in dominion.another thing ccp and players not interested in mining\industry normally overlook...not every hulk pilot is only interested in earning isk. out of the 0.0 corps i have been in through the years, most pilots would enjoy the chance to build, supply a market, to support the corp and alliance they are in and not just be isk farmers that need to buy ships and fits from jita."

10/15/2012,"if that were the case, darth's complaint wouldn't be made, because prices would look sky-high (due to inflation), not responding to normal market pressures as they are.isk faucets have always outnumbered the sinks, and i hate to tell you that 100 isk was never that much - i started in 2007 and easily made my first million inside of 8 hours despite (and actually aided by) doing the tutorials of the time. even then, a million didn't amount to much; inflation hasn't meant much to ship and module prices, to be honest. they go up as they become flavor of the month, then go down on the next nerf only to rise again when some new change is made. the economy fluxes all the time, but actual inflation is pretty slight for the most part. (bolded that last part to avoid a future conversational trap - there are areas that have hit inflation, but not many and not major.)as to the op...darth, once again, risk is not the only way to lower supply, and increasing demand would work just as well. crimewatch 2 might help with that (or might not, hard to say), and if ccp could help break up the power blocks out in null demand might rise as well. even on the supply side, making mining more interactive and thus thinning the herd of bots and afk miners would do more (in my opinion) than any little bit of extra risk. especially not by the methods of adding risk most people usually think of. i would also add that new players are more than capable of coming up through mining; the so-called market glut (which i personally have seen no sign of at all except in a fairly minor drop in ice prices) still leaves plenty of profit for the new miner, even if they don't venture beyond veld. seriously - there have been times in the past (like when i tried to start mining) when trit prices dropped under 3 isk, and new miners were doing fine then...and that was long before the ""suicide ganking nerfs"" hit. i guess the only possible reason many of us can see for people wanting to add ""risk"" to mining is that it is no longer easy to suicide gank miners (and at that i saw at least three mackinaws ganked in one single ice belt in the last two days)."
10/15/2012,"you wield that equation of yours like a bludgeon, but i think your grip on it is faulty. you are simultaneously arguing that inflation is running wild while arguing that the value of minerals is dropping so far that new miners can't make a living at mining. the markets don't support you."
10/15/2012,"tell that to the poor ice miners.[edit]i gave this some more thought in context of what the markets are doing.if isk faucets exist, they are by their nature an inflationary mechanism. i concede this, as it is actually fundamental to my point.further, we can acknowledge, i believe, that material faucets are deflationary mechanisms. it seems self-evident, anyway.so if the value of isk is going down, requiring more to purchase anything of value but the price of materials (specifically high-sec ice) stays constant, it's actually lost value. if the price goes down, it's lost a ton of value.looking at the market, i fail to see how the data don't clearly elucidate that point.[/edit]he who trolls trolls best when he who is trolled trolls the troller. -darth gustav's axiom"
10/15/2012,"however...in order for your argument to be valid, there must be abundant evidence of out-of-control inflation. or even significant inflation. however, there is no such evidence; the price of t1 ships has barely budged since i started playing, and even the price of t2 has gone up by much less than 100% in five years. there is nothing to support a significant devaluation of isk, or a market glut of minerals."

10/16/2012,"there is a net gain of 25 trillion isk into the economy every month..... there is also a major influx of raw materials (from moon mining, belt mining, npc markets, and mission loot). there is also a major outflux of raw materials (destroyed ships primarily). if there is a net influx of isk into the economy while the raw materials balance out (i.e. influx = outflux), then the value of isk decreases, and the isk-value of raw materials increases.... since nearly all goods are constructed from raw materials, they then have an isk-value change even if supply and demand remain the same. in other words, the eve economy is far more complex than you make it sound..."
10/16/2012,"mineral faucets are not isk faucets, and mineral sinks are not isk sinks. when a miner sells his haul in a market, no new isk is created. it just changes hands.if you're concerned about inflation of isk, look to explicit isk faucets. the only isk faucet from mining is the trickle of bounties paid from killing belt rats.if miners reduce yield on their barges (or just lose more ships to ganking--it works out the same in the end), the price of minerals go up, but that doesn't necessarily gain the miners anything. it certainly won't make your dominix cheaper. one number got bigger and the other smaller; the product of the two numbers will only shift for the amount of time it takes the market to correct the imbalance. the people who benefit are speculators sitting on mountains of minerals, who buy cheap, announce an interdiction, and then sell dear. but that doesn't affect the value of isk either, except to the degree that it pulls isk out of active circulation and concentrates it in the hands of the speculators."

10/17/2012,"no, negative wallets can not be ever implemented as a result of player to player transactions. a negative wallet means that isk is popping out of thin air. a debt only matters when it has consequences. in eve, where you can simply biomass a character, debt is meaningless.1) place a buy order with your alt for 1b (250m put in escrow, 750m remains).2) transfer 750m from alt to main.3) fill the order with your main. main gets the 250m from escrow and 750m from the game. alt ends up 750m in the negative.4) biomass alt.5) you just summoned 750m isk into the game.there is a way to get rid of mt scams while maintaining the intended functionality: if there is not enough money combined in escrow and in the buyer's wallet to pay for the minimum accepted quantity of items in an order, that order is temporarily hidden from the marketplace. it will not be visible in the market window, and the broker will not attempt to fulfill it. only when the buyer acquires enough money to cover at least the minimum amount, the order is restored."

10/20/2012,"first off i'm laughing with no humor here. if your saying we need to add risk to mining it shows you've never been into mining. our whole existence is a risk, you can't run, you cant hide, you can only fight rats. add the hulkedon and its massive group of pimply faced retards looking for yet another reason for an easy gank and the picture gets more dismal. miners are the few in the game that each year have to ask themselves - ""do i want to stop literally playing my game for one whole week of payed time? or do i want to chance losing a hundreds of millions in a split second."" the only value risk adds to a miner is the value of stomach ulcers. ok so i've kicked that useless horse enough. moving on..asteroid depleted = automatic shut down of strip minermy biggest gripe. so follow me here for a second. when an asteroid is depleted it vanishes. so can you tell me how my strip miner spent the last 3 minutes strip mining a ghost? at what point did tangible matter turn into a mirage because thats all your mining. using a survey scanner barely helps even when your sitting there button mashing the thing for hopeful updates. i wish wish wish eve would add logic to this. when an asteroid is depleted your strip miner should auto shut off, not keep cycling for 4 more minutes. or at least add a survey scanner for the micro manager that will allow you to constantly monitor the ore depleting! as result of eve not doing anything about it there are these two options.1. survey scan till asteroid is mostly gone then button mash your strip miners off and on so you don't waste time. if every 10 min you spend 3 min uselessly mining - do the math, that is a lot of wasted time. button mashing your strip miners isby far not the way to go either.2. avoid all this and scan till an asteroid is 80% empty and move on. until the next miner comes along and finds an entire asteroid belt thats useless!! because every asteroid has about 1,000 units left in it. and this has happened more than i want to talk about. i would cuss and swear here accept that won't cut the frustration. please eve!? miners are the very core of eve, without us eve won't be able to field 90% of their ships for anything. mining is already patience demanding beyond measure. add a couple lines of code for a simple auto shutoff is all i ask. survey scanners are next to useless. now last but not least - a thank you to eve. i was partially bummed but at the same time pleased at the new changes to the strip miners. yes some of our options were cut but we were presented with a good deal more. null sec is now open to mine by the heavy risk takers. prices have dropped on some ores and those complaining are vastly the mega corps that are angry at having to share with the little guy. the new extended ore hold on the mackinaw is fantastic. now for those that can't get a whole group of transports to back them up we can happily mine without having to jettison cargo and have it stolen and then get blown up by some half equipped bs that's passing by. (that was partially a jab at the guy that suggested more risk taking for we miners)"
10/20/2012,"bah...no need to change any of the eve mechanics to make mining more interesting.just try to mine in low-sec.....it is **thrilling** and heart pounding. and, the logistics aspect to get materials back to high sec has its own rewards, especially with pos management.so, honestly.....what ccp needs to do to make mining a good profession:- mining yield outside of highsec has to rise....yes, profit right now is mostly based on how much time is spent mining and lowsec/nullsec can't compete with a 100% safe environment, unless the yield of highsec is reduced and yield of low/null is increased. low sec miners are lucky to get 20% of the mining time that they would have received in highsec..so assuming roids are equal and they almost are these days, they need a 500% yield increase to be equiv to high sec profit.- allow mining corps to somehow build up defenses in lowsec belts...yes, they have a pos in the system perhaps but it provides no assistance outside....and a pirate can hunt through belts and find any miners in them in under a minute, sometimes just seconds. this environment greatly favors the pvp focused pilot rather than miners. it has almost completely driven out the entire mining professional from lowsec. so, perhaps have some way for miners to invest in defenses for individual belts..a new skill that controls efficiency and a miner is limited to 1 improved belt per char which must be associated with a pos. the defenses should cost isk and be more of a way to give the miner more time to get himself to safety than any real protection. i'm thinking of an additional pos module that redirects some of the pos shield out towards the nearest belt...not sure of the mechanics yet, but it sure would liven things up and get miners into lowsec and in that environment - no one would be calling the profession afk, boring, or dull."
10/20/2012,"the skill makes the module use more cap, forgot to add a cap bonus to the duration bonus?"
10/20/2012,better solution: split isk in accordance w/ damage done. this way shiny fleets will stop being parasites during contests.
10/20/2012,join public incursion communities. problem solved.
10/20/2012,"are you suggesting i watch the three minute timer for my ore repeat till my cargo is full?also have you ever mined in high sec?you have to change targets all the time cause the roids are so small, gotta check on it every 3-9 minutes. not an afk job."
10/20/2012,i have an alt that does nothing but mine in hs as its one of the easiest ways to earn isk afk :)
10/20/2012,"then you're a poor tool.~3000 mining yield = ~600,000 isk a minute with hs oreso 10 minutes is 6,000,000 isk1 hour is 36,000,000 iskmining yield is based on max skilled orca pilot support with a hulk mining, so really you need two people afking to achieve this yield. then you have to add the fact that you're constantly switching asteroids, switching belts cause they're so empty... yeah."

10/22/2012,"it's the topic that never ends, it goes on and on my friends, some people, started whining not knowing what it was, and they'll continue whining forever just because...."
10/22/2012,"1. not true. there is the psychological warfare side of things in this one also.2. not true. even how much you want to find them and do what you can you might not still get them.3. true but industrialists are usualy easy to kill so they can also use force4. true but it will not resolve the issue of the afk cloaker being somewhere afk5. see point 26. and? it is your choice will or will you not fit your ship with cloaks. if you do not like the disadvantaged over the advantages then do not fir a cloak.i'll drop the dence things so this wont go into a fight over whos more dencer but i ment with they crying part that most posts are ""crycrycry no solution crycrycry"" and i did not mean you in specific. though it would be nice that you would give also an solution to this and so if you would have to make an solution to this what would it be? how would you remove afk cloaking.my solution is still that claoks should use fuel (heavy water, it's cheap and easy to get, mayby add something that allowes you to extract heavy water from ice so you don't need to go to a station to get it) and special cloak ships could have the fuel bays.1. you could still afk cloak for some time if needed2. game would be more tactical as you need to think more what you do with your cloaked ships3. you can still do psychological warfare if you want.4. cloaks would realy not change there would be just something new in them, something new that you need to keep in your mind and now just fly mindlessly all over the place.oh and ccp is removing pos shields or they are planing to do so, so no need to propose that. ;)"
10/22/2012,"1. this is eve, metagaming is a big part of it. crying to get rid of a kind of metagaming is dumb.2. if they're not afk then they are doing something. from just traveling to hunting, they're doing something. that gives you opportunities to catch and kill them. it may be difficult, and you may fail. that doesn't make his point not true, though.3. if industrialists make themselves easy targets by minmaxing and going it solo, thats their own problem.4. it doesn't ""resolve the issue""? what god damn issue? a player is afk alone in a system (as you moved next door to do things)... how is that an issue? why does ccp need to do something about that? doesn't resolve the issue of the player being afk... what a mindboggingly stupid statement.5. see point 2.6. another mindboggingly stupid statement. cloaking is a necessary mechanic in numerous situations - it's been balanced so it can be used in these situations without being overpowered - saying people should outright not use it at all is just unrealistic and stupid.ps if you insist on insulting people, at least learn to spell ""dense"" correctly.there is no problem that requires a solution. additionally, your proposed solution does nothing but interfere with active players and activities. it hinders long term reconnaissance missions, and utterly destroys wormhole space. arguably it'd contribute to the stagnation of nullsec, as intel gathering activities are a big deal and imposing idiotic limitations on them in order to curb an entirely different thing is just terrible. not to mention the fact that the thing it is trying to ""fix"" isn't something that needs fixing in the first place. someone being afk is not some unbalanced, game-breaking issue that ccp needs to look into, i can't comprehend how stupid one must be in order to consider it as such."
10/22/2012,"i understand the sentiment that somebody who is afk should not be able to have a direct effect / influence within game.yes somebody who was afk has never killed anybody, the issue is that you never know if that person is afk or not.i do not agree cloaks need fuel or a timer as this has for too much potential to hurt other area's of the game.i would much prefer to introduce a new class of ship, say a destroyer and new types of probes to help scan down cloaked ships.the way it would work would be that the scan time would be a lot longer then normal probes and only the new ship type can equip the probes. if the person is not afk and is moving around there is no problem as it would be impossible to scan them due to the scan time.however if the person goes afk they run the risk of being detected.i do not see anything wrong with this."
10/22/2012,like i said that if you do not have any solutions for this then do not post. you realy need to be realy dense to not understand that. ^^i'm saying it's broken and i want to hear solutions for it not crying that it's not broken. if the fuel idea is bad then present a better one.
10/22/2012,"that'd still utterly destroy wormhole space, as the presence of sigs (even if it took a long time to scan) would tell you if/how many cloaked ships are in your system.you seem to be arguing against not knowing whether someone is afk or not (rather than cloaked ships being ""invincible"" like some others make a point of), but i still disagree with the existence of any issue. you don't know if that player is active and you shouldn't know if they're active, imo. you shouldn't be able to just know that kind of thing. if a player wants to appear afk to lull someone into a false sense of security they should be able to. your destroyer idea would prevent that kind of metagaming, shrinking the sandbox purely for the benefit of cowardly null ratters/miners who want perfect safety in 0.0 of all places."
10/22/2012,"the reason i don't have any solutions is because there isn't a problem. regarding point 4 in the earlier post, you went on to explain that you can (and i assume do?) just move system to do your business, leaving the afk in an empty system - which you claimed was a problem. i explicitly asked how that's a problem, because it doesn't make a lick of sense. a single player, entirely by himself in a system, is not at his keyboard. how is that a problem? you're demanding solutions and trying to dismiss me because i didn't provide any, but you can't even say what the problem is. how can you expect solutions if you can't define the issue?ps ""really"". two l's."

10/24/2012,"hence why disruptor has x% chance based off y(range) the specifics would be up to ccp to sort out, however the range wouldn't touch the entire solar system, something like a 1-4 au bubble. the presence of this unique ship on the active cloakers dscan would alert him to the danger so he could himself move out of range.i'm not suggesting an iwin ship vs cloakers, i'm suggesting something with a chance to detect them.btw this t2 destroyer would also be gimped somewhat by the cloak disruptor fit (like the cov-ops/t3 ships are)greater.insight.skill.knowledge"
10/24/2012,"you have a very binary thought process. i am suggesting a ship that could engage in a hunt for a cloaked ship, not push a button and instantly reveal all cloakers in the system.i'm not a 'cowardly nullbear' i'm a player of this game and i think being able to perform a task in the game of eve without an appreciable chance of being countered by another player to be a broker mechanic.i assume you either profit from this mechanic personally, are unable to coherently think through the possibility of creating a ship that could actively search for an active cloaker (who could spot him on dscan and actively evade)it makes perfect sense that covert ops would have counter cover ops working against them. stop defending a broken bloody game mechanic.greater.insight.skill.knowledge"
10/24/2012,"i have a very binary thought process regarding this issue because it is a very binary issue. introducing a ship or probe or some other mechanic to detect cloaked ships utterly destroys wormhole space. even if you make it a convoluted or timeconsuming process, or even if you give it some %chance to not find anything on a given scan, it still wrecks wormhole mechanics. a deliberate design of wormhole mechanics was the inability to detect cloaked players at all. introducing a mechanic to detect them, regardless of what limits you put on it, undermines that.additionally, it doesn't solve any ""problem"" because there is no ""problem"". you're suggesting things that have nothing but negatives, all because your psyche is so frail and battered that a single other player (in a massively multiplayer game at that) who isn't even there causes you to freak out and stop what you're doing/quit.it's ridiculous. htfu or go back to hisec.edit: as for ""counters""... afk players do not need a counter. i do not see you suggesting things that would allow me to kill you when you're afk in your pos or outpost, so it's a bit hypocritical to be demanding mechanics to kill other afk players because the mere sight of them causes you to inconvenience yourself.on top of that, cloaks are already balanced. there are plenty of limitations put on ships capable of cloaking, so by themselves they're not much of a threat even if they're active."
10/24/2012,"first explain how introducing a new ship with a specialized module that has the ability to, with skill, have a chance to temporarily disable all cloaks will 'destroy' wh space. considering its a specialized ship, would its presence not alert the cov-op pilot to the potential danger? perhaps use a fuel cost or charges, perhaps a huge cool down or massive cap usage to 'fire' the disruptor so as to not make it spammable.afk in pos - can seige said pos, with a greater chance of success than moving within 2000m of the cloaker in system.afk in station - granted, you cannot pod individual, however an alliance can take over the station and remove his ability to redock with a greter chance of success than moving within 2000m of the cloaker in system.lol frail and battered psyche, that's cute. anyway as i previously stated i play this game and i seek to improve it. likewise i haven't demanded anything, only suggested something that in fact existed and continues to exist in reality, as allowing an enemies submarine free reign in your waters without any ability to hunt for it is very dangerous (see wwii, battle for the atlantic)perhaps the crux of this (obviously highly emotionally charged) discussion is the need to differentiate between types of cloak. one for the spy, and one for the ambusher?the spy could continue to gather information without risk, only his time and effort.the ambusher could be revealed by the disruptor, but has a ship-type that is more capable in combat than the spy.greater.insight.skill.knowledge"
10/24/2012,"has anyone taken a look at the character bazaar recently? pretty funky calculations to determine character worth going on over there. for example:the 4.6m sp miner worth 2 billion iskthe 2.6m sp pi pilots being sold for 2 billion isk eachthe three 2.7m sp mining pilots being sold for 1.5 billion each the 6.5m sp miner going for 3 billionwhat do these have in common? if you guessed massively inflated prices, you'd be right. prior to plex being introduced as a way of paying for character transfers, these characters would be worth anywhere from half to a quarter of what they are now. these are simply examples, if you look for yourself you will see that every single character is worth massively more than they should be. and just in case any of you think this is coincidental, that this is a natural player-driven market phenomena that will subside (just in case you forget this has been a trend since the introduction of plex for transfer), i give to you these quotes: ""what's wrong with someone incorporating the cost of transfer into the character price?"", you might ask. well, that's just it. it's a clear violation of the ccp character bazaar rules and resources where it says, and i quote: to summarise, and to finally get to the point of why ccp should remove the usage of plex's for character transfers, the use of plex for character transfers has had two negative consequences for the character market as a whole: first; it has created a culture in which, in clear violation of ccp's rules and regulations of the character bazaar, it is not only acceptable, it is necessary for the seller to place the cost of the character transfer upon the buyer if they wish to turn a profit and avoid paying cash for the transfer. secondly, it has massively distorted the worth of characters in the character market, leading to low sp characters being sold for their estimated worth + 1.2 billion isk, a gross distortion of the characters worth. thus, and in conclusion, ccp's introduction of using plex as an alternative method of payment for character transfer has created several negative and easily foreseeable consequences, which must be addressed."
10/24/2012,"i don't understand your point here.... the owner of the character is responsible to pay the character transfer fee, but why shouldn't the prices be inflated to transfer that cost to the seller... if you buy milk in the grocery store, everyone that touches the product between you and the cow that produced it adds a markup. there are real-life man hours associated with transferring a character, both in the form of development time, gm time, etc... so ccp charging to do this is extremely reasonable. additionally, allowing people to use plex for the transfer (rather than rl cash), makes selling characters available to a wider range of players. finally, if it costs me 15$ to transfer that character, rather than a plex, do you really think i'm going to value my rl cash at below the plex to cash conversion rate? tl;dr;1.) ccp has the right to add a markup to character transfers (be it in cash or plex), because it costs them money to perform that service. 2.) as long as i can buy plex with my cash, and isk with plex, there exists a cash to isk conversion rate.... so any cash payment has an isk equivalent value. 3.) third party markup costs are always transferred to the buyer from the seller... that's just standard business policy! you accept it anytime you buy something in game or out!"
10/24/2012,"i accept your premise that, in the real world at least, cost incurred by the seller are transferred to the buyer. however, this is not the real world, this is a highly artificial and tightly regulated economy overseen by the creators i.e. ccp. as such, there are rules which, if you do not follow, you will be punished for. in this instance, the rule is that the seller shoulders the cost of character transfer, not the buyer. to ad absurdum your analogy, this would be analogous to the buyer being forced to pay <U+FFFD>15 worth of their own money to pay the transfer fees. since we can assume that a plex, bought out of game for a set amount, can thus be ascribed a real world value, the principle of my statement is the same: is there a difference between being forced to pay <U+FFFD>15 to buy a character, and paing a plex worth <U+FFFD>25?on a side note, my first conclusion is objective. it has analysed the empirical evidence to arrive at a logical conclusion, and that process can be observed and duplicated by another individual. my second conclusion is thus subjective, as it is simply my opinion. felt the need to clarify that."
10/24/2012,"1.) the eve market works very similar to the real world market... and while it is centered around space pixels, it is a highly functional market economy based on supply and demand. in most ways, eve's economy is much less regulated than the real world market! while it is monitored by ccp, it is not tightly regulated... the price you pay for goods and services is almost completely determined by player created supply, player determined demand, and player market manipulations, not by npc buy/sell orders. sure, there are several sources and sinks of isk and commodities that ccp controls, but those are pretty much kept static so the market equalibriates around player activities. in short, ccp could regulate supply and demand, but rarely do! 2.) eve sellers are selling things for profit... to do that, they must transfer all costs incurred in creating and delivering that product to the seller! the character bazaar is no different! why do you think it should? this is not a communist society where people devote their efforts for the general good... they devote their efforts for profit.... 3.) this rule does not mean the owner of the character cannot or should not factor in the ""costs"" of transferring a character into the sell price of their character! why do you think it would or should? the point of the rule is to explicitly state whom is responsible for the character transfer fee that ccp demands for their delivery service."

10/25/2012,i added few more proposals:wis- poker rooms- espionage tactics- theft tacticsindustry- some additional mini games to the already existing production mechanics. where if u decide to do them if u are good u can min/max the production output.
10/25/2012,"because as i've already said, the inability to know if there are cloaked ships in wormhole space is a deliberate design. adding a ship that will, with a few clicks, tell you if/how many cloaked ships are in the wormhole defeats the god damn point. you may not be too familiar with wormhole mechanics or the typical styles of gameplay, but take it from people who've spent years doing it: introducing a ship or mechanic that'll not only tell you cloaked ships are there but let you find them is horrific, and destroys what makes wormhole space unique and interesting. you claim it's presence would alert the cov-ops pilot... but what relevance does that have? great, they know that the enemy knows they are present (despite wormhole space being specifically designed to prevent that)... now what? the jig is up, already. good job ruining an entire area of space with your peabrained idea.as for sieging a pos or taking over an outpost... they both take a lot of effort and provide the person sitting in them ample time and opportunity to get out safely, additionally sieging a pos or taking over an outpost doesn't undermine core mechanics of 0.0 space.you want to improve the game, and i appreciate the good intentions, but take it from someone who actually knows: your suggestion would make the game worse in many ways."
10/25/2012,"mmm clever use of the word 'peabrained' i like what you did there. and although such infallible logic has rocked me back to my heels, i will nevertheless attempt a rebuttalthe premise of your entire argument is thus : it will ruin wspace, as this area of the game is designed around the concept of stealth and cloaking. fine, so wspace eminations alter/eliminate using a disruptor, which is btw mounted on your ship, not a probe you launch. now wspace is maintained as it is and working as intended. you can breathe a sigh of relieif.i would ask you now then why a) cloaks should show up in local. why the creation of a second type of cloak, specifically fit for combat cov ops ships (versus purely information gathering ones) wouldn't eleviate that problem. and how these two changes wouldn't in fact go hand in hand with a disruptor module, mounted on a specialized hull that could detect/disrupt the ambusher cloak (for combat ships)yes seiging a pos or a station are hard. finding a cloaking and flying within 2000m of him in a solar system are a c%$t hair short of impossible. if i was so inclined, i could create 1000 subscriptions, train them to fly a covops and flood nullsec with afk cloakers.imagine the tears.is this a mechanic your willing to defend without comprimise?greater.insight.skill.knowledge"
10/25/2012,"the problem with the disruptor ship is that it does something than no other ship (or ship based module) in eve can do: apply an effect across a whole system.this is a bit op (about as much as the old aoe dd imo) and if you limit it in any way so that it is not op, you make it only useful against active cloakers and hence does nothing to ""counter"" afk cloakers.edit2: read back a bit more carefully, and this was not entirely what was suggested. i apologize for derping and you may return to your semi-debate.edit: and anyone who gives tears over 1 potentially afk guy is a fool. there are plenty of options to deal with invaders, and there are many systems that do not have afk cloakers (or anyone for that matter)."
10/25/2012,"i see your point and raise you 1 off grid boosting ship.ps never stated cloak disruptor had to have a system wide range, probably in the aus though.again, allow me suggest another type of cloak (ambusher) that can be fitted by combat ships that can be countered with disruptor. cov-ops (intelligence gathering) ships can retain the old (spy) type cloak and remain utterly undetectable.greater.insight.skill.knowledge"
10/25/2012,nooooooooooooo!!!!!!
10/25/2012,"and i'm of the mindset that i'll only pay so much for a character, or will only sell for a certain amount. these posts that say ""keep in mind i'm using plex to pay for the transfer"" means nothing to me. here's my price, take it or leave it. i don't care how you pay for the transfer fee. if you're over priced; you're over priced. i will not buy a toon that i do not feel is worth the isk.and since we're on the topic of value, i've always had a hard time wrapping my head around how people try to standardize value. that toon (or car, or house, or whatever) may be worth x to you, but to me, it's worth y. who are you to tell me what something's worth? i'm no economics expert, but to me, value is 100% subjective."
10/25/2012,"actually; yes, yes it does. whilst i can agree that everyone who sells something is looking to make a profit, or at least minimise their loss, the point i was trying to make with the artificial market was not that the eve market was tightly controlled, but that the character bazaar and only the character bazaar was. ccp may not have an active interest in controlling the prices (save in one or two instances), but i'm sure they have an interest in making sure the rules of the market are followed. now, again to my point, which you seem to be missing: if the rules of the market prohibit the seller from placing the costs of transfer on the shoulders of the buyer, then by adding the price of 2 plex to the sell price that is literally what they are doing. and thus in doing so they are breaking the rules of the artificial market . now, to reiterate a previous point, and expand upon it slightly, why should i pay an extra <U+FFFD>25 (since that is what i am doing, as we have established that plex's have real world value) to allow the seller to break the rules? if somebody wants to make a profit on a character, that is fine. i used to buy and sell characters all the time, before the introduction of plex for transfer, and what kept the price relatively stable was the absolute knowledge that you were wholly and simply paying for the character. now, you're paying for the character and the transfer fee, and that is simply unacceptable."
10/25/2012,"this. same rule i use when i go to estate sales and auctions. know what you're willing to pay for something and stick to it.yes and no. you can objectively measure the value of a given object by determining what people are willing to give up (in terms of real costs or opportunity costs) to obtain that object. subjectively, you may be willing to give up less or more than someone else for the same object, but it's average of those values that determine the market value of that object. (and all of that assumes i remember my freshman economics classes)."
10/25/2012,"sara brandie wrote:if the rules of the market prohibit the seller from placing the costs of transfer on the shoulders of the buyer, then by adding the price of 2 plex to the sell price that is literally what they are doing.to quote the rule (again): no where in the rule does ccp specify that price of a character sale may not be determined with consideration of the costs of the transfer. all the rule states is that the actual character transfer fee at the time of the transaction on the account support page must be paid to ccp by the transferor, not the transferee or some third party. there is currently no way for the transferee to pay for the transfer via the account support page, nor has there even been. interpreted as such, this is a hang-over rule from the days when the transferring of characters was paid for via cash only. people in the character bazaar were dealing in monetary transactions, and per other areas of eula, we are not allowed to put down any forms of real-world currency for items and/or characters in the game. thus, if you paid for the character transfer fee externally from the system, you were technically violating the eula (even if you were paying for the actual character with isk). if you enter into an agreement with the seller of character for the value of the character plus two plex that you purchase separately with your own money and transfer ingame, i doubt ccp would object to the transfer. alternatively, you could just pay the price of the character which then includes the tranferor's purchase of plex or his financial investment. the actual calculation of plex price into a character transfer is a matter of the market determined by active traders and investers in character transfers. if they have all mutually assented to calculating their prices based on them paying for their character transfers now in terms of plex instead of real-world currency, that is a matter of efficient capitalism and does not violate the rule.to be clear, you're also mistaking the definition of value with the definition of price."

10/26/2012,fixing the dec shield/war dec exploits should be a priority i believe.
10/26/2012,agree that this would not only be informative and useful but is required and long overdue!+1
10/26/2012,"note: i did edit after i realized i misunderstood. also i forgot about offgrid boosting... which i have been against for quite a while.your two cloak idea would not have any effect whatsoever on afk cloaking (because an afk cloaker of the kind people worry most about is not a combat ship, rather a covert ops with cyno).there is simply no idea (that modifies cloaking mechanics or cloaks) that would do anything to afk cloakers without making active cloak activities much more difficult or tedious than they already are. yet. i've been thinking for a long while on this. if anyone comes up with one, i might even buy them a plex. maybe. not committing to that though."
10/26/2012,"yes, i am. i'll get to why in a moment.first, i am glad you appreciate how destructive such a ship (or other similar suggestions) would be to wormhole mechanics, and of course disallowing the use of such a ship (or similar mechanic) in wormhole space would of course preserve the glorious, superior mechanics of wormhole space. it'd feel a bit clunky to say ""ah! but ... strange system effect! just so happens you can't use that ship now!"", but it'd at least preserve the sanctity of wormholes.however, i still entirely disagree with such a ship because there are, again, legitimate activities and playstyles in nullsec space which would be massively hindered. i'm sure i've mentioned this before, but long term reconnaissance missions, whether it's observing an enemy fleet, or waiting in a strategic location to provide jump/warp in points, etc rely on the ability to sit cloaked in one location for extended periods of time. i feel that being able to locate these brave agents is detrimental to the game, as it helps entrench residents/defenders by making even simple acts of observing them or getting in position much more difficult. there are further arguments in favour of cloaking, such as countering the stupid, instant and infallible local tool by introducing doubt - are you there, or are you afk? some kind of mechanic to detect stationary cloaked ships would remove this doubt, providing people with even more security and intel than they already have, and remove the one tiny thing players can do to help counter the overpowered local tool. no to that, i say.and above all else, i don't understand why you feel you should have the right to find and kill afk players in your system anyway. you already have every advantage, yet you are so mad that they simply have the ability to sit in your system doing nothing? pah.as for you creating an army of afk alts, yes, i fully support that. i will defend that without question or compromise. as they're all afk and incapable of doing anything, there is no problem. it may scare some local bears to see ""twonk1, twonk2, twonk3..."" etc in local, and they may think theres a big fleet out to get them but the ability to employ such forms psychological warfare and meta-gaming are what elevate eve online above the wow-level dreck that mmo game space is dominated by."
10/26/2012,"ok so then i need 10,000 subscriptions and to afk cloak 1 system at a time (preferably an enemy staging system or other strategically important location) perhaps cashing the node. get the point? no counter = potential for abuse. eve needs to move towards a full pvp/sandbox style and away from this sandbox with the grade 3 teacher watching version of it. which means every action must have a way to stop it/negate it/deal with it etc... by the player baseyou have highlighted several concerns with being able to reveal or detect a cloaked ship which show me that 1)there is a serious problem with the existing system and 2) the solution rests with the creation of new mechanics, adjustment of old ones.a) revamp of the dscanner (a very cool idea, needs to updated badly)"
10/26/2012,"remove afk | cloakingthere are 2 distinct parts here:1) afk - mining - ratting - hauling - market trading2) cloaking - intel spy - cyno drop - 'safe' travel - bombing - terrorizing - bounty huntingplease pick one and make arguments on it separately, then check to make sure your suggestion does not negatively impact any of the other listed areas. if it does, go back to the drawing board and start over. after finding your best answer please post it along with all your back research for peer review.that is all."
10/26/2012,"but it is balanced. the difference is local's intel is guaranteed, whereas the psychological effects from afking are not.plus, why shouldn't there be psychological warfare in this game? i think it's a great addition.let's face it, when they decloak, they are just as killable as you. this really is a none issue and you can take precautions. sure you may still diaf, but as i said, the only guarantee here is the easy mode local intel.want changes to cloaks? then let's deal with the reason for afking first please.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

10/27/2012,"i've mentioned the biggest issue with that idea. it does nothing to solve afk cloaking, just adds unnecessary complexity.an afk cloaker would just make sure to use the same setup as the active spy, and thus will still be ""invincible"".all the idea would do is make devs work more and make cloaky hunters have a little more risk in an already highly risky, low reward profession (either that or i just suck with bombers ).there simply is no way (still considering betting a plex on this) to hinder afk cloakers without making things more difficult for active cloak activities, some of which are already difficult and risky for very little reward (note: while modifying cloaking itself).there may be a way to remove the silly terror that is afk cloaking, but the answer lies with the other mechanics responsible, not cloaking (cynos, local, etc). or just growing up and learning the many ways to deal with potential intruders already used by wh corps and a few sov holders.edit: devon thank you for at least being reasonable with your debate style. i really like the lack of personal attacks and whining. rare thing, but makes these discussions actually enjoyable."
10/27/2012,"my perspective that psychological warfare is a great addition, could indeed be argued either way.as far as the different cloaks idea is concerned, i refer once more to my post. let's sort out the reason for afking first, then let's look at cloaks. even with this diversifying cloaks idea, you end up gaining more intel power on top of the already powerful local intel tool. that surely cannot be seen, as a balanced approach.that being said, i actually like the status quo and don't wish for any changes. but if you want cloaks to change, then local should be changed to stop it's easy mode intel system. the fact that you can afk without a cloak and gain the same psychological effects, means your focus should be on local. if indeed afking is your target.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."

10/28/2012,"anything that hurts the character bazaar is a good thing; it's a necessary evil imho.cost of transfer is what, $20? that already puts cash in favor of isk (esp. with rising plex prices). if this was not the case, i would suggest it as a compromise.people make serious isk off of characters. you may have to shell out more isk to get the plex, but you will just have to find a way to make it back on the character sale. that's called business... and inflation."

10/29/2012,"i would love this. i can see arguments for not making a jump capable one. i think it could be argued that rapid deployment for war (i.e. jumping ships) is a job for carriers. yes i know jump frieghters can and are used to get behind enemy lines. still, i think that saying that moving fleets of fitted ships is and should remain part of what carriers are for. however, you wouldn't use a carrier to move ships through non-hostile space during peace times. you would use a ""dry dock"" cargo vessel. it is big, relatively helpless, slower than a carrier, but capable of moving more at a time. that is the sort of job i see for a ship like this. i vote making it a ""tier 2"" freighter rather than a ""tech 2"" freighter since it is more of a re-purpose than a complete redesign. oh, and +1 either way."

10/29/2012,"our alliance has been forced into a war with dec shield. we got into this mess after war decing a bot mining corporation. after bumping their ships, after mining over top of them for months, they still bot. we thought about ganking them, but didnt want to hurt our security status. a war dec seemed like the logical choice. now the war will end for them, they will go back to botting and we are stuck in a war we don't want to be in. i have read the proposed changes and i think they make sense. we should not be forced into a never ending war like this. while i have been typing, a corporation just left dec shield and we are now at war with someone we never declared war on(octopus). these mechanics need to change. i'm afraid that even if ccp bans these bot miners, our war (which should be over at that point) will continue and cause our young member to leave us and move on.the more pressure we can put on this issue, the better chance we have of getting something changed.please support dec shields drive to make a change.bigbelly"

10/29/2012,"if dust succeeds, it might be wise to attempt to apply a similar business model to eve and attempt to ween the game off of subscriptions slowly and attempt to move to a free to play model. this would be a major change for the game would take a lot of work and certainly wouldn't happen over night.so how would aurum modules and hulls work with out turning into pay to win?aurum modules would be identical to tech ii modules in every way, however: they would have much less intensive skill requirements. this would allow people to purchase and use tech ii modules if they hadn't normally acquired the skill for it. it also gives those who attain normal tech ii modules the normal way a slight advantage, as depending on the modules, they would use less capacitor, have greater range, or would hit harder because of the supporting skill. in the end regardless of skills an aurum module would never be able to attain greater performance then a tech ii modules only equivalent.aurum hulls would be identical to tech ii ship hulls but would require much less skills to fly them, allowing people to pay to get into a hull with out some of the supporting skills, but would give people who trained to use the actual tech ii hull advantages from its supporting skills. you would have to do some tinkering with actual ship command skill bonus where, for example, a person who had heavy assault cruisers skills trained wouldn't be able to squeeze more performance out of an aurum hull then a normal hac, for instance:aurum version of sacrilege: amar cruiser skill effects both amar cruiser skill and heavy cruiser skill bonus. once again an aurum hull would never be able to out perform a tech ii hull it would only attain equivalent performance.the other difference would be the hulls and the modules if they had a model in game like guns, would also have different artwork, to allow people to get these ships or modules simply for variety or customization sake, or even for bling factor. like all other aurum products they could also be sold on the market.with the changing of how people train for ships, and how skills like recons, heavy assault skills, etc become racial, another advantage of this is it will also give players the opportunity to quickly get access to another races tech ii hull if there willing to pay extra in isk or in aurum for it.i think the best way to do the acquisition of these hulls/modules is the aurum purchases a blue print copy with a certain number of runs and that it would take basic minerals from the market to produce these vessels/modules. people get the most bang for there buck then. these aurum bpc would have fixed mineral build values and would be unaffected by manufacturing skills, every one builds them at the same rate for the same mineral cost. you dont just purchase one hull or one module with your money you would get a set. this mineral cost may sound like a **** idea considering that people just spent cash on this product but if a good value was arrived at i think it would be a reasonable cost in addition to the creation of the aurum hull/module.by making these ships and modules equal to and not greater then tech ii modules and hulls i think it avoids the ""gold ammo, gold hull"" problems of fearless fame.if this is still idiotic and game breaking please say so. and more importantly please explain why."
10/29/2012,"won't ever happen. can you imagine what eve would be like if everybody had unlimited alts?god...what a nightmare.now if they found a way to simply prevent you from running more than one client at a time on any given pc...great...all for it...but i seriously doubt many others would agree with me simply because they rely on said alts, as did i at one time.ccp on the other hand would probably lose revenue with such a model."
10/29/2012,"two things:- as pointed out above... making eve free to play will usher in a golden age of alts. watch single players control mining fleets of 10 hulks and 2 orcas... or create fleets of drakes that are all fit the same exact way, shoot at the exact same time, all at the same target.best part is that this is already legal... the only limitation is how much money you are willing to spend on how many accounts.- why would people spend real money on ships and weapons that are ""no better"" than t2 stuff when they can simply wait for the passive skill que to do its thing? i certainly wouldn't. especially if i'm not paying anything to keep an account open in the first place.maybe some more impatient people will get these ""gold"" ships and mods... but i doubt they are enough impatient people that will get ccp ~5 million usd a month ($15 usd * ~350,000 subscriptions)... and i doubt they will hang around for long either when they find out that their ""pimp"" ship (that they paid real money for) can be easily killed by 15 people in random t1 crap."
10/29/2012,"no, this topic there is only ""remove afk cloaking"". there is just one part here. if we go for all afk activities we can close the game right now cause you can list manufacturing, reserch, invention, p.i. and almost all other industry based activities to your part 1 and without those there will be no eve cause you would not have ships to blow up."
10/29/2012,"the problem is...if you are attacking this particular ""problem"" because you have an issue with people being ""afk"" then it is only fair to be consistent and work on getting rid of all mechanics that allow for afking. after all... it isn't fair that people can ""gain an advantage when they are not on the computer.""if you are attacking this on the basis that cloaking itself isn't directly counterable... well... look at the ships themselves. they are actually quite gimped with regards to direct combat and won't stand up in a ""fair fight.""if you are against afk cloaking because you fear cyno drops... that's a different mechanic system separate from cloaking. you can alter it so that normal cynos need to spool up... but what about covert cynos? taking the point above in account (that cloaking-capable ships are weak in direct combat) how is a person supposed to last long enough to pin down a target (remember, only stealth bombers have no targeting delay and they have minimal tanking ability) and live long enough for a cyno to spool up?beyond that... if you create mechanics that allow for system scans of cloaking ships you effectively negate any point to cloaks in general (because any anti-cloaking ship that can scan a system becomes standard for any serious 0.0 and wormhole dweller) and if you make it ""localized"" then you are doing nothing against ""afk cloakers"" (who sit in safe spots well out of the way of any celestial object) and instead directly nerf ""active cloakers"" who are trying to do things in their tinfoil ships.the most important issue though is how are people supposed to take their enemies by surprise if local tells everyone in the area that a ""potential hostile"" is in system (keep in mind, afk cloaking was ""born"" because of this)?every time i have gone to null-sec in a ship, as soon as i appear in local everyone docks up. and they will never come out. ever. until i leave or am killed by the thousand man horde. this makes for very few opportunities to engage anyone or do any real damage no matter how well i prepared.the only counter i have is to devalue local by sitting in the system until they are used to my presence."
10/29/2012,well i wouldn't actualy mind about the fact that if i would need to make the ships activly but it's just not happening.there are too few of us versus the people getting blown up in the ships that we make so if the build mechanics would change in a way that every build would need active game time it would mean that you would run out of ships realy realy fast.also i would go for the remove local idea cause it would be a good change to the game actualy. but as long as it's there then removing afk cloakers is the choice what i would like to have.
10/29/2012,"i think the quoted poster was providing a guideline for those making suggestions to counter afk cloaking.he was saying, in order to come up with a counter method, you must check each activity listed to make sure you are not impacting them in a negative way.this has so far been shown to not be possible.also... some posts have gone missing from this thread..."
10/29/2012,"well being as local is the reason for afking, (in the context of psychological warfare) then it's the thing that should be looked at. without local's instant intel, afking would be pointless.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
10/29/2012,"after reviewing over much of the conversation i find the crew application interesting. while it does sound like have been playing star trek online, this is still eve online a very different game in itself. crew aspects would lead to crew skills, they would also lead to many asking for crew abilities as well as being able to walk in your ship. it would also lead to ship interiors which will then lead to useless console button pushing. oh wait i almost forgot, arent the pilots in a pod directly connected to the ship. yuppers but having crew serf might sound good in some aspects. one must know how and when to stop and draw a line. if crews are given to ships can i as a pilot murder that crew. slow down some of your ship functions. hmmm its all interesting until you get really into it. perhaps capital ships can have limited crew otherwise we tend to think that ""clear skies"" is actually how we use the ships in eve online. while the show is great it is not the full story of how ships operate in eve online. in truth no one real knows the full answer.just remember folks this game is better the sto and it has less usless attributes then sto. please dont try to make it replicate useless attributes. have a purpose in the game.i would say yes to carriers and titans having a limited crew operate the fighters and some of the ship functions perhaps different aspects to each faction would crew the ships. you can get crew through missions you do as well as on the open market."
10/29/2012,"i think the title is misleading...i thought this was a thread about having a """" in the game and came in with high hopes...alas i think the op meant ""ship crew"" and since we already have hundreds of threads on this topic i will leave disappointed."

10/30/2012,"so i was out scanning around today, came up with an idea to help make low-sec piracy a more viable ""profession"". it ties in with factional warfare, and i believe that it will be a small scale conflict driver throughout fw low-sec across the entire game. my thought is that if you're a pilot, not a member of any militia. you come across a militia pilot in a ls system controlled by any of the other militias, it doesn't matter which, as long as the system doesn't belong to your targets militia. you decide to engage that militia pilot, and kill them. what benefit does this grant you as a non-fw pilot? ...not much. a kill mail? maybe some tears? you take a sec status hit and have to wait out your gcc. and hopefully get some loot?my proposal is that if you kill any militia member in a system that belongs to another militia, you would be paid a portion of the lp reward that the kill would normally be worth by the faction that controls the system. essentially you could be ""paid"" by the factions for disrupting their opponents, and protecting their territory, without having to join a militia. privateering.if you join the militia, of course the reward would be far better, but this would open up the fw loyalty point stores to outside players, and would drive non militia players to fight in these fw systems far more. it makes being a -10 low-sec pirate a much more viable play style, almost a real ""profession"". it would allow them to make money from the lp stores, like the majority of fw pilots, however it should not be anywhere near as profitable as actually joining the militias. i feel that it opens up a large subsection of the game to new and interesting game play.blog:"

10/31/2012,"i had never considered the ramifications of having free to play also mean maximum alts. yikes. i dont know how you would control that with out screwing over people who already have like ten accounts.as for impatient people they're everywhere. i hope dust is successful and as i have been playing it i assumed most people would be like me in thinking the only thing you would spend real money on would be a skill booster, and then let your actual game play do the talking skill wise. but there is a growing group of players who really think the quickest way to level is with aurum gear instead of implants.some people dont want to have to wait 30 days to fly a hull or more, you might be shocked at the number of people willing to plunk down cash for a ship if the price is right.now eve pvp is awesome, and it may not get you sp to win pvp fights, but i think it there are people crossing over from dust they might take the same idea with them of: ""if this tech two aurum hull is better, i should grab a couple.""the idea here is that in pve, you usually dont loose ships, to make any sort of income off of aurum ships modules they would have to be focused on pvp modules and ships.im trying to create and oppurtunity for ccp if dust is successful its going to bring in quite a different crowd then what were used too. all the fpsr i have met on dust i have always told them to get an eve account started and there dust merc will bathe in isk one day."

10/31/2012,"as a lifelong pirate, i would support a system like this if it was endorsed by npc pirates rather than local fw. the prominent regional pirate faction makes more sense to hand out rewards for killing people (disruption lawful activity and such), and this would mean such a reward system would not be restricted to fw areas. part of the appeal of being a criminal is the complete lack of affiliation with any sort of governmental organization, and i don't know how many pirates would be willing to compromise that to become glorified fw conscripts. edit: also, rewards given for killing people should not be claimable until you have -5 sec status or lower"
10/31/2012,"that's a pretty good idea, maybe require your standing towards the pirate faction to be above a certain point to be eligible for the rewards?blog:"
10/31/2012,"no, because that would probably require some amount of pve grinding, which most pirates have no patience for. also, most pirates probably have greatly negative standing to most, if not all npc pirate corps if they were mission runners at any point. i think the only major requirement to receive these rewards should be a deeply negative sec status, perhaps rewards for killing someone with a very positive sec status could be higher than if they had a neutral sec status.edit: after giving it some thought, i think that the standing requirement would not be a bad thing if pirate standings would be gained through killing capsuleers. perhaps if a certain regional pirate faction required a high enough standing to get rewarded for pvp, you had to destroy so many ships to become eligible for whatever the rewards are, and then only after reaching that standing threshold, do you receive tangible benefits to being a pirate."
