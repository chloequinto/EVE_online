9/1/2010,"blaster brutix is fail, it will die fast once locked ~ active tank is pretty crap unless you solo 1v1 ~ ~ a cane will orbit a brutix even when scrammed ~ ~ a harb will simply demolish the brutix no need to move around, it can kill it before it flies away ~ ~ if you solo in a brutix you failed, use a myrmidon with acs/pulse next time ~so yes blasters sucks ass, they have hard time tracking an orbiting bs in optimal.railguns (or failguns) will prolly hit for 36.6 damage something moving at 40-50km.... again a pulse can do the same with just more damage.make blaster shotgun like weapon, ofc not aoe, just massive damage thats whats supposed to be... also ""railguns"" is lame to deal thermal damage.. explosive is more likely since railguns use projectile ammo (in reallity that is)."

9/1/2010,this thread can really take off if everybody in support of it makes an active effort to get the word out.linking the thread in alliance or corp chat and asking your best buddies to vote support it. they don't have to legitimately support it. as long as you can coach them and their alts to blank reply support the thread then its worth it. if the only thing we succeed in is getting the csm to mention futanari/describe it then this thread will be well worth it. if somebody can figure out an htlm link that causes the user to make a blank post with support ticked then link it here. that way you can get anybody who is logged in to vote support it with a single click.

9/1/2010,supporting this thread. perhaps ccp could team up with one of the chains for a week of hilariousness or something. the pizza chains have pushed worse things.
9/1/2010,supporting the idea that destroyers need to be serious ships that can actually do what the description says (cormorant is an exception in the pattern of descriptions): one idea to help the rebalancing would be to switch the role bonus from optimal to tracking. this then allows the skill bonuses to be better tailored to the individual race's needs.
9/1/2010,"not supported.this is what separates the great minds from the common masses.. the 2 year old player with no learning skills and the month old noob able to learn anything fast. to do this would harm eve in the wors way possible by making it safer, easier, brighter. it would be un-eve-like."
9/1/2010,"what about possibly rearranging learning skills. instead of a + to attributes maybe it instead gives a boost to train a specific skill group of your choice? and instead of a actively earned skill make it a passively gained bonus given to people after a certain subscription age? with a max of 5 groups with a bonus.this way instead of rewarding you for spending time else ware it rewards you for staying with the game.what i mean is after a character has been subscribed for 1 month, 6 months 1 year, 1.5 years, and finally 2 years gets a bonus to train a skill group... it rewards those who stay with the game. and this does not include unsubscribed time (i.e. have the account for 2 years with no subscription) nor would a break in the time affect it (example: you subscribe for 6 months take off 3 months and then subscribe again for 9 months would mean you get the 1 month, 6 month , and 1 year bonus.i doubt i was clear enough for others to understand but what of that as a possibility? although i'm probably crazy and that is ok to."

9/1/2010,"propose 2 wardec mechanics change.1) current 5 mil dec cost (bounty from 5 bs rats) is a joke. rise it to at least 100 mil per corp (2 hours of carebearing by 1 person).2) abolish cost increase for additional decs, in favor of a flat fee.currently, empire wardecs consist of countless 3-man front corps supported by tons of neut rrs, grieving noob corps, with noob corps disbanding and reforming to avoid dec. the whole mechanics is broken and easily manipulated by both sides.changes would encourage formation of more large merc alliances, deccing many large corps and fighting real wars. the higher fee floor would make noob corps not worth deccing, the flat fee would make large merc corps/alliances worth forming."
9/1/2010,1: yes.2: no.... in fact the scale should be maintained at the new prices. paying to avoid concord intervention and fighting in lowsec/nullsec should come at a price. it's too easy to grief and abuse the system as it is.war dec's should be expensive.... and even your proposed prices just aren't enough in my book.to easy to get that kind of money.this doesn't even come close to wholly fixing war-decs but its a start.conclusion - not supported.
9/1/2010,"no, too expensive.yes. also:yes.-liang"
9/1/2010,all you people that belive this should put pass it over already. it's puff puff pass not puff puff and puff some more.no one that is not already willing to go to low sec will go. they will always find ways around going though low sec even if that means having multable ships and gear in each empire they wish to do bussness with. and seting up jump clones.
9/1/2010,"i support this, but only if the boundaries are expanded (ie more bottleneck systems)"
9/1/2010,we clearly need to screw up eve economy for the sole purpose of giving a handful of ppl more kms.
9/1/2010,"yes, please."
9/1/2010,i highly doubt this would occur. if people went to caldari space then the value of caldari faction items would tank and the other empires faction items would greatly increase. sooner or later even the most die hard carebear would muster up the courage to get in an empty pod and shuttle through low sec to get the better lp rewards.
9/1/2010,"there is one ""quick fix"" to help low sec missioning given the current mechanics of the game. stronger station defenses/easier undocking or remote mission completionyou can make certain ships very hard to impossible to scan down, easiest on the t3 ships. the problem is having to dock and undock to complete missions. the station becomes a choke pint where player pirates can lock you down while only having to face a couple of pitiful station guns.if you had a fighting chance to get out of a station to do a mission, more people would do them i think."
9/1/2010,"that 8% is made up of various alts, while their mains that they spend most of the time on are in high/null. it's misleading.lowsec missions are no go if your big fat pve fit bs can be scanned down in seconds. rewards won't help if there is no means of collecting it. before mission scanning, carebears were in lowsec, then it got implemented, and they all left. the new population balancing ""feature"" that made lowsec missioners go through more gatecamps is one more nail in the coffin. you can come up with whatever solution you want, only one will work. there was a time when lowsec wasn't barren, before mission scanning and load balancing got implemented. we already know what works, all that's left is to restore things back to its last known working state."
9/1/2010,"supporting this, low sec needs help.another option is to move all l4 agents with quality higher than 0 to low sec."
9/1/2010,i like this idea better.this thread should cost you 50m.
9/1/2010,"the solution for the nap train issue will have to come from ccp. no matter how good an idea (and in no way am i saying this is a good one, sorry) to change how it nap works, the current players that are involved in naps will do everything in their power to make sure it does not change.i mean think about it. if your in the huge nap train making isk hand over fist, would you want that to change and your income to drop? would you want to have to work at actually making isk? of course not.the only ones that have a problem with the nap train are those who prefer pvp and the 'good' fights. everyone else wants it to stay the same.only thing we can do is wait for ccp to save the game from itself before the entire game is 95% blue with each other.i of course expect everyone part of the nap train to smack me with npc alts claiming there is nothing wrong with the current situation. anyone that is part of the nap train that actually speaks out openly about wanting less blues is immediatly silenced by being kicked or threatened.now it is getting to the point where i don't blame alliances for signing up on the nap train list to have a chance in 0.0 the idea of an alliance/corp trying to carve out a piece of 0.0 without blueing up a bunch of other alliances is simply not possible.there are nothing in the game that discourages this. having dozens upon dozens of blues is simply, safer.but like i said above, if you want in 0.0 then you have no choice in the matter."
9/1/2010,"with my idea,and using your aliance as an example, i believe you have 3000 members in ur alliancesay you want to blue corp a (70 members) alliance a (700 members) and alliance b (1500 members)you will be paying approx 13b per month, corp a will be paying 3.07b a month, alliance a will pay 3.7b a month, and alliance b will pay 4.5b a month.that is costly, and would definetley fix the nap trains, and we wouldnt have north vrs south, wed have more like tribal wars in a way, maybe 2 alliances controls region a, and 2 alliances controls region b, and we get smaller, more server capable fights."
9/1/2010,what makes you think it needs fixing? ppl blue other ppl because they want to. maybe they don't want to fight just because you want them to. you're always free to fight everyone else. stop trying to force other ppl do what you want. they'll just find another way and it won't work in the end.
9/1/2010,"let's check your thought process:nap train are bad for 0.0 -> we should change them -> add a blue chargeyou are missing a piece. high sec and low sec allinces, corporations and individuals have people set to blue, so your idea will not change much for 0.0 alliances that will keep the blue to lue standing up and still make plenty of isk from 0.0 resources, but will screw up low sec/high sec alliances and corp and that are making way less.so instead of ""curing"" 0.0 you infect low sec and high sec. smart."
9/1/2010,"unsupported.you can't put a fee on people agreeing not to shoot each other. all that will happen with your proposal is people will go back to the old days of keeping a written-down list of friendly corps, and they'll consult that before deciding to fire.it improves nothing."
9/1/2010,"this would make things worse, i do not support this."
9/1/2010,"or they can ignore that mechanism and use other means, say forums, voice chats, irc, hell even xfire. to make those naps happen without having to pay and the only people that got affected are the high sec corp/alliances who have real life friends in other corps/alliances that have nothing to do with blab warfare.you can't stop human natureand i personnaly don't think that it will ever get to all 0.0 blue. again its human nature, what happens when a power becomes to powerfull and too big? (think of what hapened to the roman empire)"
9/1/2010,um. no.
9/1/2010,this idea has no redeeming qualities.
9/1/2010,"maybe, but low/hi sec alliances and corps are much smaller, and would require a much smaller fee.maybe make this fee for sov holding alliances only then?they could do that yes, but now they dont have access to each others jump bridges, docking rights etcthe fact that you can rarely ever get good fights anymore, its always massive blobs and server lag, its no fun. its a huge deterrent for most people to go to 0.0.some alliances have allies they dont even see ever cuz their too far away, or a blue that does nothing for them. in real life, most countries that are allied do trades with each other, but in this game thats not true, you just buy from jita. there should be some limit to how much blue you can have.i dont believe all of 0.0 will go blue, but my idea will bring more pvp, and it wont make it impossible to make isk either. alliances would probably also start weeding out there inactives and we would have more accurate numbers on how many people they actually have. i also think this idea would effectively get rid of pet alliances, because their would be no profit for them, you know the people who have 0.0 but dont deserve it at all, also a big reason that big alliances can afford so many super capitals."
9/1/2010,"what if corp a in this big bad sov holding 0.0 alliance, wants to set a particular high sec care bear indy hauling corp as blue, so they can haul their stuff up to jita for them?does corp a have to pay billions of isk to set [care bears anon] (wonder if that's really a corp out there?) to blue?"
9/1/2010,"no because you dont need standings to do a courier contract, and if your referring to a carebear hauling corp that goes to sov holding alliance a's outpost and hauls to jita, im pretty sure that sort of corp doesnt exist. but if they do want standings, then yes they would have to pay, not like you need standings in hi sec anyway."
9/1/2010,"yes, i mean if [care bears anon] flew through gates camped by corp a. they'd set them blue, so they wouldn't get toasted.so you're saying they would have to pay?"
9/1/2010,"yes, but that doesnt mean much, because this is an unlikely scenario, most big bad sov holding alliances have their own jump freighters / t2 hauler alts. the ones that dont would be small enuff to afford the standings. or maybe neutral carebear corp could join the alliance.however if carebear corp anon wants to blue hisec pvp corp anon, they would not have to pay, because neither hold any sov."
9/1/2010,"we have one other smallish alliance set blue, and i still think your idea has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. eve is a sandbox, stop imposing artificial limits on emergent gameplay.what needs fixing isn't really how many people are blue, it's that the actual fights are too biased by sheer numbers."
9/1/2010,"not supported, but i do agree that the napfests are ghey"
9/1/2010,"itt""we should tax people for having friends"""
9/1/2010,in the past it was risky to jump in titans without a support fleet because you can't kill the hics / dics in time. by now the titan is that kind of uber ship wow kiddys are asking about. so my suggestion is give the hic a new role bonus wich reduces the dd damage done by titans to the old values.
9/1/2010,whaaaaaa! my cruiser can't hold a 50 billion isk ship so i must try the nerfhammer.either your fleet wasn't ready to back you up or they kill off your hics and logoffskied/jumped.
9/1/2010,whaaaaa! my cruiser can't do what it is designed for. think before post dude
9/1/2010,hic isn't a counter titan ship...
9/1/2010,your doing it wrong kid.can't take the heat? get the #### out of the kitchen.not supported.ps: hic's have notoriously strong tanks... for a reason... obviously your not ready to fly them or you don't fly them properly. they are fleet ships as well.... not solo-wtf-pwn-mobiles....unless your that good.ps2: and if your crying/emo-raging over getting dd'd by a titan? not even a carrier is supposed to survive that.... duhhh? (answer - have more than one hic in the group... do some histroy reading on titan take downs.... not that hard to figure out.
9/1/2010,"i have a terrific mental image of the millennium falcon getting shot in the face by the death star superlaser. except when the dust settles, han and chewie are standing there grinning.especially since titan dd is now targeted, why would you ever imagine that anything as small as a cruiser hull could withstand a hit?"
9/1/2010,"sounds cool, anything to kill some caps.cromo, stop posting in bold, you look like a moron."
9/1/2010,good idea...less insurance = done...now more sc deaths!!
9/1/2010,i support anything that kills caps faster
9/1/2010,i support anything that will kill caps.
9/1/2010,"really, they are? i'd love to see the proof of that. fact is, when one side fields 20 supers, the other side isn't likely to field 21 and say ok, let's have a go at it. they're too expensive to risk losing half your fleet to kill the full other fleet for. supers do not fit the role that the dread/carrier proliferation of old fill. simply put, they don't have a role, they just do it all well to a point where the only risk involved in using supers is your own pilots stupidity. the idea has failed horribly and sadly it doesn't even seem to be on the radar of ccp to rebalance again even most reasonable people will admit they're overpowered... see shc. then you have the doom. pilots who think that there is such a thing as end game and they all want to be in it. hence they're constant refusal for changes like this one. i don't particularly think it should be disruptors, but the 75km scrams i'm cool with. easy to out range on top of being easy for a super to kill. so not much added risk, but a bit."
9/1/2010,i really don't see why people are so upset at this suggestion. if the pos is unmanned then you can clear any and all tackle and offensive mods on you in about 20 seconds (it's p easy)...
9/1/2010,"this * 10...if this is implemented it may make the above moaners to the idea think twice about dropping an avatar and a nyx on a lone drake, which they do with regularity, they want to keep the status quo of their risk free pvp, so supported.alsoas this is their preferred m.o.how can a normal alliance member tell the difference between an questionable blue and a non questionable blue?"
9/1/2010,maybe we want people to play the game (tackle things) and not stupid posses?this whole change would just make it safer for idiots who dont scout. we dont need to support those. darwin handles them nicely.
9/1/2010,"yes supers need to die more. no, vuk's proposal is not the way to do it.the problem with supers is not that pos batteries don't scramble them, it's because they can log off when tackled and in trouble and usually live that way.vuk's proposal is simply a way of preventing/making harder the hotdropping of stuff on a pos, effectively making 0.0 safer for carebears. it does not, by any means, ensure the dying of more supers. the net result is probably that they will get used less again and carebears can use jump bridges/beacons with less chance of getting their stuff ganked again. no thank you i say!now the proliferation of supers, without them dying, is a serious issue. so yes, they need to die. instead of vuk's proposal, which doesn't serve to solve the problem mentioned, i would rather propose to change log off mechanics, so that any ship that is tackled will not disappear from space when it logs off, effectively eliminating the use of logging off to gtfo while in combat."
9/1/2010,oh hell yeah.
9/1/2010,"yes, because it's hugely challenging to log an alt into a system each day with a cloak and a cyno, go to work, come back, go to the store, come back, and just wait until you feel like being active.that's real fair for the guys doing the proper scouting to know 1) is it a legit alt, 2) is it active, 3) does it have a cyno ready. how is shutting down a system of travel afking all day fair or in any way actively playing as you just phrased it? tell ya what, fix cloaks, fix hp, fix a few other things about moms and we can forget the point on the tower... although i kinda like it too."
9/1/2010,interesting idea but i don't think it is a good one - the whole point of these ships is that they have immunity apart from to hics/dics. it isn't all that easy to get one and so the benefits should be great. if it was a manned gunner device it may work better but the simple fact is that if you are patient enough to camp for a capital gank for hours then you should be able to get a reward :)either way i think that people really should just be more careful when moving caps through bridges and gens...most large alliances are awful at scouting and i do agree with whoever said this seems like a boost to the lazy and carebears of 0.0.
9/1/2010,see that kind of attitude is the exact reason why ccp should not implement that idea.let me give you one small hint: a dual web rapier gets your cap ships/freighter away from a pos in no time.
9/1/2010,"actually, it's that kind of stupidity that is why ccp should not listen to a person of your intelligence. first your asking for a dual accouter, now your asking for a dual accounter with the 2nd account specifically trained for a particular race and a particular ship. and finally, you're leaving out the fact that a hic or dic can bubble instantly and / or cloak, removing the ability to beat it with the system load working in the attackers advantage over the defender. **** sake already, shut up and allow average gamers to play the game already w/o you wanting to epeen over everything with your overpowered toys. you seem to not mention that you can go in at any time of day with your supers and incap those mods forcing them to be repped constantly for multiple times the amount of time."
9/1/2010,"although you have a point, this is not the solution.if a ship is tackled without aggression, they emergency warp to safety after 1 minute, this is a good safety measure atm, it should not change, although some one may deliberately log off to save their ship, there is also legitimate disconnects.atm if a ship aggresses then logs, you have 15 minutes to kill it, plenty of time you say, which it is, if you are trying to kill an aeon with 2 rifters and a thorax, you are doing it wrong.the tackling isn't the problem, the problem is to catch a sc you need the right ships in the right places at all times, now expecting someone to man hic's and dictors 24 hrs a day on jb pos's and cyno pos's is ridiculous, who wants to spend their game time doing that?vuk's suggestion is a middle ground, the pos will tackle the sc, the home defense force will mobilise, if quick enough to mobolise they will catch the sc still tackled by the pos disruptor, most of the time they will not get there in time and the sc will be in a safe spot, cloaked, waiting out it's aggression, the amount of alliances that could muster up such a fleet to snare that sc in time before the mods are destroyed are very few.also take into account sc's get tackled quite frequently, killing them is the hard part......"
9/1/2010,"a long while ago, i logged in one day and saw a notification that stated i 2 days left for my subscription. 'thanks', i thought to myself, as i quickly went to my eve account page and canceled my sub so my card would not be overdrawn.enter today. with so many people living paycheck to paycheck, it would be an excellent idea to re-implement this notification, as to save time lost waiting for a paycheck. as of this writing, i have a character inactive because i did not have the cash to pay for the account, and now my bank account is overdrawn (because it attempted to take cash out). not to mention, now i must wait for ccp to temporarily re-enable my account so that i may apply a plex card. all of this hassle and headache could be avoided by added a simple ""5 days remain before auto-payment/plex end"", whatever the wording happens to be.i saw this once right after dominion was released. where has this notification gone? trial accounts still get the ""14 days left"" notification. why don't paying customers get a similar notification?"
9/1/2010,i agree with saithe on this one
9/1/2010,"there's a lot of talk on this subject.apparently that warning only applies for a select few players.i think you have to set up monthly payments, using a major credit card, during a full moon, between the hours of noon and 2 pm, on alternating thursdays.otherwise, it doesn't show up for you. sorry!"

9/1/2010,"+1nothing is more annoying when undocking from a station, knowing there is an enemy waiting outside, and you have to sort and start the right drones in the few valuable seconds when you got 1.000 other things to do..."
9/1/2010,"i'm not wanting free kills. i never said make them easily scannable either, but when someone has a prover who has trained to the top of their skills and alls w/ implants it's an imbalance in mechanics. if someone is cloaked they can't fight, most ships can't even warp. pro vs con, balance obtained and we can move on. running in an unprobable tengu, ok u lose some dps, but your cant be probed, you get higher payouts, and you shed some dps. not much of a balance. the prober in our corp is topped out on skills, he can only hit a 50% on a t3 meaning no chance of sucess so whay should a pilot be able to roam freely in a ship thats unscannable? isn't that part of the reason lowsec missions are more lucrative in the first place allowing for the extra danger of doing it? are you saying that it's unreasonable to watch local and check for probes every so often to cover your back? again, no one said it had to be easy to scan one out, but atleast make it possable to do it, not impossable."
9/1/2010,"wall of text ftw?ok, so you want ships that can't be made 100% undetectable.well...how about we also reduce the effects on reppers? why should ships be able to mount enough regen to be impossible to kill?how about we also reduce the effects of tracking and speed on weapon systems? why should ships be impossible to hit?how about we also reduce the amount of sp on toons who make bullsh!t whiny threads on the forums? why should it be impossible to browse the forums without seeing tears?most agree, cloaks are the counter to probes. but these forums are jam packed with threads whining and b!tching about how cloaks should be nerfed. so here comes un-probe-able ships, which aren't ""cloaked"" but are still making everyone dock up and hide from the boogeyman in local.restricting game mechanics, so they can be probed down no matter what, means it's impossible to avoid combat.so... do they live with the impossible, or do you?"
9/1/2010,"most ships that people complain about as un-probe-able end up being cloaked ships. i've never understood this complain about t3 ships, as they can be fit with cloaks that will have the same effect (someone in system, warp, cloak) and doesn't gimp the fit."
9/1/2010,"lol, if you can't break the tank change ships. no ship has an impossable tank that cannot be broken, if you think thats true then you need to think outside the box. no tank is unbreakable.no ship is impossable to hit either, they can be hard to hit or even catch, but not impossable. it simply takes a diffrent setup like web's, tracking computer, drones, or missles. no such this is impossable to hit.sp = time in game training w/ paid sub.as you can see there are counters to evereything you said, or in the case of sp the trade off is you pay ccp money for several years to make 50 mill sp. time/money vs high sp.as for the cloak again the balance is they are not in combat or doing anything but cloaked. unprobable has little to no trade off and the ability to defeat simple game mechanics. explain how this is such a horrable concept for you to grasp."
9/1/2010,"shall i also explain what ""spell check"" does too?to make a ship un-probe-able, they have to boost the sensor res significantly. that involved using a combination of implants, rigs, modules, all of which means they're missing out using something else. for the sake of avoiding being tracked down and ganked, they're giving up being better at their jobs.""risk vs reward"" is chanted in here daily. well... they want to avoid risks, so they're missing out on some of the rewards they could have had with a better fit."
9/1/2010,"you mean it takes them 5 min more to do their mission? cry some more why don't ya. if you canthack it in low sec and 0.0 maybe you should find a diffrent agent. i hear motsu has great agent, will never have to set foot in low sec. as far as setting up your ship it didnt look all that complicated to me, alot less complicated than trying to rig, implant, train, equipment to scann effecently. last i checked eve was one of the most unforgiving pvp games out there, maybe you should try warcraft, i'm told you simply respawn over there and have no repercussions from a loss."

9/1/2010,"i agree, ccp should fix lag, we dont need beautiful graphics"

9/1/2010,"use all the derogatory remarks and smilies you want ( see? i know how to use them too,) but the fact is that ccp should have the hardware in place and the software optimized in the event that a fight of any substantial size is going to take place. this is not something that just started happening. it's something that has been ongoing for a very long time now and ccp is doing nothing more than throwing a few token developers on it, having them write the occasional blog entry and run a mass testing event every other week and saying they're working on it. but they're not. they have pushed it to the side in favor of their more ambitious plans and expansions which, if sov warfare is any indication, will be total **** as well ruining game play for many causing them to quit and eventually eve will no longer be self sufficient.your implied solution of ""no blob warfare"" just simply isn't feasible and would end up castrating one if not both (or all) participating sides in an engagement. eve has touted that it's the largest mmorpg universe where you don't have to play on individual shards and this in itself infers that you have more players available in your universe. as more players are introduced into an environment, the greater your chance of combat becomes and more fights leads the greater chance of more people being involved. furthermore, these conflicts not only affect the system in which the ""spacial anomalies"" occuer (i love how ccp colors lag to sound like it's a feature of game mechanics... maybe they're closet microsoft fanbois) but it also affects other systems throughout new eden. for the last 10 minutes i've been trying to load the station in the system next door to where a fight is currently raging with 500 pilots and i still haven't seen the local nor any of my chat windows. i am unable to bring up my ship or items hangars so i can reship and get back in the fight. i am unable to undock. i am unable to do anything. the game is currently completely useless to me.ffs. i have to be a sick masochist to keep coming back for this **** every day. if the concept of eve wasn't the greatest i'd ever heard (and i've been playing video games on the computer since the early 80s) i wouldn't still be here. but i guess the truth is that since i am still here ccp has no incentive to fix the problem knowing that if i haven't left now that i probably won't be leaving anytime soon."
9/1/2010,"i seem to recall ccp having a way to ""schedule"" a fight, so they could set up extra resources for big fleet battles.of course, that would mean that the cloaked recon with the cyno, waiting for orders before lighting it up and bringing in the 500 ships, would have to file the proper request first."

9/1/2010,"no. too easy to abuse, does not add value.assets are too easy to take from a corp or transfer to a new alt/corp/whatever... and the stock exchange as you know it only works due to federal regulation, large threats not unlike the sword of damocles, and other issues not relevant to eve and apparently beyond your feeble understanding of economics."
9/1/2010,"i first replied thinking it was eanm. but this, well, they are hardly used anyway. i think there are more regeratives added to ship because of misclicks then out of intent.also, cdfe look somewhat similar to trimarks, what with 15% more shield (this also adds recharge with the shields) and 50 calibration."

9/1/2010,"he didn't say that, nor did he say the free tritanium should be removed because i don't doubt some people will request a free rookie ship take the tritanium then trash it, push the button, repeat. alternatively there would be a time limit on how often one would be permitted to request a free rookie ship instead of removing the gift of 1 unit of tritanium but again he nor you his interpreter said that."

9/1/2010,we requested devblog related to pi and all shiny numbers about it (hopefully there will be blue graphs as well). hopefully it will see the light of the day soon(tm).
9/2/2010,"fool that i am, i will cut against the grain of this very popular thread. i think the op does make some good points. i will just post a bit of my own perspective. i think ccp has done an excellent job and a very reasonable job of balancing new features versus fixing old features.wormholes are a relatively new feature. if ccp were to continue to only work on fw and sovereignty until it was perfect this may not have been developed? i really dont go in wh myself but i recognize that ccp did a good thing by adding this new feature.they have done several minor fixes/new features to faction war in apoc 1.5. they also added new rig changes which i think they did an excellent job on. the new faction ships are well balanced. sure some complain about the dramiel being overpowered. however considering the numbers of ships that ccp updated or created the fact that only one of the ships is even controversial shows that they did an excellent job. they created or upgraded over a dozen ships to make them playable and yet the players are just hung up on why they cant fly a hawk or a corm. personally i agree with ccps decision about what made the game more enjoyable. keep in mind it does take time to fully evaluate what exactly should be done to make fw, or any other feature, better. although there have been many threads on fw the recommendations of the players are often contradictory. accordingly i think ccp's limited and cautious actions with respect to fw is reasonable. sure certain bugs could be fixed regarding occupancy plexing. but lets face it very few in faction war really do plexing. correcting the bugs will not lead to many more people doing occupancy plexing. more needs to be done than that. how much more and what exactly? i have my own ideas but suffice it to say this is a very controversial topic. there is no obvious fix that would make everyone thrilled to do occupancy plexing. that goes for fw. are the other things more clear cut? do we know exactly how treaties should work? do we know exactly how sovereignty should work? i really dont play in that area of the game but i would guess that is still somewhat controversial. the focus on incarna is disappointing to me. 18 months to develop this feature is not really what i would like to see. but in a way they are taking the ops advice. they are saying we are going to an ""excellent job"" with incarna and so we will lengthen the cycle to 18 months! personally i wish they would just spit something out there that would take a team of 4 devs 6 months to work on."

9/2/2010,"""chicks with dividens"" is now a meme."
9/2/2010,"i honestly don't know.i would say yes, but it's not because my mind is corrupted by dirty images of women, y'know, makin' some love. i would say yes because if you're going to make eve as realistic as possible, then go ahead and show something revealing.i'm edging towards no, though. first off, even though this is a game for those mature enough to understand it and not die of boredom, some kids do play it, and enjoy it like any person out there. showing exotic dancers while there's a pos just gets 'em banned from the game by their parents and ruins the fun. i'm pretty young myself, but i don't mind since i'll run into nudity somehow. besides, i don't see the point in putting revealing features in eve if the main point is to fly a ship, mine, shoot people, and dominate the sandbox. but opinions are opinions, and i don't support it.it's not a bad topic though, some people do enjoy ""inappropriate"" things, and nothing can stop them from watching it. maybe you should make a petition for ccp to agree to this or not."
9/2/2010,i fixed that for you. also there is nothing inappropriate about transgendered individuals or futanari for that matter. ccp has shown through storyline and chronicles that futa is a regular fixture in gallente society. although i have to admit your post was way way more intelligent then i expected it to be considering i found you in couster.

9/2/2010,"dec cost is 2 mil, not 5. it's been quite a while since they changed it. not that the difference matters, they are both pocket change.100 mil is still too little if it's to be a flat fee. it's nothing for any individual more than a few weeks old, not to mention large merc corps or those that hire them. if you can't afford so little isk, you shouldn't be deccing wars."
9/2/2010,"fix risk vs reward in highsec and low/nullsec and there'll suddenly be less griefer/extortionist corps. ""problem"" solved. a lot of griefing corps are ex-pirates who got sick of hunting other pirates and noobs. killing other pirates isn't really piracy so when they figured that out they became highsec ""griefers"".but yeah, wardecced corps should be able to let one merc corp/alliance join for free."
9/2/2010,"wardec cost should depend on the target corp player count, standing to concord, faction standing, average securty status, average player sp and so on.that way, to wardec a small pvp corp costs pocket change(maybe even free if sec status totally screwed) but deccing some newbie carebear mission runners would cost alot, like 250mil."

9/2/2010,"oh god yes!if certain asteroids would only spawn in certain empires, then you would have to haul minerals from all the 4 empires to build a ship. prices would change, and you could actually make money on trading. please, for the love of all that is eve, make it happen!"
9/2/2010,"you don't have to, that's just where the highest profit would be."
9/2/2010,"well no, if the only way to build ships is to get 4 different types of minerals, and if these 4 different types of minerals can only be found in large enough quantities in the 4 different empires, then every ship that is build will need to have come from all the 4 empires. the ""local"" mineral would be worthless as everyone would be mining it, but to build something you would still need to get minerals from the other three empires, and prices for those mineral will be high.someone could then haul these minerals through lowsec for ****loads of profit.if people want to stay in highsec, fine, nobody is forcing them, they can run lvl4s all they want. but i don't see why they need to get ****ed at the idea of there being another way of making more isk for those willing to risk more."
9/2/2010,"not supported. because mara rinn said it best:forcing trades to go through lowsec will, in the long run, move highsec dwellers to caldari space.empire dwellers choose the path of least resistance. they wont go through lowsec."
9/2/2010,"low and null is already where the highest profits are (planets, moon mining, mineral deposits). lots of people don't go there because of many of the people posting here in support of this idea are waiting at gate camps to destroy them.i don't have anything against piracy but the pirates who whine endlessly on these forums about low sec and the lack of players are getting tiresome. they spend hours and hours at gate camps and roaming low sec to make it a dangerous place for people and then cry when no one wants to go there.the low sec dwelling eve pirate: a bigger group of self defeating forum cry babies you will never see.i have much more respect for groups like tears who bring it to high sec instead of moaning about a lack of targets and trying to force people where they don't want to go."
9/2/2010,"none of those will help. they all focus on either buff lowsec rewards or nerf highsec rewards to make lowsec look better in comparison. bottom line is, it will still require a bs staying at lowsec mission site for a long time, more than enough to scan it down and kill it. if you're lucky and warp off, you abandon the mission and take standing hit. pretty soon you won't be able to use the agent anymore.the solution is not to buff rewards, but increase safety to a point where missioners can complete enough missions to make up for the standing hits when missions fail as result of being ganked, in order to keep running lowsec missions. otherwise all the rewards in the world won't make a difference. rewards have to cover ship replacements too.a way to do this is making all lowsec missions similar to fw missions."

9/2/2010,"i think you don't get what i whant. i don't whant the hic to be a pwn mobile i whant it to do what it is designed for, pin down a titan. if you have ever taken place in a big fleet fight (i guess not since your post shows me you havent any idea about whats going on there) you would know atm there isn't any chance of pinning down a cuple of titans because they will blow up all hics you got in a couple of seconds. my idea of fixing that problem is giving the hic a role bonus which reduce the dd damge to the old aoe value. this means you can still blow up hics with a titan but you will need more dd for a hic. btw the reason why the hic got this insane resist bonus is that it is able to survive a dd so stop **** posting"
9/2/2010,hics were brought in to counter ewar immune mother ships terrorizing low sec. they were not introduced to counter titans. edit: the main point of a hic is to pin down an ewar immune ship (focused script) and hold it there as long as it can (big tank). that's all.
9/2/2010,moms and other titans are the titan counter. get over the fact that your cruiser died to a superior weapon platform. this is eve. htfu
9/2/2010,i've never lost a ship to a titan so stfu with such comments. nearly no one of you has ever been part of a big fleet fight so why are you posting about things you don't know about? i guess no one of you has ever seen a titan you are taking about game mechanics you dont understand so please stop posting on things you dont know
9/2/2010,use a light dictor to hold super caps. warp in drop bubble mwd out rinse and repeat.... titans cant dd light dictors cos they move too fast!!!
9/2/2010,"if you've never lost a ship to a titan, why did you make a thread to complain about it?also, if you want to tackle a titan, bring 2 hics. if a carrier can't take a dd, why should your cruiser be able to? and don't bring that bull**** that it was ""meant"" to tackle titans, because it can also tackle every other ship in the game."
9/2/2010,dds don't take transversal or sig radius into account. you could hit a dramiel moving 10k/s perpendicular to the titan with the dd.
9/2/2010,/thread + stfu @ op == epic win
9/2/2010,logging off super caps to avoid destruction mid fight has been a much used tactic for a while now. both in ganking and fleet fight situations. the lag associated with fleet fights makes the 15 minute timer a joke.
9/2/2010,"true, with tyrannis level of lag it is impossible, it is a delicate situation because without lag it is totally possible, maybe you are right and aggressed ships should not disappear after logging but then you will have lots of tears from other people, it may be possible to have differing timers for ship class but that sounds like overly complicated coding.shrugs."

9/2/2010,all titan kills in 2010-08all mothership kills in 2010-08
9/2/2010,"that's terrific, mm alone could probably cover all those losses with their own csaas 2 fold. that is not a steady or high rate, that's a pathetic rate which is leading to the explosion of number's we're seeing. supers are at the point where until you start seeing battles where sides take losses similar to dreads circa 2007, it's not going to matter."
9/2/2010,"maybe you should use all your supercaps to kill the hotdroppers once in a while?and to answer your rant about alts from a few posts back. i didnt want to imply that you should use alts, this is an mmo, multiplayer, people playing together, i am quite sure you could get one of your corp mates to give you status on a system before jumping in."
9/2/2010,"to quote everyone from nc""just because you cant handle something and are crying you expect ccp to change it""sorry kim lau, you may be the queen bee who gets all his puppets to blindly agree but double standards and hypocrisy will get you no where this request is obviously in favour for nc alone.are you really telling us that you need a pos to stop a supercap or more so that you guys have been incredebly slow forming fleets recently that by the time you get a bubble / hic close, the supercap is gone :p"
9/2/2010,"there was a supercapital death about once every two days. i'd call that a good rate. you can't ""mass produce"" supercaps like you can any other ship. that being said, like i stated before, having a system that only allows for only having 1 supercap construction facility per x number of controlled systems would be the best way to prevent proliferation and thus blobs of supercaps. the only balance change that i would support is -perhaps- reducing their remote repping bonuses so 'blobs' of supercarriers aren't near-invincible in on themselves. but the hp and fighter damages of the ships individually are balanced, and to go back to the op, a major capability of the ships are the invulnerability to ew including jamming, so that change goes against a key role of the ship and shouldn't be looked at."

9/2/2010,white whale implies obsession that destroys you in the end. this is neither. i just like things balanced so i can frag things if we work for it. i watch my back doing missions after all. i suppose i could buy a t3 for missions but seems kinda boring to me.
9/2/2010,"you do realise that fitting to be unprobeable totally gimps the ships ability to do anything else. all they can do is hide, doesnt seem like much of an issue to me."
9/2/2010,being unprobeable does not make the ship usless ... most unprobeable lokis have packing ganglinks giving there fleets insane bonuses with no risk which is one of the main reason people use them ...
9/2/2010,"i like being unprobable. mostly in a jaguar. i'd like being unprobable in other ships, but can't afford them atm.what can you do while being unprobable?you can't belt rat, the belt is warpable, you can't explore, these are scannable. this leaves missions, for which you need to get back to station quite often.for this you need 2 slots at minimum (jaguar, note that a frig does not have a whole lot of slots) or 2 slots and a subsystem for a t3. you can't do this with angels (tp) and might be a bit risky with bloods (active modules). you can't use drones, and you should steer away from buffer shield tanking and some t2 missiles.this sounds like a trade off."

9/2/2010,"hi, not long ago ccp created a new mechanics for mission hubs: agents now give missionrunners missions that are located outside the agent's system, if the system is too crowded. this was made to spread the people a bit around and reduce the lag in the mission hubs. it makes perfect sense to send people to do the guristas extravaganza in a neighbour system instead of doing it together with 150 other missionrunners in the agent's home system. in 0.0 mission hubs this seems to create undesirable side effects. in hubs that have like ~40 people, over 90% of the missions are suddenly in the empty neighbour systems. i don't think ccp intended that nerf to 0.0 missionrunners. everyone who does them knows about the dangers of using stargates in 0.0 with a ship fitted for level 4 missions. there is no need to do that because of lag issues, at least not when there are less than 50 people in system. tl:dr/plea to ccp: please limit that mechanics to systems with 50+ people in local (or whatever number that is critical for lag) or at least give people who have high standing with the agents more mission in their home system."

9/2/2010,"1. i'm inclined to agree with this, wardec is essentially a bribe to concord to look the other way towards agression, why shouldn't the defender be able to pay concord for protection. at this point the corp with the greater amount of resources wins without a fight. i don't think that the amount of ppl in the respective corps should be taken into account. this is how i believe it should go.corp a wardecs corp bcorp b has 24 hrs to outbid corp a on the wardec, bidding is public like in an auctionif corp a wins the bid, war is declaredif corp b wins the bid, war isn't declaredso essentially larger corps have more resources to fend off wardecs.also i believe that a single fee should be available to shoot certain members of a npc corp, but those members are notified and have 24 hrs to prepare just like a wardec. the fee's should increase based on how many you've had in the last week and such. but if the character joins a player corp they need to be wardec'd normally.2. sec status and gate guns i have no opinion on.ac"

9/2/2010,"you've missed the point. i did quite well. the point is that i recognize the sophomoric (there is a reason why ""sophomore"" was chosen as the adjective) tricks that you tend to use to sell your point of view. like inventing new meanings for words which simply don't apply ""a cosmos is any pvp game that lets you do things other than pvp."" ""a pvp fundamentalist is anybody who realizes that a game where the devs explicitly said it was a pvp game is a pvp game."" ""you can't have a pvp game if cooperation is allowed. please ignore all team pvp games like team fortress ii, counter strike, call of duty, and so on."" ""all of ank's own words are 'smears' because, even though it's proven that she said them, some of them she said in response to someone else, so it totally doesn't count and you're trolling her!"" ""sure they want to nerf pirates, but really i think it would be a good change. so let's not say 'nerf pirates', instead let's say 'improve eve for everybody (except pirates)' "" ""sure ank was confirmed by several independent people to have thrown a spoon at someone else, but she didn't hit her and/or didn't throw it to cause injury, so all those who claim that ank threw a spoon at someone are liars!!!"" etc. it's sophomoric word-gaming. it's semantic tapdancing. if you stopped arguing in such a manner, i wouldn't feel that you were using such tactics in order to argue dishonestly. if you stop with the word-gaming, that'd be a good first step. the second is to stop making claims that are, to put it mildly, a hard sell. like claiming that you love pvp when your last posted kill was more than a year ago. if false, then you're lying. if true, then you're using an account that is not your main in order to hide your true identity, which does not foster confidence."

9/3/2010,quoted for truth!
9/3/2010,"wood for the trees perhaps? the player who trained to level v receives more of a bonus than the person that only trained them to iv. firstly they would get more reimbursed sp than the latter pilot (which you state isn't enough), however they have also received the benefit of faster training time over that level iv pilot since they trained their skills to v.the only people i see objecting to this are the ""i had to eat gruel as a child, so you should too"" bunch. learning skills provide nothing but a divider between the old and the new players. if the learning skills are taken away you lose nothing, what you are upset about is that other people are getting something that you already have."

9/3/2010,i trained up all my pi skills and even got elite level command centers set up great colonies... and never use them for precisely this reason. i don't mind ccp requiring me to interact with them... but making it so damn well inconvenient when i do means pi == fail without this.
9/3/2010,"sure:1st point - overhaul the system which i place orders.currently, to place an order, i have to (a) find an item, (b) click a button, (c) :the important part: navigate another open window, (d) change the price which is automatically set to the lowest sell at the particular station or the regional average, both of which are usually not what traders want, (e) set specifics, then (f) confirm the order.(c)-(e) can perhaps be made a bit better, especially the default price. maybe the window could have more info or be integrated with the market tab, which leads me to my next point.i feel like the market window can hold the orders section of the wallet (it sort of does, but it's clunky, because you can't see the orders and the market for a particular item at the same time). if there was an easier way to put these side by side, and maybe a one-click view-market orders from the ""personal""- or ""corp""-orders section (instead of right-click on your order > view market orders), that would make things a lot easier. plus, it'd be nice to have available funds (like the total currently in personal and (if you have access) corp wallet) visible on the market window.these are just a few thoughts, i don't like the experience and the tediousness of things in the market. if pi taught us anything, it's the less clicks the better."
9/3/2010,"yeah like when you see the market orders of an item, have yours highlighted and then just right click your order and be able to change it."
9/3/2010,"""blending the market window and orders window.""no, thanks. corporation orders are in the market window, and it is a pain to switch between the tabs and stuff, i'd much rather keep them separate windows.what about being able to modify corporation orders? would that be op?"
9/3/2010,i always wondered why this was not possible...
9/3/2010,"low/null mission running is a separate issue. before mission scanning, carebears were in low/null, then it got implemented, and they all left. before load balancing, there were still a handful of mission runners in low/null, when they had to pass through many camps, the last of them left.the real problem is mission runners fail missions as result of mission scanning or gate camps so often that they soon lose enough standings and can no longer use the agent. thus, forced to move to highsec. it doesn't matter if you're willing to pit pve fit against pvp fits, if agents don't give you missions, you can't do them even if you want to. no matter how high the reward is, it won't help, safety must be boosted at least to the point where it's possible to make up for lost standings, in order to keep getting those rewards."
9/3/2010,"i'm mining for a very short time, but in the short time i have been doing it i got bored fast enough to be left at all, i love your proposal seems quite reasonable but don`t think how could be convenient for the new players the exploration system, but hey, if that so, and having so many millions of isk hidden in these new fields that i think all we ever been atracted by mining would return to give it a try."
9/3/2010,funny thing is there is already a macro for scaning stuff down in wormholes haha :)ya humans are lazy man you cant fix that with anything.
9/3/2010,"good idea in general, but you've to think about the new players (as said before)for the manual aiming, getting more yield idea, that won't stop any macrominer. yes, they'll be slower, but they'll still have a steady income.i would rather see a special reward for miners that are actually sitting infront of the game. like some half destroyed modules inside of roids (from battles long ago), that can only be extracted by some complicated not macroable procedure. those modules can be reverse engineered and rebuilt or something like that (throw in your ideas).or just give manual miners the chance to find a high end vein in the roidyou can't really kill the macroers... but can only try to cripple them as much as possible"
9/3/2010,"i like the idea of spreading out trade a bit more but i don't like the idea of 'feed us more n00bs' by forcing players through lowsec systems. there's already a wide enough gap between the earnings potential of more experienced players vs the newer ones and this would simply be exacerbating the situation. more experienced players would find ways around it but newer players would find themselves trapped within a given empires space meaning ""where are the mission agents in highsec so i won't get killed? what empire has which types of ore so i pick that one? which has the better trade hubs for me to work in?"" etc... i don't like the ""pick your race based upon game play style"" and, with the removal of many of the sub-racial differences, it appears ccp didn't like that either.the only ways i can see to address something like this would be to get rid of the ability to gate camp and station camp lowsec systems but not the ability for pirates to operate there. this would take a hell of a lot more changes than just setting up more lowsec so the pirate types can chew up more newer players.the only 'fix' for the gate camp gig i could come up with is an ""extreme rework"" to say the least. change how warp works and allow bubbles in lowsec. allow a ship to be pulled out of warp but make the gates and stations ""1 shot wonders"" against any aggressive combat ships that get within range of them -- 250km out or your pirate will end up dead.allow probes to find ships that are warping and provide a ship id that can be locked onto and allow for 'intercepting' that ship, in warp, to pull it out/ground it. no more ""in warp so i'm safe until i come out"" -- someone can pull you from warp and nail you. no more gate camps so getting into the systems is safe and easy. it's getting across systems that holds the risks vs just entering a ""this gate is camped!"" spot.something that adds to the risk of flying there but removes the entrance blockade effect we currently have.if such changes were done, i'd support lowsec systems between empires but the way it sits... no thanks. i think the game has enough blocks for newer players without crippling their ability to shop and sell even farther."
9/3/2010,"i like the idea, having low security systems between empires gives a sense of more realism to the game, opens up many possibilities with the market, missions (courier), piracy, production, pvp, etc.revitalize low sec, will put it on the map again and not only would the backyard of high sec and 0.0 front."
9/3/2010,"so now you want to nerf 00 and wh space so the only way to operate is acquire resources from all 4 empires? wouldn't the empires just setup trade agreements if they each are worthless without the other 3? makes no sense they'd let crappy lowsec separate them if they need resources from the other 3 empires.there are ****loads of ways to make ****loads of isk, why do we need to create yet another method where the primary beneficiaries will be those who already have ****loads of isk with the stupid idea of screwing players by cutting them off from opting out of lowsec or facing isolationism in a single empire? if people love lowsec, fine, no one forces them to stay there, they can stare at gates and each other all they want. i don't see why they and these 'elite traders' feel the need to screw other players and their play style to benefit themselves, oh wait yes i do see why they feel that way."
9/3/2010,if i did not know better i would think this is yet another low sec blues cry post. just pucker up grow something o somewere between your legs and bring it to high sec lots of targets here lots of corps doing it. just wardec a nice looking corps and take them out.
9/3/2010,"the actual bounty system can be improved in a very simple way, and it will make it very effective : - when a guy with a bounty on his head is kill, just redraw from the total ammount of the bounty the ammount of ship loss, and give it to the hunter.example :a pirate have a 150m bounty on his head :- he's killed by a bounty hunter and the ship loss is 50m, he dont gain any isk for insurance.1. he now have a bounty of 100m on his head2. the hunter gain 50msimple, efficient, easy to implement...ramon wilco"

9/3/2010,"so i take it you have a sc, your proposals are utter bs and only extend themselves to sc protection, an aeon with a correct fit has 70 million hp's without help from any remote reps.pl and wn have shown how sc blobs can destroy alliances, the only reason we have as many titan and sc deaths over the last couple of weeks is due to the pl and wn sc and titan blob that has destroyed any atlas sc that has had the balls to try and jump out to safety, so if you take them deaths out of the equation, not many sc's die.everybody and their dog now wants a sc, why, because it is an iwin button, the log out mechanics don't help in the least, 70 million hp's is enough to last the 15 minutes, especially when they are used to drop a lone drake ratting.at least let pos mods be able to hold them for the amount of time it takes to get a hic into system to take over tackle, now sc pilots just log off in system and when a juicy target appears they destroy them within seconds and just cloak up with no repercussions."
9/3/2010,did you notice that most of those 50-70m ehp ships die with like 5-6m dmg?rumors say that one of the titan losses from pl was less than 60s.and this idea wouldnt help against such supercap blobs like pl/wn in detorid.the only people it would help is protecting idiots jumping caps/(jump)freighters into hostile space.

9/3/2010,"what is the point of swapping one scrambling battery for another, that is exactly the same? unless you can comeup with a valid idea of how to make it any different, your point is invalid. poses are starbases that can build super capitals, they have guns just as big as dread does, see no reason why they should not be able to tackle a sc and potentially kill it the pilot is dumb enough. sc'sshould not be flattening pos modules with no consequences, that's one reason.second is the fact that sc is a ship with same tank as that of a titan, but enormous flexebility< which is the reaon to ther popularity. it's near-invulnerability makes them anobvious choies. now, when thescisstuck their for thetime it takes the carrier to kill the scrambling battery (which is not thatlong) you have some risk factor added, and that is good.i usually don't call people names or anything.. but what the **** is that? are you drunk? eve is not a singleplayer game, sometimes you can ask your friend to light a cyno, and your frined to web you. yes, friends, some people actually have them."
9/3/2010,"confirming that the motivation behind this thread is not the desire to kill super carriers, but to discourage them from hot dropping on capital ships who think they should be 100% outside the pos shield.start scouting and escorting your capitals instead of blindly jumping. it is not that hard. just requires effort which you guys apparently don't want to have to do."
9/3/2010,"with the increase of dps which has came in from ever larger fleets with ever more damage per ship (special note for the fleets of supercarriers with near 10k dps per ship.no structure in the game can stand upto the damages put out for a useful amount of time.i am proposing a number of changes:a:change it so pos batteries, at least small ones and missile batteries, will target drones or fighters/fighter bombers automatically.this will make it so supercarriers can no longer incapacitate poss out of their owners timezone without any difficulty at all. it will also combat the practice of assigning fighters to interceptors and running round out tracking the guns while killing the pos batteries.b:increase the ehp on tcus, ihubs or give them the same 50% resist bonus that the sbu has.sov warfare is too easily based on the attacker, especially sbus... it's too easy to take out a tcu or ihub (even with reinforce timers)c:poss.... at the moment pos gunnery seems to be a useless skill... by the time you arrive to control the guns at a pos, theyre incapacitated or the pos is dead. alliances in 0.0 can easily come up with large fleets that can make the millions of hp of a pos look like nothing.so...triple or more the hit points on pos shields, change reinforcement to 12.5% and make it so you can add more stront at 25%, also have the pos shields start off at 25% when the pos comes online, giving attackers an advantage when the pos is being set up, but defenders the advantage once the pos is online and fully running. this would still put them way behind ihubs that have 192m hp, a pos would have about 160m ehp. considering a titan under optimal conditions can have 82.5m ehp (avatar) and a pos currently has under 60m, the poss need the boost. it would also give a real advantage to faction towers that have better shield buffers.jump bridges, cyno generators/jammers - triple the hp on all levels so that they dont incapacitate at the first sign of an enemy roaming fleet.turrets - the damage on pos guns is sufficient with gunners to kill a dread in siege while not being threatening to supercaps, this is acceptable since the fighter bombers could be eliminated from a sc and a titan will unlikly be attacking a pos solo...double the shield hp of all external batteries.increase the armor hp of all external batteries by 10x, giving l/m/s guns 15m/7.5m/3.75m armor and increase all hull values to 500,000 hp.alternativly make a bonus of larger towers so they provide these hp boosts automatically.this means attackers have to risk losing more when attacking large poss or being deployed longer when using dreads etc to take out poss. it will also make a quick response to a new pos essential to avoid the new hp levels and means there will be lots of repping carriers/supercarriers/logistics ships outside the shield available as targets to anyone able to catch them."
9/3/2010,"uhm ... what ever you smoke, dont do it again ... reallythe last thing we need is more hp grinds, neither for tcu/ihub and especially not pos towers.if you want to keep your structures, go and defend them. dont relay on reinforcement timers so much."
9/3/2010,"sounds like you just want to setup a pos and bore your enemies to death while you hide in station and wait for them to leave.guess what, if a large fleet shows up to your home in 0.0, you need a large fleet to fight them or you better pack your bags and go back to hi-sec.i don't know what game you are playing but the dominion sov system is way too advantageous to the defender. there is nothing more boring than shooting pos mods and tcus/ihubs while your enemy just does nothing. you should be active to mount an effective defense and your ideas would make it so you can be passive and not do anything and show up whenever you want and require the attacker to bring an even bigger blob to do anything. nonononono."
9/3/2010,"it definitely requires some revision and balancing... im a relative noob when it comes to static structures and capital/supercapital sieges. i would say that if there arent systems already designed to increase the defensive options in a system to counter a supercapital siege of structures, there should be improvements that can be made on tcu's and the like to increase ehp etc...i would add that in the 1st published book of the eve experience the caldari and gallente have early warning and preventative systems in place to combat large scale forces. something that should possibly be rolled out across eve and its empires?it makes sense tho that in the same way as building a station in a system, rather than transport it in a ships cargohold (unlike a pos) you should be able to improve other structures that are already positioned. the idea of only being able to improve anchored items by replacing them totally is extremely un-economical and very wastefull.that kind of policy is something a highly advanced civilisation should not be able to survive living by.as eve is an immersive experience living in the distant future, something like this does break the continuity of such an experience."

9/3/2010,"yes i know they already can, as part of a contract. how pointless is it that a freighter pilot has to contract his own ships to an alt, who then courier contracts them back to the freighter pilot, who delivers them for the alt, who then contracts them back to the freighter pilot.complete, unnecessary, nonsense.just let us put the rigged ships in the frighter. surely that's not unreasonable?please?"
9/3/2010,"even in a blue hub, missioning in lowsec and nullsec is already dangerous enough. there is already too much risk (pirates, red blobs, etc.) and too many consequences (bad empire and irreversibly bad concord assembly standings) for too little reward compared to highsec missioning.ccp should limit the mechanic so that it doesn't apply to any nullsec or lowsec systems, even ones with 50 or more people. but the op's proposal is close enough."
9/3/2010,"not supported.a game mechanics should be the same for all players both null/low/high sec.and by the way, if you're afraid of jumping to a stargate in 0.0, you should'nt be there. there are more risk in low, and far more risks in 0.0, its the way eve is.and speaking or rewards, i used to mission in low sec and nullsec : low sec is very profitable due to the improved lp for mission, and 0.0 lvl4 missionning too, missionning in 0.0 is generally for lp's to buy factoin ships, you gain 12k to 20k lp in a single mission in nullsec (with good standing and skills).so for all these reason, i dont support this thread.best regards, ramon wilco"
9/3/2010,"this game mechanics doesn't change anything for highsec players (except a 2-3 minutes time loss per mission), but is a significant risk increase for lowsec and 0.0, so it's not the same for everyone. i now get a lot of missions in a dead-end 0.0 with no stations for example, all that missions are lost. ccp made this for the purpose to fix lag, that's how it was described in the blog, it was not made to balance 0.0/lowsec against highsec missions. but even if you want to compare the risk-vs-reward of 0.0 vs highsec missions, the vast majority of missionrunners apparently won't agree with you, or why do they stay in highsec. but again, that's not the question here, as this mechanics has a lag fixing purpose, in 0.0 or lowsec hubs there is no need for that (as they don't grow as big as the highsec hubs) and the side effects are grave.if you insist, i don't mind if the game mechanics are equal anywhere, just make them kick in when there are more than 50 or 60 pilots in system and it won't matter for the very most non-highsec-hubs.fake edit: supporting own thread."
9/3/2010,you should give me a thumbs up.
9/3/2010,"not supported.by the way the only way to really improve bounty system is very simple :instead of taking the bounty if u kill the guy, you should receive an amount of the bounty equal to the ship loss.this way, a people who have a bounty cant be shooted by a ""friend"" to get the bounty, cause he'll just gain the amount of isk he's loosing...and the other good thing of this is that if someone have a 200m bounty, he cant just be killed once and bounty is erased, bounty is effective until he loss 200m in ship (with possible loose of module,rig and implant he loose really a lot of isk, far more than the bounty on his head).this is the only way to fix bounty and make this system effective.and everyone should be able like now to chase someone for a bounty. people saying that the chased should be informed of the people who chased him propose a non-sense. you cant know who's chasing you, this is the purpose of a bounty.... but some bounty hunters in beeing celebs by killing lot of guys will certainly be known at terms by pirates...best regards, ramon wilco"
9/3/2010,lol at continuous whiny threads.
9/3/2010,"i support allowing 00 to become highsec, through upgrades allow npc faction police/navies to deal with the sovereign owners enemies or not blues. upgrades could open the door for gate guns, police/navy forces that sit at the gates and a number of reinforcement waves that arrive to back them up, the higher the artificial highsec the more waves and the stronger they get."

9/3/2010,"yet again you have misunderstood. you claimed that you wanted some sort of ""truce"". i pointed out that your habitual dishonesty and trolling would get in the way and asked you to stop. rather than agreeing to, you tried to change the subject with (still more) obfuscatory nonsense and vague pablum about how, my-oh-my, you'd tried and ah well and aren't you the long-suffering peacemaker and blah blah blah. so i called your bluff and pointed out, again, despite you talking about how much you love pvp when the account you post with is obvious not now and has never been at any point in the past, ever, a pvp account . and so, i gave you one more chance to show this ""civil discussion"" that you're pretending to be about and asked you to either post with this supposed pvp main that you have, or admit you were trolling. you can talk a good game about ""civil discourse"", but as long as you're trolling and arguing dishonestly, then all your talk about ""civility"" is just another troll. you know full well that as long as you are dedicated to trolling, constantly, only an idiot would give you a ""charitable interpretation"". just like i knew when i asked you to post with this supposed ""pvp main"" that chances are you'd never do any such thing because you almost definitely made it up. it's hard to post with an account that doesn't actually exist."

9/4/2010,here's my 2 isk again.change the cloaked velocity bonus to (or in addition to) a 20% per level reduction of scan resolution penalty of cloaking devices.increase jump and bridge range by 50% (should be enough to get some of those regional jumps that are just out of reach currently)change the sin's agility bonus to a 7.5% tracking bonus per level.change the panther's speed bonus to 10% falloff per level bonus. imo the other 2 ships should be fine with the top 2 bullets i made and the other aspects of the whole ship class is balanced in terms of tank/gank.
9/4/2010,ya there pure crap for a tech 2 ship just becouse you can jump with alittle clocking abitly. wtf sorry ars of a bs if you ask me. not so great of the fighting is there main problem.o i can jump a little or alot and even if you inc jump range by 2000% there still crap in a fight.a stealth bomber group is way more usefull/takes less time to train/and cost less.

9/4/2010,a couple of hours on-line and i've got a splitting headache. tiny (and terrible) 12 point font on a 2600x1440 monitor is just cruel punishment.i can't believe this issue has actually been left to fester so long.
9/4/2010,"i had to buy a t3 just to use blasters. it gets better dps and tracking do to subsystem layout. to fix blasters:more damage, same range, much better tracking. make hybrid guns reload in 5 seconds not 10. a blaster or rail gun has to use ammo, thats just how they work. the ablity to change damage types should be possable too. they are infact half way between normal guns and lazers. t2 ammo is pointless right now so that could use a look into as well. maybe make a ammo that does good damage (80% max) but has + to optmal and falloff. nerf scorch so its got the end all of ammo to shut people up. not much but just enough to bring the range down a little bit. the above changes would make me happy. my t3 would shoot for over 1000dps, be able to shot anything that flys at it and really be able to dish out the dps, not just say it can...for once."
9/4/2010,"i posted a similar solution in another thread.increase medium / large rail damage by 10%increase medium / large blaster damage by 15%reduce reload to 5 secondsreduce charge size to 1/2 that of projectiles (reducing gun cap accordingly)devide the ammo into two types at each range;""gal ammo"" one 4:1 thermal to kinetic damage + tracking ( tracking bonus starts around 10% and increases as the ammo range increases)""caldari ammo"" one 4:1 kinetic to thermal damage - cap use ( cap bonus starts around 15% and increases as the ammo range increases)^^ that puts hybrids inbetween projectiles and rails, they get their own unqiue identity without being worst of both, and they take a little more thought to use."

9/4/2010,thank you very much for your post. it is rare to find posters that have the backround i do when it comes to eve.gallente are the race i chose because the best represent me as a person. they refuse to let gender biases or cultural sterotypes prevent them from having fun and experimenting with things. i would love to see this thread get spamed with approval icons by people with plenty of alts. just so that the csm is forced to mention and possibly even define futanari. that in and of itself will be a huge step forward for the movement.
9/4/2010,"i say, this would be a fine addition towards the game if such huhm... futa was implemented into incarna. but you also have too consider a filter option for our younger pilots that of course are prestent too and would like to make use of the said bar.but i think this should be the responsibility of the parents or guardians too set a passworded safeswitch too disable the well... boobies he he.altough... a micro bikini would be a option too if all other things fail.(ps post belongs too hesphos, i messed up the character selection.)"

9/4/2010,"well, with the whole mechanic of you having to be docked to send an application to a corp, supercapital pilots cannot do it unless they have holding characters. now, some pilots just have alts designed especifically to fly the ship at all times, which means they can't join a corp. this is a bit game breaking, if you ask me. please support to bring this issue up with the csm and let's try to come up with some solutions!"

9/4/2010,"this is basic common sense, pilots need to be able to join a corp and it's not safe to leave the ship at any time, given the risks of theft/etc. supported."
9/4/2010,"poss are meant to be corp owned structures, not for personal use. plus, unless you give special rights to that pilot, anyone can steal the ship from the capital sma. stop being dogmatic and hating on supercaps because you can't have one. we're talking about a game breaking feature here. and ccp will not help you apply to a corp. so, you are required to trust another person if you don't have a holding character. i'm a pretty trusting person, but i don't really fancy lending a 30 billion isk worth supercarrier to someone i met over internet pixels, especially when ccp actively supports stealing supercaps. say whatever you want about them being overpowered, but if you were in one, you would think the same way i do.again, this is a generic situation, i'm not the subject of this post."

9/4/2010,"then remove load balancing from null/lowsec and make less pipe areas within lowsec and more connections to highsec to reduce gatecamps. don't nerf highsec extortion. a lot of ""griefer"" corps are former pirates (the ransoming kind, not the ones that call themselves pirates but are really pure pvp'ers) that figured out that there aren't that many targets in lowsec.make lowsec safer and highsec less profitable so that targets actually leave highsec and suddenly there'll be less griefer corps because they'll follow the targets again (l4 missions in highsec and t2 exhumers brought a lot of carebears from lowsec to highsec, but that was years ago; prior to that a lot of people ninjamined, etc.)."
9/4/2010,"4) make pve ships = pvp ships, cause we all know that pve already stand a chance chance against pvp that the fail pilots ninjing in highsec with scannign frigs and come back with a bc are just padding their killboard...or sockfluffing their egonot going to happen anytime soon. like after 7 years wasn't soon enough when the vast majority of the player base always return to the highsec mission hubs for a few weeks at a time before heading back out pvp and loose it all.5) change the eve community as a whole, so that there is less griefers and douchebags ect just because they can do it. after getting screwed over, your last ship was blow up, your wallet is empty from that ransom they didn't honor, you are podded, and now stuck in a 900k clone with 50+ million you cannot afford and zero implants, where else are you going to go to get away to start over again but npc corps because some can feck you over because ou have been wardecced for several weeks already in a pc corp. never going to happen. you might as well try to make ccp admit that sandbox for everyone is in your sandbox. makes you wonder why 42k active accounts at one time is considered ""successful"" for a niche game after 7 years and wow is still pulling strong (and i have never played that game because of its crappy comical graphics). i honestly think eve could of been a lot more successful (like 2 or 3 independent server clusters running 40k each in my opinion) if they had a more defined sandbox that didn't have a portion of the player base giving golden showers and mentally getting off on it resulting other player leaving the game in frustration just because you can do it. sure, its a sandbox. but its also a game and ccp could do with more $$$ from from a larger loyal player base instead of a small cadre of long time vets and a business model that relies on a fast turn over of new accounts that leave after six months."
9/4/2010,"because it's late and i'm tired, i'm bumping my own proposal. this proposal would go a long way to improving creative use of space. just think of the possibilities: if someone goes on a long winded rant about whatever topic (you just ganked them, stole their stuff, escaped their perfect camp whatever), you could now tell them to ""drop it in a can, son"". or you drop a can 100km off a gate and mr. super pro dram pilot speeds over to take a look see (because the can is now labeled ""secret coordinates""), only to open it a read the note therein saying ""did you know that cloaked disco ships have no targeting delay?"".internet space pilots need to express their creative sides as well!"
9/4/2010,"i'd like to use this thread to collect various complaints about the ""new"" sovereignty system that was implemented at the beginning of this year, including supercaps. i'd like to keep the complaints in this thread as general and high level as possible, so don't make posts for example about the capacitor level of some capital ship. also please don't ask for new features, i want to focus on things the csm has a sliver of a chance of getting to ccp about.also if you know about existing threads on the forums here that are relevant, please link them here so that everything can be looked at.here are some complaints that i've received to get you started:1. everything has too much hp and killing the things is soul destroying. for example sbu's and stations, etc. timers also make it really hard to take a system.2. supercap, jammer, capital ship inflation. these structures that are supposed to be big-deal centerpieces of an alliance is becoming a dime-a-dozen and perhaps the ship balancing ought to reflect that.3. outpost inflation. perhaps the balancing of outposts should reflect that eve will eventually have one in every single 0.0 system, and there is no way to destroy outposts and probably never will be.4. poses remain completely unchanged for years and still remain a vital part of claiming sov. this is stupid."
9/4/2010,"too much blue balling.i will elaborate. most battles, if people actually fight, are already decided. the game has reached a point, for a good while now, where it is just about numbers and ehp. sure there is the once in a while skirmish where the ship bonuses, pilot skill and fc tactic all came together to get the victory.95% of the time, two forces won't engage if they are outnumbered or if the odds are even between the two sides. they simply chose to not fight and run. i am in now way saying they are a coward. it is the way the game mechanics are. why take a chance on heavy casualties when you can just avoid the fight and lose nothing?so unless you are doing something that is a real threat like attacking an important pos or contesting sov, there is no motivation to fight when there is a vast amount of reasons to simply ignore them.there is only three things an attacker can do to motivate a fight:1. drop sbu's to mess with the enemy sov. which some people do not because they want that space, but to draw out a fight.2. siege a high end moon pos. again, knowing that if they put a tower there it will just get ultra bobbed and taken back.3. take out the station services. which is like seizing a tower anyways. and unless you plan on camping them in 23/7 they will simply wait till you are gone and rep it back up.that's it. all of those can only be done as major operations and require cta's which the enemy will most like have a spy and know about it anyways. in which case brings us back to the blue balling. if they can't get superior numbers they won't fight. same goes for if you can't get the numbers either.the only time you have to fight is if you jump into a camp. any decent camp has a scout so if they are there when you load it means your about to get ganked. if they are gone it means they didn't like what they saw and bailed. again, avoiding pvp.this post is getting really long and i'm sure people will flame me but i don't care and they can go **** themselves for all i care. so i will do a to;dr for the reading impaired.tl;dr. game rely too heavily on who has superior numbers and leaves no room for ship bonus and tactics involving them, thus causing fleets to opt out of a fight and run. also there is no small to medium objectives to make fleets want to fight each other.fake edit: i don't know why i bothered to reply to this. maybe deep down i still hope that the csm actually has some form of power with ccp and is not just some facade."
9/4/2010,"re: #3, one suggestion i've made is that a means of outpost destruction should be implemented which is just like construction but in reverse - i.e. self-destruct timer is set, outpost is no longer there after downtime. all assets within it are destroyed, and anyone docked or with a clone there is podded (and clone contracts are transferred back to corp hq, which is required to be in empire)."
9/4/2010,"last year,ccp stated that you will not be able to kill a station, but might put it into a state of disrepair that would take considerable resources to fix. unfortunately, they then decided there are more important things to do, and i can only assume that the idea of a damaged station have gone the road of 6 months past + 18 months future. super capitals have too many hp. carriers should not be able to get range bonuses to repairs without triaging because it promotes blobbing. ms shouldn't have them at all. it promotes more and more capital blobbing when you can spider tank. there's absolutely no senses to the 9 hr tcu timers, and 3 hr sbu timers. they do not encourage fights. it also doesn't make sense that sbu's go invulnerable w/o any means for the defender to kill them before a station/system comes out of reinforced. it just centralizes the time both sides have to be in a system. there needs to be a way to promote more fighting. also reinforcement timers are way too long. there's no excuse that the hub timers are more than 18 hrs, and the station timers are more than 24 hrs. it should not take 6 days to take stations... make it take 2-3 days tops. there was an almost identical problem with the old sov system and pos timers that approached 4.5 days... hence the reason and logic that they shortened it. so wtf did we go backwards there for. titans need to have a natural enemy that's not so clear, cut and dry as bring motherships. dreads have totally lost a role in 0.0 now. the answer is one i've promoted for a while, siege protects dreads from full dd damage. if that happens, then dreads have a role in general capital combat again. mix it with a nerf to mothership hp and rr, and a fix to carrier rr out of triage, and all the sudden, you have roles for all the capitals w/o making it capitals online. blue standings don't make sense. there is no excuse why you can immediately blue an entity or red an entity and make fleet combat so simple as shoot the red side. there needs to be an element of confusion about who are friends and who are foes in big battles. having blue and red tags removes a lot of the coordination that should be needed. i'm not saying get rid of blue standings, i do think it needs to be a function of something. that would actually be a terrific role to associate with a command ship or flagship. make it an element of fleet warfare that you could actually disrupt for the other side."
9/4/2010,"in the current state of sov warfare, an alliance should be esentially dead for a medium sized group of alliances to actually take it's space. it's a compilation of serious flaws that make the sov system the root of all that is bad currently in the game. first of all - cyno jammers were brought in the game with the thought of preventing enemy dreads from entering the system, while the defender is free to use carriers to support it's subcapital fleet(ok, maybe they had something to do with the aoedd too), not to force subcapital ships to fight 50+ supercaps, each one with 50 million hp and remote repping eachother.in it's current state, the game will soon be filled up with supercaps, we've already seen 100+ supercaps on field. you could fight dreads with subcaps before, but you can't fight 50 supercaps with subcaps with motherships raping your battleships and titans doomsdaying your hics. as a basic idea:i-hub is anchored at a pos, jammer is installed on i-hub. you set up a heavily defended pos to protect both the jammer and ihub - enemy reinforces ihub - jammer is down till i-hub is out.titans shouldn't be able to doomsday hics, t3s, logistics etc. fighterbombers should be less effective against battleships(aka not oneshotting them). dread siege cycle should be cut by half(same as triage).i-hubs should be easy to reinforce and a lot harder to kill, i.e. - reinforce with subcaps, but bring 100 dreads or tons of supers to kill. same with control towers. want to abort a supercap? rf the ihub while reinforcing the csaa pos, insure 30 dreads - come nuke the pos while your subcaps are fighting the defenders. or hotdrop their carriers/supercarriers trying to save it.too radical?"
9/4/2010,"ok first, before i get into the sov features...everyone saying nerf supercaps is treating the symptom instead of the disease. the problem w/ supercaps isn't their hp or damage, it's that they can be produced (somewhat) easily by the bigger alliances that have the resources. how long would a supercarrier last against 20 dreads? a couple minutes, max. that's balanced and it's where they should be. if you nerf their hp suddenly 5 dreads take out a super-carrier in 30 seconds and we're back to pre-dominion where they're worthless piles of junk. the problem is the blob, and that comes from too many of the ships in circulation. so fix the disease and nerf production, not the ship. it's only 30m/month to pay for the upgrade that allows the capital construction facilities, and you can have as many as u want basically. make it to where it's 10-20 billion a month to pay for the upgrade and you can only have one production facility per system. that'll slow things down and make it harder for players to get one, in addition to making each ship cost significantly more. (or my other suggestion has been you can only have a supercap facility if you control x systems, such as 1 facility per full region of control). other things wrong with dominion:alliance sprawl has not been reduced. making system costs more expensive might help with this.treaties need to be introduced, it will help in getting new blood into 00 (and could represent a new income stream for alliances). this will also help reduce alliance sprawl. there needs to be a reason to fight. it used to be moons, but not as much now. whether that means new types of resources added into different regions, access to different things from different regions, etc, there needs to be something that motivates players to go out and conquer systems other than just for the heck of it or good fights. the sov system needs to be tweaked. its a bit over the top to try and take a system now. not that i'm saying it should be easy, because it shouldn't be, but it needs to be straight-foreword and shouldn't require players to sit there for 3 hours shooting at an ihub or station or tcu 3+x a week (assuming there was a successful defense mounted) just to take over one system. then once u capture that system, go kill the tcu/ihub/stn/poss for the 20 systems surrounding it. it's a bit much all combined."
9/4/2010,"my problems with dominion sov are close to the op.""1. everything has too much hp and killing the things is soul destroying. for example sbu's and stations, etc. timers also make it really hard to take a system.""sove warfare is boring. huge hitpoints on structures equals huge blobs. and bigger lag. sov warfare is about as entertaining as operating a triple beam balance. sadly, it is also about that complex.the new system is designed so that you can have a huge climactic battle over a system with these timers, only the game is incapable of doing this (lag). on supercaps...welcome to nyx and aeon online."
9/4/2010,"i think one of the major issues is it's just too much of a ""war of the timers."" the defender isn't going to bother to show up to lose a bunch of ships against a superior force because it's just easier to show up and rep everything later. at the same time you can't just get rid of them all, because then the timezone problem only gets worse.the timers should be adjusted, but sbuing a system should do some kind of other damage, such as suspending all station services and infrastructure hub effects (except dock, and cancelling market orders.) make sbu's unable to be unanchored, so attackers have to commit and defenders have a reason to get rid of them. make certain outpost upgrades destroyable to allow for economic harassment and provide another impetus to defend a system (can you already do this? i'm not sure).i think the biggest issue, sov aside, is that really nobody has to fight for resources any more, anyone can upgrade their ihub and run plexes all day now, so why bother throwing away supercaps to take another system?"
9/4/2010,"i dislike two things about the sov system currently in place1) no small gang objectives. mainly a gripe with 0.0 itself, but you need a blob (100+) to do anything in sov warfare. i don't want to take over stations with a 20 man gang, but shouldn't i be able to damage the enemy a little bit? right now the defenders either dock up and laugh because you don't have enough to invade or they evac and run away because you do have enough people to invade.2) only a small amount of time determines the fate of sov. so if you don't control a system for 22 hrs of the day and then show up with a massive blob for the last 2 hrs and save everything, you get the system. massive fleet battles are awesome but if you don't play during the timezone when timers come out of reinforced you might as well not bother. i would like it to be a constant battle for control of the system culminating in a final massive battle instead of everyone sleeping and then alarm clocking for the reinforcement timer.but i'm also in the small camp that wants the mechanics to change to split up the blob ie multiple objectives for the defender so you cannot just blob defend one objective at a time. too much advantage goes to the defender atm.a good thread by mazzilliu! oh my. i bow you your womanly efforts, madam o7o7o7."
9/4/2010,"this is a csm proposal that asks the gm's to automatically reimburse game time if a character is banned due to an investigation and then later unbanned, after being found not guilty. this is the most easily fixable complaint i've gotten about the gms so far, although i don't know how widespread the issue is, there doesn't seem to be any systematic reimbursement of losses due to gm investigation at no fault to the player."
9/4/2010,do they really not do this already?
9/4/2010,"they do it, but i believe you have to pester them about it and it takes a long time. that is really unacceptable from a customer service standpoint, i know if i was any other company and i wasted the customer's time at no fault of their own i would automatically make things right. this really can be automated too. anytime a gm uses their little foamy unban hammer their gm tools could automatically reimburse game time based on how much time has passed since the ban."
9/4/2010,sounds good to me.
9/4/2010,"right now the self destruct mechanics are majorly flawed, motherships facing a handful of titans accompanied by motherships, carriers and a small support fleet can self destruct in 2 minutes.supercap caught by a bs fleet? no problem, self destruct.supercap caught by a sc fleet? no problem, self destruct.what i propose is that the standard 2 minute timer will still apply but only when unagressed. when agressed the timer goes from 2 minutes, to something a bit higher, like 15 minutes.something similar for logging where if you get shot while logged out in space, you get the regular agression timer which gives fleets with low dps the chance to give logoffski's.tl;dr - if agressed self destruct timer is 15 minutes, if shot while logged out in space you get 15 minute aggression timer.//i am terrible at writing, be nice."

9/4/2010,"if you spend the time to track someone down, running locators, and coordinating a trap with others, you don't want the reward to be the price of a shuttle. you get whatever's on his head, for the pod kill. that's what bounty means, and once killed there's no more bounty on that person.your suggestion only removes any incentive for bounty hunters, and maintains the bounty on the target after he's been killed. doesn't help bounty hunting as a profession, and unfair to the outlaw, who's paid his debt to society by being squished."
9/4/2010,including cost of implants into payment for bounty hunter solves problem of killing someone in shuttle and it still solves 'kill your alt' issue
9/4/2010,"i dont have a carrier or want to get one at the moment but an idea came accross to me when told that carriers and higher can only jump to diffrent sytems by using cynos, and are not allowed to use jumpgates.well heres my idea, why not let carriers, supercaps and titans use jumpgates, to make it easier for them to move around more, and so cynos are not made useless they could be used to move ships accross a bunch of sytems at once (as they allready can) this would make pvp battles a bit easier as carriers and titans can get to the rally points quicker using stargates without the organization needed for cynos in diffrent sytems only 1 jump away."
9/4/2010,"also, why don't we have caps in highsec? why don't we run missions with carriers? no."
9/4/2010,"so why does half of the csm not care about getting rockets fixed? i was told by one of them that it's not a priority and they're trying to talk the other half of the csm into dropping it. wth? obviously the csm member who was going on about how rockets are fine doesn't fly any rocket boats. why would he have such a strong opinion on something he obviously knows nothing about? i'll tell you why, he has other issues that he wants to push and he sees ccp devoting resources to balancing rockets as something that will get in the way. he even said so, himself. he wants to recommend that ccp not fool with rockets at all, but just leave them the way they are! come on csm, half of you are there only to serve your own interests, not to take care of the people who elected you. i know the delegate from my alliance argues with the rest of us on the forums. (we have a forum to give him input, but he shoots it down and does what he wants to instead, even if it's the direct opposite of what the majority of our players say they want.) i've seen threads where not one single person agress with him, but he stil won't back down. self service. typical politician. and this is why the csm is fail.this rocket thing is a big deal. hams actually have a considerably higher explosion velocity than rockets, at the moment. this seems like an intentional nerf of rockets. there is obviously some prejudice going on here. why else would this have been done? caldari's best small ship pvp was with rockets. now it's gone. (same with med and large ships regarding ham's and torps to be honest.) hams and torps have been nerfed all to hell, torps repeatedly over the years. rockets have been nerfed and then renerfed. ships designed to use short range missiles don't work any more. khanid and some caldari boats are seriously hamstrung. when i see killmail after killmail of vengeance's and malediction's with autocannon's on them (ships with rocket bonuses) something is terribly wrong. you just don't see the sacrilige in space any more. crows can no longer fit rockets. ham cerbs are a thing of the past. torp raven in your gate camp? maybe. maybe.we need to get more people into the csm who are there to be fair, not merely to advance their own interests. we need more people like vuk lau. and ccp needs to quit procrastinating and fix those damned rockets. if they ever intend to.btw....don't tell me that caldari aren't meant to pvp, or that theyr'e the pve only race. too many of us have specialized in only caldari, and heavily in missiles and now we're screwed. i need to train another race or buy another character if i want to pvp in anything other than a large fleet. bah."
9/4/2010,"caldari can pvp, but they have the disadvantage of using the two worst offensive weapon systems in the game, missiles and hybrids.missiles have been nerfed repeatedly.hybrids have become obsolete with the rebalancing that has been done with projectiles and energy weapons over the years.as far as rockets, yes they are broken. i don't understand why fixing the explosion radius is so difficult. how many man hours would it take to fix rockets? in ccp's eyes, too many?"

9/4/2010,can we have the ability to repackage stuff in a pos corp hanger please? can i have your stuff has morphed into where's my stuff. it's one of those little things that has gotten a bit too annoying.
9/4/2010,"as it currently stands now, in order to make a p3 or p4 commodity you're forced to micromanage multiple planets by freighting one commodity to the next planet, then the next unless you are lucky enough to get a planet that can provide all you need for a p3 (i.e plasma).take robotics for example. the only planet currently that you can make robotics on just by itself is a plasma planet. if you cannot find one of these, you are forced to manage a lava planet and a barren planet to produce the two separate commodities you need to form the p3. this is easily enough done. however, in order to make the final product you have to export one (lets say consumer electronics) from one planet to the next. the steps in doing so are below:current: route ce to launch pad. export ce from launch pad to custom's office. gather material at custom's office and transport it to the other custom's office on the main production planet. import ce from that custom's office down to the planet. route ce to robotics production facilities.not all of us (i.e. pvpers) have the ability to sit in system and micromanage pi like this. some use alts to do so, but then again some people don't have alts, or spare alts to use for something like this. my proposal is to automate the export/import process and add one small feature. the ability to export and import between custom's offices themselves. this would allow you to take the ce from one planet, export it to the custom's office and then export ce from that office to the other automatically. so it takes the current steps and does this:proposed: route ce to launch pad. specify how much to be exported/imported. ce is exported off planet to custom's office, and then exported to another custom's office in system where it is then imported to that planet's launch pad.main points:1. input how much to be moved from launch pad to custom's office, provided you had the room. pad: 10,000m3. custom's office: 25,000m3. you would need enough room to move between all four steps. i.e. input you want to move 5,000m3 of consumer electronics to x planet. you have enough room in both planet's offices as well as the launch pad, so there is no problem doing so.2. can only work for custom's offices in the same solar system. so you couldn't import something from one system to another that's one jump over.3. allows simplistic and time efficient ways to do pi without having to have specific alts to do so. enables pvpers who don't have the time to micromanage multiple planets to do so without having to transport goods or jc down to the set up system to do so.4. other than extractors running out and initial setup of colony, completely hands free."
9/4/2010,i can support this but i do belive a transportation fee should be payed for it. i also belive that shiping contracts to transport goods from one custom's office to the next would be nice too. much the same way players pay other players to move goods for them from one station to another only for pi and leting you ship them from/to custom's office. this would be a very good thing for transport people.but it's probly on the bottom of problems with pi right now.
9/4/2010,"eve recently got a huge problem with spies and thiefs who enter corporation and can by default access ship maintenance arrays. security system in eve for corporation management became a big issue. ccp should develop some kind of mechanism of security with more options to make a restriction to pos's and structures including possibility to specify namely who can access structure or who cannot. think it over, csm members and bring it to ccp."

9/4/2010,"maybe its because ccp boldfaced flat out told the csm ""frak off"" when it came to fixing major issues in the game that have been there since its inception.no major fixes or patches for 18 months to 2 years... its right there in the minutes in black and white.no offense... but anyone who misses that... has no business making statements like yours."
9/4/2010,"i am also looking forward to walking in station but i believe that there are a lot of things that could be fixed with the game the way it is today. once wis happens that will open up an even bigger can of worms that is going to need even more patches to get working. i want wis too but a also what blasters & rockets not to suck anymore, no more lag, and a whole list of other known problems fixed before more content is added. eve needs more quality not quantity at this point. yes i know itsa topic thats been beat to death but i dont care it still needs to be said. in eve terms ccp wants fly a bs without having the back up skills to fit one out properly. theres going to have all this stuff for us to do, but its all going to be half done and in need of work. support skills at lvl 1 as it were. never mind all the patches that wis is going to need... lets just keep pushing that backlog stuff back even further. :(yes wis will be cool... should it be put off till other problems are taken care of... yes."

9/4/2010,"this is what ccp is doing. using a rl analogy here from my work that we deal with everyday.im an auto mechanic. i fix cars for money. if you bring your car in to the dealership i work at and pay me to fix something. when you drop off your car you expect the problems to get fixed. if i charge you and the problem is not fixed you get ****ed and bring your car back and we then work on it for free till the problem goes away. (with in reason) work on it for free... not a good way to do business. not only are you not making money for working on the car the second time, you have ****ed off the customer and might not get there business after there car has been fixed right this time. add to this the loss of income from what else you could get work on when youre in fact still working on the car you never fixed right the first time. so youre losing money two different ways. this scenario is called a ""comeback"" and happens all the time in any shop. shops that have a lot of comebacks often go out of business because there (now ex) costumers are ****ed and they go to another dealership from then on. ccp (mechanic/dealership) is working on a car (eve) for a customer (us) and adding things to the car we don't need (wis, pi) instead of fixing the problem we asked fixed in the first place. (anything posted in this hall ;) at this point ccp is handing back the (still broken car) to us with the new add-on (pi, wis, & so on) not only is the car still broken but the new unwanted add-on is also faulty because its affected by the problem the car had in the first place. we might have been interested in the extra add-ons (called up selling) if given an option. we never got the option and instead of having the problem we wanted fixed in the first place we now have the extra (now) unwanted add-ons and the problems they cause. (bugs in new expansions)so to continue the analogy, buy not fixing the problems that eve has now, ccp is just ****ing us off to the point that we might go else were. i would rather have the problem with the engine fixed then a new shinny stereo and an engine that still runs like crap. a new stereo is nice, but if the car (game) doesent work whats the point. if your mechanic did that to you what do you think you would do? take it back right. we cant take eve back to some dealership all we can do is type stuff like this and hope ccp takes note. arnold predatorp.s.ask me if im ****ed blasters are almost useless for pvp? >:( but there is this new p.i. system that only kind of works..."

(and thats with low skills in subsystems) to scale that down to a t3 frig would mean that you would have cruiser dps from something flying at 3000m/s+ and still have the tracking of small guns/lasers/what have you. t1 frigs would pop just looking at a t3, t2 frigs might have enough time to worp out...maybe. destroyers would no longer be flown as they would be one shotted by a t3 frig. a t1 cruiser or bc would be a joke to a t3 frig as well do to dps out put and speed tanking.how would you fight against that... all ships would have to fit duel webs just to see the t3 frig much less hit it. i think a t3 frig would be too fast and too strong. yes they would be fun to fly but they would also make flying anything else ******ed as a t3 frig would gank anything in space. if too many t3 ship classes are out there you will get full t3 gangs that are invincible to anything other then other t3. here is a scary thought. a t3 frig getting repaired by a t3 sc that gets a bonus per lvl to rr amount. the t3 frig would be doing cruiser amounts of damage and the sc would be doing bs amount on top of it. get two or more of these teams together and you have a scary gang by anyones standards. everyone would run away at the sight of such a gang or die very quickly. the only way to counter a gang like that would be other t3 ships or massive amounts of t1/t2 bs or bc. it would be fun for the t3 blob, im not saying that it won't be but as a game designer ccp has to think about both sides of the battle. (keep people from emo quitting from being tanked from super gangs of t3) i think that t3 sc are all the t3 we need right now... they maybe even a little over powered in some cases (proteus with 3/4 million ehp)but given the huge investment of isk/risk of sp loss i think they should be head and shoulders above other ships. im working on faction/deadspace fitting my t3 right now... when its done i will have over a billion invested that i risk every time i undock. even without the faction fitting my ship cost 500 million to buy the ship itself and subsystems. a t2 costs what 1/5th the price for the hull and your done. you also never risk loosing sp when you fly a t2 ship either. so i guess my stance on this is keep a very limited number of t3 ships. make them super expensive and risky to fly so they don't overpower every other ship in the game. if ccp made a t3 of every class of ship no one would ever fly anything else... ever. i do not support the op in his wish for t3 frigs. in case that was not clear all ready ;)"

9/4/2010,"long time lurker, first time poster.let me preface this by saying that i am not against suicide ganking and think that it should at least be an option for players.what i would like to see is some form of kill rights for the ganked individual against the ganker. as it currently stands, there is little to no chance of getting some payback. as the ganker already has a 15 min global criminal flag, he's going to stay docked for that period and you're not getting a shot at him. how long the kill rights should stay active for is up for debate, but i like the idea of 1 or 2 days.the mechanics of these kill rights should be something similar to being flagged for stealing someone's loot. it should not be a free ticket to attack without the ganker being able to retaliate. if he brings neutral friends, too bad for you, go find some help as well.the second upside of this idea is that it actually creates more oportunity for pvp for people who choose not to leave highsec./dons flame ******ant suit"

9/5/2010,"k so we determined that blasters are a joke for pvp as you will never be able to make it to optimal before youre blown up. well i want to pvp and all i have is hybrid weapons left. lets see how railguns fare in pvp as its our only other option. 250mm railgun ii(3.3 x 24 / 6.375) (14400+12000)(79.2/6.375) (26400)(12.42)(26400)327888 weapon scoretracking 0.023heavy beam laser ii(3.6 x 24 / 6.00)(12000+8000)(86.4/6.00)(20000)(14.4)(20000)288000 weapons score.tracking 0.033so again the lasers are a better choice then blasters all around. shorter optimal, less damage, and worse tracking. no wonder railguns are called failguns."

9/5/2010,i have been playing off and on for several years (with different characters none the less) and i have yet to see ccp even make an attempt to officially support multiple monitors despite many users calls for it.see these threads:
9/5/2010,medium shader setting was removed because the minority of players used it and ccp claimed it would be too difficult to maintain such a feature for only a handful of subscribers. what makes you think that more players are going to use dual monitors than medium shaders (ex-medium shader user here)?

9/5/2010,great idea!+1
9/5/2010,"ok, you want high-level issues.1) timezone warfare. this is unfortunately a big problem where my corp operates - most of my alliance are us time, most of our enemies are eu. this way, everyone can just set the timers as necessary so that the important fights happen when the enemy is either sleeping or working/studying. of course, i know this can't be automagically fixed - there is just no good time when everyone can fight. ""recruit people in all timezones"" is currently an invalid solution too - why have 1000 people spread across timezones with, say, 400 on call at any time, when we can have all 1000 in the same timezone and just set all the timers so that it is good for us?i propose two approaches to this problem; but by no means they are to be taken as final solutions. just tossing some ideas around.approach a. currently, two (or three) engagements are needed to destroy a structure. the attacker chooses the terms of the first engagement, the defender chooses the terms of the second (potentially third). the catch - the defender needs to win any one of the engagements to succesfully defend. the attacker has no choice but to fight and try to win on the defender's terms, while the defender is free to just ignore the attack happening on the attacker's terms.you could try to change the mechanics around, propose more or less fights, but you won't change the fundamental point: what is to happen, if both parties win every battle on their terms and lose all the battles on the enemy's terms? if status quo is maintained (as now), the defender has an advantage, if the structure is lost, the attacker does. in either case, the advantaged party can simply choose to ignore the unfavorable fights.my proposal: continue the engagements until one of the parties wins on the enemy's terms. for example (a is attacker, d is defender):a attacks first, this is on a's terms. if attack is succesful, the structure is reinforced and will come out at a time of d's choice.d has to defend on their terms. if the defense fails, the structure is destroyed / taken over by a. if the defense succeeds, another reinforcement timer begins set by a.a has to try and attack again, and d has to defend on a's terms. if d wins, the structure is succesfuly defended and resumes normal operation. if a wins, another reinforcement timer starts on d's conditions.during the reinforcement timer the structure has to be rendered inactive, thus making d fight to reclaim it, not just maintain a draw. poses do that already (deactivating reactions, labs, etc.), perhaps ihub upgrades should cease functioning while the ihub is reinforced.one issue i see with this is that it slightly favors the attackers. if a stalemate is maintained, they do not gain anything, but the defender's infrastructure is hurting. and by the very nature of eve there will be groups that will reinforce stuff for no real good reason other than to f*** with the others.approach b. shorter, and maybe wiser. make sov warfare dependant not only on several key battles (although those could still be crucial), but on overal performance for a period of time. create temporary minor objectives for both patries to achieve from the moment the structure is reinforced to the time it comes out, and make completion of these objectives favor the better side in the final fight. or even get rid of that altogether, and simply proclaim whichever side accomplishes a predetermined number of objectives first the winner. possible strategies could be to lock the system down with a massive fleet for hours to complete all the objectives, to bring the fleet in at a time more favorable than the beginning and complete all the spawned objectives at once, or even run small gangs to complete the objectives behind the enemy's backs."
9/5/2010,"2) hard for small alliances to step up. first i have to say that i have nothing against large alliances, nothing against applying sufficient force to prevent a fight before even happening, nothing against massive coalitions controling several regions. if you can handle the politics, the military, the organization and the multiple industrial backbones needed, all the power to you. and i also agree that not every john doe should have a sov-holding alliance. however, there should be some way for startup alliances (a hundred to several hundred of players) to compete. and i of course don't mean taking over a region, only a system or two.currently, the only option such alliances have is to join one of the pre-existing power blocks. new powers no longer arise, they are only formed when the old coalitions are broken up. there should be a ""small league"" for alliances to start on their own.two notes. first, the amount of assets / space owned should most definitely not scale linearly with the ""strength"" of an alliance (or a larger entity). if a coalition of 2,500 people holds an entire region, that doesn't mean a 250 man alliance should hold a constellation. if it isn't clear, i propose a scaling way faster than linear. second, the dominion upkeep mechanics were a step in this direction; making unused systems unprofitable. and in my opinion, they are already showing results - it might have taken longer than some anticipated, but look at the influence map, especially in the south-east and north-west. the space is becoming more and more diversified; although as i said before - this is mostly a result of larger blocks splitting up.one possible approach: make the edge systems and regions much more valuable than the ones directly connected to empire space. the inner 0.0 should require constant maintenance and work to break even on the costs, while the edge should provide more than enough resources - if you can utilize them. smaller alliances could occupy the inner worlds, which would be too unprofitable for the large power blocks to care about. (note: am i proposing a restricted version of sovereignty in lowsec now?)3) little to no assets on alliance level; none at higher levels. maybe a little away from the topic of sovereignty; but this is another thing i think needs to be looked at. there are currently no assets that truly belong to an alliance itself, and no in-game authority. everything from poses to outposts always belongs to an individual corp, and the alliance authority is the executor corp. many of the existing assets even don't allow alliance usage - see smas, chas, industrial arrays, cycling cynojammers, fueling jump bridges, etc. etc. this makes for quite unnecessary leadership problems, where alts are necessary for even very simple actions, just because you need to be in a particular corp.second, in the current political situation, blocks larger than alliances are forming up (see the influence map again). apart from blue icons, fleets and several outpost settings, there is absolutely no way to accomodate these pacts. all of the assets could use a ""allow for positive standing"" option. example - pos forcefields, jump bridges. passwords to these should be only used to allow foreign entities access, everyone who is already considered friendly should have access by default."
9/5/2010,"first itt to mention lag i mean, dev blogs about how they ran windows update on the server and it updated successfully are incredible and all, but let's see some actual resultsthe role that lag has played in every sov fight since dominion is absolutely pivotal and simply cannot be overstated. if you want to defeat your enemy: blow up his ships and take his outposts or moons. if you want to utterly destroy him and ruin his will to fight: kill him before he loads grid, while he's blackscreened, give him 3 minute traffic delays when using a gate, and bore him to death with module activation and targetting delays that make chess by mail look action-packed by comparison. once ""not enough"" people show up for your cta, you have no choice but to give up, and let the other side spend hours wailing on your ihubs (lucky them).yes, they're working on it and ""taking our concerns seriously."" great. this still has to be said, because it's true and it's extremely relevant. i like this, except i think timer #3 should be rand(). i, too, am sick of getting jabber pings for <<good fights>> from russians when i'm waking up in san francisco.sov structures have way too much hp, there are too many timers. i don't fly caps so i don't consider myself qualified to comment on the balance suggestions (except to say that they sound very well reasoned).relatedly, amarr ships have a huge advantage in shooting-giant-structure warfare because you can afk with them. drones are okay for this, too, but rails/proj/missiles all suck. note that this would be fixed by one of the csm proposals to make ships resume firing at last target after auto-reloading.when sov structures get hit, why not automatically reinforce the node? how many systems are in serious danger of changing hands in a given day?most of all, though, it's just straight up not fun. i think there's too much of a sense at ccp that tedium and monotony are valid tools for game balance. ""well sovereignty is really important so let's make it a huge pain in the ass to fight over. we don't need to worry about whether or not the fighting itself is actually fun because people will do it anyway to increase their internet spaceship wealth and power."" see also, pi. can anyone point to a recent sov change that was a result of a hard-fought battle? i can't. afaik, in the south, hta failcascaded and disbanded, and the russians waltzed in. atlas was defending c-j in insmother thru 7 or 8 rf timers, and then failcascaded when they got hit in their home systems (which they didn't put up a fight over, calculating the odds were against them anyways). i've been in geminate, taking stuff from the russians&pets that they don't seem to care about now that they have insmother back (no fights to speak of, just hours of shooting 22m hp ihubs). it's entirely possible i'm mistaken about this, so someone please correct me if i am.i am very concerned, however, that devoting any resources to this might slow down the development of the wod alpha, or even (god forbid) dust."

9/5/2010,"the legitimacy of this argument depends entirely on your goal.if your goal is to destroy the ship in question, congratulations, you succeeded. quit yer *****ing.if, on the other hand, your goal is to collect kill mails and stroke your epeen with them, bring more guns next time - or shoot something smaller."

9/5/2010,"i like pvp, unfortunatly at the moment by the time you get to a tower thats under attack, it's reinforced... or the enemy brings enough people to make it so the server is stressed to the point where you cant jump reinforcements.poss arent vital to taking sov anymore, except maybe for the pos that they anchored the tcu at. buffing them would just make them last long enough for people to mount a defence of them. if they were successfully attacked, the increased hp on the batteries would make it harder to repair them. if theres more chance of being able to defend a structure, then theres probably more chance of the enemy actually showing up to fight when you siege the tower."

9/5/2010,"i'd like to point out, i just got my first ever mail in 5 years notifing me that my account will end in 6 days, because i used a plex. a few days ago, before i made this post, i received a mail stating that my re-sub failed due to lack of funds.while email notifications are helpful, i am not going to log in to my email to see if my sub is about to end, nor should i have to view my account status via account management (especially when i run multiple accounts).i should be able to see that my sub will end in 7-10 days, every time i log in during that time frame, until the game time is greater than 7-10 days, across all of my accounts.p.s.: thank you for the support csm's, hopefully this can become priority #1 for ccp, asap."
9/5/2010,"perhap's ccp, assumes you know you have too keep paying. they may even assume you realize it's due every 30 daysthey probly don't realize some people need a mommy, daddy, and/or someone too hold their hand through life"

9/5/2010,"didn't you just make a proposal about not having any more proposals? if you make a proposal about not having any more proposals, then your proposal is invalid. if your proposal is invalid then people can still make proposals, which in turn means your proposal is acceptable, but if your proposal is acceptable, you're still proposing that there be no more proposals... well... we're talking in circles. interesting paradox, but no support :)"
9/5/2010,"if people yelling ""they fix nothing"" have played the same game i have since beta will know that is just bull****. they have fixed googles of things in this game. yes there are some problems but the game is very stable and i have ran into no game stopping bugs. ccp has worked hard to make this a great game and i for one get tired of hearing ""my pet issue isn't fixed yesterday"".i have after reading these forums for 2 days find csm system to be rather silly.walking in station is bad? wtf people have waited 4 or 5 years for such a thing many people. yet all we hear is csm and thier groupies cussing ccp. sure ccp needs a proding sometimes but this csm system is silly.you don't speak for the player base you speak for a minority.get over yourselves.the devs have fixed tons of things all we hear from the csm groupies and csm is that they fix nothing. i call bull****.one thing off the top of my head lag, manticore, stability, markets."
9/5/2010,only in your mind. put down the bottle.people can make endless proposals but thankfully ccp ignores most of them.
9/5/2010,in that case...take your own advice:i call bull**** on you pal.

9/5/2010,"well i didn't know about that thanks for the tip, but you can't change your speciffic overview tabs and with possible lag when you undock .... well you know what can happen . and you still have your drones that you just bought in station to put in the right group of drones."
9/5/2010,ughh... not again
9/5/2010,"sadly, ccp has forgotten all about pos-es a long time ago. they don't care about small corporations that just got into 0.0, and they don't care about people living in w-space.it's all good and shiny for mega-alliances holding whole regions and multiple stations though.give pos-es some love, please."

9/5/2010,"corp theft is a cool and almost unique game mechanic. nerfing it would make eve less of a harsh universe and more of a candyland where everybody holds hands, sings, and makes isk together in highsec."
9/5/2010,"correct. but there should be a setting between ""you are on your own"" and ""go ahead and take one of each, free of charge"". especially in pos hangars and arrays, it's an all-or-nothing deal. infiltrating a corp and causing major damage should be something that takes :effort: and :time: invested to get to the high-ranked positions, not equal to gaining lowest level access.if someone works their way to director status without anyone noticing, and one day rides off with the contents of the corp wallet, blueprint hangar and several faction towers, congratz to him. if a new recruit who wants to store his ratting drake automatically gets access to the entire tii fleet, that's bad game design."
9/5/2010,"...no, its not recent. deal with it like the rest of us.bienvenidos a eve online"
9/5/2010,"i see many t3's running missions in low sec as well as plexes. they are far from useless which is my point tbh. if i could scan wrecks i'd not complain, but most know not to use drones even because they are scannable....."

9/6/2010,"the fact that a workaround exists is not a valid argument against streamlining it. it should not take a disproportionate amount of effort (and, more significantly, risk) just to do something as mundane as joining a corp."
9/6/2010,"search for the corp of interest. do show info on the search result. on the info window, there's a button to apply to join, now.not sure if you can use it from space, though, or if you'll get an error telling you to be in a station, like so many other things, but it's worth a try."
9/6/2010,"supported. im much more interested in newer players being able to get into the game fully more quickly, than the effectively abstract concept of lvl5/+5s characters fractionally catching up with older players with only lvl4/+4s over an x years timeline of strict focused training regimes. i'd rather play eve than evemon."
9/6/2010,"short: nolong answer: nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooothis discussion has been going on for years alsways with the same arguments- new players hate it- old players forgot about it- players that have maxed it dont carefirst of all the new players that dont like to skill weeks and weeks for the rest of their eve life for a certrain purpose - this is not your game, move along.this game is all about having to train weeks and weeks and weeks for certrain ships/mods/stats/aspects. learnings are a part of this very concept. you cant grind it and you cant get a premium account. so as i said move along nothing to see here. eve is the only mmo that has this concept and if you dont like it there is something else for you out there.also these are pretty much the only skill that will help your throughout your whole eve existance. other skills might be helpfull to but learning in general will always be helpful.as in my times as a recruiter and mentor for newer players i told new ppl that it would be smart to have learning from the start up - but not everything we do in life is smart. so i told them get to a ship that will be handy for a few days and then train your learnings. also learnings are a good time to sort out where you wanna go, in eve there are tons of possible ways and finding the right one for you will take some time.in general eve training from time to time is pain in the ass. depending on how long you are in the game the pain differs, at the beginning a few days are a pain, then two weeks are a pain, then you get to the point that you dont care how long it takes cause its waht you want to learn.new players dont need to train learnings. at some point it might become handy, but before that you can easily train your first cruiser and do whatever you like. you probally lag the money to but one but you can train one, lose it and be frustrated about it and leave the game after 2 days."
9/6/2010,/signed
9/6/2010,"they're kinda unnecessary. the less time spent preparing to prepare to play the game the better.i support attribute implants though, because they provide a carrot-and-stick to get enough money or lp for them and such. however, i would happily compromise and get rid of those if it meant we could axe learning skills"
9/6/2010,"keep in mind that the csm is a representative body, not a blind conduit for direct democracy. as such, several csms felt that an extra step was needed to insert csm input into the prioritization process. you will note that i made sure that the results before and after the csm input were made public, to ensure transparency.as this was the first time we had done crowdsourcing, we were experimenting with the process. in the second crowdsourcing (ui low hanging fruit, just passed) we used a different method; we just subdivided the list based on how many csms +1'd each idea, but within each sublist the items are in player priority.also, remember that csm often has extra nda-sealed information about certain issues that factor into our decisions.this backlog prioritization only covered items that had previously been passed by csm. i am sure a good proposal about fixing hybrids (more than ""fix hybrids!"") would be an interesting one (if i've missed one, please point me to it).the csm is also currently in the early stages of developing an action-list of game balance issues; more on that will be made public sometime soon, i hope."

9/6/2010,"+1.and thanks, dierdra."
9/6/2010,"getting into t2 small autocannons also gives you the prereqs for t2 small artilleries. getting into t2 rockets does not give you the prereqs for t2 light missiles. you'll still have to go spend several more days training standard missiles skill to 5 if you want the t2 longrange counterpart. so, training t2 guns of any race in general is faster than t2 issiles, if you're talking both long and short range variants, which people who specialize in this weapon type will want to train."
9/6/2010,rocket ships not sucking would be a very nice christmas present ccp :p
9/6/2010,"i support this proposal. i've supported this proposal for a very very long time. this is a good idea, it doesn't affect the mineral markets, and it gives a higher end goal for miners beyond hulks. mining is not a mini-profession. it deserves more end game content (like combat currently has), even if it's just bigger ships that don't mine any faster"
9/6/2010,why? hulk mines good and tanks good as well.no need for a bs sized miner
9/6/2010,"the main incentive for me would be longer range (comes with larger ship), and increased cargo bay. drone capabilities are nice. i'll never turn down extra hitpoints either.since i want longer range and extra cargo storage, that implies a bigger ship. the rest just kind of falls out as an appeasement to the masses to not upset the mineral markets. down cries would be the lack of empire ganking capabilities against them. but again, the same argument would hold for why you can't gank level 4 mission runners in empire when they're in bs's."
9/6/2010,"from my point of view it looks like the op wants a miner that can tank and repel most rat spawns in 0.0.the only downside i see to this is suicide ganking miners becomes harder, oh noes pirates lament.... i see nothing wrong with giving miners a shiny new toy, hell if you want to do the most boring thing in eve there have to be some perks to it."
9/6/2010,"despite my aversion to mining, i see no reason why t3s shouldn't get mining subsystems."
9/6/2010,"i like the idea of a heavy-tanking exhumer with an ore bay for null/low, but there needs to a tradeoff between survivability and mining yield. limit it to two strips and, in return, give it +2 warp strength like the skiff. add strip gas miners and gas bonus if the devs are feeling generous.edit: this ship might be a bit overtanked in high-sec -- it's an ""i win"" button against hulkageddon. it might be wise to restrict activation of its strip miners to low/null-sec."
9/6/2010,"but there are already battleships in game and most of them can use 7 or 8 miner 2s and you can use drones to defend yourself.increasing efficiency of mining won't improve gametime but can only lead to minimizing dependency on others as everyone would be able to mine most of minerals they need.in my opinion adding mining barges and exhumers in the game was bad decision as it pretty much eliminated frigate, cruiser and bs mining.what is the point of having nice mining bonuses of frigates (like navitas, tormentor and others) if pretty much nobody is using them."
9/6/2010,"perhaps variants.. one that has +2 warp strength and 5% shield resistances per level, 3 highs, can only mount 2 strips, 10k ore bay, 2k cargo, 75m3 drone bay, 5 mids, 3 lows.one that has 4 highs, 3 strips mountable, 20k ore bay, 2k cargo, 150m3 drone bay, 6 mids, 4 lows, +200% strip miner and survey scanner rangeone that has 3 highs, 3 strips mountable, 40k ore bay, 500m3 cargo, 50m3 drone bay, 5 mids, 3 lows, mackinaw bonusesthey're for people who cannot fly exhumers, etc yet.i made my first million in eve jetcan mining in a navitas."
9/6/2010,it sounds like we're talking t3 mining subsystems :d
9/6/2010,"just for my understanding:1. a proper fit hulk can already tank 0.0 belt rats2. you got 5 hammerhead iis for your own defensethat sounds plenty for me.so the only reason i can see why you want a drake like tank, that you might survive pvpers, that come along, long enough so reinforcements can arrive.but imho ... some guards should be on grid all the time. teamwork and such."
9/6/2010,"i went down the miner's path for a while myself, 'tis true. a bs-sized ship with strips would have been such a joy at the time....what i see in the here and now is a (ahem) slightly overpowered frankensteining of the hulk, dominix and a marauder/orca.rokh, apoc, hyperion. done right, they'll get close-ish to the hulk yield, but with much better tank. yes, the cargo hold is lacking, but that's the trade-off."
9/6/2010,"i'm well aware of this, i have a hulk that can tank 3x guristas bses and the tank costs less than the hull.yeah but the existing t3 miner proposal i saw quite frankly sucks."
9/6/2010,"and you could shoot them at other races to coat them in duct tape, also, at which point they'd be effectively morphed into minmatar ships as well."
9/6/2010,"coating other ships in ductape would be the offensive use of these launchers. it would act as a permanent webifier until the ship was repaired at a station (station only, as no actual damage would be done). the signature size would remain unaffected, but there would be a chance for fire, as ducctape glue if i recall is flamable when heated (duh...(. this fire would cause thermal damage (reduced by normal resistances) over time, and would burn off the ductape, eventually removing the web effect.full support sir!"

9/6/2010,"like spiderman 3 blasters? >.<observe how quick it was to give us the 100k sp when the servers were down that time... this time you just set it so that each sisi mirror gives the pilot 5m instead of 100k. it's hardly incarna.i support this thread. would be very nice to try-before-you-buy alot quicker, would give fairly new people such as myself (9 month old toon) more scope to see what they should train for first, and would let me have alot more fun when i head to fd-mlj :dalso third page snipeedit : hellyeah!"
9/6/2010,100% support behind this idea. it would be nice to swap out subsystems from a orca parked in a wh safe spot.
9/6/2010,"as i understand it, one of the ""awkward"" parts from ccp's side is how to change the model while in space.one solution is to have the t3 surrounded by an opaque cylinder (silver or whatever) during the subsystem swapping- may require clicking on a different fitting screen to activate. ""access subsystem maintenance field"" or something. when finished, cylinder disappears, and new shape t3 is visible.fairly crude method, but it would work.i wonder what the new ""motherships"" can do- as they're supposed to live up to their name more than the ex ones did..."
9/6/2010,"title says it all. it's unique, and super cool. it should also be updated for the trinity graphics.as the argument for removal was lag, leave it a setting to be turned on and off (like turren effects etc - off reverts back to current animation)please support bringing back one of the cooler effects of eve."
9/6/2010,"totally agree the, ""older"" effect looked so much cooler."
9/6/2010,"agreed, capitals should have some stronger effect when they jump in, not like all of the other ships in the game."
9/6/2010,"i think my biggest issue with this whole this: jump portalsit's a portal generator, not a 'blup' jumper. make it open a portal. make it cool. make it real. please fix this, the old animation was well worth the client-lag (which as i posted earlier, could easily be turned off if you made it a setting). if needed, and actually would be quite nice, have a whole new tab in settings labeled misc settings - move the turret effects, camera shake - everything 'misc' setting related to this tab."
9/6/2010,"at the moment logistics pilots are a bit on the downside when it comes to killboard stats. those stats are a bit superificial but one wants to see what he has done in his endeavours. currently logistics need to killmail***** either via failfittings (e.g. one cannon instead of a remote repairer) or by drones which easily fail and need extra concentration and attention. since logistics pilots are an integral backbone of most fleets i think it could be a nice thing if they got on killmails of people they repaired during a fight. e.g. ""gustav guardian"" repairs ""bob battleship"" bob battleship then kills a scorpion. on the killmail of the scorpion our logi pilot gustav guardian would appear under the participants who killed the scorpion. this would probably get them on relatively many killmails but i don't see a problem with that. logistics pilots are often primaried, can't really insure their ships and have a less laid back job than the casual grunt who only shoots at a primary. this can of course be modified to lessen the amount of killmails they would get on ""passively"". for example by adding a certain timeframe in which the repaired ship needs to do a kill before the logistics isn't added onto the killmail anymore. (for example the 15 minutes of the aggro timer which probably covers a normal fleet fight, if there are downtimes with waiting at pos or gates every engagement would probably be it's own fight)i think this would make the job of the hardly sought after logistics pilots more comfortable and reward them a bit more for allowing the whole fleet to move out and have fun. summary: logistics pilot should get on killmails by repairing friendlies not by shooting with one useless gun."
9/6/2010,"this would make the pilots strife to be good logistics, not km-*****. therefore i like my idea and support it!"
9/6/2010,"not supported at alli fly logistics and definatly do not need to be on killmails because i repaired someone.just live with the fact u can't km *****, and using drones doesnt require any attention just assign them to someone.."
9/6/2010,"the logistics pilots that can maintain concentration while repairign and whoring on km's successfilly is the better pilot, lets not try to make people lazy now. either you use drones or a small gun on your ship whatever, it's not an issue. i don't recall letting anyone die because i was too busy assigning my drones to a cepter or shooting someone else while repping a broadcast. it's fine as it is."
9/6/2010,"i would support this idea, if logistics get aggression counter just as the shooting ships at the same time.and then ask yourself if you want to loose your ""can always dock/jump out"" capability for killmails."
9/6/2010,this.
9/6/2010,"hmmm, sounds suspiciously like my reply in a similar thread from a while ago .. you plagiarising me darius? @op: interdictors asked for bubbles to get them on mails and ccp traded the mails for aggression. read what darius asked and consider your answer very carefully .. price may be very steep indeed."
9/6/2010,"i am bringing this thread up again in hopes it will get csm attention. maybe we can even get a section on 0.0 in the next csm meeting (minutes). i do not think nullsec is broken right now - it is fine, it just could use a few improvements to make it awesome. i am not supporting for any of the concrete ideas in particular, just supporting holding this discussion.i strongly disagree. this means that the deciding battle (assuming the attacker wins the first on their terms, and the defender wins the second on theirs) is decided by pure chance. this should never be the case.depends. for smaller alliances, i agree it can take hours. but for the current forces, the structures are gone so fast that mounting any counteroffensive when you get attacked is futile. i can not think of a way to change this so that 50 man fleets could destroy the structure in a reasonable time, and yet 250 capital fleets wouldn't just blast through it. and i am not sure this would even be beneficial.everybody is different. for some people, mining is fun. for some people, running missions or higsec anomalies is fun. i can't stand either of these, but for me holding 0.0 space and fighting for it is the best fun i've had in any mmo so far. in the end, there is no way to create a single mechanic that would be ""fun"" for everybody. but if sov warfare is not fun for you, nobody is forcing you to do it. eve has a crapton of other content - empire, missions, trading, wormholes, exploration, piracy and much more. and if you can't find anything of this that would be fun for you - why do you play eve?we had a fight in rorz-h a few days ago, i believe there has been a report on this on eve-news (or what's the site). ignoring the epic lagfest it was, we (the nc) have had about 1.5 times the enemy numbers, but we were overcome by superior fleet composition and tactics. good fights to everyone involved.that being said, hovewer, i think few people realize that in eve, most fights aren't won or lost on the battlefield. many times, they are won long before the fight even starts, by the alliance which can produce a better fleet, recruit more skilled and experienced pilots, or infiltrate the enemy and know how to counter their attack before it happens. if the enemy fields 100 ships, we don't have to field our own 100 and defeat them, risking huge losses. if we are large enough, we can simply bring 200 of our people, making the enemy not attack at all, and winning with no casualties.this is one of the things i love about eve - even if you are not any good in direct combat, you can still significantly affect the outcome."
9/6/2010,"historically speaking every time ccp nerf hp or makes something easier to kill you just see already obese coalitions grow to cover the hp.the problem is and will always be the diplomacy, if people are so intent on comparing rl to eve then the diplomacy should be identical too."
9/6/2010,"proposal: as it says in the title, move -all- supercapitals to nullsec, do not allow them to jump into lowsec. give carriers another type of jump portal useable in lowsec, because they have the capacity to help with actual logistics.or just move all capitals to nullsec, either way. it would give lowsec a chance at being populated because people dont like being hotdropped by eight titans in a battlecruiser or some such stupid overkill.edit: look at the population of wormhole space. look at what is lacking in wormhole space: supercapitals and hotdrops. theres a reason it thrives."
9/6/2010,seriously?
9/6/2010,"catiously supporting moving supercaps .... true is that moms are overkill to anything u can field in lowsec. other option is to allow bombs (low sps can fight back the supercaps) or dd in low, but then it will turn hell on eve :)."

9/6/2010,"supported, provided the below.strip sc bonuses, similar to the dd strip. make sc's only able to launch (+1 drone per level - like a carrier) 10x fighters, and no bombers. this would still allow super caps into lowsec for logistical purposes, but render lowsec combat of super caps useless/pointless, as it should be."

9/8/2010,"i helped ccp with the new sov mechanics when i was in the csm, and they used a few of my ideas. i do have a few complaints about the current mechanics though, as follows:1) missions can't be run in sov space. the idea for an outpost upgrade which broadcast to an agent of a given level equal to the sov level of the system the outpost is in was a good idea, and would allow mission runners to have an interest in alliance sovereignty, as well as supporting the alliance in question.2) there's no reason to hold intervening space. if an alliance holds a few valuable systems, they can just hold those without worrying about the systems between. my ideas were to have local be delayed except for the controlling alliance (making intel far easier in your sovereign systems), and to increase the price per jump from your core system/nearest outpost.i had all these mechanics and more worked out in a massive document, but the data is somewhat antiquated with the advent of dominion and tyrranis. i'll try to revise the document and post a link to it when i get the opportunity and the muse. until then, supported."

9/8/2010,no. diaf. fueling dozens of systems would be a nightmare. i would rather do faction warfare than be faced with something like that.
9/8/2010,yes! bring the fueling back but! introduce fuel cells that are made from ice products and from planetary ones1. having to fuel tcu and ihub would make it much harder for even big alliances to hold large amounts of systems 2. it would make it possible isolate a system preventing it from getting refueled and thus the tcu going off linealso harassing a alliance by attacking its transports could lead to the alliance giving up on some systems3. it would lead to alliances having chains of system rather than some spread out single ones and all that would lead to less systems occupied and better chances for small groups to get into 0.0to make it fair though i would say ihub and tcu can both hold a week worth of fuel which should be one whole freighter of fuel cells for one system with hub and tcu

9/8/2010,so the story goes something like this. i was looking into capitol ships and thinking of getting a carrier and came to the realization that one silly little interceptor can pin your multi-billion isk capitol ship with no chance of warping or jumping away. now this offends me on a couple levels but the obvious isk based ones aside the main thing that bugs me is that ccp has gone to great lengths to prove just how different these two modes of travel are (warping and jumping) and then plop down one modual that disables both.so what i am going to propose is to grant all jump capable ships a resistance to warp scrambling moduals but to be applied only to the actual act of jumping. once scrammed or disrupted or bubbled they cannot warp just jump. then tie this resistance to the jump drive calibration skill granting a +1 at level 2 and +2 at level 3 ect... so that at level 5 you could still jump if you were warp scrammed by up to 4 people but the 5 one would nail you. now before the waling about unbalancing begins i believe that due to recent ccp changes to jump drives you can only jump out of a system to a another system. no in-system jumping is allowed any more so there would be no easy escapes for stupid pilots you would still need to be smart and have friends. also as i mentioned before ccp has gone to great lengths to state how different these two drives are.jump drive back story

9/8/2010,"less dps comes with more range? if you want to trade range for dps, fly a proteus. and why are we comparing cov op fits for ehp and dps?"
9/8/2010,"you're forgetting that the medium neut also creates some kind of ""damage""."
9/8/2010,"why do i get the feeling ya'll think the maller is a fantastic gank ship? look, they both have an ew bonus when configured like this. the legion gets neuts, the proteus gets tackle. it's basically equal although different (just like the arazu vs pilgrim). both are equipped so as to dictate the range of a fight. the fact that blasters are shorter ranged isn't really relevant. since the legion lacks a weapon bonus (a cap bonus is not a weapon bonus), you could throw blasters or ac's on with no penalty.if you throw neutrons onto said legion, the dps goes up (at the expense of range), if you throw ac's on, the dps goes down slightly but you get selectable damage type (similar range, better tracking, no cap usage). what i'm really arguing here is the 10% cap usage bonus should be removed from the game. but i've thrown that idea out before and it's typically shot down by 2 month old characters flying bs's in lvl4's who are worried about cap stability. so i limited it to the legion.as is, the legion with the cov ops subsystem lacks the dps to kill anything even with neuts. if you make proper usage of the neut bonus and turn it into a gunboat pilgrim, it does about 150 dps with 3 medium neuts. a pilgrim with 3 neuts does 240 dps (hammerheads) for comparison and can select damage type. the proteus on the other hand is a great solo gank ship with that setup. it may not have neuts, but it actually has enough dps to break something. and that 20km scrambler is pretty handy too of course. getting it into optimal is no problem.hopefully that fully explains it. everyone i know who is amarr spec'd thinks the cov ops subsystem for it is crap compared to the other races. and that's why i really didn't bother to explain initially, i thought we were in unanimous agreement that it needed to be changed."

9/8/2010,"i am a max skilled legion and tengu pilot, but from the dps side the legion cant really keep up with the tengu. even when both use 3 dmg mods and 5 launchers. for me it seems the legion has a dps problem in general, not just with the covert ops subsystem."
9/8/2010,this is a duplicate thread on the same subject. you may further your discussion on this in this thread:[issue] the eve font
9/8/2010,omg!!! why isn't this woman in jail and not just banned from an online game?? it's a travesty of justice i tell you!!!
9/8/2010,"there are several csms for whom this is an area of deep interest; meissa and i had a wonderful argument about possible ways to break up the blobs over a dinner at the summit, for example.in the short-term, however, ccp is currently focused on beating back the lag-monster and getting it locked back in its cage, but i think they realize that longer-term, game-design changes are the only way to prevent fleet sizes from ballooning (as i put it in my election manifesto, ""fleets grow to fit the lag available"").when ccp starts feeling more comfortable with the progress they are making on technical lag-fighting, i hope they will be amenable to some serious discussions about game-design (especially sov) changes, and in particular that they will reconsider a suggestion i made at the summit - that they endorse the creation of a csm-run focus group of experienced nullsec strategists and fcs charged with coming up with some serious game-design change proposals."
9/8/2010,any news on a release date?
9/8/2010,"the current draft of the report of on the august planning meetings was discussed during the sep-05 csm meeting; you can read the raw logs of the meeting for the details of the discussion.a vote on whether to release the report was called; it failed 3-6.at present, we are working on a revised draft, which will be discussed at the next meeting, which is this weekend."
9/8/2010,"i find this voting result to be really saddening.it makes me wonder why you go all the way to create such a list, ask players for input and cycle it through ccp when the reason for not releasing the result is ""because it might change before release"".that is always the case and can never be excluded.following that reasoning you should never release any information of any kind until it is released by ccp themselves.you weren't afraid to show that ccp was unwilling to commit any resources to your suggestions during the summit, but now you are afraid to show what ccp was willing to consider from this list because ""it might look bad"".what has changed?"
9/8/2010,"trebor daehdoow,thank you for your job.don't you think that ccp is now using this point to discredit your work ?we all wait from this report. if we can't have ccp view it's not a problem but we want to know your view. even if there is blank line where stated : ccp don't give information.ccp is now a fat real life isk company we can't expect them to listen to their customer anymore.but more csm meeting notice i see without meeting minutes less i trust in your work.even if just point, please 1 meeting = 1 minutes.yeay"
9/8/2010,"more likely then ccp getting in the way, is other csm members not getting the bigger picture. at this point it doesn't matter how much detail or content, what matters is that we see progress. if y'all want to wait for big stuff or deliverables, you can wait 18 months, this still is ccp. they are improving tho, but yeah those two interviews from mr. ward and mr. carriers really bleeds that at that level they just don't get the troubles. i still can't see ccp getting in the way tho. but yeah, if some csm vote against because they want to see stuff complete, they are delusional. this is step by step, and you can't leave gaps.maybe some csm members are just wanting to put the pieces in order for their campaigning that will probably start to begin again at the end of the fall. that is more likely, combined with at least a few of them being caught in awareness of ""omg but this isn't fun, there is no drama"" just put it on a blog or something. do like hilmar does, sidestep chokepoints, you know he wants you to."
9/8/2010,"first of all, when i said ""we"" are working in my previous post, i should have made it more clear that ""we"" = ""the csm"". several of the delegates who voted against the release of the current draft are contributing to a revision.so, while i totally understand the concerns being expressed here, i would counsel patience until after our meeting this sunday. i am hopeful that this will all be resolved by then.i recognize that sometimes the pace of events is frustratingly slow, but this is in part a consequence of the fact that csm is an evolving institution, and in particular now that we have stakeholder status (because of the hard work of csm 1-4), there are process issues we are having to work through -- which is a good thing, if you think about it in a long-term perspective.with respect to the minutes, doing edited minutes for these bi-weekly meetings was a fairly big undertaking; i did the first pass on several of them, and it's multiple hours of work. given that relatively few people read the edited minutes, and instead prefer to just browse the raw logs, teadaze decided that it wasn't worth the effort, and tbh i agree with him. i for one would rather spend the time researching ah proposal threads and massaging them into shape for discussion at a future meeting.if there is a particular thing in the raw minutes that you need clarification on, i am sure that i or another csm will be happy to oblige."
9/8/2010,"thank you.personally a meeting minutes like this would be good for me:- point- topic summary- decision summary- csm next action + date- ccp next action + datethe points, i feel the ones i'm interested are the harder ones :- ccp official answer on the backlog priority and a planning of bug resolution.- is ccp confirming after your prioritisation exercice that they don't resolve any bug or focus on quality prior 18 month ? (means the forum voice is not judged relevant.)yeay"

9/9/2010,if you trust the group enough to want to apply then you should be able to meet a ceo or director in space and have an option apply / be accepted in space right by them.and it isn't always about it being a personal asset or corp asset. sometimes we personally pay for the equipment we want. and if i pay the fuel + materials + time of usage + i have the char to build it + i buy and anchor the structure to build it. then it is mine and not the corps. i may lend it to the corp but it is still mine.
9/9/2010,those saying store it at a pos clearly do not understand the situation. if one could store his super cap at a pos then he is probably in the corp he wants to be in.what if someone was in an npc corp (kicked and petitioned by kicker) what would you have him do then.obviously there are workarounds to these issues but none of them are very appropriate. i see no (non-technical) reason a super cap pilot or anyone for that matter should have to be docked to join a corporation.
9/9/2010,"you should be able to join any corp if you are within 2500m of a station, same as jump range and just about every other environment controlled transfer."
9/9/2010,"due to the above issue, you can't join that corp yourself, and when leaving ships at towers that belong to alt corps of ours using the password, i've had those ships ejected the next time i enter space since they still belong to me and i didn't have time to enter the pw before the pos reacted."

9/9/2010,"war decs as they are, are unfair. some industrials (like myself) don't want to be wardecced, though it is okay to be wardecced, 5 million isk is an hours work for me. so in theory i could war dec someone for a week in less than a day. the price should be something that you're corporation can't maintain so the war doesn't keep going forever.completely supported."
9/9/2010,"then hire mercs or pay the ""griefers"" to cancel the war. a lot of newer merc corps who are trying to build a reputation will even do it for free if you pay the dec fee."
9/9/2010,"an hour? an hour? you're doing it wrong if it takes an hour to make 5 million isk. war decs could be priced based on the difference in average character age. people should be able to toss war decs at corps with older characters or characters as old as their own easily. i'm okay with making it significantly harder for old characters to grief noob corps.complaints might be raised about people stuffing their corp with noob alts to bring down their average character age. sure, it may decrease the war dec price a bit, but it would take a lot of noob alts to drive down the average age in a corp with a single 3 y/o character to make it comparable to a corp with a handful of characters a few months old."
9/9/2010,"you mean the ""at least 2 scanning alts always present in a inhabitated wh system""?those you use only to scan your way in and out? and, btw, that percentage is based on activity, not number of logged and unlogged people present in system.so it is 8% of all logged accounts."
9/9/2010,"excellent question and it would be perfectly valid if the ships they were supposed to hold down were as rare as was originally intended.unfortunately that ""solution"" became obsolete when super-capital drops grew to contain 10+ super-carriers plus an assortment of smaller ships (usually carriers ).since ccp knowingly let super capital proliferation get out of hand, i think it only prudent that they take steps to insure that the rest of eve are not made to pay for their ineptitude."
9/9/2010,"drop your own capital fleet on them, problem fixed"
9/9/2010,"you know how you fix that? let the alliances join fw. there are a few alliances that are faction specific and had been formed eons ago with anticipation of fw. they are usually the ones doing those cap drops. if they are in the militia, each militia will have a relatively healthy cap fleet and you will see that drop off or end in even cap battles. it won't be on the scale of 0.0 by any means. still baffled why ccp hasn't allowed this as it seems to be the easiest fix to the problem."
9/9/2010,"i was unaware that ch, it, -a-, hydra et al. (the usual suspects when it comes to low-sec drops) were created to participate in fw the purpose of this exercise is to have less capitals in low-sec, not more so i don't really see how allowing alliances into fw would further that goal.but sure, let them join. just leave all sovereignty at the door on the way in"
9/9/2010,"... but i thought you lowsec'ers keep complaining about a lack of people coming into lowsec?can't eat your cake and have it too, ya know."
9/9/2010,"having super caps in low sec is more a deterrent to the newer players, which low sec needs, than it is for the older bored alliance players who would be kept out by the super cap ban. supported as long as dreads and carriers get to stay in low sec"
9/9/2010,"lowsec alliances cannot produce supercaps, therefor they shouldn't be allowed in lowsec. it makes perfect sense.yes, i'm sure people always complain about a lack of nyx traffic in their system. i mean, who doesn't love to see a half dozen carriers with a supporting fleet get driven off by one or two bored nullbears?"
9/9/2010,"super caps need to be allowed to jump in to and exist in low sec space for the purpose of traveling to an another area, so i don't support banning them completely, however, supercarriers should loose the ability to deploy bombers just like titans can't use dds.low sec should be the middle ground between the no capitals low stake pvp in high sec and the high stake super capital warfare in 0.0."
9/9/2010,i am just looking for a simple change. a little checkbox in the survey scanner window to use 'overview' settings.when mining with crystals - you only care about certain types of ore - not all of them. would be a 'nice to have option' if this is a very simple change for ccp to implement for us miners.cheers'
9/9/2010,"supported.idea worth considering would also be to directly integrate the survey scan into the overview (e.g. as a new column labeled ""yield"" or w/e)."
9/9/2010,sounds good
9/9/2010,sounds sound.
9/9/2010,"agreed - not least due to the fact that for several classes of t2 ship there are no bpos, most notably jump freighters. also, if you want to build one of those at a pos, you're currently forced to build the t1 freighter there as well, because there's no other way to get a packaged freighter into a pos array."

9/9/2010,"a shy proposal on how to get logistic ships more in line with other ships and game mechanic.atleast i is a bit sad over that me as a logistic pilot dont get the glory to brag over how many kills i have made. my role in a battle might have been what tipped the win in our favor.1. a logistic pilot do never get any kind of aggression timer. he can in high, low and 00 sec space always dock/jump after he have repped anyone around him.2. a logistic pilot in high sec that rep someone that is at war with another corp will be flagged to that specific corp. and therefor be a target for the hostiles in that specific war.3. a logistic pilot can rep and take part in a big fight but do not get the credit of being logged about hes actions, therefor not shown on a killmail. ----my proposal is to make logistic pilot 1. get aggression when repping a aggressor. ff guardian pilot put reps on geddon pilot that is shooting a raven pilot. the guardian pilot will be logged as aiding a aggressor. he will get the aggression timer and need stop repping to be able to dock or jump.2. when a logistic pilot is logged as aiding a aggressor and therefor get a aggression timer he will be shown on the killmail as ""support to aggressor"".exampel: pilot a get tackled in a belt by pilot b. a fight starts. pilot a screams for help... pilot c undocks in a logistic ship and warp to the belt and starts repping pilot a. they manage to kill pilot b and on the killmail shows that pilot a have shot pilot b with xxx ship xxx weapon etc. and also it shows that he had the support of pilot c in a logistic ship.this is to aply in all kinds of space.high sec - a logistic pilot will get aggression timer if he put reps on someone but he wont get concorded. but he will be flagged if the person is at war.low sec - logistic pilot will get the aggression timer that prevent him from dock/jump but he wont get shot by sentry's and be public flagged. but he will be flagged to everyone if he reps and outlaw. if he reps someone that already got a aggression timer to someone he will be flagged to that corp/alliance (like in high sec with war deccs).00 space - same rules as in low sec but there are no sentry's or outlaws. so just plain aggression timer that prevent you from dock and jump.---this is a rather old topic to speak about so i bet some similar ideas are out there. i dident even look at page 1 if there was a thread about it already :)"
9/9/2010,if he gets an aggression counter he should get sentry aggro. no special case.and you really shouldnt be that lazy. from page two: linkage

9/9/2010,the reason it takes over 45 years to learn every skill is so that no single pilot can use everything. what your suggesting is wrong on so many levels and could seriously help to endanger specialization. i suggest you find contentment with the fact that your character advances even while you are not playing.
9/9/2010,big no.
9/9/2010,"/signedon one hand, traders and pirates would reap the direct benefits. the indirect losses, however, would be dispersed among the mission runners and the miners. it would either force them to go to good markets for their intended merchandise (either low-priced ammo, or high-priced ores), or buy/sell them in safety near their farming location. i approve.however, i also feel that multiple currencies, while an interesting change, would be overkill and annoying."

9/9/2010,"as far as cannon goes, both warp drives and jump drives are the same thing and operate on pretty much the same principle (they create ""mini-wormholes"" and ""tunnel"" through space-time). the latter is simply bigger and uses different graphics/methods of presentation (i.e. ""jumping"" is simply a ""long range"" warp that bypasses stargates).throw, even a small, a monkey wrench into either a big machine or a small one and you'll get pretty much the same result.not supported.edit: just remembered that supercaps are immune to normal warp disruption (you need a hic to pin them down). i assume that is the a gameplay mechanic so you can rationalize it any way you want it."
9/9/2010,"originally i was spending about 5-6 hours a meeting editing the minutes (though with later meetings of csm4 the number of issues under discussion dropped and so there was less to edit). officially only the raw logs are required to be published but i aimed to provide a meeting summary as well as tl:dr type results. due to changes at work, i've had far less free time to spend on csm and what time i have has been taken up with the increase in communication with ccp since the summit. robert has helped prepare some of the minutes, but he is currently busy editing our csm ""dev blog"" (which is taking shape nicely thanks to the time he has put in).but enough of my excuses because the raw logs alone are not a very quick overview of the meetings, i provide voting results on the csm database as a replacement to the old tl:dr minutes. i plan to back-fill the missing summary minutes in december when i'll be unemployed and thus have lots of time to spend on this stuff, but for now the priority is voting summary and raw logs for context."
9/9/2010,inappropriate posts removed. constructive comments will be appreciated.
9/9/2010,if you don't fight back you get a month of killrights. the only problem is that people recycle the ganking alts (even if in theory it is an exploit) and you rarely get to get your revenge.the few that don't recycle alts generally gank for 1-2 days and then go to 0.0 for a week to recover their standing. in high sec you rarely get them in something kill worthy.
9/9/2010,and the characters that aren't recycled usually spend most of their days in 0.0 or low sec anyway.
9/9/2010,issues must have been in the assembly hall forum for at least 7 days prior to a csm meeting for them to be added to the agenda. however if you can get enough supports it could be considered for a future meeting.

9/10/2010,"reasonable points.something else just occurred to me. what if the display was limited to the currently selected ship, plus all the ships you have locked (both in space, and with the additional info in a halo around a smaller ship badge in the list of locked ships)?there has to be a way to limit the amount of information to prevent clutter, and in the heat of battle, doing a lot of display selection isn't going to be optimal anyway.let's work on clarifying various approaches over the next two weeks, so that i can raise it in the csm meeting at the end of the month."
9/10/2010,"to avoid clutter, instead of graphics and icons, use a simple segment i don't want to see where the locked ships go - in a frig once i lock them everything is decided anyway. i want to understand at a glance what the whole enemy blob is doing. speed vectors are perfect why do you not like the idea? is it too simple? the simple ideas are the best ones.moreover, it blends well into the currently existing tactical overlay, and is a lot less onerous a work for the devs."
9/10/2010,"the display selection bit is done before battle, exactly like you twiddle with your overview settings. you probably don't want to see this for your fleet, for neutrals if you're in highsec, and pods. you want to see it for war/fw targets, and neutrals in lowsec and highsec. woot!!! \o/"

9/10/2010,"fully supported!only problem would be: how to make the technical side work fast enough to make it worthwile? if a ordered pizza has three weeks delivery time people will die.how about making a contract-acceptance bot (ccp can do this and are allowed to) where, after finding your order number on the ordering site (website would be a must here) you contract your plex to this bot with the order number in the subject line. secure (if people are smart enough to copy-paste the number) and cheap in manhours.alternatively, ccp can make a in-game cross between the direct-trade and fittings window. also: next kestrel to drop a bunch of plex in jita means pizza for the entire gang."

9/10/2010,i dont know who we are talking about..but
9/10/2010,"i'm sorry but it is hard to take you seriously, and others like you, with a name like that. especially on the issue of maturity."
9/10/2010,because letting you drag parts of the game to a different screen would be all that hard.... just have an option that extends the game window over both screens... one is the space view and the other is empty and can hold what ever sub screen you want. yes it would take a little work but not all that much.
9/10/2010,"while i support what you want and multiscreen features are and have always been part of my csm agenda i believe anti is also right. in saying that, theres no reason why we can't bring this up again, and again, and again.please visit your user settings to re-enable images.come to daddyif i ever meet apple she gunna kill me.-t'amber"
9/10/2010,"because allot of people have dual screens and those that don't might go out of there way to pick up another screen to take advantage of eve adding this functionality. ccp will have some kind of reporting software built into eve which will tell them what hardware and settings people are using so the medium shaders decision was probably researched and justified. not sure if they can do the same with dual screens but that information can be found out from the steam hardware reports which is used extensivly by allot of developers/publshers to follow trends.besides, dual screens in eve would be fricken awesome and the single best addition to eve in a long while. better than walking in stations anyway."
9/10/2010,"ok, ok,... if it makes you happy i'll vote.(fake edit: i saw a vid from 2009. fan fest showing that ccp is working on multi-monitor support.)"
9/10/2010,"(edited 09-25-2010 to include player-contributed suggestions)it has been a long standing wish of many eve players that the design of player owned stations be revisited. however, it should be clear to everyone who is not actually a dead horse that this is unlikely to happen soon.i would therefore like to kick off a discussion with the goal of identifying small, hopefully easy to implement tweaks to pos mechanics (aka ""low hanging fruit"") that will at least ease the pain. this should include not only new items but also gather in existing csm proposals.my current ""cunning plan"" is to finalize the list in the first half of october, then crowdsource priorities in time to propose to the csm at the end-of-october meeting.current list of suggestions:* relax range restrictions inside pos shields; if you're in the pos, you can interact with all the pos modules, move stuff between them, etc. if possible, this would include onlining and offlining.* pos fuel warning evemails should tell you how many hours of each fuel component you are running out of.* fuel pellets -- perhaps as a new output of pi (but requiring some components that cannot be produced on planets)* remote refuel - grabs stuff from corp hangars; limit to regional range (or system in wh-space)* all pos modules should be nameable (or at least a damn code number on them so we can tell corp hangars apart).* manufacturing modules should be able to accept inputs from, and deliver outputs to other modules. even something as simple as ""if there are insufficient materials in my hangar, grab them from this module"" would permit simpler pipelines and easier remote management. or more simply, some sort of remote-move-between-modules interface.* anchoring/unanchoring queue.* fix ship hangar bug that sometimes leaves original ship in space.* view blueprints that are in structures in space via corp assets and science & industry interfaces.* review and revamp pos permissions, please.* jump bridge tolls* reduced time for anchoring, onlining and offlining.* update reaction linking interface to be more pi-like.* repackaging in corp and ship hangars.* personal divisions in corp and ship hangars; corp divisions in ship hangars.* access controls at tower-granularity.* access and use controls based on standings.* improved anchoring ui.* courier contracts to and from pos locations.* menu and ui improvements to make dangerous actions harder to do by accident (aka, ""ooops, i offlined it again..."")* improved reactions ui; show timers, what silo stores, etc.* show pos cycle timer.* list of ammo in all guns.* make refining arrays and t2 ship arrays useful.* don't show items in fuel screen that the pos doesn't use.* allow csmas to be anchored without sov (or at least in wh space). note that csma != csaa!* cache passwords on client.* allow multiple players to anchor and online at a pos at the same time (aka ""wham! bam! thank-you, gang!"")"
9/10/2010,"supported, couple of nice ideas.what might also come very in handy would be an anchoring/onlining queue and/or onlining/anchoring modules without sitting within 2500m of them.also, purely aesthetic though, i'd suggest more variability with module anchoring spots and orientations. currently it's rather difficult to build an even remotely pretty pos as all modules are pointed in a different direction, and the distances between the mods need to be rather big to ""avoid clipping"", even if there'd actually be none in the current spot. so a more advanced collision control would be nice."
9/10/2010,great ideas to streamline pos management.supported
9/10/2010,"yeah anchoring/unanchoring queue is a must, we lost way too much time waiting for the previous thing to be ready to be ready to activate the next one.allowing things to be done at more than 2500m would also be very welcome.dunno what would be fair, be having to move an orca 500m because he got bumped while wanting to fuel the pos, and putting items on the corp hangar is a pain.at least give us 5000meters.also there's still the strange bug with the ship hangar ; you can take a ship at 3000m, but if you're more than 2500m (and sometimes you even need to be 2000), your current ships won't be stored.a 5000m range here would be a good thing, we're on the bubble anyway so no risk from outside... it's just to save time and pain.for the name, something allowing us to see what modules it is when we're clicking on the manage tab would be welcome.it can be useful for example when onlining things, as if you have more than 1 of the same module you don't really know which one it is.same for pos guns, without name we dunno which one is it, and even to make a name we need to know xdgive us an effect on the target our mouse is on !some more infos, like for example distance of the module may be useful.also i may simply don't anchor things at the good place, but the bumping / stuck problems when our ship is near some modules is a real pain.i suppose i'm not the only one having my ships stucked on a module while launching warp ?as i'm on w-space, i may need to warp in any direction as the new sign can be anywhere, so i can't think about that while anchoring modules... because the random position of sign will make any position a potential target for the warp.btw, talking with pos and wh, think about a word for refitting of tech3 ships ;)"
9/10/2010,"automating parts of pos-based industry is a good idea in principle - i think it's reasonable that people should have access to the same sort of flow control as they already do for moon mining. this reduces the amount of work people have to do, but increases their risk exposure, because they have more stuff floating in space at once. however, when there are so many possible configurations, there's the potential for all sorts of interesting bugs to spring up (e.g. the one that resulted in vast quantities of advanced materials being produced out of nowhere).don't we already have renameable structures? last time i checked it's possible to name labs, but are other structures not so flexible?additional request: let people view blueprints that are in structures in space via the corp assets / s&i window, so that jobs can be started remotely. otherwise, all the other remote management features become much less useful for people who don't have access to blueprints in an outpost / station in the same system."
9/10/2010,"i would not support the ""remote refueling"".i want some pos's to run out of fuel when im in a wh.the fact that someone can auto refuel them from a far i would not like."
9/10/2010,"i think we need total pos reweiv .including modules rules etc.see ""pos dead horse"" tread.as for changes supported."
9/10/2010,"i agree, make it regional. you can interact with the pos if you are in the same region the pos is."
9/10/2010,"well it would be a tech 2 ship, so i'd make it more expensive than a hulk. probably another 25%-50% of the price of a hulk. naturally this means there would be a much weaker t1 variant as well that would have to be made."
9/10/2010,"would rather see a t3 ship that can fulfill multiple industrial roles. if current proposals aren't good, improve them. i don't think we need any more static sub-capital ships. t3 ftw"
9/10/2010,yes
9/10/2010,"t2 is already meta 5. t3 i assume has a meta level, though i'm not sure.in any case, supported."

9/10/2010,it's unavoidable. you need some kind of income to keep pvping in anything better than t1 ships with crap fits.
9/10/2010,"grinding is the main focus of his game, not a means to allow him to be able to afford to pvp.also, if you hunt juicy targets, extort carebears, etc. then pvp is profitable. it's just that some l33t pvpers look for ~goodfights~ instead of piracy."
9/10/2010,bump.op updated. please bugreport it whenever this issue occurs to get it to ccp's attention.
9/10/2010,"before i state the desired changes, lets look at the issues with the oneiros. compaired to it's only competitor for armor logi's, the gaurdian:351 lower base armor1 less low slot2 less high slots3 more mid slotsa bonus in tracking enhancers that has no relevance to logistical effects at all.14.3% higher base signatureabout equal base capacitorhigher base speed by 5 m/s20 lower scan resolutionthe most noticeable problems are the lack of tank slots for what the ship is designed to tank. it's an armor logistic that's got a higher base shield than armor, and a higer count on mids than lows. it also suffers from a much larger sig in addition to it's other defensive weakness.additionally, the guardian get's 2 bonuses that directly affect the role of the ship... armor and capacitor. the oneiros relies heavily on wasting it's extra mid's just to support it's capacitor requirements, again, a waste of it's bonus to tracing enhancers since you won't have the slots for them.======================so the proposed changes?reduce the mid slot count by 1, increase the low slot count by 1.reduce the sig radius by 5.change the tracking links bonus to a 5% per level effective boost to remote repair amount. add 5 base speed.===========================by limiting the changes to those proposed, the guardian still has a much larger base armor, lower sig, same low slot count, higher capacitor potential.oneiros get's a choice with the additional low of more tank, or more capacitor repairpotentially, the oneiros gains effectively +1 repairer worth of remote assistance with max skills while not costing it any more capacitor. in regular combat/fitting situations, this makes it a better repair ship.the additional 5 base speed gives it a better possibly of speed tank, while continuing to have the higher base sig and lower base armor."
9/10/2010,i support this change
9/10/2010,"support of courseif you think making those changes makes it at all the same ship as a guardian, then you're f-ing nuts. learn about ship and fleet mechanics and fly the different ships before making silly statements. if you're going to be so negative against ccp's use of this forum, then quit ****ing up my thread. as much as i have issues with ah, at least i put in the effort to help ccp help the game, even if not all ideas are liked."
9/10/2010,i support this change
9/10/2010,i support this change.
9/10/2010,"fly a guardian then. what's keeping you? it should be easier than proposing changes towards the effect of pushing ships of different races together, making them the same ship with different names. it's not as if ccp even bother reading those things."
9/10/2010,"the problem is not trying to make everything the same, because its not, but it should be on the same level as other logys."
9/10/2010,"yeah, right now the onieros sucks. the cap transfer bonus on basi/guardians is pretty out of control.this would be fine.alternately, they could rework the ship to be more of a general purpose utility ship (amp up tracking link bonus, maybe add a projected eccm bonus or something). i'll think about that more in 18 months. meanwhile, this would save me from having to crosstrain amarr cruiser 5, so, supported."
9/10/2010,not supported.scimitar and oneiros got their roles.
9/10/2010,not empty quoting.the only change i would consider supporting is switching the tracking links bonus to another beneficial module to differentiate it a bit from the scimitar.
9/10/2010,"after some of your previous wonderfully misinformed post on things you thought were actual facts, why don't you toss up some defined examples of oneiros roles so that we can be sure you're upholding your wonderful intellect."
9/10/2010,i was going to call him out but you beat me to it. nice job op.
9/10/2010,i'd rather have a 5% cap recharge bonus so you don't have to fill all the mids with cap rechargesbut i'm happy with it as long it makes it better
9/10/2010,"on the other hand try dualboxing a kronos/mega with an oneiros running two or three tracking links and enjoy the insane tracking of your big guns.the oneiros does seem to have a fairly gimped amount of armor/grid and of course the lack of a cap transfer bonus does make it less viable than a basilisk or a guardian... but those tracking bonuses can be very handy if used correctly. ideally, i'd just like to see the oneiros get more survivable and a little less tight on the fittings for its intended purpose."
9/10/2010,and that is why i do not own one...it needs to be fixed.
9/10/2010,"gtfo.shield tanking armor logistics is fine. okay for me if you do all the other stuff, but stay away from its mid slots."
9/10/2010,"the oneiros can be unscannable, unlike the guardian.... it still doesnt mean that its not the worst logistic...the scimitar works because the scimitar is fast and small, the basilisk/guardian can have a buffer tank with circle energy transfers.if the oneiros had less mass and were more agile, it might gain more acceptance in hac gangs."
9/10/2010,"^thisjust because a ship's perks doesn't fit your needs, and you're among the majority, doesn't mean it needs to be changed into a copy of another ship that does fit your needs. if the guardian fits your needs, then fly it. how are you entitled to mess up the onieros for the people that do take advantage of its perks just so you can get a guardian with a different name and save a few days of training?"
9/10/2010,supportedits bloody annoying to get kicked out of a fleet if they have asked for armor logi's because your in an oneiros
9/10/2010,"if they kick any logi at all then the fc needs his head examined. it's an ominous sign, you wouldn't want to be in that fleet anyway."
9/10/2010,"this^^~on topic~i fly an oneiros i must say that its not the best logi, tracking links are never fitted (or shouldn't be >_>) and its a pain to get fair cap stability with mwd + 3 large reps + 1 med (good luck fitting 4 large reps and have them running for more than 2 cycles, unlike the guardian)needs to be buffed, and get rid of the useless tracking links."
9/10/2010,"as already pointed out, carebears use tracking links, as well as unscannable fit, and shield tanking armor rep ship. so, they're not ""never fitted,"" just rarely. a minority of people depend on oneiros being what it is. it's not fair that they get screwed just because the majority want it to be more like a guardian. if you want guardian, then fly a guardian. if you change oneiros into a guardian, you'll have 2 guardians and those who want oneiros will have nothing."
9/10/2010,"all logistics are unprobable depending on fit. this in no way changes the oneiros into a guardian, it just refocuses it's effort on what it's used for 99% of the time anyway.oneiros still sufferes against neuts, still has a higher sig, a lower armor, no cap x-fer, and a totally different use for it's slots. you can still get insane tracking buffs even w/o the boosted tracking link effects from normal tracking links. yes a lot of fc's turn down oneiros in fleets because they are a weak link. any competent enemy will immediately take them down, just like we experienced tonight... lost our oneiros immediately, guardians survived. just because you don't like the facts doesn't mean the ship doesn't needs the change. you want tracking links, in your own words, train for the scimitar.... fix the oneiros."
9/10/2010,"why do we want to relax the term limits? sure, it's good for the csm members. it's good for giving them time to push the game in a direction that's beneficial to their own particular interests and playstyles. but is it good for eve?there are what? 300,000 accounts now? i'm not sure how many individual players that is, but it's a lot. why do we need the same 7 or 8 people over and over? why would we want it?the big alliances already have the obvious advantage at election time and thus on pushing game changes that favor pushing more people into 0.0.i say 2 terms, period, and you're done. that's my suggestion. 2 terms in office is plenty for anyone. oh...i know mm was upset when vuk couldn't run. they had to find someone else to run, because they had to have a member on the csm, which underlines my point exactly.relaxed term limits are in the best interests of a few. i'm certainly not one of them. 2 terms!"
9/10/2010,"maybe that sounded a bit too harsh, but point being that having a strict rule of 2 term limits is a very good idea, imo, unless the playerbase is happy with two or three select people having longterm influence because they're in positions of power in some of the largest alliances in the game.that could pretty much become a legal, public version of the type of influence bob was accused of in the past (true or not), that got everyone in such an uproar.diversity is healthier. besides, it'd be nice to see things get mixed up a bit."
9/10/2010,i was never in favor of unlimited terms.supportedps: at best should be at most 4... but no more than that.
9/10/2010,"not supported.for one reason, the time it takes for ccp to get their act together and the hazzle of new people to understand the process. it takes more than 2 terms for issues to be resolved, which means too many frequent changes disrupt workflow."
9/10/2010,"not supported.i don't see how limiting them to two terms will have any positive impact on csm representation. if they're doing a good job representing the eve players, or at least a sub section of them, they'll get voted in again, if not someone new can replace them. let the player base decide.as for the alliance comment, limiting players to two terms will have no impact on the influence of big alliances... they're big.. they can put someone else up to vote for and represent their interests."
9/10/2010,"not supported. we have term limits already; they're called elections. everyone is going to get a political powerbase from somewhere, those 'big alliances' you fear will simply field someone else if their motives are so cynical, by proxy if need be. alliances and players come and go."
9/10/2010,fixed your post.
9/10/2010,fit a target painter or use dronesno kill mail with no agreshion timerthink of hi-seck
9/10/2010,"actually... thats more than correct! i don't see the problem with aggression. it would bring logistics more in line with the rest of the game. if you rep someone you get on the same aggression counter as he is. (therefore you can jump gate after 60 seconds of the last guy you repped ceased firing). fleets with bad discipline would suffer but i can live with that. it is still more than worthwhile to encourage more people to fly logistics and to add some reconition to the important life-savers that are logistics. to adress some comments: my guardian will never have a gun nor a target painter. it has reps, energy transfers and eccm+afterburner. drones will not get me on most killmails because the bigger fleets in my alliance simply kill primaries off before the drones even reach it. most capital killmails are doomed to fail due to smartbombs. not to forget that i don't have the time to lock up friendlies and enemy primaries/secondaries at the same time in a big fleet battle so target painter wouldnt work anyway except for one random target.serverload: long shipnames probably create more serverload than a true/false state of a logistic as a supporter. then again: we are here to tell ccp what we would find cool, they will think about the technical side of it and decide whether or not it is doable.""irrelevancy"" of killmails: actually, they are at least a bit important because if you want to get into pvp corporations people usually check your killboard. it would be really nice to actually have prove to be a dedicated logistic pilot except the fact that you probably have mostly logistic losses. the people who care about killboard stats get satisfied and the people who don't care still don't. killboards will never cease to exist. that's probably for sure."
9/10/2010,"i would also support it if they got aggression for it. this would also help solve neutral repping. two birds, one stone."
9/10/2010,"how about adding ""warp to"" and ""dock"" to the right click menu for research agents in the journal?"
9/10/2010,"why stop with only research agents? this should be done with all agents, whether in the journal or in people and places.otherwise, supported."
9/10/2010,raising this for the next csm meeting now. if bunyip links his document later on i'll see if there are points in there i can include with the discussionsi read all the points and included the ones which are the most common complaints that i hear. the vast majority of these statements in this thread i agree with wholeheartedly. i rewrote them to emphasize the complaint aspect and not request specific new features.
9/10/2010,"one of my complaints is that ccp seems to have either forgotten this thread or chosen to disregard it. there is a lot of constructive feedback and suggestions yet the last post by a ccp dev/employee was regarding the deployment of dominion 1.03 (see post #185, by ccp incognito on jan 7 2010, page 7).while complaints regarding fighting for sovereignty come up often (especially points #2 and #3 in your op), i would also like to bring up the upgrades mechanics : they should allow more people to live off the same fully upgraded solar system. while ccp's original ""hundreds"" estimate is too much of an utopia, the current amount is little on the low side.edited for support"
9/10/2010,"why is sov needed to be something that is based on system to system.why can constellations and regions play a bigger role.everything fails with sov just because the numbers that fight over them at one place is to much. it should be pointless to bring 300 vs 300. dont allow that since the server cant rly handle it at this moment. there are no real individual skills in taking part of those fights. sure a fc can do a great job and take the right decisions but pilots need to have a bigger say in performance how the battle is to progress.so fight over a constellation and several sites at the same time.well that wont work since some alliances can field 300 ppl and will still blob the whole area instead of one system. tho it will spread things out and create a different type of battle. attack a constellation and you need to have active presence in every system or key systems for a period of time. this means that defenders can concentrate on disturbing that.well wont that be unfair if xx alliance spread out 300 ppl in one const and the defenders can go to only one place with 300 and wipe out a small fleet. probably yes, but how about forcing the defenders to split up to gain the control of the constellation again.a constellation that is taken give out xx bonuses have xx stations and when it gets attacked all of those disappears while being in siege. the owners dont get any mining, ratting bla bla bonuses from owning the constellation. the owners stations/outposts loses the fuel to run bonus and maybe even some station services depending on how the sieges state. so to get those back the defenders need to clear the majority of the constellation of hostiles. no afk cloakers cant be used to siege a constellation lol.not rly into detail. just an lose ide i had since i dont like the system fights.something in this way would allow a smaller force to be able to mess with hostiles homes more and force a response with a actual plan behind and not just blob them and go back to ratting. big alliance will still fight each other and bring large numbers but now split out and forced to have fleets that can work on several locations. this will be very hard for ppl to adapt to."
9/10/2010,"there should be restrictions. an outright ban is ludicrous, but the full capability of the supercarrier should not be available in low security."

9/10/2010,yeskill mails for doing damage to self destructers would be good to
9/10/2010,this!also. you guys make it sound like you are trying to go out and hunt sc and titans. apparently no one in the game ever attacks you with it when they dun suspect you can hold them or something? jowan from co2 would be a good example. he picked the 15 minute. i'll just disappear and laugh timer over the 2 minute i'll lose my ship timermy math is prolly way off but corpmates say that after resists scs and titans can sit at around 40 million health. 40m/12k per nyx = 3333 seconds3333/119 seconds = 28.008so if im right on that it takes 28.008 nyxes to dish 40 million damage in 2min - 1 second. self destruct only requires 4 nyxes to beat 3.7 to be exact.i watched pl dump five or so supercarriers ontop of six dreads and they could only kill five of them before the 2 minutes ran out. so for those of you saying bring more firepower i think you need to reconsider what you are up against.

9/10/2010,"@ the op: how many towers do you currently fuel? i'm guessing 0-1. there are a lot of problems with this game, but a lack of ""chores"" to do isn't one of them.this is a terrible idea, not to mention an almost totally incoherent post."

9/10/2010,fueling poses is a drag. fueling sov structures would be another one. so no thanks.
9/10/2010,this is a bad idea - the whole point of simply paying for sov upkeep instead of fueling poses (the old system) was because everyone hates having to fuel all those structures.
9/10/2010,"for my point of view paying sov upkeep to a system force (concord) not present in region is irrelevant.no fuel is not a problem for me, it can be a good roleplay way too.but paying for sov in 0.0 to an not present 'authority' is not."

9/10/2010,"supported, as long as killmails also show when the repairing started and how much cap/armor/shields/etc were repaired, since i know that people will sit in rr ships just to ***** km's in high sec, which is lulzy but i still don't want killmails to be ruined. also, make km's show when eccm, tracking links, etc were initiated."

9/10/2010,"you are making a good point and i think that will never happend since it will be to much data needed to be coordinated. in a big fight that will just not work in eve at this moment i believe. and you are right that there is a problem with whoring on km<U+FFFD>s by sitting in a guardian and just put reps on ppl randomly to get on killmails in high sec. tho remember that you still do get aggro timer and can not dock/undock and you get flagged to the hostiles (high sec = war) (low sec = aggressors or outlaw).show rep amount on km and when it started. cool but as said above, to much to ask for. imo start with getting logistic pilots on the mails and give them aggro timer like everyone els. dont allow logistic pilots to jump out or dock when they like and dont make them invisible.i do support this.i would like to get rid of killmails all together.or atleast make them into something less personal... like corp km and alliance km.pilot km is just meh and ruins allot.but for the game i think something is needed like have logs of what happend at xx place at xx time. so a killmail where it stats that 4 geddons from xx corp attacked a myrmidon and harbinger from xx corp in xx system etc.that would still give the generall credit to the corp or alliance. you can brag about how cool you are but it wont be on a pilot vs pilot lvl, rather a corp/ally vs each others."

9/11/2010,"a way to fix medium blasters by arnold predatorvery long but has a fix i hope people can agree on.in a previous post i worked some numbers that scored weapons based on damage output and range. in this post i'm going to expand on that a little more and include projectile weapons as well as try to find a way to balance all three turret types we each other.here are the best of the medium sized turrets. each is using there highest damage type ammo. 425mm autocannon ii:(3.465 x 24 / 5.625)(1200+9600)=w 1200 not 2400 due to the -50% optimal you get with phased plasma ammo.(14.784) (10800) = w (83.16/5.25) (10800) = w(14.784) (10800) = 159667.2tracking of .1056heavy neutron blaster ii: (4.2 x 24 / 5.25)(1800+5000)=w 1800 not 3600 due to the -50% optimal you get with antimatter ammo.(100.8/5.25) (6800) = w(19.2)(6800)= 130560 weapon score. tracking of .1heavy pulse laser ii:(3.6 x 24 / 5.25) (6000+4000) again 6000 not 12000 due to the -50% you get from multispectral ammo.(86.4 / 5.25) (10000)(16.4)(10000) = 164000 weapon scoretracking of 0.08125dps: 19.2, 16.4, and 14.784 blasters have more dps over pulse lasers by 17%, and 31% over auto cannons. blasters should have much more damage over any other weapon type.range: (optimal + falloff) auto cannons have the best range over all but its not by much. the range advantage is only 800m longer then lasers and a whopping 4000m longer then blasters.optimal: pulse lasers have a huge advantage on optimal. pulse lasers have a 6000m optimal apposed to the 1800m of blasters and the 1200m of auto cannons. optimal: pulse lasers have a huge advantage on optimal. pulse lasers have a 6000m optimal apposed to the 1800m of blasters and the 1200m of auto cannons. fall off: no surprise here as auto cannons have the best fall with 9600m, thats 4600m better then blasters and 5600 better then lasers. tracking: right now projectiles have the longest range with the best tracking. (nerf?) blasters have the lest range but place second in tracking. blasters need as much tracking as they can get due to there extremely limited range. lasers have almost the same range as projectiles but the worst tracking. bump blasters to have better tracking then all there better ranged counterparts to make up for there low range. as range goes down tracking should go up. not the other way round like projectiles have now. tech 2 ammo: right now scorch is the king of tech two ammo. a medium pulse laser with scorch ammo has a weapons score of 331885. the closest any other turret can get to that score using tech two ammo is the 425mm auto cannon loaded with barrage. even with barrage the autocannon is only at 196504 for a score. the best blasters can do is 184800. all tech two turret ammo makes you take a hit on tracking but that hit effects lasers the worst and blasters the most. scorch gives a 50% bonus to range. the longer the range the less you need to track things do to there slower transverse velocity. tech two ammo in blasters make not since what so ever as you will never hit anything up close there up close weapons. i have some ideas to fix this but i dont want to do the maths. so hybrids have the worst score when compared with tech 1 or tech 2 ammo. here are a few examples of why blasters need a buff. the optimal of lasers is almost longer then the optimal+ fall off of blasters. the 425mm guns have the longest range over all and the best tracking of the entire group there for will almost always hit. in pvp all other weapon types would be able to hit a blaster boat for at least 4k before it was in range. then once it is finaly in range the blaster boat might not be able to hit anything as its tracking is bad. (this makes for a ship that cant hit what it shots at even after its flown though being shot at for 8-9k :("
9/11/2010,"here is my solution to bring medium blasters in line with the other turret types. this is just some thoughts i have had on the subject and the maths i have used. in order to find out whats needed to fix blasters lets look at the numbers. blasters have the worst score of 130560, pulse lasers the best of 164000. a hybrid turret is a mix of laser (all power) and projectile (only bullet) weapon. a laser weapon is more advanced then a hybrid turret and much more advanced then a projectile one. it would make since to me at least that lasers would have the most advantages over the other two so it makes since that it have the highest over all score. a projectile weapon should have the lowest score due to its simplistic nature. there for a hybrid weapon should be right between both. right now it stands that projectiles have a weapons score of 159667.2, hybrids have a score of 130560 and lasers are at 164000. i see a problem with that hybrid hole. so if my logic is right the new numbers should be more along the lines of 159667.2 for projectiles, 162000 for hybrids, and 164000 for lasers. in order to bring hybrids (in this case blasters) up to the that new number lets work the equations a little bit. in order to get a score of 162000 we need to decide what we want to change in order to bring that number up. seeing as most of the people on the forums say that the range needs to stay the same and damage just needs to go up so lets us that. the damage out put needs to be adjusted. so to find the new damage a neutron blaster needs to have to reach our goal we need to take that goal and divide it by the range. so 162000/6800= 23.823529411 so lets call it 23.825 because everyone likes round numbers. now 23.825 is the new base dps a neutron blaster does after the buff. that 145% more then the 16.4dps of lasers not the 117% it was before. this is more inline with there lack of range and fixes the problem of lasers giving most of the benefit of blasters but with 3 times the optimal + extra range to boot. blasters would now be extremely deadly at there extremely close range as they were intended. how does that extra dps turn into an easy buff for ccp to implement? well there are a few options to pick from. either buff the ammo so that it hurts more, or buff the guns themselves. a buff to ammo would have to include all the ammo types and not just one. that would mean changing each ammo type to do more damage. this makes more work then needed. a better, easier way would be to buff the guns themselves. change the damage modifier on blasters to give them the extra damage they need and all you have to do is adjust the numbers in there description. to find out how much of a change needs to happen lets do some more maths. we have the dps we want them to shot for (pun not intended) of 23.825. we know that dps is damage modifier times (d) by highest ammo damage (h) then divided by rate of fire. (r) so: (d x h) / r = dpsso that turns into: (d x 24)/5.25 = 23.825 or to rework that to what we need it for (23.825 x 5.25)/ 24 = d125.08125/24=d5.21171875= d or to round that 5.2114 (i worked the numbers and 5.2114 works best if you round) so we now have all the numbers to re-run the weapons score equation. (5.2114x24)/5.25) x (1800+5000) = weapons score(23.824)(6800)= wthe new weapons score would be 162003.2 not bad for all the rounding i did. what needs to happen to fix blasters is the damage modifier gets adjusted from 4.2 to 5.2114 and add a little bit to tracking say 25% more to go with the 25%ish more damage. blasters would now be useful again as they would have the best damage, the shortest range, and the tracking to (for once) hit something. how hard was that? as i type this as my character is cross training for lasers and amarr ships to fit them too. untill blasters get fixed i dont have much choice if i want to pvp."
9/11/2010,"i think we need to be careful about giving blasters a massive damage boost. although this may work and balance out the disparity between the weapons systems, the problem of fights becoming very short due to massive dps is likely to occur.there needs to be a rebalance of effective dps amongst the weapons systems. this may mean a slight nerf to the effective dps of both lasers and projectiles along with a slight buff to blaster dps. also, the fix probably needs to have something more than just damage and tracking. how about a rework of the current ammothe current ammo for hybrids offers little choice. you either have lots of damage at close range or not much damage at long range. all the ammo inbetween offers is slight changes in range and the odd bonus to capacitor usage. meaning they have no real value and is the reason why almost everyone just uses antimatter and iron. what if, like projectiles, we give hybrids some variation in ammo. i don't mean changing damage types but i mean to give hybrids some real options for ammo types to use. for example, a damage type that offers a tracking bonus but has a drawback of range reduction and low damage output. one type of high damage ammo that does massive shield damage but low armour damage and a one that does the opposite (base shield/armour damage). i'll set some examples up in another post so that this doesn't become a wall of text."

9/11/2010,"my concern is that blasters would just feel like auto cannons but with even less range if you could switch damage types. that's a very big projectile trait to be giving to hybrids. fail guns would just be faster firing artillery canons. yes the idea is sound that it would re balance hybrids and make them better but to me it sounds like i would be trading my hybrid weapons for projectile ones that now require cap to use. no thanks. by giving a dps and tracking bump the ranges stay the same as b4 and hybrids can now hit other people. the trick that keeps the balance is the range of both lasers and auto cannons. yes a blaster boat will have way more damage then the other two types but the other two types will be able to shot said blaster boat way before he can shoot back. if your dumb enough to get in close to a blaster boat... your dead, end of story. you also have to take into account that most other ships are faster then gellente ships. so not only do they have longer firing range but they can also keep there target at that range better. look at the numbers for scorch ammo.. they get a 50% range bonus.... a blaster boat would get hit from way, way beyond he range and would have to burn though the incoming fire just to get to range. i think that once he gets there he should get to ****face for all the work he did just to get there.... don't you.lets say i have to micro at 1000ms for 15k to a target to get him in my range. (optimal+falloff) if the other guy is shooting me for 500 dps during that 15 seconds that means i get hit for 7500 dps before i get in range and can even start to fight back. thats 7500 dps advantage over when i start shooting back... that's huge. that's also assuming the other guy is at a stand still. if he is flying away from me even a little bit the dps advantage just gets bigger. if he is faster then me... i can never get him unless i get help to slow him down... fixed my math... by giving blasters such a huge boost in dmg and tracking they become great in a fleet. they are the guys that keep frigs at bay when there not being used as the big in your face damage dealer of the gang once they get tackle on the target. if you ran into a blaster boat all by him self it would still be easy to kill him as all you would have to do is pound him from beyond his range."
9/11/2010,"i wasn't suggesting a change in damage types. i was suggesting a change in how the ammo could give very different bonuses. hybrids would still only deal thermal and kinetic damage but for example, antimatter would deal alot more damage to shields and plutonium a lot more damage to armour. a different ammo type can offer very high tracking and another very high rof or high alpha with low rof. one could offer very high falloff where another could offer very high optimal."
9/11/2010,"while i agree with the sentiment that hybrids needs a boost, i have to point out that your weapon score formula have some major flaws.1.dps have the same weight as (optimal + falloff).2.optimal have the same weight as falloff.3.tracking speed is not a part of the formula4.other utilities of the turrets such as reload time and cap-drainage are not accounted for.when the highest tier medium railgun scores 150% higher than the medium blaster perhaps that should give you a hint that your formula is not a very accurate tool to evaluate weapons? or could we perhaps just give railgun-stats to blasters and all of a sudden they are very good?posting stuff like this to try to promote a hybrids buff will likely just be contra productive."

9/11/2010,the error lies in that when you store and eject from your ship within 2500m of the sma but your pod then pops out to a position farther away from the sma than 2500m. the ship stays in space. happens often especially with big ships.

9/11/2010,"(disclaimer: i'm a maxxed-out hulk pilot)let's be serious, that which makes things harder for the macroers often makes mining worse for legitimate players. adding extra goodies for those present is a good idea.allowing us to explore to find better belts is a good one.making basic mining into some horrid mini-game is a terrible idea. it has been for years."
9/11/2010,"pretty much spot on there. but, in much the same way pirates keep misisoners out of lowsec. supercaps are keeping lowsec pvp extremely limited aswell. my corp has several cap pilots, but we almost never have a use for them (aside from the odd l5 mission when things are really quiet). we either roam in sub-caps until we get bored, or we break out a few caps to hit a harder target... and almost always come up against a sc hotdrop. the risks of operating on either extreme of carebear and pvp are so severe that the middle ground of cheap roaming blobs are all that remains.i think a number of things could revitalize lowsec:1) supercaps - fighter bombers have no place in lowsec. period. without the ubiquitous sc issue, lowsec politics would get a niche of their own. cap warfare would be more prevalent and if 0.0 entities wanted to weigh in, they would need to come on even footing (even if they had many more numbers).2) securing a system (note: 'secure' is very relative here since there will be no warp bubbles) with positive sec status should be possible, but at a price. i'd like to see the ability for corps/alliances friendly with an empire to pay for the right to shoot first against anyone with negative sec. ofc, that leaves the opening for players with positive sec to invade eachother. creates a pseudo-sov system without the upgrades. basically a place where pve players could -try- to keep pirates out if they so desired, for the chance at more lucrative missions or sites.3) create a real dynamic between pirates and mercenaries by reforming the bounty system. i see it being something a bit like faciton warfare, but it could be done in some other way aswell. there could even be a counter-merc system setup by local pirate npc agents (for those with negative sec status). this way, both white knights and self-professed yarrbears would have a compelling isk-backed reason to hunt one another and compete.there are other (mostly fw related) suggestions, but i think this covers most of the non-fw issues."

9/12/2010,got a better way of ranking weapons then? if so please post it. i agree that the way i was using is not absolutly the best or only way to rank stuff in eve... i just don't know of any other way. please if someone else has a better way to rank weapons...post it.about changing ammo. i agree with you now.. that does sound like a good idea... i thought you were also talking about changing damage types as well. my bad... i was real tired when reading your post.
9/12/2010,it is very difficult to count all factors.for example how can we consider damage type in a formula? projectiles can adjust damage according a target. it means that real dps is much higher.how can we consider fitting requirements in a formula? for example ac has tiny pg requirements. it gives big advantage in fitting.the formula does not consider all factors. it is simplified model. but it illustrates common blaster problems very clearlyp.s. +1
9/12/2010,"+1 herein general i miss the old days and ways to engage in blaster combat. where working with a platform that forces a target to point blank pvp did mean something else than flying a slow brick and running into tracking issues, just to perform as bad as "

9/12/2010,"let me set this straight: it is not useless. is do use it. it is good. it's worse then that of it's counterparts. let the numbers speak for me: blasters effective range (faloff + optimal) is improved by 25%, since it's a bonus to optimal and falloff.laser optimal range is improved by 37.5%, only optimal is improved, but that's the majority of their range.the autocanon range is improved by 40%, only faloff is improved, but that's whre most of autocanon's range is in.as you can see, not only are blasters an underpowered weapon system, they also recieve an underpowered t2 ammunition, which renders them redundant even further. because someone decided that 25% boost to faloff and optimal for blasters is same as 50% boots to optimal on lasers. obviously it's not. if someone does not believe te numbers listed above, i will be happy to provide full calculations. solution: increase the range bonus to 37.5 percent, that of lasers. seems fair to me. it is not advised to buff one of them by 50%, because blaster's range is half in optimal, and half in faloff."

9/12/2010,"why isn't the oneiros' most important disadvantage listed -- the fact it has 200 less powergrid? the guardian can easily run four reps, 2 large energy transfers and a 1600mm plate while the oneiros is extremely pressed to fit 3 reps and a 1600mm plate.imho the slot layout is sufficient. the tracking link bonus i agree is pretty useless; a repair drone bonus would be far more logical for a drone specializing race. more powergrid is the most essential problem."
9/12/2010,"although i disagree that the onieros needs a boost (maybe a smidge more speed) i do think that tracking enhancers are useless with their current bonus. the bonus needs to be stronger to be effective and worth while using.i also think that the schimi is slightly off too. i've always thought that the schimi should drop its tracking enhancer bonus and be given a bonus to remote armour reps being as minnie ships do both shield and armour tanks effectively. i've also thought that there should be two classes of logis for each race. one similar to the onieros and one similar to the guardian. the amarr ""onieros"" (needs a real name) class logi could have a very similar slot layout as the onieros but with a bonus to remote eccm. the caldari would have a bonus to remote sensor boosters. then the gallente and minnie 2nd class logis could have the energy transfer bonuses to let them ""pair up"" for larger fleet work."

9/12/2010,"some of us have playd this along time and some like the person under my first post havn't, if a small alliance wants to become big explain to me some good ways to go from 100 in a small alliance to 1000 with out being someones ***** and paying for space? if 6 wh's could be joined ( via jump bridge not gate) then a small alliance could grow to probably 3-400 wich would be sufficient to go to 0.0 for there own space, 100 is a rediculas number to try and take and hold your own 0.0.[maybe if you took the time to read and to pay attention as to why we oppose this you'd stop being called an idiot.]maby if some people would consider an idea instead of no, no ,no all the time just because some people love to live in high sec all the time or be pirates doesnt mean small alliance that want to play against npc instead of wrecking other peoples experiance. the only reason for sov in a wh from my oppinion is so u could join 6 wh's together. if some people read what i had written thaey would c that i asked for class 1- class 6 to be joined ( not 6x class 3 whs ) wich would give newer players a chance to make isk in the lower classes and build an alliance.before some smart a post a reply atleast tell me why this basic set up of joining 6 wh's is so bad"

9/12/2010,maybe they should nerf rifters and their t2 counterparts because they are too fast also. because you get your ass kicked by something doesn't mean it is unfair. i hate warp scam but you don't hear me crying they should nerf it.
9/12/2010,wow brilliant argument there. too good compared to what? if it costs 150m to lose it should be more effective than a bs that costs 20m to lose.
9/12/2010,"news flash, a bs costs 100m+ isk to lose and that's assuming you insured it. not sure where you got 20m from, maybe if you get a tier one, don't fit it and self destruct. that said i'm sticking with my original point of ""wts t2 web."" an ab hac is stupidly easy to kill. it's the ones with mwd's that can be tricky."
9/12/2010,"20m is on the low end for t2 fit, but not by much. 100 mil is way off, unless you're buying ships at twice market value."
9/12/2010,"3x trimarks cost 40-50m isk. megapulse ii's cost around 3m a pop, 8 of them is 24m. you'll want a warp disruptor ii, that's about 800k. you probably want a dcii as well, that's 600k. you're definitely going to want some ammo so that's 8m for 8x in mf and let's say another 8m for 8x scorch crystals. you might also want to throw a few plates on, 1600mm rt's are 3.5m each, let's say 2 of them. 20m isk my ass."
9/12/2010,the zealot/guardian blob is extremely potent but has lots of effective and low-cost counters. it was born out of the ashes of the smouldering bs wrecks that died to the swarm of bombs and is far more vulnerable than the last hac fetish ever was (nanoage-hacs).
9/12/2010,no. buff demois instead. buff munin. make them as goodas the zealot is. then we are talcking.
9/12/2010,i agree with the dread needs to be redesigned; here is my take on what would help the dread being fixed:
9/12/2010,"could be used for a sort of jobs board for corp members.drop note into member hangar, note gets pulled, no chance that job gets done twice."
9/12/2010,"should be a fairly easy modification of the bm token system, agreed 100%"

9/12/2010,it has been confirmed the alleged nda breach had nothing to do with any of her recent activities but with her earlier seats on the csm.
9/12/2010,"no, it wasn't confirmed. there was some fairly well-substantiated speculation, but we didn't ever find out exactly what happened or what time-frame it happened in. even if it wasn't information from this aborted term on the csm, it could have been old information that she recently released, or whatever. we simply don't know and probably never will, since eva's ""i'll tell you all tomorrow"" blog post was something like two months ago now."

9/13/2010,"i have spent some more time working the numbers on the other weapons sizes. i know the weapon score (ws) number is not all inclusive but it does give a good indication of the problem. i use them if you dont want to dont. if you know a better way to rate weapons, please post it as this is the best way i know. i added tracking just so people can see it for each weapon type. keep in mine the further the target is away from you the less tracking you will need. one thing i have not touched on before is that lasers dont require ammo in the since of per shot consumable ammo. add to that that reloading is instant were the other two types require a 10 second reload time. these are yet 2 more advantages to a weapon system that is all ready over powered. here are the numbers for small tech two weapons. small neutron blaster iidps: 14.4, optimal: 900, falloff: 2500 range: 3500 tracking: .3165 ws: 48,960 medium pulse laser iidps: 12.34, optimal: 3000, falloff: 2000 range: 5000 tracking: .24525 ws: 61714200mm autocannon iidps: 11.01 optimal: 600, falloff 4800 range: 5400 tracking: .315 ws: 59875again the numbers show that blasters are lacking something. most people say damage. in one of my last posts i worked out that if the damage modifier on medium blasters was upped from 4.2 to around the 5.2 mark the guns would be much more balanced across the board as far as weapons score goes. lets see if that change would also work on small blasters as well. (5.2x12/3.5)x(900+2500)=60622that works out to 17.83 dps, the same range as before, and a new weapons score of 60,622. that would put the buffed neutron blaster right between the score of the 200mm autocannon and medium pulse laser. the blaster would still be the in your face weapon it was meant to be but would now have the dps to make up for its short range. so its the same easy fix just bump up the damage modifier of hybrid weapons 1 point to 5.2tech two ammo is still unbalanced as a medium pulse laser ii with scorch ammo has a weapons score of 124457. the other long range tech 2 ammo for both hybrid and projectile weapons only have a weapons score of 70950 and 85377 respectably. maybe nurf scorch ammo to bring it back in line to what the other weapons can do right now it seems a bit over powered due to the 50% optimal bonus it gives. this needs to be looked at and re-balanced."
9/13/2010,"here are the numbers for the large short range weaponsneutron blaster cannon iidps: 25.6, optimal: 3600, falloff: 10000 range: 13600 tracking: .0433 ws: 348160mega pulse laser iidps: 21.94, optimal: 12000, falloff: 8000 range: 20000 tracking: .03375 ws: 438857800mm repeating artillery iidps: 19.712, optimal: 2400, falloff: 19200 range: 21600 tracking: .0432 ws: 425779 the weapons scores are just as unbalanced here as they are in the other sizes. not only that, but there are other problems as well. first lets take a look at the weapons score of blasters and try to fix that. so again lets see if the new damage modifier of 5.2 would bring blasters more inline to the other weapons. (5.2x48/7.875)x(3600+10000)= 431055. what do you know... same problem, same solution. so not only would changing the damage modifier up one point fix blasters it would fix three sizes of them. second problem, tracking speed.a blaster should have much higher tracking to any other gun due to its low over all range. it makes since then that tracking on blasters should be adjusted so that they have the same chance to hit at there close range as the other weapons that shoot at there longer ranges. the problem i see is that the 800mm repeating artillery has 99.77% the tracking speed of the neutron blaster but 58% more range. does that stick out as a problem to anyone else?tech ii ammo is still unbalanced here as well. scorch is still heads and shoulders better then any other tech 2 ammo. when it comes to long range ammo scorch has a weapons score of 888480, barrage: 607152, and null at a very depressing 483276. the high damage ammo scores are also in favor of lasers. conflagration: 512000, void: 283670, and hail at 276000. the long range ammo has 75% normal tracking speed. the high dps ammo takes a 50% tracking hit. so not only do blaster need a buff when it comes to normal ammo, but tech 2 ammo as well. this is just another example why ccp needs to shelf wis and get back to work on the core elements to there flagship game. too bad walking in space stations is more important to a mmo about flying space ships then you know flying space ships."

9/13/2010,"i completely agree with this idea. there's no reason we shouldn't be allowed to create refineries in the same system as a factory. the game mechanics obviously already exist. it's a completely arbitrary limit that holds us to one station per system, and it doesn't make sense. although people are always opposed to change (for no reason), this change would only improve the game, and increase the value of certain systems. if your alliance is willing to lay more cards on the table, then why should they be held back from doing so?"

9/13/2010,"i think the current overview settings are pretty crappy. they are hard to understand, unintuitive, hard to get right, requires a lot of work and are buggy. also they can't be shared amongst the corp or alliance.i don't know how many times i've changed something, thought i had it saved, and when i'm done it's back to the way it was again. or if i'm lucky it works the current session, but when i start the game again it's back to the way it was, alternatively all the tabs have changed.maybe i'm just too stupid to set it up right or maybe it's bugs, but it's not intuitive and well working.so i came up with my own suggestion of how i would want it to work. i put this together in visual basic, so just imagine the eve ui instead of windows xp [overview1]to the left is the settings window. here are all the settings stored. there are 4 categories:* templates - provided by ccp, read only* personal - your own settings* corporation - settings from your corp* alliance - settings from your alliancethere are some indicators next to the entries:[r] - read only[#] - a number, means this setting is applied to the corresponding overview tab* - asterisk, means this setting has changes in it that needs to be savedto the right is the actual settings. it's important to note that all the data in the tabs belongs to a single setting (i.e. when you select a setting all data in all tabs belong only to that setting) something that does not hold for the current overview settings and therefore makes them hard to understand.[overview2]by right clicking a setting you select in which tab you want to show it in, or if you want to hide it. templates can be used as is, but can't be modified. templates are of course good starters for new settings. by right clicking and choosing ""use as template"" we can create a new personal, corp or alliance setting.we can see that the one currently using the interface has the corp roles necessary to modify corp overview settings, but not alliance overview settings (they show as read only). he can of course always modify his own personal settings.we can also see that he has modified, but not yet saved, the personal setting ""exploration"" as it has an asterisk.over to the actual settings on the right:[overview3]the first tab is visibility (roughly what is called filters today).it contians two children, static items and pilots (roughly what is called types and states today).static items, as you can see, is almost exactly like types is today, with one important exception. you can now not only choose what should be shown on your overview, but which brackets should be shown in space as well.[overview4]pilots is what is called states today. but instead of the very unintuitive and buggy mess that is currently used this one is a lot easier to understand.the current selection for example will hide your fleet/corp/alliance, typical nullsec setup. by for example changing the ""not"" to ""equals"" and the ""and"" to ""or"" you will instead only show your fleet/corp/alliance, useful for carriers and logistics.this is of course very easily modifiable. all the criterias that exists today will also exist here, as can be seen in the dropdown box.by clicking the corresponding remove button that critera is removed, and by clicking the add new criteria... button a new row is added.the four remaining tabs; appearance, columns, ship brackets and misc is exactly the same as today (ship brackets is called ships today). the overview tabs tab is removed as it is served elsewere (in the right click menu)."

9/13/2010,"1 mw every 30 seconds? the likelihood of keeping anyone's cap drained to absolutely 0 at the right time for a dcu to continue running is pretty low. in the lagfest that is a super cap takedown, it is likely that the module will be stuck on without using any cap anyway. most smaller ships will be dead inside 30 seconds so even trying to keep their cap at 0 at the right time is just plain silly. no reason to have this an active module instead of a passive one."
9/13/2010,"my apologies, so many posts, so little time.in light of today's devblog about the recent lag-fix on cycling modules, your comment is particularly prescient.i will have fellow csm vuk lau send you some of his famous soothing lube to ease your pain. wrt to the posters concerned about the possible missed kills due to dc not being incappable, i would like some more data on how frequently this kind of event really occurs (ie: it makes the kill possible vs. just delaying the inevitable). also, assuming it is a real factor, what changes to the module attributes might balance the change?if i do bring this up to csm, it will definitely include this concern in the cons section."
9/13/2010,dear ccp:u did it worng u need to give tranqility sp
9/13/2010,indeed.
9/13/2010,they did it right. sisi is voluntary and it doesn't effect the game. as i posted before it isn't right to give out free sp for any reason except extreme circumstances that ccp has caused intentionally or otherwise and even then i am very weary of them giving sp out. yeah it is a pain to wait for skills to finish but never should we expect that. after all there is a reason it is supposed to take over 45 years to train everything and that is so no one character can specialize in everything.will not supported nor do i ever intend to support such a proposal because of its nature.

9/13/2010,i cant understsand what the op said. lolbut if he said that rring needs to have timers added then i support
9/13/2010,"suggested addition to the mechanicyou must have a membership count equal to 5% of the membership count of the corp you are declaring war on or the cost is increased by a specified factor (ie. tripled, or based upon the missing percentage). while not having this cost requirement for declaring war on an alliance (the increased cost is already present).this is to discourage 2 man corps declaring war on those with 300+ members for the meager cost of a current corp to corp wardec. adding in the increased cost penalty is to ensure mercenary institutions are still able to perform their duties."
9/13/2010,"agreed. you should not be able to simply jump, log off during your invulnerability timer and then log back in with full cap ready to jump out nomatter how long you stay offline. both capacitor and shield level should be at whatever it was when you last logged out."
9/13/2010,"that is up for debate, but the point is that it doesn't even do that - quite often it spawns you with a lower cap level than what you logged out with."
9/13/2010,"how about mining? :)maybe not as much of a troll as it sounds like. it could solve a number of issues. ccp could deliver that 5th subsystem in a way that would not totally overpower t3 ships. i'm sure that's a consideration with any new subsystem......balancing all the possible combinations of the new type, and the old ones.it could present a mining option that is more resiliant than the current crop of mining barges, for players who want that. (and what miner wouldn't?) you might even end up with <gasp> a mining barge with spare highslots!"
9/13/2010,"t3 is pretty skill unintensive. how do you plan to account for that, make it worth using for mining, and not make it worth training over the hulk in the first place due to the lower amount of time needed if it were trained. isk cannot be the answer, nor can specialized training. so while i actually like the idea, i can't see a practical implementation based on what t3 is designed for."
9/13/2010,"the same thing t3 ganglinks did to command ships you mean? that worked out ok.still though, meh.(i've had nightmares of the next set of subsystems including a hictor or dictor effect.)"
9/13/2010,"the current set of introduction to the game missions are woefully inadequate to teach new players the basics of the game. you are basically ""throwing them into the deep end and seeing if they sink or swim"".1) the advanced tutorial agents do not provide adequate information on how to actually complete them. especially those tutorials which give you skill books which you need to learn to do the mission, but do not give you the prerequisite skillbook for it.ie. mountains of molehills chain, you are provided the refining skillbook, but you dont' actually get the industry skillbook anywhere (which must be trained to rank 1 before refining can be learned), nor is it explained on where to actually get skillbook or how to find items you need or where to go to get new skills.2) the introduction to the game training missions can expireget started on a mission chain, come back after a week and the mission chain that teaches you the basics of the game has expired and you cannot continue the chain by talking to your agent again.both of these 2 issues are relatively simple to fix from a gameplay point of view. with just a little bit more care and attention to detail and actually running through those mission chains in a random order (or all at once, does not matter) and finally assuming the player knows absolutely nothing about the game.1) ensure that either all the skills neccesary to do the chain are issued to the player when they run them, or indicate to the player that there may be prerequisite skills needed to learn and where they can go to get them (ie. point them at the skills section in the market place).2) either, don't let the advanced career agent missions expire, or if they do, just put them back with the agent and say something like ""oy, you let this expire, dont do that, i'll let you off but other agents are not as nice as me""2c"
9/13/2010,"makes sense. i've posted a different thread about giving players industry 1 automatically (since manufacturing is also based on this).supported, as it will help the newer players to this game."
9/13/2010,"i had my friend try an eve trial once. the tutorial missions were confusing for him and insufficient, even with me helping him. he failed to swim and sank to the bottom.when i first started playing, things like this confused me to no end. i figured it out before long, but it's still unnecessary confusion."
9/13/2010,"i don't have a problem with a change but honestly it isn't that 'hard' or 'challenging' to see a skillbook has a prerequisite and then wonder where it is/how do i get it then make a logical 'leap' to checking where/how you can buy it.you are incorrect refining is for waste, reducing it by 2%, you don't need it or industry trained at all to use the refining service at stations. yes missions do expire and they tell you how much time you have left in the mission details window as well as in your journal. i don't see a real need for this but extending it to the trial length, 2 or 3 weeks i think is 'fair' if it is deemed really necessary. the bigger issue here is once you start with an agent you have 7 days to accept the whole 10 part etc arc, ie mission 1 shows as 7 days, mission 2 shows as 7 days but missions 3-10 will have 7- however long you took doing the other missions left before you can't accept them anymore. meaning if you take 5 days to complete mission 2 then 3 days to do mission 3 you can't accept mission 4 because the whole 'arc' ran out of time, 7 days to accept all the missions or you can't complete the ones that expired. if you do the missions in agent order, military, bus/indus iirc the game is better explained perhaps ccp should 'urge' players to do them in a specific order as using the market is covered either in a mission or perhaps under the many tutorials in the listing. or just move the 'guiding' missions into a separate tutorial like the 'first days/crash course' thing that is made 'mandatory' but that you can still say 'i don't need to do this' if you so choose.i support having another look at this but i don't think it is 'that hard' to figure out if you've ever played a game before or 'think'."
9/13/2010,"i stole this from **********. alright, since that is blanked out, i stole this from a little old lady walking down the street. her name was ms. kugot.sumen.original thread:"

9/13/2010,"think fo something better then camping the hub for 10 minutes, someting more active. but i like the basic idea."
9/13/2010,won't everything that encourages people to group up end up as a blob?
9/13/2010,"is there anything better in this game than a blob 1000 enraged ravens trying to defend their isk? i don't think so, so supporting this."
9/13/2010,sounds cool - ill support.
9/13/2010,"creates unneeded work for the servers and clients, and friendly alliances will wind up 'friendly camping' neighboring i-hubs and creating a situation similar to the current bounty system. not supported."
9/13/2010,similar how?
9/13/2010,"i don't like the slot changes, nor the nerfing of the tracking link bonus, but i do like the reduction of sig radius and bump up of base speed.'twold be nice to see more oneiros' flying around. its always guardians and basis and scimis because the oneiros doesn't fit into most decent gangs well enough to be useful."
9/13/2010,i dont support this change. except for maybe small sig/velocity tweaks oneiros is fine (especially for dualboxing).
9/13/2010,"i think its better too replace missile bombardement lvl5 skill, with the rapid launch lvl5 skillwhy ? both are equally long in training but more dps on target is more preferable than abit of extra rangeusually in pvp and pve dps is more important right and too have an certificate that proves that for missiles would be kewlhope you give your thoughts about what i missed plz"
9/13/2010,does anyone actually care about those certificates?
9/13/2010,the op apparently.i mostly use them to wall paper the inside of my pod.
9/13/2010,gee.. i laminate them and tile my pool with them.....
9/13/2010,i live in a wh and even i don't support this... turning wh space into null sec is such a bad idea. yes it would be nice to get more sites to run more often. the disadvange would be that all the 0.0 corps would invade all the wh and the rest of us would never be able to kick them out... ever. not supported due to it being a dumb idea that would breke the game.
9/13/2010,"the big alliances would do it as at least one of the systems they string together would have a wh into friendly space, sort of making a permanent connection to their space. these, plus an outpost or two would also become the jump off point for wh roams, which is what you don't want.i'm sorry, but the more structure you allow to be laid in wh space, the more likely you make it that the coalitions/alliances, like the one i'm in, will oust the little guys and move some people in.i have given lengthy explanations why this is a bad idea more than once. read them before you claim people are making unthinking ""no"" responses in this thread."
9/13/2010,when exactly are you planning to actually do smth about those cheaters that destroy the economy and also take away profits from honest miners?uphene as we speak right now is wrecked by them the place is infested with them.seek all those hulk pilot drones that mine in large belted near low sec systems that dont reply tour convos and have 1 mil isk spa and never say anything or do anything else than mine for 23 hours per day. and totally destroy this game.we have at least 10 of them ruining uphene daily do smth before yous tart losing players ffs
9/13/2010,use macro yourself. problem solved.
9/13/2010,i actually enjoy mining ok? plus i am no f cheater r will ever be. i aint going to be one of those that ruin the economy and the fun of gamers that play fairly the game and i hope that they are the majority.
9/13/2010,"the answer to your problem is simple, if you would like to know more evemail me ingame.gerrick palivorn"
9/13/2010,mail sent but i reaaaaly want to hear smth from someone from ccp here telling wtf they are going to do about this problem. they are riiiight there they see them they know them and dont f ban them.
9/13/2010,"i predict that if i were to keep bumping this thread, it'd get more replies from anonymous csm alts than any other thread in the history of the csm. right up to the point where they have it deleted."

9/13/2010,i support 2 x 1 year term limit.kb
9/13/2010,"they said it caused too much lag. i have a pretty awesome pc so that was never too much of a problem, but it must have sucked for the people who don't.that said, i miss it. it was way cooler, and i wish they'd bring it back.also, the nos and neut animations we had for a short while that looked like fine red lightning bolts or crackling electricity...those rocked. bring those back, too.the new eccm, as mentioned elsewhere, is too dramatic. it detracts from gameplay in a big way. +1 on revamping that one. i know there's a thread on it around here somewhere.the old web animations were cooler, too. never have gotten used to the new one. it just doesn't grab your attention in the same way. it's too hard to see. pseudo-science explanations of the graphic take a back seat to actual usability in the game as far as i'm concerned, i'm afraid. give us the old web graphic back, too!lots of awesome graphics in eve. lots. it's just that a very few of the 'upgrades' in recent months/years feel more like downgrades. (new shield effects, for instance are awesome, and a huge improvment.)"
9/13/2010,"this thread already exists in the csm, and features and ideas. please use eve search before hand to check to make sure that when you post that this thread doesnt already exist."
9/13/2010,"it was the drone regions, not level 4 mission runners, who destroyed the value of mining. everyone makes mistakes. the problem is, ccp, like most game designers, will make a mistake, then try to fix it with more mistakes, messing up all kinds of seemingly unrelated stuff in the process, instead of just rolling back the original mistake.get rid of the drones. put regular rats in the drone regions.ultimately this will hurt ccp's income, by costing subscriptions of scads of former soviet block players who make a real life living in the those regions, and some of who will undoubtably migrate to another game, but they should just suck it up and do it anyway."
9/13/2010,"you know, that there is no bounty on drones ?no 1.1 mill or even more isk on each bs which spawns ?no officers loot or those hauler spawns, which gives you huge amount of minerals in one go ?and you know, that all the drone loot isnt worth anything, if you cant haul it to highsec or build something from it, which also means initial high investments ?its not a mistake, its good as it is. still drone region sucks, you dont know that ?"
9/13/2010,"right, lol. ever been to a -1.0 drone system?the quantity of minerals you can haul out of there by killing drones is ridiculous. i've never made so much isk anywhere else in eve."
9/13/2010,"but why am i arguing with xdeath about it, lol? of course, you're right. drone regions suck. your secret is safe with me. don't worry!"
9/13/2010,do you realise that they reduced the amount of minerals that drones drop?
9/13/2010,"hi obsidian here.i was there when the drone regions first opened up, helped build some of those original stations out there.op - you are full of crap, because of the drone regions, mexaloon prices jumped up and so did pyerite. while the drone regions are plentiful in minerals, they are really lacking in 2. mexallon and megacyte.this of course makes stuff like plag, and kernite a great mining money maker. plus if you havent noticed, since tyrannis, nocxium went up in price 50%, isogen is up 10% also."
9/13/2010,"i think blah was attempting to slide a hidden russian nerf through. i still have to laugh at the xdeath guy who responded. if you don't like drone space, why not move into the south and give the drone regions to your pets instead of the other way around?i think drone regions need more variability in their drones. you shouldn't be able to rat for an hour and know almost exactly how much you will make. in the rest of 0.0 space, people are faced with killing a battleship rat and getting a crap laser crystal as loot, then killing the next and getting a pith x-type. drone regions simply don't have that variability."
9/13/2010,"so basicly, it's a human drone, shooting computer drones, and droning on while his isk ticks up slowly in minerals."

9/13/2010,noooo! i haven't finished minmatar cruiser 5 yet! i would be stuck with 3 bad long range hacs then until i can sit in a muninn. give me at least another 12 days please. that or they could fix the hybrid ships.
9/13/2010,"while the vast majority of our population remains quite mature it seems that there are some people just have a problem ignoring those that cause... problems. and the phrase out of sight, out of mind comes to mind.so my suggestion is simple. create a mechanic that allows us to put people on an ""ignore"" list and we never see a post from that person again. i have seen this feature in several other forums / communities. i have no knowledge about how complicated this would be for programming.while not ideal it is a possible way to allow those of us who cannot help but reply to the consistant troublemakers. also because there is a user number unique to each account this would allow us to not only ignore that specific person but any alt created on the same account. admittedly this does not prevent them from creating temporary accounts, but i don't have an answer for that.just a thought. take it for what it is worth."
9/13/2010,"right now there are only two options when it comes to tech two pulse lasers. one is weak the other strong my proposal then is that ccp make a third option, medium option. there is no medium option for pulse lasers in both medium and large sizes. reasons: both hybrid and projectile turrets have three tech two turret options, why do pulse lasers only have two?allows more fitting choices with three options as apposed to the two we have now more choice in fitting is never a bad thing.drawbacks ccp might make them over powered and make these new lasers are more powerfall then there blasters/autocannons counterparts. make sure all weapons are balanced to each other.. granted that all ready needs to be looked at anyway...i know ccp is busy working on incarna so i took the liberty of coming up with some possible specs for the new pulse lasers for them. downgrade the tech 1 version accordingly. i quote some dps numbers from other turrets. i get these numbers like this:(d x h / f)= dps d = dmg mod, h = highest dmg ammo, f = fire rate in seconds. name: intense pulse laser ii (medium) activation: 10.665 gj power grid: 181.5 mw cpu: 32 tf rate of fire: 4.9s damage modifier: 3 accuracy falloff: 3.5 km optimal: 11.5km tracking: .085625 rad/secthe dps of the new medium pulse laser is 14.69. this fits nicely between the heavy pulse laser (16.46) and the duel heavy pulse laser (14.2). the power grid, cpu and tracking are all half way between the two existing turrets.name: duel intense pulse laser ii (large) activation: 32.5 gj power grid: 2200 mw cpu: 47.5 tf rate of fire: 7 s damage modifier: 2.875 charge size: large accuracy falloff: 7 km optimal: 22 km tracking: .03575 rad/secthe dps of the new large pulse laser is 19.71. this fits nicely between the mega pulse laser (21.94) and the duel heavy pulse laser (18.96). the power grid, cpu and tracking are all half way between the two existing turrets. there i think if built to around those specs the new pulse lasers would give a nice medium option between low fitting cost/dps and high dps/fitting costs. just don't make them more powerfall then there counterparts from the blaster/autocannon groups and you should be good.note.. i used"
9/13/2010,"while you're at it, add a 3rd option for artillery too. 400/800/1600mm for s/m/l please.and for crying out loud increase the tempest powergrid already.thanks in advance."
9/13/2010,i for one would like to see it balanced around.dread - anti cap/super capsupercarrier/carrier - logistics and drone boating.titan - completely repurposed (including rebalance of doomsday) into a station siege cannon.
9/13/2010,they just moved supercarriers from a more logistic focused role to an anti cap ship role.

9/13/2010,blah. nm.
9/13/2010,"yep. also, on the ship fitting export panel, how about ""select all"" and ""deselect all"" buttons. in the browse window for ship fittings, let us select multiple entries at one time. both of these would make managing fittings a lot faster and easier."
9/13/2010,that would be great!
9/13/2010,ah.... i would prefer to see eaf's be able to fit cloaks....
9/13/2010,"maybe not decloak, but make a ""ghost"" item on your overview (you are the pilot of the eaf) of where the cloaked ship was when you activated the module, and the ""ghost"" would only last for a few seconds, that you can try to approach to see if you can decloak it."
9/13/2010,"a few points regarding the evelopedia article:and fricken long to repair, if you kill one. i don't really want my fitting down half of the time.one doomsday takes down one hictor. you can't field as many 50m ships as the enemy can field 50b ones? you deserve to lose. imo, this is not an issue.never the goal in itself? why are there so many alliances holding sov then? there is very little to be gained from owning an entire region that you can't get from a few systems, yet alliances continue in their conquest. if someone doesn't want to hold space, there is some 2,000 highsec systems available.i am against small gangs having too much say in sov warfare. they have their purpose, and that is disrupting the infrastructure. killing ratters, miners, people movind through gates or undocking - that kind of stuff. but i don't want to call upon alliance fleets to defend sovereignty every time some randoms decide to put a 20 man gang together.don't take me wrong - i agree with all the other points in the proposal. i have only quoted those i think need to be worked on more."
9/13/2010,my thoughts exactly.

9/13/2010,"csm can't publish internal ccp documents or discussions without prior agreement with ccp. this is pretty much standard operating practice for any development company.csm can and do publish csm meetings except for sections covered by the above.incorrect. because csm are under nda we can discuss and get feedback on items which ccp don't wish to make public yet (though this doesn't happen very often)also csm can and do raise player issues and get items into the eve backlog for future development, which doesn't touch the nda at all.can you please pick one thread and stick to it instead of cross posting the same questions in different places?"
9/13/2010,"csm, sorry to say but i will come back in 18 months to get the csm5 information feedback.enjoy your meeting pontifications but players except information.not just reading you meeting planing agenda.at least just the facts but i see nothing except that you will give them to us...sounds like ccp. thnen as ccp player will expect results in 18 moths.yeay"
9/13/2010,"i'm slightly unsure what your complaint is here. we publish our meeting discussions and we make available information from ccp when we get it (providing they are not under nda).we have something in progress which will provide some additional information, watch this space."
9/13/2010,"hello,i'm complaining about a clear answers, a list of point where can see rapidly what's on the table between csm and ccp. who hold the point and who needs to act in a list ?csm not publishing cause csm does not agree internally ?csm not publishing cause ccp does not allow to ?ccp does not answer you but engaged to do it ?why does it take so long just to have a clear view about dates ?who needs to act ?does the csm have answer of ccp ?which subject ccp does not give you date/answers on ?for an issue where can i have a date of resolution ?where can i see a list ?state which point is under nda ?nda means no information from us, please state them too !i find some elements but please make a list link on the forum about the relevant wikipage. may be a thread just for us to follow ?thank you for publishing the log but do you think we can follow you by reading a discussion we aren't aware of the exact details just by the logs ?csm is too much a black box concerning what's on the table with ccp. i'm sure you have the information but make it clearly on a page where we can go and clearly see what's on the table please.yeay"
9/13/2010,"i don't have time to respond in detail but these two wiki categories are a good place to start.issues raised by csm waiting responses from ccpcsm issues resolved by ccp - not 100% accurate because tracking of csm issues by ccp won't be in place till the next summit meeting in december. csm publishes all meeting logs except sections where there is discussion of nda items (this doesn't happen very often, maybe 5 times in the last year). also csm maintains the wiki. what else are you expecting?only items under nda are not published. most of this would come under ccp's development schedules which are decided after considering all the issues raised by the eve stakeholders (which the csm is one of). csm can request information from ccp and frequently does. see the other business sections of most meetings where status updates are discussed.i can't tell you what items are under nda, sorry. all i can say there is very little under nda right now and one thing should be published this week.yes. the exact details of issues under discussion are in the wiki and in the meeting logs. the logs and voting results are public and the issues are on the wiki which links to the original assembly hall threads. it is all there.incorrect. all player issues raised by csm to ccp are clearly displayed on the wiki. if you want to know the date when things are going to be resolved then i have to say that nobody, not even ccp, can say that for the majority of the issues."
9/13/2010,thank you
9/13/2010,"csm,please read this thread title and think about it if it would not be more useful act you can do for the players in the current state of the csm meetings.may be you will do it and we will trust back in you.personal point of view is that if you continue like that you are just as useful as ccp 18 months...yeay"
9/13/2010,"hello,i like the energy you set in the csm posts.but seems to me now we are waiting information from you too and get nothing cause some don't accept a point on a list on your side.looks good to do meeting but better do to less and get back informations to the players.csm works can be good but without real feedback to the community e.g. the backlog thread the csm is just as ccp. we post we wait and we wait.sorry but it's this situation you put yourself in.i don't trust anymore the csm to get any relevant value-added for players requests.forum can do the same if ccp read them.yeay"
9/14/2010,"thanks for the list. if ccp would sticky this, and if you would be kind enough to keep this list updated, it could help cut down on the double topic crap in assembly hall.edit: happy day, oh happy day, it got a sticky!"
9/14/2010,supported so i don't have to bump 10 different threads per hour.
9/14/2010,i really think all these should eb addressed before next expansion.
9/14/2010,"the underlying problem here is that while ah is a great place to discuss proposals and debate their validity, it is a poor venue due to lack of features for being able to easily find, vote up or down, and assess the status of various proposals. if a more appropriate tool were being used for managing proposals, the desire for a stickied ""hot topics"" thread would probably not exist.but...since we don't have such a tool, such a stickied thread seems useful. however, a bunch of potential problems come to mind:-- how committed is the op to keeping the original post updated as proposals are addressed by ccp or as the status of items on the list otherwise changes? now, sure, but what about in a year? two years? keeping track of a proposal's support/non-support ratio is a challenge--given that would have to be reviewed regularly to be sure of the actual support count (you know how people express support but forget to click the ""support"" checkbox).-- what happens if the op's account goes inactive for some reason? all kinds of things happen in rl that take players away from the game; if the op can't (or no longer wants to) log in to update the post, then what? that is why in other forums, ccp staff tend to be the authors of the stickied, non-static threads--that way, there is a guarantee of access to keep the thread updated.-- who decides what is hot enough to go on the list? everyone will believe their pet proposal is hot enough to be on the list and many will express annoyance at topics being included that don't relate to their interests or which they perceive as being pushed by a null sec voting block. the selection of topics is a big can of worms. -- when do items lose the ""hot"" status such that they should be removed from the list? supports/non-supports can change a lot over time--especially if something happens in game to affect the validity of an ah proposal. who makes the decision to take an item off the ""hot"" list?i've got this thread bookmarked so i can watch it and will bring it up with the other csm members, but i think there are too many potential problems to make a stickied hot topics thread advisable. depending on responses from others, i might be convinced otherwise."
9/14/2010,"this is a temporary, half-solution, mynxee. it isn't perfect, but it is better than the current system."
9/14/2010,"mynxee - yes there are several problems that can occur as i am not a player and stuff can happen.but at least this is a good temp solution until something more permanent can be worked out. as for what is on the list currently, i tried to weigh out hot issues as ones that would affect eve as a whole rather than just a select minority.yes i will admit mothershps model size only affects a minority, but anyone who has seen them test server, or regular server will realize, hey my battle ship is almost just as big. so this one was more for a aesthetic feel for eve, plus it was requested. however i am willing to work with the csm to change the links and post which ones are hot and people should look at."
9/14/2010,"a nice idea till we get (hopefully) better forums.another possible way to handle this would be as a ""most frequently asked for"" wiki page with links to the issues here. at least that way we could get it stickied while allowing players to edit as needed."
9/14/2010,if you missed it:
9/14/2010,"i share your frustrations and goals, but i have some problems with this. how exactly could a typical player -not a forum regular - find some of these topics? i'm not arguing or criticizing but without keywords and such like, i find free text search using eve-search/google has some limitations. starting with the missing forum search from ccp - if searching historical forums were important and to be encouraged, then why does not ccp provide it.btw, i am not quite sure why there is a f&i and a ah forum? i also see a disconnect as to the feedback forum goals: is this where paying customers provide feedback to a corporation? i.e., if i write toyota that i do not think their cars should accelerate on their own, i do not expect a response of ""what a noob - it's already been suggested"" and it matters to mcdonalds whether 15 or 15,00,000 think their new sandwich tastes bad; it's not just the topics; number of responders matter.a lot of companies use non-employee (i.e. unpaid) forum members to help police organize things. in particular, if there were a way a forum member could do a quick drop down and have a post moved to the ""suicide/insurance"" thread/topic/keyword. probably much more likely to be successful than training 350,000 people to behave differently using forum software that has many opportunities for improvement. this is not just ah: it would be nice if a click could move the topics into the ""raven or tengu"" sub-forum. ( and in the redundant poster's defense, seeing their are 27000 eve-search entries for raven fit or 10000 for raven fitting does not put you that much closer to an answer for a common question ) and how many posts about jump clones or mining could be answered with a single link? but i strongly believe that if the choices are between changing fundamental human behavior or changing the forum software, it would be easier to change the software to make it easier to coalesce the common questions and suggestions.i also think the new forums are very important going forward and the csm should push very strongly for their features in advance rather than letting ccp pull their usual ship it first and then respond with the ""well that is a limitation of our micro$oft tool"" or ""we'll polish this later"". and of course prevent the ""we do not support the android/iphone/ipad/firefox/safari/chrome browser"" or ""we require flash or .nyet or activex""-------perhaps the process is someone (csm? forum maven) did an official quarterly top 25 or 50 sticky. not as some volunteer who may be unmotivated or unsubscribed in 3 months but a commitment to the process from ccp/csm. i would mimic the qen and call it the qwn - quarterly whine newsletter but suggestion or feedback would be more politically correct. way too much to hope for is a quarterly poll on the top 25 - where people chose a few small med and large features. because these days, for non-lag features the question is not whether it is good but rather where it is good enough."
9/14/2010,"dear ccp,i refuse to pay plex with rl isk untill its fixed. this is costing u allready 6 x 3 x 27= 487 euro's /hemmops:bump"
9/14/2010,i have decided to put eve down for a bit. the length of time it takes to get decent pvp fights in eve is the main reason. even after you do all the grinding for isk and buying and moving ships and mods you still don't have a way to find decent fights much faster than an hour of jumping around or waiting around for a fleet to form. i can't commit that much time to a video game. rvb was good but it was a bit too arranged. fw should imo be the way for more casual players to find decent pvp fast. i don't think an hour of down time is really fast. others may disagree. no i'm not giving away my stuff because i'm not quitting eve. :) its still the best video game ever. i will likely check back from time to time to see if they do anything to improve this. the suggestions in this thread would definitely dramatically improve the situation. but there are other options.
9/14/2010,"tl:dr, but the 4th bonus on assault ships was resistances. since you have to have a racial frigate skill to 5 to fly that race's assault frigs, meaning the bonus would always be the same, and for other reasons i don't recall, at one point ccp decided to quit listing it as a bonus in the description, and just add the calculated amount to the ships base resists in the info window's second tab.the fourth bonus is still there, just displayed differently, now. oh yes....it lets you look up a ship in the market and see what the actual resists would be, rather than having to either board it or eft (quickfit) it, or get out your calculator."
9/14/2010,"perhaps even an agility increase as well. i think af's should be the most agile ship, period."
9/14/2010,what about interceptors?
9/14/2010,"+1assault frigates, the ships everyone only flies for fun because they don't properly fill any role, certainly not well enough to justify their cost."
9/14/2010,"speed != agilityinty's should be the fastest ships yes, but af's should be the best at making smooth 180 turns for dogfighting at close range. i wouldn't mind if the 4th bonus was near-web-immunity (75% reduction at level v)."
9/14/2010,"assault ships are supposed to be stronger, more resilient versions of frigates. interceptors are supposed to be faster, more agile versions. this is their role."

9/14/2010,"having had to deal with this a few times, i have my own opinions. this should have never been a ""reality"". it's risk is minimal (""oh god it's targeting me"" /dockdockdockdockdockdock) with the reward being extremely high (""lol look at my 6k shield tank on my sleipnir""). yeah, it's that dumb, trust me. it's a broken and abused mechanic that i am surprised ccp hasn't completely fixed. if ccp didn't think it was even remotely broken, they would not have bothered adding timers to rr'ers a year or so ago.yes, because there are absolutely no mercs operating in high sec for 0.0 alliances, obviously. /sarcasmemopandafacethere was nothing more painful than getting a contract only to get counter-contracted and have the biggest out of corp rr slugfest you have ever seen.us> ok guys, they have 12 out of corp rr'ers. do we still have our 5 out of corp guardians and 6 out of corp oineros on standby?them> we're undocking 15 more logis midfight, lol glhfus> fffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-there is a lot of pvp that happens in highsec. there would be even more fun pvp if ccp could find a way to fix mechanics like docking wars and out of corp rr. even the large 0.0 alliances have to deal with potential high sec problems due to always being war dec'd by other alliances/mercs."
9/14/2010,"of course you are going to say that, it is the only way your alliance gets kills.there is an easier way than all this baloney to fix this broken mechanic.repping should not aggress the logistics pilot, jumping through a gate is a valid tactic for us 0.0 pilots if it goes pear shaped.to rep someone in the first place, you have to be in the same fleet, not in fleet, no reps can be given.all members of that fleet acquire the same status as the war target, once they join the fleet they are also war targets.problem solved."
9/14/2010,"supported.personally i think neutral repping should be there with a couple of difference from the current way.first off, repping an agressed target should incurr an aggression timer... and...repping an agressed target should incurr a one way personal wardec meaning that anyone in the opposing corp get a week where the repper is free game but the other corp is still as untouchable as before.with this scenario neutral reppers would still occurr, but after that they would not be safe flying around. it should in effect work as a war dec meaning that during this time the opposing force can kill them as many times as they like.if the repper reps again during this personal wardec then the wardec is prolonged. the personal wardec is not connected to the original. so if the war ends the very next day the personal wardec is still in affect for a week."

9/14/2010,so i can now use the warfare link. it would be nice if i could use the ship for pvp fleet boosting as opposed to just pve.fix it already!!!

9/14/2010,"what exactly would make this harm eve? if anything, it would help eve by creating a lower dropout rate of new players. this means a larger population base over time which means a healthier mmo which means more development which means i could add an almost infinite amount of ""which means"" to this sentence. this topic has been brought up numerous times throughout the years and getting rid of learning skills completely always has more benefits than disadvantages.supported."

9/14/2010,i have never posted on the forums in the 4 years i've played this game.i recently came back to it after a 6 month break. this is the most perplexing change and step back i have ever seen of a fuctionality of the ui take. this makes non sense why they would remove it. on top of that i cant even find documentation stated by ccp why this was even a good idea besides the change over to eve gate bull****. its been what now? 2 going on 3 months of this bs?tl;drthis is is ****ing ******ed.

9/14/2010,"no sane insurance company in the real world would insure any active-duty war machine, and eve ships blow up far more often than their real-world counterparts. therefore, while it seems logical to say that ships destroyed by concord should not be covered by insurance policies, eve insurance is completely illogical to begin with. you might as well say, ""remove all insurance from eve"" (which i actually agree with, but that's purely personal preference).on a side note, i am lulz at this classic carebear whine thread. no matter how many years pass since ye olde days of stacked microwarpdrives, carebears keep on making these threads."

9/14/2010,"problem: so your corp alliance decides to move halfway across the universe for an op/campaign/shenanigans - cool. you load up your can/gsc/freight container/skiffs (oh wait...) full of everything you will need and quickly take off in a shuttle/ibis/7x plated abaddon for your final destination since there are not any of the logistics pilots online to move your stuff. you perk up with joy as one of the logistics pilots with a orca/freighter/jf/carrier logs on and is willing to move your stuff. you attempt to setup a contract and get an error stating you have damaged crystals/mining crystals and you are now 59 jumps out from your original destination with everything in a can(s). you then rage log/punch your desk/cry and contemplate life and why you can't have nice things.in all seriousness though, what is the reasoning behind the damaged crystals and not being able to contract them? is it something that would take a lot of development changes to fix?if it's really that big of an issue, can we at least get a warning telling us that we are putting damaged crystals in a container? some of us have multiple freight containers worth of modules/items that we need to move whenever we are going halfway across the galaxy. this can get a little frustrating at times when that one little crystal we missed slips in between all the other ammo. it usually leads into a hilarious vent/ts discussion, but it still sucks.solution: allow contracts to be setup with damaged crystals or give a warning stating that you are putting damaged crystals into a can and it will divide by 0 if you attempt to contract it."
9/14/2010,"i agree. as a work around though, you can set up a courier contract to whoever it is you want to move the stuff, and the person can then accept it and break the container to get the stuff that way instead."
9/14/2010,"making the dcu a passive module really benefits two groups of people. 1) people who die because they forget to turn their dcu on and 2) people who like to autopilot through highsec with expensive stuff in their cargo hold.i know it'd be great for afk hauling in my orca, with the huge structure on that thing.supported? not sure. it'd make my life easier if it was passive, but i'm not sure being easy is what eve is all about.don't know enough about the drone mods to comment on those one way or the other."
9/14/2010,"sounds good. less server load, less having to activate mods that behave just like passive ones anyway. tbh thinking about it, couldn't all hardeners be 'passive'? instead of making the server deal with thousands of mods cycling(3-4 per ship x the blob), and we all know how little tq likes things cycling, just give the active hardeners an equivalent passive cap penalty(mwd style). i can't think of a ship i use with active hardeners that don't just get them activated after every session change and left running til the next one. targeted mods(guns, smarties, reps et al), probes and prop mods are the only thing that really need player interaction imo. if the only time you interact with something is when the game turns it off, you restart it, it doesn't really add anything to the experience, other than lag. no actual change in cap use or functionality, therefore balance. only 2 potential problems i see are overheating, but frankly not having to wait for cycles to end to switch heat on and off, would be welcomed by me and possibly some of the slightly higher cap use mods like drone controls which tend to be run in bursts(during combat) in my experience rather than constantly from undocking like hardeners and dc's, but i don't think them having a smaller cap use/penalty than currently would be game breaking, end of the day they're just another damage mod and none of the others use any cap in of themselves.*waits for angry post about how this will break some niche ship*, but honestly if it reduces lag i can live with you having to refit. adapt or die and all that."
9/14/2010,"supported.will also make high sec ganking a little more ""interesting"""

9/14/2010,"if you disagree with dcu being passive because neuting a dcu into quiescence was essential for you getting a supercap kill... perhaps you want to discourage ccp from ""fixing"" lag since so many nullsec fights depend on lag in order for one side or the other to get a free win? just because the situation exists in the game and benefits you in some situations doesn't mean it was designed to be that way.dcu was supposed to be a passive module, the devs couldn't make it passive at the time due to limitations in the game engine. the game engine has changed since then to allow it to be passive but the change was simply never made.for what it's worth, i think a dcu would work better as a rig with a drawback of 5-10% on pg/cpu/cap.(edit: while being excessively verbose i neglected to indicate my support for the idea at the focus of this discussion)"
9/14/2010,supported
9/14/2010,"i'm going to have to disagree with this statement.one issue that will arise for certain is the bonuses (bonii/whatever) that will occur from passive boosting skills such as armor and shield compensation. you will essentially take an already extremely useful module and make it even that much more powerful. this could get completely out of hand on ships with high resist bonuses/bonii. now before diminishing returns gets brought up...diminishing returns, they will eat dc's alive on purely passive tanked ships. this could make them essentially useless for certain fits on the other hand~"
9/14/2010,"it should be pretty trivial to make sure those skills wont affect it.chances a dc is deactivated by neuts are very small, and most likely reactivated again immediatly by the pilot."
9/14/2010,"without having a direct answer from ccp/csm about that, it is actually a really bad idea to give a yay agreement towards this issue.edit: i think the idea is noble and is a great start, but the solution put forward is not complete. it really needs to be addressed whether armor and/or shield compensation skills will have any effect on a passive dcu. if they do not, i would be in full support of passive dcu's."
9/14/2010,"i disagree with this. personally i think your time can be spent on more important issues like dual monitor support, or the creation of an assault class destroyer.after reading the other link, i say bring it up at your next meeting to run a mass test on the test server. if it can be shown that dcu produce noticable lag, then i'll vote yes to making it passive. otherwise it's still a no."
9/14/2010,while i support this i feel that there are more important issues that the csm should be dealing with.
9/14/2010,it would be nice to have it passive. as ccp finally figured out how to implement module limitations on ships without using the stupid -99% cpu penalty workaround this shouldn't be hard to implement.
9/14/2010,"damage controls and drone control units should be passive, yes."
9/14/2010,very strongly supported.
9/14/2010,"i can't think of a more important issue than fixing lag. maybe i have different priorities. remember, that's the whole reason for this change, reduce lag. improving the tank of foolish people autopiloting orcas is an unfortunate side effect."
9/14/2010,"hmm, this just turned me from ""yeah, make them passive"" to ""hmm"". it would be a big boost for any afk haulers.no. active hardeners can most definitely be neuted off, unlike dcs, and there are several ships i use that doesn't turn on the invul until it's needed to save cap. additionally, passive mods can't be overheated.no, that shouldn't be a problem. active mods are also supposed to get a 3%/level bonus when they are not turned on, so if that had to be the case, an offline dc should already give 15% armor and 15% shield resist when turned off.not really considering how fast you will get back 1 unit of cap, and even if you manage it, it will be back on about a second later. it may affect the chance of killing a super cap that tried saving itself by logging off, but that is a separate issue that should be fixed some other way by either automatically turning off all hardeners when logging out or increased log off time for ships with extreme buffers or something.this should be a very easy tweak, i'd be surprised if it took more then 15 minutes for a single programmer to make the change."
9/14/2010,"while i would welcome my 250k ehp afk hauling orca (structure tank ftw), i still think the dcu should be active so you can neut it off."
9/14/2010,"confirming that my dcu is neuted off quite often in pvp, and it's been when using a bc against two or three other opponents max, not even with capital warfare. not that i'd object to not having to worry about this, but it has made a significant difference in the fights where it has occurred, including one painful 1v1."
9/14/2010,"i think people are underestimating how common it is for a dcu to be neuted off. there's a couple of reasons:- the way your cap recharge works, when it's nailed to 0 you're getting way less cap/second than you do at your peak. in practise getting that 1 cap back in any subcap ship often doesn't happen. i've sure been in that situation quite a few times. in a supercap i don't know... but i'm sure it's not inevitable with dozens of neuts properly staggered on you.- when dcu is neuted off i at least often don't notice immediately, it's not the kind of thing i'm expecting. result is it's definetely not going back on 1 second later. more like 20-30 seconds or never. watch fraps back later -> oh **** my dcu was off that whole time.i'd rather see the code fixed and optimised so it can handle the game as-designed before dumbing down gameplay in the name of lag. that said, this is a very minor aspect of gameplay. if it turns out it helps significantly, then that's probably a sign of a deeper performanc issue, but nor is it exactly going to ruin gameplay to make em passive.the other thing it would help mitigate is people dying while blackscreened on jump/log-in before they can activate dcu/hardeners. but again i'd rather see those cases reimbursed properly, in the interim until blackscreening is 100% fixed.any dumbing down to fix lag that approaches anything like this:needs to be avoided."
9/14/2010,"could they also fix this by somehow grouping/synchronizing/batching module cycles?what about letting us group more kinds of modules (sensor boosters, invulns, hardeners, reppers)? or even grouping different kinds of modules into 'units' (different kinds of hardeners, hardeners and reppers, invuln + damage control or whatever)surely you can do some sort of optimizations to reduce the back-and-forth and calculations when dealing with grouped modules. if that comes at the expense of some granularity, so be it.this would have the advantage of making the ui better. bonus points if you figure out a way to make the overheating interface not terrible, while you're at it.also, this would be way more fruitful than taking a couple of kinds of modules and making them passive (granted dcu is on almost every ship in a fleet fight). if you could reduce the effective number of active modules to 3 or 4 per ship (guns grouped, a 'tank' group, propulsion module, and theoretically an 'active tank' group but nobody uses those in fleet fights anyways), i think that'd be more effective, and would, yknow, make the game better while you were at it."
9/14/2010,"modules with identical cycle times tend to self-syncronise over time already. i guess it's just a quirk of the system, but it could perhaps be taken advantage of."
9/14/2010,i like to think of the primae as more of a collector's item...but it should be a useful one. supported for the sake of actually having a reason for people to use it.

9/14/2010,"i believe he's referring to the latest two csm meetings, wherein the issue of whether to release the results of the ccp release planning (i.e. the meeting where ccp decided which, if any, of the csm proposals to implement for the next expansion).apparently this meeting went so badly that several csm members objected to the publication of 'the list' (of granted and rejected feature requests) and voted to never release it. csm members were so embarassed by ccp's (apparent) wholesale rejection of feature requests that several of them voted to tell us nothing about it. also, how did korvin's answer to a yes/no question manage to contain an nda violation? weird.from"
9/14/2010,"even if this proposal gets over 9000 thumbs up, csm will never release anything that shows how useless they. they will continue to act like the csm is helping so they can keep getting free subscriptions and free trips to iceland."
9/14/2010,"i've been trying to work out what this guy was complaining about. as far as the planning meeting outcomes, that is ccp's information and we couldn't pass it on till we had agreement from them. once we had permission to make it public we (well most of us) wanted to roll it into a csm publication already in progress. it is due to be released this week, but feel free to jump on the csm hate bandwagon, i think there is a little more space left. incorrect. the vote to release the list as part of the in progress publication passed and the list will be public this week.korvin made direct reference to something due to be made public this week that ccp expressly told us they didn't want leaked till then.if you'd followed the argument in the previous two meetings you'd note that the reason some csm were not willing to push the list as part of this publication is that they felt it wasn't a good enough response from ccp. they wanted ccp to put out the list instead of it going out with a csm stamp of approval. at no point was it going to be permanently suppressed from the players.you back up my point above, the inclusion of the list in the publication later this week passed. mynxee had the controlling vote and passed it.a bit further along in the minutes you'll note the 8 votes agreeing to release the publication this week watch this space."

9/14/2010,"calling it like i saw it, spare me the martyrdomyes, it passed on a tie vote. several people at the last meeting and this one voted against it. i didn't say the vote failed. less pedantry, please. if you talked down to people less, you might find yourself more infrequently the target of 'hate bandwagons.' this wasn't clear from the chatlogs. the only discussion i saw on the issue was meissa saying ""no this'll make us look bad"" and someone else saying ""hey maybe we should push back more against ccp first"" at the previous meeting. i didn't see anyone say ""no we should make ccp release it themselves"" (on what kind of timetable? when the patch notes hit for the new expansion?)anyways, yes, we did ascertain that the vote passed; we're not illiterate. we're annoyed that several people voted against releasing the minutes. if the alternative was ccp will release them in their own dev blog on the same timetable, then that was not made clear, but i don't think anyone made such a representation. the only discussion i saw of the issue was people whining about how it might make them look bad, and then it barely passed on a tie vote.if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen and keep your self pity to yourselves."
9/14/2010,"quite right, i misinterpreted your post a bit and should have been a less defensive in my reply.that's what i get for quickly replying before work."
9/14/2010,"i'm not talking about the overall quality of the posting, i mean the forums themselves and the software that runs it.why does it never remember whether or not i want to see signatures and images? why does it never remember my default posting character?why does that search box to the right suck so badly and search the entire website instead of the forums? why do i have to go to eve-search.com to search these forums? someone else has to build another website to search the forums?why do they not have an automated dev finder? instead, every week or so some intern posts the blue posts in their ""dev finder"" section with date/time stamps that reflect when the intern posts the link instead of when the dev actually made the post. could no one at ccp think of a stupider way to aggregate blue posts? let alone the inability to send private messages, or integrate with evegate/ingame mail.these forums basically appear to have come from some angelfire page circa 1997. take your php twits away from spacebook and have them bring this **** into the current century, please."
9/14/2010,"supported - this forum is horrible.and no, don't use the upgrade as an excuse to install something even more ridiculously annoying like captchas."
9/14/2010,better solution:quit writing your own forum software and customize one of the excellent ones freely available on the internet.then you can focus on what you do best.making kick ass games.
9/14/2010,you had me at search box. does anyone even use that thing?
9/14/2010,do it ccp. these forums need an upgrade.
9/14/2010,new forums are actually in development. unfortunately we have no fixed date as to when they will be deployed but they are coming and work is already under way.
9/14/2010,can we get a sneakpeak or do we have to wait till it gets implented?
9/14/2010,"good to hear. while you're at it, it would probably enhance your social media strategy to make some sort of dynamic 'front page' to the forums. show the most popular/talked-about threads in a particular forum within the past day/week/month/whatever, or the most supported items for the month in the ah.maybe you could even let spacebook users specify which forums they were interested in, generate a dashboard, and let community reps or isds or csms or whatever have some ability to help push stories/threads into the 'breaking news' or 'hot item' or whatever areas.but, yeah. i'll settle for not having to go turn on images every time i want to see them, or having a search that actually works and doesn't require me to visit another website."
9/14/2010,"the issue with this is the ability for the vargur to use long range adaptations. as it stands the other marauders can use both a long range and short range weapons system without sacrificing slots to adapt to a long range fix. e.g. using power grid mods to increase the power grid.for the varger to use a long range fit, tech 2 fitted, you must use ancillary current router, and reactor control units to make the long range fitting work.so my proposal is, increase the vargurs power grid to a base of 9000. this will allow the use of long range w/o having to sacrifice other fittings to keep in line with long range fits of other marauders.opinion i mean come on you have to put on rigs and reactor controls to put some 1400's on the thing where as on a paladin you can slap on 4 tachyons and run off and play? also i know its a ac boat for teh most part but it would be nice to have the option available."
9/14/2010,"the vargur is already one of the best and most flexible marauders due to it's ammo versatility and it has excellent range even with short range weapons. there is no reason to buff it. apart from that, many ships have trouble fitting the largest possible guns of their class unless they fit rigs or modules to make it possible. the vargur is not at any disadvantage here."
9/14/2010,"why are you trying to put 1400 on the vargur?it has a 10% falloff bonus for a reason, with some range mods the autocannons can have a falloff of 80+ km, which gives you the ability to hit targets at 40+ kms with the majority of dps, and the autocannons can also track cruiser-sized targets orbiting at 20-30km. the majority of lvl4 missions contains bs that orbits at 30-50km and cruisers orbiting at 20-30km, and the vargur can deal very good damage to them all, so it does its job of a ac lvl4 mission runner very well. putting arties on it and you actually decrease your efficiency as arty has less dps and you'll have to rely on drones to take out the orbiting cruisers. if you want a high-end pvp sniping boat, try the mach."
9/14/2010,"oh, right.. because that stasis webbing bonus on the kronos is so useful"
9/14/2010,have fun hitting angel ships without it. especially with rails.
9/14/2010,have fun using rails period. bleh.
9/14/2010,well ... thats the other issue... i would rather bring a golem with torps and ab than a kronos. =)speed tanking golem is fun to fly. though blaster kronos can be fun in angel missions or damsel.
9/14/2010,who ever said the vargur was to just be used for missions? i think people seem offended that a marauder can be used outside of pve. i think op wants some sort of pvp option on it using arts which i am all for. i made an art vargur on the test server for lulz. got some omgwtfbbq results.oh and inb4 all the carebears that say marauders are only good for pve. seriously set it up right and you have a beastly pvp gank ship with them.
9/14/2010,"and the only really viable option for pvp in a marauder is small gang. for fleet battle what normally happens is this. (not to mention it was fail fit)so lets assume you want to make your vargur a sniper. who cares about tank then? dmg mods, some mods for speed/agility, some fitting mods, a bit shield buffer. (similar to the maelstrom/tempest) but iirc the alpha from the vargur isnt really impressive compared to the tech 1 minmatar battleships.and for the 800mm ac small gang fit you have no issues at all fitting the ship.so your argument falls pretty short."
9/14/2010,"not to mention that if one ecm ship sneezes next to a marauder, it loses lock."
9/14/2010,"i've been playing eve for some time now and one thing i've noticed is, standings take even longer to draw back than sec status, and are even longer to go up than skills. what i propose is though, is something like the re-map feature for attributes... but for skills.but instead of being able to change the standings, you'd reset them.... all of them, the good and the bad, meaning you could enter any empire again, but would lose the ability for your jump clone creation at the same time.this would be only available once a year like a re-map and may or may not include a sec status reset and lp removal too.i thought of this as new players tend to be thrown in at the deep end, with everything to learn about skills and fits and earning isk its not often people learn about the standings and how they can be of benefit or can hinder your ability to play."
9/14/2010,blood-stained stars aka: a way to dramatically improve your standings with a faction that even a new player can accomplish. there are skills that help as well. just need to get your effective standings to 0 to run some faction-specific epic missions anyway. add to that agents that you can turn in tags for standing with and i really don't see what the problem is. it is pretty easy to improve standings.
9/14/2010,"there is a reason some people put in so much effort to balance their standings. choices and consequences, working as intended."
9/14/2010,allow bookmarks on a room you cleared from enemies.
9/14/2010,this makes no sense at all.....
9/14/2010,i am not even sure why you would want/need this.the only scenario that is even slightly plausible is to save yourself the effort of slow boating your hulk across 120km to get to the gate with the really good stuff on the other side.not supported.
9/14/2010,"so, as any of you who have mis-double clicked on a structure in pi have no doubt figured out, if you double click on the planet's surface, it takes you directly to your command center - do not pass go, do not collect 200 isk.this isn't really that annoying - unless, of course, you are managing a dozen extractors on the opposite side of the planet from your command center, which results in you having to waste time spinning the planet around into the proper position again. only to have it do it again when the cat decides to bump your mouse mid click. cue the jeopardy theme while i look for my extractors for the second...make that third time.my proposal is actually pretty simple and consists of two options, either of which provides a solution to the annoyance.option 1: turn off the double click and make the ""go to command center"" an option on the planet's right click menu (if it's not there already - honestly, i never look at my command centers, so i don't know if it's there or not).option 2: leave the double click as is and add the ability to right click on the planet';s surface and get a go to menu that would group your buildings by categories and then by name. so i could right click, choose go to> starports> fed-897 and have it swivel the planet around to that particular location on the surface. (it might be nice if we could name our planetary structures, but i'm not holding my breath).thanks."
9/14/2010,forget all thathow aboutrightclick command center -> reschedule all extractors -> select cycle -> submit.instead of having to click click click click click click click.. and click some more.
9/14/2010,i am definitely not opposed to that as an alternative solution. it solves my problem by default.
9/14/2010,"i am one of those players that left after six months (actually 3). i have to say though that war decs were thoroughly enjoyable and one of the better experiences i had. simply learning to survive was fun! the real problem with 3-6 month players leaving is that you gain a great understanding of the game after three months, but realize it will take nearly 2 years to become a valuable asset to any serious corp. that's why people leave, why should i spend nearly 21 months being useless when i can play another game?edit:i only came back because i'm so drawn to the theory and excitement (and economic realism) of the game through the news of the community and am willing to put some time into the game to get this satisfaction. however, most players are not going to come back or keep up with the news/community of a game that they abandoned."
9/14/2010,"ccp is hoping you'd spend real money, sell plex, and buy an old char."
9/14/2010,"i would like to see something that if you war dec a corp and then retract the war dec, a portion of the cost should go to the corp you war dec'd.i agree with the 5mill being too low.still impartial on the increasing vs flat fee."
9/14/2010,"my corp moved to nullsec when i was a one month old character and it was the best thing to ever happen to me.the concept that it takes two years to be useful is just plain wrong (i've only just hit one year now and flying hacs and recons for two races). t1 frigs and cruisers help in any engagement - sure you may not be as useful as those in t2 frigs and cruisers, but every bit of support helps. and there's more to being useful than pvp - newer players can scout for freighters or cyno capitals or any number of useful things.perhaps it's perceptions that need to be changed, cause i sure saw the value i could get and provide to a 0.0 corp/alliance very quickly.back to the main topic, from my perspective (having spent most of my time in the game in 0.0) wardecs are just an extension of 0.0 into empire in limited amounts. i see it as a mechanism for 0.0 entities to cancel out any safe haven for those who attack their space, but one that can be used by people to get cheap kills.quite frankly empire griefers are pansies (often called bullies) who like being able to get the upper hand whether they warrant it or not. if you want pvp action go to low/0.0 instead of wardeccing. if you have a purpose for being able to attack people in empire then fine. kb stats puffed up with noob kills are pretty much worthless.so, i see limiting the ability to wardec random noobs as a good thing. exactly how to do that however is the sticking point."
9/14/2010,"i would support fixing that so that you do not loose cap, but this quote from the op means i can't support this thread despite that:"
9/14/2010,"i think that is in reference to how characters usually sit in super caps and they can't dock, so you always logout in the ship. if you log out, go to bed, go to work, come back home, log back in and your cap is lower than when you logged off... something is wrong. it should cap back up. i wouldn't worry about caps recharging (with the exception of a jump freighter) inside the 30 sec invuln time. it might be possible for some, but the fits to do such a thing would be ridiculous.i just eft'd it. a chimera, with a full rack of t2 cap rechargers and a full rack of cap power relays and all lvl5 skills still would take 3.5 minutes to recharge the cap from dead, so even that would take around a minute to go from a jump to being ready to jump again. t2 cccs get it to 1m45s, so that would possibly be able to accomplish this feat... again, ridiculous fitting."

9/14/2010,"supported.im not suggesting the new players have their hand held for them, but this game is quite complex and overwhelming for a beginner, so tweaks here would alleviate this and hopefull keep hold of more of the players who come to give this game a go."
9/14/2010,"1) i'm pretty sure this is intentional. it isn't extremely hard to figure out how to find the prerequisite skill and buy it. in fact, forcing a player to learn how to do all of these steps is going to teach more than just simply injecting a skillbook.2) this issue does seem kind of weird. they should at least let you repeat the mission if anything. i will support the thread because of this issue."

9/14/2010,"you have not provided any indication of why sovereignty in w-space would be necessary, or at the very least not game-breaking.nullsec is highly connected, sovereignty is required in order to prevent certain things from happening such as cynoing in fleets of capital ships. since you cannot jump into w-space systems, there is no need for cyno jammers, cyno beacons, or jump bridges. thus there is no need for sovereignty to defend from hostile fleets.sleeper wrecks are already more valuable than k-space npc wrecks. the process for getting more of them is exploration-heavy. w-space is about exploration in dangerous space. the process for getting more k-space npc wrecks involves having more people in pew-pew ships in your sovereign space. nullsec is about ""feet on the ground"", so the k-space npc system (along with the ihub upgrades) works well for k-space.you have the tools to prevent roaming gangs of caps landing in your lap. in fact you have better tools than most people in nullsec, since you have the ability to shut down any entrance the invaders might find.if you want more than w-space offers, go where the experience you want is on offer. if you want to claim sovereignty and have your alliance name in orange up in the top left corner of the screen, head out to nullsec.if you have problems with big fleets invading your space now, what makes you think that having sovereignty will make things any easier for you?"

9/14/2010,"so i am a fairly new player to eve online. i have been active for approximately 5 months now. i have found the gameplay to be engaging and the level of player interaction to be far beyond that of any game out there, even world of warcraft cannot compete with the amount of player based interaction. however with all of these accolades behind them, and so much emphasis on a system where players become the ""good"" or ""bad"" guys and run the economy; how could ccp leave out what is possibly the most powerful player tool available. what tool could that be? player generated mods. wow allows players to create mods for huds and much more. ccp should allow us as players to at least create simple hud mods so we can customize our displays. i understand the need for security in eve, and how modding could jeopardize that, but with strict rules and players supporting these rules mods could help fill in some what may be missing or could allow us to streamline our displays and make our gameplay more efficient. in short, the pro's of allowing player created mods far outweight the con's, security risks can be mitigated by players being involved and ever vigilant for those who are abusing the ability to create mods, and last, gamers would have one more element of control in new eden, and isn't that what eve is about? player control and interaction on an unheard of scale."
9/14/2010,you clearly don't understand eve or ccp yet from the 5 months you've been playing.

9/14/2010,"yeah... i deffinately didnt make a comparison. i made a refference. there is a big difference between the two. in a comparison i would have linked similarities between the two games. seeing as how i never linked any similarities, i only made a refference to a dynamic and active part of their player base, and said that it would be a great tool for this game; what would make you think that you have any sense of understanding? now a comparison would be me comparing your childish and immature response to that of a typical wower. see what i did there. that was a comparison. as for you other guys, mods dont change the game only the visuals and interface in the computer that the mod is downloaded on so new players wouldnt have to use mods until they personally felt they were ready and when more experienced ppl used them it wouldnt give them any real advantage over newbs or miners. and yes i do understand eve and ccp because if i didnt would i have made a proposal in this forum"
9/14/2010,you said it yourself.
9/14/2010,"for the love of all that is holy, please learn to separate your stream of consciousness writing into paragraphs?in world of warcraft, the user-generated ui extras are called ""addons"" - ""mods"" invokes ideas of converting homeworld to use eve online ship models, or writing new content to produce ""counterstrike"" on top of the halflife engine for example.addons achieve their effectiveness by the game providing an xml/lua engine under which is an api which provides the lua code access to certain data structures, along with controlled mechanisms to activate game features (eg: start casting a spell).wow is an example of how releasing code on two platforms simultaneously can increase the overall quality of the software, and it is an example of where providing the api for a ui makes the game code itself cleaner since there is a better separation between game client/local simulator and the ui.ccp is now discovering through their ""thin client"" what blizzard has known all along: there are places in the code where you can do things more cleanly, there are plenty of efficiency gains to be achieved by refactoring the code that's been lying untouched for years.in my opinion, adding the ability to customise your ui will be a lot of work for ccp, but all that work will be extremely useful in terms of identifying further ui/simulation bottlenecks, cleaning up data and command flows, and rethinking just how much data needs to be sent to the client, and just how much trust needs to be put in the client doing things ""the right way"" - such as allowing the client to decide when to sign on to the local channel after the simulation has started accepting input from flight controls.pushing for development of the ui engine and api that will allow something along the lines of addons for eve online is a great way to dig up all this messy code and get it cleaned up by the teams who have a vested interest in getting that code fit for purpose.personally, i'd love to have a ui that was subtly different when flying caldari ships versus minmatar ships. something along the lines of the different ui in starcraft when playing zerg/protoss/terran. alliances could even tailor their ""corporate soe"" ui to suit their particular style of zealot/guardian gang, or their particular style of sb gang. giving players control over the fiddly little things like having chat windows staying stacked between logins, or properly rearranging overview windows when resizing the screen, means that ccp can focus on other more important things like cleaning up the code base, focussing on the quality of their simulator and 3d modelling.the thousands of players who have an interest in tinkering with uis to make them prettier/more functional/more efficient will have a greater impact on the game than the dozens of ccp-paid developers who - while doing an excellent job given their time constraints - just don't have the hours in a year to put the polish into the ui that contemporary gamers demand.ccp could start by moving the current interface to the community/crowdsource domain, documenting the allowed api, and leaving it to the community to sort out the issues of location/size/operation of overloading buttons, while the ui team focusses on giving the community better ui building tools.as for concerns about customisable ui being exploitable by bots? i'm sure there are bots out there that talk eve protocol directly to the server without any ccp client code being involved. the way to handle bots is to assume that the client cannot be trusted to be ""human"". design the game to reward human capabilities (ie: interaction with other humans) and punish robot cababilities (ie: the love of things that are easily automated)."

9/14/2010,"the disagreement regarding publication of the list began after it had been drafted.while the csm is full wonderful people with exceptional skills, none of us, alas, is gifted with precognition.my own super-power, for example, is the unerring ability to drive straight to the best currently available parking space. unfortunately, i have not yet figured out how i can use this power to fight crime."

9/14/2010,"other players :di'd say revelations part 1. it gave us probes, replaced the old escrow system with contracts, tier 2 battlecruisers,tech 2 invention as opposed to the lottery, rigs and the current gang/fleet system and skill bonuses.i think they should be an even mix of new stuff and improved old stuff. the latter is important, but without the former, people inevitably get bored. i don't think ""bother"" is the right word... i'd be a little disappointed because i think one of the things that keeps the game vibrant and alive is the two expansions per year schedule. big mega-expansions are nice, but a year is a long time to wait.going back to revelations 1 again - it's all about the invention. i've never even seen a tech 2 bpo, but i make a very healthy living off selling tech 2 modules because i can build them anyway. as a roleplayer, i also found that empyrean age had a big effect too, but not as pronounced. i don't think i've ever been negatively affected by any expansion."
9/14/2010,"1. a lack of low/nullsec pvp that doesn't involve getting dropped on by at least a nyx. this should not be super-caps online.2. apocrypha. wormholes rock.3. making eve a better game. that may involve releasing new content or improving old content, but the end result is to make eve better.4. it would bother me if the expansions held the same level of content/improvements as before, but if the expansions increased in quality as they increased in rarity, that would be fine by me.5. dominion really made eve go back to suckville. the sovereignty changes utterly failed, and of course the lag which had been rather nicely reduced by apocrypha mysteriously found its way back into the game. i used to look forward to being part of a nullsec empire; now the idea just sorta makes me want to cry.some thoughts and ideas on sov changes:tcus should be automatically onlined; no more ninja-sov holding with offlined tcus. classic example of a good idea with idiotic implementation by ccp. definitely ruining things for small alliances rather than helping them. also: make sov bills scale with the size of the empire being controlled, and make tcus/ihubs cheaper so smaller alliances can afford them.gravimetric upgrades and anomaly upgrades need rebalancing/adjusting. things should not be a choice between mining spodumain and running sanctums in the same system 24/7.alliances need to have some kind of delay/vote before being disbanded. it's quite possibly the stupidest reasoning ever to allow them to be instantly disbanded while kicking a single corp member can take upwards of 24 hours. it is a sad commentary on ccp's alliance design that 94% of all alliance disintegrations are caused at the click of a single button, rather than through actual combat. it is even sadder when they use this as a marketing ploy.alliances need to have reasons to fight each other besides boredom and epeen stroking. scarcer abc ores and changes in anomaly spawning come to mind. capital ships, supercaps, and titans need to have the log-offskying survival tactic fixed.outposts should be destroyable. they are the one player-constructed thing in eve that is not. that is stupid.that's all that i can think of off the top of my head right now. kudoes to ccp for changing the titan aoe doomsday to a focused beam; sometimes they're bound to get something right, even if it's by accident."

9/15/2010,"this logic doesn't make any sense. this is like saying ""we shouldn't allow more than 1 pos per system because destroying them all could take time."" stations don't need to be conquered to conquer a system regardless. the fact is, if more stations exist in a system, the system is worth more, and should take more time to conquer.i'd like to reiterate my point that arbitrarily limiting nulsec system counts to 0 doesn't make sense."
9/15/2010,or only one of these stations would be tied to sov as designated by the sov holders. you would of course be unable to change the station once sbu's have been anchored. would need a way to flag it on the system view though so the attacker knew which was tied to sov.supporting the **** out of this
9/15/2010,"sounds like a good idea, as long as only 1 can affect sov and it has a big sign saying 'this station controls sov for this system' painted on it somewhere all can see it."
9/15/2010,"if only one was tied to sov, i would agreed. the problem i had raised the last time this was proposed was that dumping 10 stations, each tied to sov, into one system could make that system an impenetrable fortress."
9/15/2010,not supporting until ccp allows destruction of said outposts to be possible.it's bad enough that they can never be removed... but allowing them to exponentially increase is just not a good idea in my book.don't get me wrong... i'm all in favor of such an idea due to the obvious fact there are multiple stations in various high sec systems throughout the cluster.but there's gotta be a balancing mechanism here.

9/15/2010,"without reading anything at all that was posted above me,i am in favor of removing insurance reimbursement for any engagement involving concord officials. also, we want prostitutes to start dropping again. they can't all be exotic dancers."
9/15/2010,"firstly, two points:1) when you log in, you consent to the eula. you do not consent to pvp or indeed any other specific activity, of which there are many. the ""you consent to pvp by playing the game"" is a fabricated excuse. there are some reasonable expectations you should bring into the game, but nothing so specific (anyway, in my experience criminals run away screaming from people who explicitely consent to fighting them pvp).2) ccp does not in fact support griefing under any guise, and does not intend the game to be used as such. see here for example.it amuses me that many use the justification of 'its only a game' for griefing behaviour; it appears in fact to be for precisely this reason that ccp regards it as unacceptable! it also amuses me that many say they grief as a form of 'protest' against the existance of high security space and the people who 'hide behind it' as a minimal-risk mechanic, whilst themselves hiding behind the minimal risk mechanic of insurance to effectively pay for their habit...ok, on the subjects the op raised, i do think it ridiculous that concord effectively subsidises criminal activity (whether done for 'in-game' reasons or griefing). i don't think that people who suicide gank purely for in-game profit should be prevented from such activities though. they are the bandits of eve, scum but characterful scum (and who wants to live in a fascist utopia anyway?). i also think it wrong that people who make a genuine mistake, particularly new players, and get concorded, should be denied insurance. indeed, this has been stated by ccp as exactly the reason they haven't already changed insurance to reflect this (in itself presenting another firm line against the 'legitimacy' of pure griefing).one solution to this dilemma could be to say you have a '3 strikes and you're out' policy on concord insurance per account (important that it be so, rather than per character, if anti-griefing is indeed the goal). yes it is still possible to work around, but more difficult and less worth the effort. probably not possible on per account basis though due to coding.otoh, it does impact against for-profit suicide gankers, who ccp evidently regard as legitimate users of game mechanics (me too, but that doesn't matter); whilst this can be reduced by sticking to genuinly profitable targets (as they should be anyway for thieving professions), one might consider a mechanic such as slightly more generous cargo drops for 'criminal' kills within hisec only. easily justified as a bandit taking extra care to minimise cargo loss, as opposed to the more hectic and hostile enviroments of losec/nullsec where they wouldn't have the chance to take so much care. note that this mechanic should only be given if it is to balance out a mechanic against it, not as an excuse to just make a more profitable sideline for griefing.i also don't support the argument that concord should 'safeguard' wrecks; as above, i don't see genuine banditry as a practice to be stamped out.however, the elephant in the room is for any of this to all be truly effective, there needs to be an improvement of losec as an enviroment (nullsec needs some polishing too). that'll not only more obviously seperate out the pathetic little scumbag griefers (who'll continue to hide in hisec whilst whining about it) from the big manly pirates (who took to griefing because losec sucks worse, and will rush back for some proper pvp), it'll enrich the game experience as a whole (and better yet tempt a few of the 'good citizen' hisec players out of their reasonably safe home to indulge in some righteous carnage too)"

9/15/2010,"supported.if your fleet's ability to take down a capital or any other target hinges on being able to neut off this one module, i think you need to re-evaluate your attack strategy."
9/15/2010,"this is a much bigger concern than supercap kills, afk hauling means the dcu is of no use to you. if dcu are completely passive it will nerf suicide ganking."

9/15/2010,why would the resistance calculations be any different to what they are now?this proposal is about making the damage control unit and drone control unit not require capacitor (and thus need to be turned on) in order to function.nothing else will change except that the module will no longer require cap to be activated.
9/15/2010,"supported. anything that lowers the number of unnecessary clicks gets my support. there is no reason for a dcu to be active.i can't really think of any other modules. i wish we could say sensor boosters, but those need to be able to be neuted. i am just lazy :)"
9/15/2010,"i am not sure that making this module passive is a good idear.they are already pretty much a must fit on many setups.maybe if the mod also introduced a hard cap limit, or a percentage recharge reduction, or perhaps if it increased (doubled?) neut/nos damage.i like the idea of having it as a rig instead of a module.as for passive hauling, might even be interesting to force someone to choose between a cargo extender, a dcu or maneuverability enhancements.but i think what irks me most that it is a suggested change only to reduce lag, not because people thought it ought to be a passive mod to begin with.it's basically the same as suggesting removing halve the weapon slots from all ships and doubling the damage output from each weapon (with some added fitting changes for the ships or the weapons), or basicallly removing seperate hit and damage calculations from grouped weapons.sure it would reduce lag, but would it enhance eve?"
9/15/2010,"first of all, thanks for the intelligent discussion of the topic. this is exactly the kind of feedback ccp needs, and ccp veritas has said he's monitoring this thread.one item that i have found particularly interesting:* if it turns out that this change would not significantly reduce server load, there may be an argument for a game improvement that automatically restarts modules like dcus and hardeners after decloaking from a manual jump.please keep the comments coming."
9/15/2010,+1 for change to passive. imo it just adds unnecessary chores to flying around.as if you'd ever want it turned off.
9/15/2010,that would be an idea which i could support. unprojected modules remembering their activity state.
9/15/2010,yes. restarting the hardener modules after jump is tedious.
9/15/2010,"have fun killing a 60million ehp ship in a cyno jammed system. if you do not neut off it's dcu and hardeners, they can just log off and will disappear after 15 minutes unless you bring more than 250 dps battleships. by bringing a neut on every battleship, the number is cut down to 80-100 instead. i think that's good enough reason to not have it be a passive module.this i can support."
9/15/2010,"to those making the argument that a dcu is easy to shut off: i have been on the receiving and giving end of a curse neuting a ceptor. it most definitely bottoms out the cap in a ceptor, whether it is a heavy neut curse or a curse with a pile of mediums, it instantly empties the cap in a ceptor. despite that, a ceptor is still able to get enough cap to initiate warp within the cycle time of the neuts. that cycle time is less than 30 seconds. so, no, if a dcu gets shut off, there are either so many ships against the dcu ship that he's dead anyway or the neut ship just gets really, really, lucky.i don't think that is a valid argument."
9/15/2010,"good sir. have you read my post at all?edit: to put things into perspective, neuting off an aeon's dcu lowers it's ehp from 28mil (with all hardeners neuted off already) to 23mil. that's 5mil less ehp. and if you have 50 battleships neuting it, it's going to go down in a couple cycles."
9/15/2010,"yup. someone had posted a solution to that. one that should already exist. ccp is aware that people log out in super caps to avoid dying. the solution was ""if you log, your modules no longer impact the ship"" i think this is what happens when you eject anyway, and a logoffski is basically the same kind of thing, i.e. bailing.i've never been involved in a successful titan take-down, so i have to claim ignorance when it comes to that topic. but if making dcus passive can shave off some noticeable server load in all cases, i'm willing to see more titans slip through my fingers. you're also talking about a remote situation after all. not only is a titan tackled, but you only have enough firepower to take it out with the dcu off before it disappears. that is an exceedingly rare occurrence."
9/15/2010,"bagehi: when you log off the first time, all your modules keep running, when you try to log in again and log off again ... then they turn off.atleast from my experience."
9/15/2010,supported.

9/15/2010,"gesundheit, blackbird but seriously, i think that a ship's ability to fit 1 or 2 viable setups with only one type of weapon should hardly mean that it should not be allowed to fit others. marauders should be versatile; how freaking long does it take to train them?a marauder is hugely expensive [relatively] and essentially an endgame mission ship. it really should have the powergrid necessary to fit any projectile [or even hybrid; i don't judge. i do lol, however] weapons system.tl;dr a marauder is supposed to be the ultimate mission ship; after working so hard to get one, it should have the flexibility to fit both weapons systems [long and short range]"
9/15/2010,"i, too, want 1400s on my vargurs. not even gonna train marauders skill until it's grid gets buffed, even though i have all prereqs.edit: speaking of vargurs, it's t1 version also needs some kind of buff. incidentally i'd prefer a grid buff over anything else."

9/15/2010,"even with connections, social and diplomacy all at v you cannot get good standings accross the board with empire factions (ccp has told me themselves). and even with diplomacy v a mistake as a new character or even a choice in the past could lead you to be -6 to a empire faction. choice and consequence is all well and good but not when people change their mind ( and people do it alot ) and then have to live with that choice in a game? even if it means they no longer enjoy the game? i think not. especially as the only way to get those standings up then would be to have another player/character mission and share standings with a corp/agent so you could mission in low sec where concord/police wouldn't get involved and you could spend weeks clawing your standings back. if not more.missioning for many isn't so much fun as it is merely a way to earn some isk, not everyone buys & sells plexs, not everyone wants to sit there watching a ship mine or dare i say it as there are some that do... use bots to mine with.the whole idea behind a re-map for attributes, was so that you could train faster in a certain area (draw back being slower in other areas but it meant you could have more fun because the skills you wanted would train faster. this feature would be no different, it would be fair to all as everyone would have the choice to use it or not.epic arcs & cosmos missions are intended to increase already positive standings rather than 0 or negative standings. as always though i'm fully aware that some will back this while others will sit there and pick holes in others suggestions instead of making their own. so feel free to continue to do so."

9/15/2010,it is a game for me but in game it is in fact work to my character. if i had a cent for everytime someone said that...
9/15/2010,"so far, i agree. you should not log back in with less cap then you had when you logged out (unless someone somehow managed to neut you in the time between your log off and your ships removal from the game).this is the part i disagree with. it should not cap up, it should stay the same. if you log out with 28.75% cap (what you'd have after making a jump starting with max cap), you should log back in with 28.75% cap, no more and no less.the invul time is actually a minute, i have tested it multiple times trying to lock a capital that i just lit a cyno for after its 30 second session change has expired. that is not really what i'm worried about though, and if you manage to create a fit that can do it, then you don't need to log out at all. i wouldn't even have a problem with it since you'd have to give up everything else you could have fitted in your lows, mids and rig slots. what i don't want to happen is caps being able to jump somewhere, log off before their invulnerability timer ends (in order to make sure noone can aggro them causing a 15 minute timer), and then waiting for however long it takes your cap to recharge before logging back in again and jumping out as soon as you exit warp. if that is made possible, (super)capitals using it would be impossible to kill since there is no time to kill them after they jump in before they log out, and once they log in, it will take most more then 60 seconds (original session change after logging in+30 seconds for joining fleet session change) to align for warp to where they were before they logged and then actually warp there, meaning that if the cyno is lit before the ship actually lands where it logged out, it will be ready to jump the second it lands before anything even gets to start locking. as a side point, if you find those 60 seconds to be too much, it could even be reduced to 30 seconds since the char forming a fleet will be put in it immediately regardless of if he already had a session change in progress or not."

9/15/2010,"honestly, most of the fixes that made that list are things that people have been waiting for more than a year to see. i don't think they'll be outrage at this point that something isn't included. as someone had said in the minutes, not everything makes it to release. i will admit that if csm publishes a list then something from the list doesn't show up in the release, rational or not, i will be disappointed."
9/15/2010,"which is pretty much the point of it all. getting ccp to deliver results. since they sign off on things, putting it out there constantly makes them work for it. we all know how it went like when nothing was visible, nothing ever happened. so if something from the list does not make it, they have something to explain. which is both a little bit of pressure, and a prelude to strengthening communications. neither is bad.visibility, communications, even if ccp is slow, it'll get things on the table. only that way it can be worked on properly."

9/16/2010,"again, figuring out which 25 or 50 to put on that list ... not to mention the lack of a reasonable way to easily count supports (and discern non-supports from un-thumbed supports and supportive discussion) would require a huge amount of work to keep up with it. but as a start, i'll ask for this thread to be stickied (not sure they'll comply, though) and oh can deal with keeping it maintained, since he started it! if it stops being maintained, it can just be unstickied.also to the op:-- please capitalize assembly and hall in your thread subject (/teachermode off)-- for those items which have been raised and passed by csm (as quite a few of your listed items have been), you might want to link to the issue thread in the wiki, since that will contain vote results and also link to the proper forum thread and any related others."

9/16/2010,destructible outposts would make it beyond impossible for anything but the largest 0.0 entities to ever own space with an outpost in it. why simply move out of your space when you can burn everything down then move out to make sure its completely unlivable for anyone in the future? large alliances would routinely destroy outposts of up and coming alliances to keep them out of 0.0. destructible outposts would end 0.0 permanently. it would become stagnant in a way we have never seen.
9/16/2010,easy enough just link all the stations to 1 reinforcement timer or as said before 1 sov holding station and rest irrelevant
9/16/2010,"supported -- look at providence, they already have 50+ outposts for 80ish systems. seems to me that it's inevitable that almost all of them eventually will, when the better gameplay solution would be to allow more stations in the more central/conveniently located systems.related: sov warfare mechanics are terrible and also need to be changed. looking forward to that happening in 2012!"
9/16/2010,...thats exactly why this is a bad ideayou know how hard that was to grind through? the sleepless nights...the cries of manfred and obiwand over ts...i have ptsd from it still

9/16/2010,"public feature&idea (+ bugtracker) for eve..i started a thread about this on gd a day ago, but it's already on page 3 - let's see how this goes here instead. as i read the sticky from obsidian and the post from mynxee in there (hot topics of the assembly hall #9) i want to start at last a discussion here about this.i see the problem with the actual approach of collecting opinions/ideas/etc pp from players about the game via the forums - reinventing the wheel over and over and over..let's say there are several people who have the same kind of idea and irk with the game, just not at the same time (read months here). how do they make a proposal that would get through? how do they work on it from time to time? add to it, discuss it from different angles? you can't search f&i in a way that would qualify as helpful for forming ideas and if there wouldn't be chribbas eve-search you couldn't search at all.it's a half-assed and bad implementation to get features and ideas collected, reviewed and worked on.for example i want to see all proposals and discussions regarding planetary interaction, and there in special team-work. how do i do that? do i make a new thread and hope all people who are currently interested in discussing that show up as long as this thread stays on page one/two? do i screen all pages of threads in the forum there to find old threads about it? do i use eve-search? with what kind of phrase? can i be sure i found all there is?i also want to point out the last brain-storming-thread where a dev made his appearance and probably took some notes.. but what about us?.. that thread will vanish sooner or later and all those infos/ideas collected in there will be more or less gone: is the galaxy ever going to get bigger?is the csm now in charge of collecting features and ideas for ccp and has to create, run & maintain a framework for it?and on top of that, how does the information stored in this thing finds it way to the desks of devs in a usefull/supportive/synergistic approach (read without to much hassle and reformatting)?and to add some tinfoil to the mix.. how to make sure ideas/stuff doesn't get bended/whitewashed/dropped/supressed by csm before it reaches ccp? i have nothing against csm to moderate the process and guide here or there in an open and public way.. but with power comes responsibility and the human factor. if ccp where to run that show (database, whatever) i could at least be sure the csm or single candidates don't run their own agenda with it.the solution i see for this is a bug/feature-tracking program run by ccp on eve-online.com:"

9/16/2010,"that's sort of an obsolete item in csm proposal pages, since typically these days we just publish the raw meeting notes. if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you'll see it passed 5/4 -- and is in the ""in process"" category."

9/16/2010,more missions and make them more intresting. sleeper ai would be fun but dont use it on every mission. make the ones that have sleeper ai worth a little more lp or something. not being able to use my drones in some missions should make that mission worth a little more. some people only use there drones so the missions that have the sleeper ai would need a ship with more then just a large drone bay and a afk pilot. i support the op for his wish of more intresting missions.
9/16/2010,"supportedpersonally, my favorite of these ideas is the ""one hangar of stuff"" idea. moving stuff between modules is a pain and doesn't add any enjoyment or interest to the gameplay.fuel pellets a strong second; should be trivially easy, too, just introduce a fuel pellet bpo that takes the pos fuel components.but honestly, all of these ideas are good and none of them are rocket science. three coders, two days, and a few pots of coffee should be able to check off the whole list.on the other hand, it's way more work than fixing rockets or blasters or assault frigs, and we've been waiting years for that, so <shrug>"

9/16/2010,"this is correct. plus, i've crashed before while in combat and the only thing that saved me was that modules kept on running and i mwd'd off grid while trying to log back in. so no thanks to modules shutting off on logoff."
9/16/2010,"i have noticed a lot of concern about afk orcas and logoffski capitals. i understand your concern.what about if the damage control is fit on a sub cap it acts like a passive module. if put on a capital ship, you have to activate it to get the benefit.if that's to complicated then i suggest the current damage control be passive and can only be fit on sub caps. introduce a capital ship sized damage control that can only be fit on caps. this of course would need to be turned on to work.please don't forget the motivation behind this idea is to help with lag and the tedious turning on a module after every jump which is anoying."
9/16/2010,for lag reduction it would make more sense that unprojected modules preserve their state. as you see on crash + relog that already works. so all they would need to do is preserving the state during jump.

9/16/2010,"ah, which implies that the concerns in the csm were to do with how little the list of csm requests that made it into the patch appear? :)i think my refresh button is broken :("
9/16/2010,"just as an update about the csm blog, we submitted the csm blog content on monday and requested publication nlt today. an email from ccp a couple of hours ago said they are still fact-checking. if we want the csm blog published just like a dev blog (which we do, so that it becomes part of the permanent blog archive available here on eve-o), we have to endure ccp's publication process. given that, it would be kinda dumb to ""scoop"" our own blog by publishing the list and other content elsewhere and risk diverting comments from the comments thread that will accompany the csm blog itself. also, patch notes don't contain csm tags for csm items. some of us in the csm have asked for that but not everyone agrees with the idea. therefore it will not be readily apparent in the patch notes which things csm influenced or was responsible for championing. the csm blog at least can do that.but i am not a patient woman...so get on it, ccp!"

9/16/2010,"basically here are the bare bones of it. give all destroyers a fitting bonus to a new type of probe launcher and set of probes. these new probes can only be loaded into this special destroyer only probe launcher. that way no other ship aside from t1 destroyers can fit it. idk what the stats should be on this new probe launcher, but i would like it so that it does not impact our normal dessie fits at all, aside from using up that 1 utility high that most of us have a problem figuring out what to stick in it in the first place. do the same thing sb gets for fitting bomb launchers but instead for dessies with this new probe launcher.all these probes do is allow cloaked ships to be scanned down like normal ships with the following exception. under no circumstances will you ever be able to find out the name, type, pilot of said ship. it should come up as unknown at what ever point the information normally comes up at while scanning with regular probes.this way we can kill two birds with one stone. 1.) destroyer pilots will have a a clearly defined role for them to fill 2.) kill afk cloaking as we know it, without impacting any of the normal cloaking mechanics.personally i hate all the other ideas with these timers, and fuel consumption and crap that will completely ruin cloaking mechanics. this probe launcher and probes for the destroyer will not effect any of the cloaking mechanics except for being able to be afk for hours in a safespot. sb pilots like who even while cloaked jump from safe spot to safe spot and move around alot while cloaked will have little to no chance of being caught like any other pilot who keeps moving around when someone who is trying to probe them down. (unless they are complete noob, and only have 2 safespots that they keep jumping back and forth to, which even still would require a decent amount of work on the probers part to find em, and eventually tackle em.)things that i see 1.) busy systems will be easy to stay afk (long enough for a cigarette and a toilet run) in just because the amount of ships in system, try pobing someone down with 50+ ships in local it's friggin hard. 2.) conversely low traffic systems probing is easier. but either way if the pilot is at the comp and warping around, good luck getting a green dot you can warp to, and good luck if you actually land close enough to tackle. 3.) also who says it's an afl sb that's cloaked? for all the dessie pilot knows it could be a protype fitted cane with a pilot that's waiting for the moron dessie pilot to probe him down.so inconclusion, i think my idea is the best because it creates a definite role for destroyer pilots to play with, it does not mess with the cloak at all, only people that come out losers are the ones that think going afk in a hostile system is a smart thing to do."
9/16/2010,"lots of words for fixing a nonexistent problem.why would i fit a cloak (the counter to probes) if i can be probed out anyway?why would you need a counter to something that is helpless in space? (a cloaked ship cant do *anything to you* especially when the pilot is afk)have you ever tried to live nomad style in 0.0? or a wormhole without a pos? (with a cloaked orca/carrier as ""base"")if your idea would get implemented, we would get:1. your module/ship would become kinda mandatory in any roaming fleet and would only lead to more logoffski, instead of warping to safespot and cloak up.2. all the 0.0 carebears would just blob out someone who tries to cloak up in a system to wait out the ""get in gang and kill the guy""-phase or the ""everyone dock up, neutral in system""-phase. so in the end their space would get even more safer that it is today. and some 0.0 space is safer than highsec.all in all ... stupid idea. thumbs down."
9/16/2010,"lol, obviously it's a problem cause people have been arguing about it non stop since i started playing 2 years ago. out of all the ideas with the nerfing of the cloak directly, my idea is the best. 1.) only destroyer pilots can fit and use the probes in the first place. that means someone is gonna have to be flying around in a thrasher instead of a hac or bs. hell i'll even be generous and say yes make the requirement for the launcher cut into our normal fit destroyer fit drastically, so we only got 4 guns worth of cpu and powergrid instead of our 7.you can always just log off and wait for the blob to go away, or stay on and warp your ass around. i take offense to the idea that someone can avoid a fight 100% if they are 1.) not at their computer, and 2.) not in a pos shield or station.you want to be safe and afk, log out, or dock up. as to your arguements1.) yeah that's kind of the point of giving the destroyer a dedicated role in fleet. as for logoffski you don't want to risk pew pew, log off. rather have you logged off of eve, if you're going afk anyways.2.) carebears will do that anyways regardless, it's just a matter of if you're willing to actually warp around in system while they run around with their heads cut off, or are you gonna log off and check in an hour or two to see if the carebears will leave you alone.i've always found the counter arguments to mine always way too carebear for my taste in the first place. ""i don't want to pew pew cause the carebears might get me"" is always what the counter argument breaks down to"

9/16/2010,"it appears that there are several points on your ship that turrets target when shooting. how about there be some of these points around the ship as well. shots that completely miss hit a point that is a bit far from the ship. shots that barely hit a point that just scraps the ship. and shots that do hit, do as they are now. also shots that miss and barely hit continue pass the points since nothing is there to stop it. this should be within the abilities of the current engine without having to make to many changes, but would make the effects a little better as nobody likes to see large lasers that are apparently missing every time engulfing their ship as if everything is hitting."
9/16/2010,"yes, it should be more like the movies!"
9/16/2010,"well, i'ts a bit more complicated than that i think. for example, laser animations ""end"" when they hit the ship, if they'd end in space, a new effect would need to be added that makes the beam fade away instead of ""exploding"" at the target point.that aside, i like the idea. but if ccp commits time to this, id rather suggest a more ""dedicated"" approach than just random spots around the ship. optimal solution would be making the weapons actually shoot where theyre supposed to shoot, depending on their tracking. so, as an example, if you try to shoot a frig with large guns, theyll usually shoot somewhere far behind the target, and if your guns scratch the target, they really do (maybe even with a part of the beam passing the ship and fading into space behind it).nother idea would be that laserbeams fade out depending on their optimal range and falloff, but both these suggestions are huge overhauls of the current system, so ... just throwing some ideas around :p"
9/16/2010,"ccp is to busy with wis and incarna to worry about effects of lasers... it does make since that if you ""miss"" the target that the laser/bullet would keep going but then you have to think about what would happen if the laser that missed hit something else behind it/something flew into it after it missed its intended target. a fleet battle would be almost imposable to implament this on as you would have to track what the laser/bullet might do to anything in its path. you think there is lag now.... just wait to when they try your idea..."

9/16/2010,"oh god, it's naomi knight all over again :di haven't played this game in 4 months (work sux) but last time i checked pretty much every ship worth more than 50mil can be fitted with long range weapons, except the tempest (can fit 6x 1400ii, but can't fit anything else then), the vargur, and the apoc, should it choose to fit tachyons.vargur needs *several* grid mods to fit 1400s + mwd + everything else you need. and giving it more grind won't make it any better at ""marauder"", so i really can't see the problem.i guess i'll just train for machariel. all i need is the gall bs skill anyway, which is lover rank than marauders.also, while apoc+tachyons issue seems similar, apoc is already so op at sniping, that's the only thing holding it back from becoming the only viable choice for it. when tachyons get nerfed to rail/arty levels, or the other two get boosted, then i'll quit whining.edit; fyi: 1400s on a vargur are about as good as tachyons on an apoc. except that it costs roughly 1bil more to fit. very nice balance there sir."
9/16/2010,do you mean paladin by any chance?
9/16/2010,"i mean apoc, paladin is actually worse at sniping, since it doesn't get the range bonus. with tempest and vargur it's the other way around. 1400s can get a metric crapton of falloff and tracking on a vargur, giving you the ability to almost match a tachypoc. and while both setups are kinda gimp they're the only ones that can shoot ~400dps out to 200+km.the only difference is, one costs 50? mil after insurance, while the other costs quite a bit more and requires the marauders skill."

9/17/2010,about time this got stickied. i'm with you bro.
9/17/2010,first let me say congrats on getting this stickied. i hope you keep it up to date or someone picks up the torch when/if you leave the game. this is a good thing for this forum. especially since the noise to signal ratio is so incredibly high. i completely understand your view on t3. while i don't view them incredibly underpowered i do think they are incredibly limited for the price you pay. i honestly think removing racial requirements from the fittings so that caldari can fit amarr modules would make for more powerful and even specialized ships. i look forward to your article :)
9/17/2010,yes please.and how about a few skills that help you improve the performance and capabilities of your pos as well?
9/17/2010,"thankas for the up.the trails are something different, i don't oppose them but they don't work when zoomed out."
9/17/2010,"this could be linked to the concept of ""look at"" range -- you'd only be able to see this information so represented within 100km. much further out, it's irrelevant imho.or whatever. the surrounding concepts are interesting, but i think absolute vectors for all ships are completely essential to eve's future development. superb idea."
9/17/2010,up
9/17/2010,"as for me i'm 46 years old and have to use a laptop to play. the combination of my old eyes (that suffer from perspiopia) and the limited size of my laptop tends to give me severial challanges. reading the items with: 9,8,6,g,0,o,5,s,and b can be misinterpited. also puncuation such as: , . ; : ' "".other font options as well as a better choice of font size would really help out this old grey haired dad. (my eyes after hours of playing eve)."
9/17/2010,"how about reworking your ""weapon scoring"" to account for damage types? you want scorch range nerfed so that it's in-line with barrage and null?there is nothing wrong with the worst-tracking short-range gun that deals the worst damage type (for most pvp situations) having the best damage projection.you want something nerfed, look at the last round of buffs. you know, the weapon system that has excellent tracking, selectable damage types, no cap use, a tech 2 ammo that compares well to scorch...on hulls with multiple utility highs, double damage bonuses, best agility/speed...get hybrids buffed. wait for things to settle down, then figure out if/what needs nerfed."
9/17/2010,blasters highest fitting requirements on the worst overall fitting ships. gallente and caldari have 3rd and 4th best power grids. gallente have 3rd best cpu (caldari is best for missiles).i'd be satisfied with easing fitting requirements a bit.
9/17/2010,bumping
9/17/2010,"..if you support this, then please make a tick at the right moment i just left a post in the sticky thread i linked in the op and see how this goes (drawing some attention from the csm and others interested).my fear is, that there already was a thread about this (some time ago?) and i just made a new one"
9/17/2010,"one of the problems is that suggestion can become old very fast. you really want to discuss (for example) changes the scanning system and the ""proper"" thread is a a 500+ page thread initiated in 2005 while in the meantime there have been 2 complete redesign of the system and several major overhauls?who will decide when a suggestion thread has been made obsolete by changes in the game or even what sections are obsolete and what are still valid?generally if thread has merits it stay on top of the relative forum section for a long time. sure it will not aggregate all that was suggested about that topic, but you really think that people will read and re-read a 20+ page thread to find the good points?"
9/17/2010,"having some kind of tree to hook/relate all those threads into would be a start.. as it is by now, the information might be somewhere in here, but where?about what part of suggestion aged to much and how to keep it separate from the rest of them.. granularity just needs to be in the right order. and about who decides what doesn't match to present eve i would suggest csm can have that job.i mean.. i see several approaches to this already, just they won't be very automatic (read needs many manhours to maintain) and aren't very compatbile to get this stuff organized:"
9/17/2010,"supported, provided i get the 13.5 million or so skill points(3 accounts ) i've spent on them back one way or another, and i really don't care if they just give it to me outright, or just increase the training speed until the difference is made up.how soon is this likely to actually happen?"
9/17/2010,makes sense.
9/17/2010,/signed yes
9/17/2010,"as mentioned in the csm devblog, this issue will be addressed in the winter expansion."
9/17/2010,"+1folders are good, a working watch list would be better. not one that still tells us someone is online 8 hours after they logged"
9/17/2010,"as mentioned in the csm devblog, this issue will be addressed in the winter expansion."
9/17/2010,"the description says it all. ccp could keep the price of items the same, and create in-game vouchers (at a slightly inflated price, such as 750mil = 35 bucks) to purchase items. players could go to the eve store and either buy an item for them self, or transfer it to a voucher to be sold in-game.a similar system is in place for plex's, why not open up the rest of the eve store?actually, it would work identical to the plex system. ccp would still get paid for the item (not by converting plex, but by buying a voucher), vouchers would cost the exact same real life money as the item itself does, only you would be able to sell the voucher on market or contracts, just like plex's are. yea, you can get scammed this way, but you can also get scammed with plex's too. and, if you're buying something like this, wouldnt you check the contract/market before you buy it to make sure you're getting exactly what you're paying for?this would eliminate people like myself from begging others for items from the store in exchange for isk, only to get caught and banned for trading isk for rl stuff. i have not done it yet, but man i'd really like that guristas zippo, and the navy mega model."
9/17/2010,"vouchers could also not be purchased through the eve store if the item is currently out of stock, or make special items unavailable.also the person redeeming the voucher would be responsible for s+h"
9/17/2010,sounds good...but ccp may not like it much.
9/17/2010,sounds very good+1
9/17/2010,me likey. +1
9/17/2010,sounds like a pretty good idea!
9/17/2010,"it has been brought to my attention that some people may try to use this method of purchasing eve store items to transfer isk to cash. so, if implemented, ccp could very easily allow only 2 voucher transactions, per account, per month. ccp already watches large amounts of isk transfers, so should someone try to transfer isk to a character for a few extra hundred bucks a month, they would be easily caught."
9/17/2010,"this has actually been brought up at fanfest 2009, i believe. the devs said that sleeper ai would be a possibility if it didn't take up so many server resources. i would like to see improvements, though, just like everyone else...and the faction kill missions send me into a slight nerdrage sometimes. i am left with no real reason to not support this topic."
9/17/2010,"they do get tedious once you've done them all at least 10 times. some more variety would be nice, interesting storylines, missions that can't be blitzed, anything really, anything to make this party of the game better."
9/17/2010,i'm pretty sure ccp intends missions to be punishment for losing at pvp. there can be no other explanation.
9/17/2010,"oh please, pvp haven't existed since 2005. losing your boat is the result of not enough risk-aversion and being on the other side of the blob."
9/17/2010,+1 to this+infinity to the faction mission part...
9/17/2010,"considering that the last mission i flew was just to get some stuff from a lp shop and for the excitement doing it in nullsec i have to support this. even sleeper get boring over time as the script that handles them isn't very 'innovative'.. this is now something i don't really understand, well partly.. the faction missions which where thrown at me ages ago during my normal missions where short and in low sec. quite exciting and some change from the usual go there, kill, come back.though i understand that those aren't funny if they all end in the same system (which then get's camped 24/7) and the mission itself is more than just shooting forsome mere seconds at a simple target."
9/17/2010,i would have responded sooner but i fell asleep doing a mission.+1
9/17/2010,"for the normal level 4 missions just use a random script to generate them. they are basicly very simple, just x rooms with y spawns each with z ships. that can all be random (within reasonable constraints), add some different settings, either premade or also random, and tada you at least got some surprises in missions."
9/17/2010,"fully supported, one of the things i really hated in wow was the repetitive nature of 'dayly' missions and the like to grind up for stuff. i'd like a bit more variety in doing missions. cosmos thingies are fun for a change, and i generally do other things than missions, but i still need lps and standing, so not much getting around doing missions.+lots for the anti-faction thing, i understand that the various corps etc, don't like other races, but can we get some kind of segregation between regular and anti-faction agents or something? i for one don't care for them.more chained missions would be nice too, as i like the little stories they write. even if it gets boring once you do the doll quest for the umteenth time."
9/17/2010,"high-sec is extremely safe as long as you pay attention. if you're mining you can be afk because most mining barges can tank long enough to wait for concord to come and blow up the pirates. don't haul on auto-pilot if you're cargo is much more expensive than a frigate or the pirates will probably gank. missioning ships are almost always safe. as for the ships that come out only once ever, just invest those, keep them for a few years and then sell them. right now the primae is already selling for over 200 million."
9/17/2010,"agree to no insurance for concord kills, but an absolute no to anything else. high sec isn't about safety, it's about consequences."
9/17/2010,"welcome to eve.things tend to explode and die in horrible, sphincter-clenching ways here.will you be staying long?!???!???"
9/17/2010,"bwahaha! this, so many times this!"
9/17/2010,"if you want revenge for those who killed you, stay in empire.if you want protection, you will have to work for it. move out to a space where your alliance can protect you.if you want complete safety at no cost, go play hko."
9/17/2010,yes lets make it impossible to activate any type of gun/mission launcher and move all missions to low sec
9/17/2010,noone cares?
9/17/2010,"this proposal is for a corp/alliance store. the idea is for the corp/alliance to be able to sell equipment/ammo/skill books etc... to the member base in a controlled manner.the following would be required1) store can only be accessed at a station where you have an office. as per any market, the stock must physically reside there2) a person with suitable rights will be able to link items to the store in a method similar to putting a sales order on the market. visibility will be corp or alliance wide.3) parameters will set the price, max qty that can be purchased, how often the purchase can be made etc...the idea is this is to allow for corps/alliances to sell to their members at a discount to what they would pay from the market, without having to grant rights to a hangar that allows for someone to clear out a hangar.e.g. sell a skill book for 50% of market value to corp members, but they can only buy it once (to prevent the corp subsidising their sales to the market).the current mechanics allow some of this already with corp contracts. the main difference is that you can1) set the repeatability of accessing the item (once off, once per time period etc...)2) sell x amount of the item without having to setup x contractsi am aware that some will say this is bad for 0.0 markets, but the fact that the items have to be moved to a location will balance this i hope. in addition, a ceo skill that limits how many items can be on the market might be of benefit. once the purchase is done, it will be in the member's hangar as per any other market trade.<tl;dr> i would like to see a corp/alliance shop to allow for discounted sales to members of the corp/alliance, thereby making it easier for the industrial members of the corp to provision modules to the member base as well as an easy way for a corp to provide skill books to new members without being totally cleaned outregardshack"
9/17/2010,"i like the idea but not sure how it can be implemented without, as hack said, destroying 0.0 markets. maybe a mechanism to allow better corp contract management (using the repeat sale suggestion above) and a nice screen listing all off an alliance's contracts would achieve the same outcome."
9/17/2010,"i definitely would not want this to replace markets. the aim is to allow a way for the corp/alliance to subsidise.maybe this needs something akin to the lp store to make it work. i'm open to suggestions.the main things is that this doesn't totally replace all markets, but does allow for corps to supply skill books to their members or sell ships etc...one use that occurs to me might be for null sec ship replacement programs - buy your replacement dread for 1/2 billion isk from corp etc...a more complex security structure might lock out who can buy what based on rules - so you must be in the corp 6 months to access capital ships, whereas cheap skill books are immediate etc...anyway - this is a work in progress concept that needs much input to get exactly right.edit - supporting own proposal"
9/17/2010,it sounds like a great idea hack...a nice way for alliances to help its members with things like ship replacements ..a feature similar to a loyalty point store sounds cool
9/17/2010,"this is a really great idea. i'd imagine this could remove a lot of the hassle when replacing lost ships, or providing skill books. damaging the market in the local area, maybe not. after all, all the items in the store had to some from somewhere."
9/17/2010,"intresting, it would make things more eficient, i like the fast ship replacement :)"
9/17/2010,i highly doubt that this would disrupt / kill markets as you currently would just have to convo / mail the person in charge of production and tell them you want something. then they contract it to you at the appropriate price. so unless you get impatient this doesn't change the market at all. it just provides a more fluid exchange between alliance - corp - character.i like the idea.

9/17/2010,1
9/17/2010,issue have been voted favorably in latest meeting
9/17/2010,absolutely.
9/17/2010,"courier contract, certainly."
9/17/2010,totally supported.very annoying issue that need solving!!
9/17/2010,"i fully support this (and any other quick/easy fixes for lag sources). as for those concerned about the afk hauler situation, the client is aware the autopilot function is running, in theory this should allow for a flag to be set to disable specific modules. cetain modules would then be ineffective during the autopilot process, basically saying it needs the processing power of the ships systems for those specific modules to do its job."
9/17/2010,very consistent behavior ... it should be either passive/keeping state for all or for nobody.also.... you know that people often use to jump in/out out overloaded systems? maybe you want to pvp a bit more...
9/17/2010,"this post is driven by the fact that t2 rigs are way too expensive and i am sure everyone can agree with this. how these rigs are manufactured today.. t2 bpcs, which can be obtained either with invent or complexes and ""blue rig parts"" for materials to produce them. the blue parts come from salvaging t2 ships only, which sets their high prices and that defines the price of t2 rigs. on the other hand it is relatively easy to obtain normal rig parts via common salvaging of rat's wrecks, this on the other hand reduces the price of t1 rigs to the level that most ppl don't even salvage wrecks due to the timespend compared with profit from this activity.so my proposal is this: players to be able to manufacture t2 rig parts from t1 rig parts. it can be done via using blueprints for those parts or some other way.the consequences of this will be reducing the price of t2 rigs and increasing the price of t1 rigs. in that case players will be more willing to salvage any rat wrecks and make a descent profit out of their time spent doing that. more people will start using t2 rigs on subcapital ships, in my opinion good also.please do discuss this idea constructively.p.s. i'm not sure if this is the place for such proposal but since i didn't find a better place on the forums i posted it here. i am sure moderators will move it to somewhere else if needed. i've searched the forums for similar proposal or idea but with no avail. if there is such proposal already exist, and is brought to the attention of csm or ccp, delete this post."
9/17/2010,"there was discussion about this earlier. about a low sec pos mod that would convert x amount of t1 salvage to t2 salvage, but i am not sure exactly where this went... if it went anywhere..."
9/17/2010,"yes, there could be a way to ""fix"" all the broken / malfunctioning / smashed components. if even something as simple as 10x broken part --> 1x fixed part. currently, tii rigs are used only on capitals and maybe faction ships, due to their price."
9/17/2010,"actually, the pricing of t2 rigs is not invariably fixed by the cost of t2 salvage. quite a few of the useful ones can be produced fairly cheaply, certainly for less than some expensive meta 3 or 4 mods. in may cases, the rigs are dear because they're in low demand, so there's little competition for what business there is. granted, t2 trimarks will never get cheap without a massive increase in the supply of intact armor plates, but then, i don't think that's a bad thing.not supported."
9/17/2010,"t2 rigs (bare very few exceptions, mainly in l size) are dirt-cheap. no need to fix things which aren't broken."
9/17/2010,"[proposal]blueprint & blueprint copy icon changesthe current icons in use for blueprints could use a few tweaks and updates. i find it time consuming and a bit frustrating to have to open each and every blueprint to see if it is a bpo, a bpc or to see what its me and pe levels are. i know that you can open up the manufacturing & industry window and get some of this information but you cant click and choose the blueprints from there and then drag and drop them into a cargo hold, hanger or can. having this information displayed at the station hanger level would be a useful addition. i find that even if i try to make sure that i have grabbed a bpo to transport to my pos for research, it is not uncommon to discover that somewhere in that bunch of blueprints i grabbed a copy instead.my proposal is as follows. please feel free to add constructive remarks to this:bpos: a non researched bpo icon would not change from its current appearance. thus quickly identifying it as a basic, non researched bpo.bpcs: a bpcs icon would have some visible identifier indicating that it isnt a bpo but a bpc. something like a different colored frame around the icon or a different colored background. or maybe a clearly visible letter c in the upper lefthand corner of the icon. but some easily identifiable indicator showing that it isnt a bpo.me & pe levels: an additional feature would be in the lower right and left corners of bpos a me and pe counter showing the current levels of research that has been completed on that particular blueprint.so. whatdaya think?"
9/17/2010,so many people use cloaks on combat ships and have no method of counter. possible suggestion i would have of fixing this problem is adding a 10 minute cool-down after a hour of cloaking. this gives cloakies the ability to wait out and stalk enemies without being able to be invincible.
9/17/2010,whine more.
9/17/2010,pretty much this.cloaking has been discussed to death - it's fine the way it is.
9/17/2010,*facepalms*
9/17/2010,[issue] people keep complaining about cloaking.
9/17/2010,then clearly others feel cloaking is a overpowered part of this game. there should be some available method of bringing it inline with other tactics.
9/17/2010,"it is inline with all the other stuff?a cloaked ship cant do *anything* to you. nothing, nada.if it decloaks, it can harm you, but then you can harm it aswell. you can shoot it, jam it, neut it.what kind of counter do you need to ""harmless""?"
9/17/2010,ships designed to cloak .... should be able to cloak ...... period.all others ships should not be able to fit them.
9/17/2010,"replying as per request. player was not afk, was decloaked by drones."
9/17/2010,perhaps cloaks should not be able to be uncloaked with drones- but need a cooldown timer. sounds like a reasonable trade. thoughts?
9/17/2010,"no ... thats exactly how you beat cloaking ships on the gate, you burn towards them and try to get into decloaking range.i seriously have to give you the advice... try to use the cloaking ships *before* trying to make suggestions and especially try to use them in 0.0.run through some gate camps and stuff. then come back."
9/17/2010,"with a covert ops cloak it is near impossible for a small gang to grab a cloaky. can it happen.... yes, does it happen often? no. short of having a bubble, multiple fast ships and drones you are not getting it before it hits warp. after all, cloaky ships are fast. really it is pointless a single ship requires a 5 man team even with drones to stop... even then its a chance of getting him. with this idea of cooldown a skilled prober with proper skillset would be able to counter the cloaker but give them a short term advantage till cooldown. keeping things interesting."
9/17/2010,"it needs one ceptor ... been there, done that. and it should be hard to catch them. running through gatecamps *is* the role of covert ops and recons.and your cooldown idea is totally unrelated to running through gate camps and it wouldnt help there at all. it would only benefit people who just want to blob everyone out of ""their"" system so they can carebear without the constant need to be careful.from someone who lives and carebears in 0.0, you always have to be concentrated there ... no matter if a hostile cloaky is in local or not."
9/17/2010,"that's right, if you use a cloak on a combat ship, you have no way of countering any attack against you because (a) there is a targeting delay after deactivating the cloak and (b) your sensor resolution is reduced by 50% due to having a cloaking device fitted.it's also worth pointing out that while you are cloaked, your prey is also invincible since you cannot attack them.imho, the level of whining about cloaks means that the technology is working perfectly just as it currently exists. people use it, and it leads to other people losing ships because they're not being careful."
9/17/2010,there is no problem with cloaking devices. they work as intended.
9/17/2010,"i love being a developer :)push thing out early, the clients complains about the quality.release only when things are all squared away, the clients complain about the tardiness.my rss reader is quivering with the anticipation of the impending csm blog of awesomeness!"
9/17/2010,"one of these days, i sincerely hope sokratesz runs through here and beats every lame-duck purposal with a wet noodle"
9/17/2010,"csm mynxee & ccp fallout,sorry and not so sorry to have spammed you all so much but this two lines on the same thread is from my 4 year old payer point of view what i think most of the current eve players want to see !thank you for these lines, we want just a clear view of what's happening in 'our' new eden.if someone do or not something it's not a problem. the problem is that we don't know if something will be done or not ! how can we 'invest' our fun into a place we don't know clearly where it's going. may be ccp should ask more about players view as does the csm. i'm agree incarna and dust will bring you more real money and the time are hard for everyone and new coming games are arriving too.ccp fallout, if you tell us it will not be done prior xyz what's important is that we 'player base' recieve a date from you and that you respect it. i like eve even if there is always something to improve but without trust eve is nothing,...you know ;-)tank you again for weel the first of the kind coordinated reply.witing the next xpansion content ;-)yeay"
9/17/2010,this is a csm devblog (csmblog?). it has lots of :words:
9/17/2010,"is this ""the list"" which was the cause of all this angst?"
9/17/2010,"concept:watch list that shows your current friends (or enemies) online status.current implementation:the current implementation does not work. you get a list of people who are online at the time you log on, that's it. if you stay in station for any length of time the list does not update. even if those who are offline log on, or those who are online log off. this is a vital intelligence gathering tool, how are you supposed to know when the people you have kill rights on are actually online so you can hunt them down.fix:depending on implementation you could do (an overlap of all of the below will increase accuracy in case of lag/latency/connection issues):1) the server knows who has logged on and who logs off, it also knows who is on which players watch list. if a person logs on/off send an update to each client who has that person on their watch list (and of course is online) and for improved accuracy get the client to acknowledge the request.2) the client knows who they have on their watch list, at regular intervals (3 mins? 5 mins?) poll the server for an update status for those people, to which the server replies with a online or offline status for each member in that list.3) at each system change, we need to get a list of those in local anyway, so might as well get this information at the same time.the 3rd will work for those that are continuously on the move hunting, the first will work for everyone, and the 2nd will work for those that spend a lot of time in a single system (ie. traders, industrialists)..such a conceptually simple implementation, and with a perhaps 5 minute window of accuracy it's a heck of a lot better than being off by 8 hours."
9/17/2010,"yeah fix this, it's driving me crazy, how am i supposed to hunt 100+ wartargets if i cant even see if they are online or not..time and money spend locators for offline characters are hella annoying.time spend travelling 30 jumps to find out a character was already offline, also ****ing annoying!"
9/17/2010,"as mentioned in the csm devblog, this issue will be addressed in the winter expansion."
9/17/2010,lose much ?hint ...... when they flash red shoot them :-)but i agree neutral reps need a 60 sec timer and i may be a privateer but i can assure you i'm proberly on the receiving end of targets getting remote rep'd than most people.
9/17/2010,"eve online already become supercapitals online, while every ship able to tackle capital ship, only 2 fragile ships able to tackle supercaps. so we have galaxy full of supercaps because they build everywhere, and die very rarely. let them ability to fight each other till the death. make ""supercapital warp disruptor"" which tackle only supercaps, and only supercaps able to fit it. also, it's look wierd that one supercarrier able to kill all pos modules with no risk at all. add ""supercap tackling"" ability to pos disruptor modules."

9/17/2010,it's called a heavy interdictor cruiser... they work great in packs.what happened to goonswarm? gone noobswarm on us?
9/17/2010,super caps die rarely?did you just came out of a cave or something?2-5 per week is the mom losses...... ps check the top week kills in this site for a few days:
9/17/2010,"been trying to get to get something like this active for a while. either this or a t2 dread designed to tackle large numbers of capitals. **** the haters. i like how none of the ""lol u nub"" posts are from anyone able to field a considerable cap fleet.edit: im including you in that statement mister blast member."
9/17/2010,you are just upset that you cant catch the nc. guys.
9/17/2010,"they no more ""endgame"" ship. endgame ship when alliance have only 3-4 such ships, not 60-80+. super capitals become ""working horse"" like dreads/carriers were 3 years ago. don't see a reason to not let them die like other ships. ps. nc, i understand your ""i'm afraid to lose my shiny ship"" position."
9/17/2010,actually i wasn't even home during that. i was more hoping it ****ed up when i left so i could blame dbrb. that is completely beside the point. supercaps are far too hard to kill. i myself have done incredibly stupid things that should by any standard equaled a dead wyvern. but they haven't because of the ******ed amount of ehp i am packing and how comparatively little ehp anything that can tackle me has. even if the ms can't kill what's coming at it. it only requires a few good sniper hacs to strip off any dictors and you are good to go. if at any time during the 10-30 minutes it takes to kill the supercap you are untackled for even a few seconds you can jump out. kind of dumb if you ask me.
9/17/2010,well i consider it endgame cause only titan needs more time to train for... but yeah there are way more than 80+ ;) no idea about how many titans though pl had aroun 25-30 of them floating outside station in o-w so if we say 80+ isnt considered engame then i am afraid we got no endgame ships in eve :\

9/17/2010,"things i'd like to see in the 'new' forums:1) integration with eve gate, allow for mailing people from the forum, or looking them up in eve-gate.2) automagic login and remember i'm logged in3) better handling of large texts typed in this box, because right now, it's horrible with it's scrollbar pushing up my text all the time so i can't see what i'm typing when i'm making a long post.4) better integration with dev blog posts."
9/17/2010,"in regards to not just this, but every other feature that we've been told is ""in development"" or ""planned:""with all due respect, saying something is ""in development"" is like saying ""the check is in the mail."" it does us no good. how far in development is said feature? when could we reasonably expect to see results? this winter? next summer? two years from now? six years? will this feature actually see release, or will it get thrown into ""the backlog"" (which, for all intents and purposes, should be called ""the feature graveyard"")?"
9/17/2010,what threat is the cloaker to the other people in the system? why is it necessary to decloak the cloaker?
9/17/2010,so you can pod them while they are afk
9/17/2010,so you've come here to peddle your lame idea rather than trolling over at the f&id board.cloak mechanics are fine...as people have told you numerous times before.not supported.
9/17/2010,"the current permission/role system is seriously flawed. the current system is to simplified to make it even close to effective. if you live in ""regular"" space this may be a bit annoying but it is not a serious flaw in itself since you have access to stations where you can keep your stuff.if you live in a worhole however you immediatly notice that the current role system is less than satisfactory. if you have access to a specific hangar then that premission stretches to every hangar. if you have access to the ship maintenance bay you can pick any ship you like no matter if it belongs to you or not... either you need to trust your corp mates completely or it just won't work.if you ask me the access permission administration system should be changed into something more akin to that of chat channels. the corp directors create hangars and much set access rights that grants some people access and others not. this way new members can be granted access to a personal hangar that nobody but the director and that person can access.a simpler way that would not have to remake the entire permission system would be to give every corporate hangar/ship maintenance bay a ""personal"" hangar. this can only be accessed by the one having the hangar and directors."
9/17/2010,already proposed to hell and back.. linchpin that brakes the whole show: limited number of bits in the variable that stores roles within a corporate structure.. as long as ccp doesn't remove that bottleneck (read reworks this part of the code which naturally is interconnected with several other parts of the code) you can propose this all day and will get nowhere.and if we had a f&i tracking system you would see that this has been brought up and supported several times already..
9/17/2010,"i'd be happy with the bullets/lasers/blasts just passing by graphically. possibly hitting the wrong tharget would be cool, sure, but not neccessary to get the right feeling."
9/17/2010,"maybe at some point in the future, after more urgent things have been addressed. this would be a cool effect when ccp decides to do some new graphics/animations work again."
9/17/2010,interesting ideas irae. might there be an argument for barring caps as well as supercaps from low sec? or perhaps from all but the lowest sec status in low sec? delilah wildfriendsofeve.wordpress.com
9/17/2010,no.
9/17/2010,"how to spot if the person talking is a professional victim or someone who understands eve:supercaps are often dropped into lowsec and kill unprepared groups of players, this means that...-... we need to get ccp to nerf the ability for capital ships to jump into lowsec!!!-... we need to get together a bunch of friends so we can gank some tasty motherships. pick one."
9/17/2010,"tl;dr version: faction navy replace concord in lowsec; tweaked aggression mechanics.most (meaning 'all') of these suggestions suck. they basically boil down to ""funnel targets down the barrels of my guns"".first i'll deconstruct a few of the ideas which've been refloated here:the suggestion about players moving in and claiming it, well, why? to anchor a pos, they need good faction standing, and that effectively keeps the big alliances (except cva) out and the small ones can't repel the inevitable (dreadnaught) pos- bashing, which is a subtle disincentive to anchoring a few hundred million isk in lowsec. who knew?if you move missioning out into lowsec exclusively, you instantly force all the mission runners to change careers or (more likely) games. a missionfit is usually thrillingly expensive and (to an order of magnitude) approximately useless in pvp, no matter the quality of the player. told they have to fly their faction-fit nightmares into lowsec to do l4's and l5's, the majority (after the first three or four goes around) will respond: ""really? well, i'm sick of the l3's i can reach and i can't actually reach the l4's, don't like pvp, see you in another mmo"". move everything but l1's to lowsec and no new players will graduate past the 21 day trial.if you create safe corridors on roundabout routes between the popular trading hubs and make everything else lowsec, the empire folks you want to gank just move the hubs to the safe corridors. if you just make everything lowsec, no-one will ever leave their starting empire. period. then they'll get bored of their starting empire, and quit the game.to forestall the inevitable ""they'll get good at pvp and fight their way out"" or ""they'll sneak/cloak their way past the gatecamps eventually"": bull**** -- new players or carebears get killed and smacktalked four or five times, then decide that while they're good at being the helpless victim, it sucks and doesn't pay well; play something else, never look back. fewer whining nublets might suit some, but since subscribers pay the bills, and fewer whining nublets inevitably results in a shrinking playerbase, and that just leads to the income generated by running the cluster rapidly approaching the marginal cost of running said cluster, from the wrong direction.making a high sec 'bubble' around gates won't help, either -- people will just warp bubble to bubble and low sec becomes a high-sec highway, as long as you don't pull over to use the restroom. and if you allow anchoring of dictor bubbles between the two points? well, we're back where we started.move all the valueable mins into lowsec/0.0? players either sign up with 0.0 alliances that hold sov and can protect them, or just keep mining whatever's left in empire. move all the mins to lowsec? suddenly the forums are awash with complaints of 0.0 alliances blobbing lowsec pounding non-blue into the dust.lowsec is actually nosec. make it low security space.no concord (or special conditions to summon concord, e.g. supercap agresses fn, gankee podded). instead, you get a faction navy response only when a ship is destroyed (not attacked), and only when the attack would have generated concordokken in highsec. it gives the carebears a sense of safety, and that encourages them into lowsec space (which remains significantly less safe than 0.5), and gives them (some) incentive pay ransoms. flip a can and the miner flips it back? no fn response if you destroy his ship. ambush him and take him into structure? no response. then blow his ship up? fn turns up. since you can fight off or escape fn, piracy is still possible. you just need to think a little harder about how you do it, now with more marks to choose from.truth told, couldn't care less if everyone in lowsec biomassed themselves. this is a way to encourage people to come into your current aoe. if you want no npc response at all and lots of targets, man up and move to null."
9/17/2010,"a couple of snarls (lol), then an interesting post that envisions a new dynamic for piracy and faction navies. presupposes that null sec is the end game, which for many it is not, but that doesn't detract from the creativity of moar's idea. moar, as i reread your post, i wondered if you would favour eliminating low sec altogether, and replacing it with a 'neutral zone' (apologies to trekkies) between empires and null sec alliances? a 'shallower' depth of systems, the game mechanics you envision, etc?delilah wildfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
9/17/2010,"so delilah, you figured out yet how to post with the pvp main account of yours ? any day now...this displays an ignorance of game mechanics and especially pos warfare. what alliance do you know of that will, for no reason at all (eg moon minerals, removing an enemy staging pos) deploy an entire fleet, bash a pos and then alarm clock an op later to remove it... all for an insignificant lowsec pirate faction? besides which corps/alliance can already anchor pos's now and standings are for highsec. or do you think that the recent nullsec alliance fights over tech moons in lowsec were waged once all the allianced ground out some high faction standings with the empire nations? the point of giving people space is so that they'd be able to fight over resources and/or do something like be able to fire on any targets that enter without losing security status: a significant advantage for any pirate faction. i left empire and started playing in lowsec about a week into my original trial period, and then was in nullsec about a month or two later. maybe we should just stop worrying about people who really aren't cut out to play eve and instead focus on what makes eve the best persistent pvp mmo on the market. nullsec most certainly does not have gate guns that will instapop any fast tacklers that aggro onto a target. it doesn't have sec status loss for aggression, doesn't (generally) have a profusion of npc stations. lowsec has already had its purpose somewhat fleshed out by fw. if fw in turn can be fleshed out then the factions will have more of a cause for fighting over space (increased production efficie4ncy, decreased pos fuel requirements, whatever). let other people claim space in lowsec too and there's a reason to use it. making it safer for the bears is a fool's errand though. professional victims will always find some reason that ccp needs to save them, that's what marks them as people unsuited for playing eve and people who simply don't get it. no matter what you do, they'll whine about ""griefers"" and the morals of internet spaceships and blah blah blah. that's why we see them whining even about highsec. there is simply nothing that can be done, short of creating a pve server, to satisfy those who play eve without understanding that it's a pvp game. and we shouldn't try. because, rather obviously, the best way to attract a larger playerbase is to have the kind of non-niche game that is mainstream. and obviously that game is wow. and, equally obviously, the best way to be like wow would be to be wow. and most of us do not want that."
9/17/2010,uhm.. ..which 'guy above you' you're referring too again?
9/17/2010,"dear csm,thank you for all your time.ccp is now a money only company as the game !bad that they don't really listened you all csm members.thank you for yout time !it's now written in the minutes, it's ccp choice and you are against their view on quality.they think once again based on the fact that new contents drive more paying players.and they don't think that not listening existing client make them drive away...oh there is no other sf mmorpg....wellcheck the market guys somes are coming. eve will not for so long be alone of the kind ! and ccp knows it that why they want incarana and dust asap !ccp, don't get stunned when you will look mercedes story...once they attempted to sell high prices car but with lower quality customers started to drive away. nathan....that's the guy that will cost you many paying accounts.i fell we have attempted to tell you we liked the quality of your game. be sure that an happy customer makes 10 happy new customers and that 1 unhappy customer make 100 less potential customer.may be you should have thinked more than once, twice to that but it seems you like to think we are 10 year old kids.with the new sf games that comes as you but for playing too.eve is dying and you make it !capsuleers, check on : www.mmorpg.orgyeay"
9/17/2010,"dear csm,thank you !for all this work, thank you for your free time dedicated to make our ideas and request.i was execting so few from ccp.please, keep the direction even if they just do cosmetic changes to our universe.yeay"
9/17/2010,"to 1:the ui is useful for most parts of the game but lacks excellence (the extra mile to remove that pita-aspect from it). it starts with simple things like 'cancel order' right next to 'modify order' and ends with corproles/pos/whatnot.to 2:apocrypha with the t3 stuff. was a damn good time to chase those sites and gear in them.to 3:as the name 'expansion' implies it should expand the playground. expansions shouldn't be used to push out bugfixes, balancings nor refurbishments of parts of the playground - put those kind of changes into smaller bites like patches and release them every month.to 4:wouldn't bother me anymore as expansions after apoc didn't really live up to their name nor expectations.to 5:i got hit hard as half-assed and bad communicated/discussed (as far as i remember) changes to drop rates of t3 raw materials had been patched in.. didn't bother with wormholes/t3 anymore afterwards."
9/17/2010,"andreus, good luck with your csm bid next election. hope you noticed the csm blog which was published today...it should give you some idea how csm has evolved and prepare you a bit in terms of expectations. if you don't know any former or current csms and want to chat about what the job is like, i'm happy to oblige."
9/17/2010,sup?
9/18/2010,"did i ever tell you i loved you obsidian.while i'm not suprised you came up with this, i am suprised that no-one else had thought of it before.great work-t'amber"
9/18/2010,"i think we need to rethink what black ops is. i say remove these black ops ships and replace them with something battle cruiser size. something that isn't offensive but can jump between systems without a cyno and can use covert ops cloak. hell, just make it jump into the system at 12,000km from the gate or something. so it can jump in and spy on the enemy without them knowing. which to me is the point of black ops.i just think black ops should be the ultimate spy ship. not this half cloaker half damage useless mutant. and not something one has to have two payed accounts just to use."
9/18/2010,fair enough... one thing at a time is fine. but i was just pointing out that scorch is usefull were hybrid tech two ammo... not so much.
9/18/2010,"the dialogue i've seen in this thread is quite well thought out, imo. most people are of the opinion that increasing blaster dmg would be the best way to go, and i agree it would be nice--but then again any improvement(s) would be nice.at the moment, longer ranged weapon systems can kite shorter ones, and i'm all for that since it creates interesting strategies. what i would like to see happen is for the opposite to also be possible--that shorter ranged weapon systems (blasters in this case) being able to get under the tracking of longer ranged guns of the same class size (missiles are naturally immune to this issue, as they are also usually immune to kiters). at the moment, it is not feasible due to the poor tracking of blasters and that most blaster boats cannot control distance as well because they are either lacking in enough base speed and/or are armor tanking (which slows down these ships further).so quite a few things need to be fixed. that being said, the first thing that needs to be fixed are the blasters so that we can have a good basis for judging what else needs to be brought in line on these ships with actually balanced weapon systems.my proposal, as some others have already stated, is to increase the tracking speed a lot, and dmg somewhat as well. at least then we can have some real opportunities for creating strategies, like the longer ranged weapon systems can."
9/18/2010,"aye or at the very leats include fitting requirments and ship fitting oppertunities into the ballance of weapon systems. for example acs do good dmg due to dbl dmg bonusses on many ships and have very very low fitting requirements as well as no cap use, just too many advantages in comparison to blasters.so in conclusion i support a significant decrease to fitting requirments for blasters or an increase on the grid of blaster intended ships, brutix, astarte, mega needs cpu, and hyperion should at the ver least be able to fit a rack of ions with a dual rep, tripple rep should be what nerfs you to electrons."
9/18/2010,"you have the right idea but you can't boost blaster tracking much, if at all, as ships like the megathron will be able to track frigates. ac's hold an issue as they have the same theoretical tracking as blasters but far more range (yes i know its fall off but fall off is effective)and ac's get tracking boosting ammo.damage is the real goal. boost damage to be extreme in blaster range. very high dps would give a stealth tracking boost as even slight hits would cause heavy damage. maybe a slight nerf of ac tracking for overall weapon balancing. then its a case of ship rebalance. ie blaster boats should be very fast in a straight line but slow to turn. basically a blaster boat would ""charge"" into range and attempt to destroy the target very quickly with overwhelming firepoweralso, like i've said before, rework the ammo so that it offers real useful bonuses. one for plain short range dps. one for heavy alpha strike but low rof. one for tracking. one for falloff and one for optimal."
9/18/2010,i give my support to this as well..
9/18/2010,"yesterday i tried a shield tanked hyperion in bs v.s. bs. you can approach very fast to antimatter ammo optimal. but then you start to miss because of tracking. it is ridiculous: you can't hit effectively at long range because of tiny optimal+falloff, you can't hit effectively at close range because of lack of tracking.p.s. btw look at common minmatar pvp ac fits. they commonly have available low slots for te. more range and tracking almost for free :)"
9/18/2010,we need our anatomically incorrect gallente *******s
9/18/2010,as a long-term supporter and short-term friend of kamitora i have to give full support of this idea! i humbly demand futanari in incarnia!
9/18/2010,make it a module you train to use and i support.
9/18/2010,"no need, a carrier is supposed to have maintaince hangars. (maybe a new cap part for production in order to make the carrier..?)make it happen +1"
9/18/2010,1
9/18/2010,i'm still very much for this idea
9/18/2010,"yeah, why not ; provided the so mechanic ed mentioned or something like it was in place this would be nice. would save people hauling precious cargo from refinery a in system a to to factory b in system b - people would have to actually go further into the system than the gate to get any hauler kills and that would be nice"
9/18/2010,"quote for the truth. would be a bad day. this would not be the end. and this game is getting easier and easier. i mean they have a training boost until 1,6m sp. and if they don't want to train learnings they don't have to.isn't it easy enough? once eve gamer were proud that eve is complex. please don't destroy it."
9/18/2010,very cool.. thanks for posting that link... now if hybrid weapons could get some kind of buff....
9/18/2010,"ummm, trebor, where exactly is this mentioned? i've read that blog twice and didn't see this issue brought up anywhere."
9/18/2010,"yeah, nice improvement to the contacts folder with tyrannis.oh wait...it sucks now."
9/18/2010,"it looks more web 2.0 now but it's dire, please roll it back and dock the pay of everyone who worked on it and the guy who pitched it. in fact, fine him a large sum of money and use it to pay the other devs for the overtime they need to get the other issues sortedalso preferably hang the guy who pitched the ""improved"" contacts list"
9/18/2010,"this is different from rmt, because money people would get for redeeming plexes for items or services (character transfers...) has already been paid to ccp. so there would be no issue about somebody suddenly deciding to turn 850 bilion isk into dollars and bankrupting ccp. it seems that ccp is currently concerned about the plexes being stockpiled on the market (see: destroyable plex, latest qen, second initiative to basically remove plex from game), and this could solve the issue easily."
9/18/2010,"replace ""voucher"" with plex. while i've loved the idea of plex for eve store credit for some time now, it may be a little too complicated for ccp to arrange."
9/18/2010,"a few further ideasthe more i think about it, the more i like something akin to the lp store interface. a new button can be added to the station if the facility is setup. this means that isk might be one factor, but maybe u need to hand over a t1 ship and other stuff to get a discounted t2 (i.e. give some of the inputs for t2 building back to your industry base) - all of this depends on the configuration, much like contracts do.a new tab on either the corp screen or the market screen should also exist to1) let you see what is up for sale2) maybe purchase remotely (though should work like contracts and only if you are in the region). this can only work if you have the physically required items in your hangar at the location of the sale (isk obviously is not effected).i'm not sure about if the actual concept of corp/alliance lp is a good one. it does allow for active members to be rewarded, but i am not 100% sure how to make the mechanic work. does the ceo hand them out. do you get them based on the amount of xyz u do (hard to balance ratting vs missions vs mining vs industry here) etc..."
9/18/2010,"cool idea, not the first time i've heard it but worth adding."
9/18/2010,interesting idea and very useful thing
9/18/2010,i support this concept
9/18/2010,"here is what i was thinking about - i know the idea has been around for awhile but this is my solution to it .... scenario -- i have 2 characters on 1 account. character a i have continuously training skills since its my main. and i want to be able to train character b on the same account for a month or two so i can get em flying an orca for example. right now, the only options i have is. a) stop training on character a and train the orca skills i need for character b. b) transfer character b off the account onto a new account. then transfer em back after training is complete( which isnt really an option )suggestion -- option c, give plexs the ability to activate another character training slot on the same account.**example - i log into the character b while character a is training. buy a plex in-game. on use of the plex it gives me the option to use plex to extend subcription or unlock a skill training slot so character b which used the plex can now train along side character a. after that skill slot time has expired account reverts back to 1 character training on the account. ccp makes more money! and players get the option to train 2 characters on one account and make us happy :)"
9/18/2010,sounds good... expinsive but good.i support the op... also first... lol
9/18/2010,"sure why not.. its no different than paying for another account, except you get less total character slots."
9/18/2010,"not exactly. if you were to buy another account, ccp gets the activation fee (unless you activate by plex), but also, more importantly, a commitment that you will keep playing on that account. therefore ccp can expect to get money from you for an extended period of time. if you wish to break this commitment and yet still keep playing the character, you have to pay the $20 character transfer fee. if this change was implemented, people would be compelled to just train their alts for a month or two, whereas without this change they would consider a full subscription.i would like to see this change too, but i understand why it would hurt ccp's business model. and i do not see it as anything crucial."
9/18/2010,first of all i really like that idea but i'm asking myself why ccp hasn't done this already? my guess is that it would be a lot of work to do that probably too much work and it would be even more work to make it possible to play 2 chars on the same account simultaneously =o also i would prefer to have all those bugs fixed and rebalanced done before such things get taken on
9/18/2010,"because ccp will lose $40 because of two transfer fees, which beats the $15 they get from a plex."
9/18/2010,so... 2 one time transfers are greater than continuous 15$ / month in?
9/18/2010,"this is correct but also..1) training more than 1 character in the same account is not equal to training more than 1 character in multiple account.2) with multiple accounts you can do multiple boxing(simultaneous game play with multiple screens).3) with multiple characters in one account you have to play with one at a time.conclusion: if this is allowed,then it will generate more revenue for ccp. most importantly giveus players more flexibility in game play."
9/18/2010,"when you start another account in order to get the same results, it's one time transfer fees plus continuous $15 a month."
9/18/2010,"if you start another account you get a free month from the invite, so the activation fee doesn't really matter."
9/18/2010,"i agree this needs to be allowed. i have had an instance where i needed to contract 50+ rigged ships (many of which i did not have the skills to fly), along with containers of ammo, and a few of them had damaged crystals. i ended up giving up and having the person come to the system to trade with me because that was quicker than finding all of the damaged crystals manually among thousands of items in each container. plus since i couldn't fly some of the rigged ships, i would have to repackage them to get the crystals out, causing destruction of the rigs."
9/18/2010,supported.
9/18/2010,"after reading the minutes, it seems that the csm wanted to change the focus of low-sec to a sort of pirate haven. while i agree that pirates should have their place in low-sec, we also need to include the bounty hunter/vigilante type folks in the equation as well. if you are going to give the pirates all these great toys, give the vigilantes the same toys to play with.thank you!"
9/18/2010,"they're in low demand because of high cost. people don't even think of putting them on anything except carebear pimpboats and some caps. all t2 rigs that has any usage at all are hundreds of times the cost of their t1 counterparts. there are a few exceptions among rigs that no one ever use (eg, small t2 rigs that decrease hybrid cpu usage, or increase laser falloff, etc)."
9/18/2010,"this is my idea for a new item that would boost ice mining and add another use for pi mats in eve.performance fuels, all ships would get a fuel tank added to them that would be accessable like the drone bay. when a ""performance fuel"" is put into it the ship begins burning it at all times its in use. durring this time the ship would gain boosted stats.stat boostsminmatar ice fuels and pi comods would produce a fuel that increass ship speed by 4%.amarr ice & pi stuff would produce a fuel that gives 4% cap recharge bonuscaldari ice fuels & pi stuff profduce a fuel that would increase shield recharge by 4%gallente ice & pi stuff would give another stat a 4% boost. perhapse electronics effects.perhapse even faction fuel bpcs could give a double effect fuel like 56% of the minmatar speed and 56% of the amarr fuels cap recharge bonus so that fuel would give+2.24% speed bonus and +2.24% cap recharge rate."
9/18/2010,isn't this basically boosters?
9/18/2010,"yes, this should be added to the game for the sole purpose of making your macro-icers more profitable."
9/18/2010,"good idea, quick draft for how copies could look like: (note: ""quick"", didnt have much time :p)please visit your user settings to re-enable images.as for me/pe levels on the icon, i'm afraid for the numbers to be readable, the corners would need to be too big. alternate suggestion would be to add sort by me/pe/# of copies left in the hangar-columns - shouldnt be too much work as a) ccp is already working on adding columns for metalevel and all that stuff and b) the system is already in place for the blueprint selection/manufacturing window."
9/18/2010,"features and ideas discussion thread -> commonly proposed ideas -> post 5, link to -> makes bpos and bpcs distinguishable -> why it can be done without redoing the whole database even the difference between bpc and bpo will kill the database, read the linked thread."
9/18/2010,displaying me/pe on the icon would require a database call for each bp each time it's displayed. that would kill the database.but: supporting differentiation between bpo/bpc
9/18/2010,"actually, i consider pilgrims, arazus, rapiers etc rather decent combat vessels. these do not suffer virtually any drawbacks. honestly i would be open to only make the cool down effect cov ops ships that have cynos or combat capability. really think that this is uneven for a petition but if that is what is being argued over so be it. (in other words, allow t2 scan boats immunity to cool down, provided they do not have a normal cyno, cov ops cyno being exempt to give them a better role then simply a prober.)"
9/18/2010,crying less and sucking lessboth are things the op needs to start doing more of. cloaking is fine the way it is.
9/18/2010,cloaking is the counter to being found ;)stop whining.
9/18/2010,"cloaking in and of itself is not what is broken, it the ships capable of using cloaks with little detrimental effects that is out of whack - made even worse by the mwd/cloak trick which makes nailing them even in transit a remote possibility.- no change to covert cloaks and other dedicated ships.- increase cloak cpu fitting by a factor of 10,and/or- double scan res penalty plus add similar lock range penalty so it cannot be mitigated by a single module. penalties apply only if cloak onlined (ie. not active, but online)."
9/18/2010,"cloaks are working as intended.. to avoid being caught. this is just another ""afk cloaker"" whine.there are downsides to this being that the ships that can use covert ops cloaks are fragile and normal cloaks really dampen a ship's performance. there are plenty of counters to covert ships. just because you can't think of them doesn't mean they don't exist."

9/18/2010,"one unique idea as sort of a way to make covert ops somewhat more risky without making it too unfair is to create a new type of drone that does no damage but will orbit the ship that deploys them with a 25km range. the orbit will follow an atom shape pattern rather than the typical circling pattern to increase the chances of catching something. to compensate for the fact that there's only 5 drones, they could travel extra fast speeds (considering they carry no weapons) and/or give them an uncloak distance bonus depending on the size of the drone. this solution may help discourage the use of cans and such."
9/18/2010,"there are three platforms: eve client/server, the forums and eve gate.in the excellent recent csm posting, the only must for the winter release was something that really had nothing to do with the winter release, a forum feature. i do not see any technical why that feature is tied to the winter release. it could happen a week or month before or after. i can think of reasons why i would not want to roll out new forums and eve client on the same day. nor do i see a lot of tradeoffs: isn't there a web team so more forum/eve gate changes are not going to affect the ""zomg fix lag guyz"" team. eve gate and the api may need some changes to the server but none to the client. and some basic web changes to eve gate do not require waiting for a release.hasn't the eve ecosystem gotten more complex than one new client/server every six months and shouldn't the planning reflect that?"

9/18/2010,"pretty much what it says on the box. assume 'n' equals the quantity of identical drones. if you launch a flight of 'n' hammerhead ii's, the drones will be a single entity in space. the model could be 'n'-number of drones in some close-formation. for every 1/n hp damage taken, dps drops by 1/n (to simulate the loss of a drone). if possible, the drone stack will not be able to rep above that hp level (i.e. you cant rep a 'destroyed' drone). once the drone stack is recalled the number of drones recovered from the stack correspond to the hp level remaining. if for some reason you want to assign different drones to different targets, the stack will split in to smaller ones. pros:server has to calculate flight paths, damage dealt and damage taken for only a fraction of the current number of entities = less lag. less overview clutter.less moving boxes in main view.cons (more specifically, unwanted side-effects):a ship could lock all 5 drones by just targeting the stack instead of having to target each individual drone. drone hp would be different from current model. i.e. right now, to destroy a flight of drones you go drone 1 shield > armor > structure, drone 2 shield > armor > structure, etc etc. with the current model it would be drone 1-5 shield > armor > structure. having a shield that's 5 times as big would certainly have some effect on the shield recharge, and would give a pretty significant buff to drone hp. finally, it would be pretty hard to figure out where the hp level would be for 'loosing' a drone. a possible solution (if game mechanics allow it) to segment the shield, armor, and structure hp to reflect the number of drones and go down drone 1's three hp types, then to on to drone 2's and so on."
9/18/2010,sounds like it creates just as many problems as it solves.
9/18/2010,"explain to me, why would i stack my drones if they can be killed/locked at once instead of 1-1?nobody will do it."
9/18/2010,"unwanted effects: negative- wing of drones can be ecmed as a single target;- maybe it can make even worth it tu use a tracking disruptor;- high damage weapons become much more effective, killing 2+ drones with one shot;positive:- you can rr a bunch of drones in one go;"
9/18/2010,/signednone of the issues you suggest are relevand in the type of warfare that would best benefit from this change.in large fleet fights that is.i just cant imagine anyone locking a drone in a 500 vs 500 fight. in lesser fights ( ie 10 vs 10 on a gate ) it just dosent matter and everyone can use drones unstacked w/o having big lag issues also.
9/18/2010,"i dont give a **** really about locking them 1-1 or all 5, but in 500 vs 500 fights smartbombing is common, all drones in 1 place and you got smartbombing efficiency 500% up.p.s. learn to ""tick"" the support button"

9/18/2010,"i'm not so much concerned by the content of the list, i think they're all good ideas and ""easy"" fixes, but the fact that ccp only made one item a ""must"", and that was effectively changing a setting on their forum software. not even directly related to the game tbh. but i guess we have to see how seriously ccp takes the ""should"" issues, and how many actually make it into the next expansion, or if ccp isn't actually committing to any of these issues."
9/18/2010,"background for the proposal:hello, i am kalindra naskan and i'm able to post this thanks to a friend having an active eve account.i was an eve player from 2005 - 2008 and is, according to my account status, no longer a part of the eve community. but i'm sure the people i flew beside of or fought against will say differently. i have stories to tell about what i've experienced and knowledge to share. just because i'm not playing doesn't change this.from time to time also try to keep up to date with politics, events and generally just the development of eve. there is a problem however. while i can read about everything, i can't give my own opinion on the politics of eve. i can't comment on the direction the development is going. i can just read. it is wrong that people that's part of the eve community, when they're not active players, can't interact with the rest of the community.i know there exist fan forums, but that's not where the core player base resides. i believe that a member of the community should always be able to interact with all the others in the community, even if they're no longer playing.there are many reasons why someone is not playing anymore. from disliking that it will take 18 months before there will be fixes for old content, real life just doesn't work your way preventing you from playing or maybe even just pure burnout. but as i laid out above, they are still part of the community.i still feel strongly for eve online and the concept behind the game, and recommend it for people that might like it. because i know it's a unique came that has a one of a kind community. that is why i think it shouldn't be restricted to those only playing right now.to summaries the proposal:i believe that people that have played eve and been a part of it, should be able to write on the forums if their account is inactive.positives of the proposal:it is an invitation to all old players to rejoin the community and be a part of it again. it might even inspire some to start playing again.it can put ccp in a good light showing that they care about their community and wants to keep it together.negatives of the proposal:i first asked ccp if i could get temporary access to the forums to post this proposal, and i received this response from support:this means that the forum login system needs to be modified in order for this proposal to work. and while we can speculate, only ccp knows how much work that entails.i also realize that there might be issues in deciding when a player should be counted as part of the community. when he has paid for the first month, or when he has paid for six months?please come with your own inputs and suggestions for this idea and more positives/negatives.regardskalindra naskan, never ending member of the eve community"

9/18/2010,"tl;dr: no you are not a member of this community. you have ties to it and some of it's members and you care about the direction the game takes, but that is all irrelevant to your posting rights on this forum and should remain so. not supported.i'm not in favor of this. primarily as this is an eve discussion forum for the players. if you don't have an active account, you are no longer a member of this community. you maybe a part of another overlapping community and still have ties to some members of this one, but that is not relevant to your posting rights on this forum. even subscribers can lose that right and non-subsribers should not have it to begin with. also if you are not a subscriber, i don't want to hear your oppinions on events and issues or hear your ideas, and i don't want to see you or others like you trolling and spamming these forums with all sorts of nonsense.active players should decide the direction this game takes and anyone else should have no say in the matter. we also have enough active players to help people out, so while you wanting to help out is admirable, your help isn't really required. there are other sites(ccp twitter, ccp facebook, mmo sites, scrapheap, ect.) where non-subscribers can talk about things with active players and there are other methods of staying in contact with your buddies. if you want to influence the direction ccp takes, either subscribe or have a member of the community post your ideas and oppinions."
9/18/2010,"i have to agree with t'amber, while you and others, myself at one point have things to offer the drawback of needing to be active serves as a minor deterrent to abuse from accounts/characters that no longer will/can have any reprisals against them for their work on the forums. even now you need a 'posting' alt to 'abuse' the forums or face whatever fallout might come from your posts and unless you plan on never letting that account in a majority of corps, can not give out your api to reveal that posting alt, or continually recycle it, and once in a corp can't use it as you may have in the past. all that is *if* you care enough to do so, with a non active account you are free from those *if* they would have even been any issue for you at all. simply put either you reactivate, post on another forum or 'move on' from a game you aren't interested/able to play anymore."
9/18/2010,"as for the supercap/cap ship issue which set off finn's latest bout of indigestion, a few thoughts. much of the csms and other pilots are looking for ways to revitalize low sec. various proposals to promote piracy, avoid blobs, fix bounty hunting, keep out null sec alliances, create commerce, and the like have been floated. some folks like irae seem to think that cap and/or supercap ships are overpowered and work against some of these goals. perhaps they are right. now i really like moar's idea about rethinking the role of faction navies in low sec. while i wouldn't want to keep caps and supercaps out of low sec, moar got me thinking about the neutral zone in st. the federation and romulans would proportionally respond to an enemy incursions, based in part on the proximity of the incursion to their respective borders. so i started to think about a fusion of low sec, the netural zone, concord and faction navies as part of a 'layered response' to the presence of caps and supercaps in low sec. as a tentative idea, it would look something like this. concord and faction navy ships would respond to the presence of cap and supercap ships in low sec. concord in .04 and .03 systems, and faction navies in .04 through .01 systems. the strength and speed of the response would diminish as the security status of the system dropped.caps would be engaged in .02 space, and supercaps in .01 space. the higher the security status of the system, the more robust and fast would be the response of concord and/or faction navies. one can readily think about functional alternatives, such as responding to caps or supercaps a certain number of jumps from empire, restricting the ability to disrupt warp, etc. i'll leave that to others. there may be several benefits to adapting moar's ideas on faction navies, but to my mind, the main one is that npcs could be used to achieve a better balance of cosmic elements without resorting to bans or nerfs of particular ships and their functionality. in some ways, this would be an extension of live events, only with pilots fighting alongside not against npcs. in this particular case, pilots could still use caps and supercaps in hotdrops, pitched battles and supply runs in both low and null sec. doing so outside .01/.02 space, however, would have consequences that would increase as the security status of the system climbed. alliances maintaining pets in low sec through the use of overpowered ships would not be advantaged as much as they were before. the use of caps and supercaps by pirate and factional warfare fleets would be diminished to the benefit of small group pvp. delilah wildfriendsofeve.wordpress.comtrolling contents removed. jericho"
9/18/2010,"enough with the ""ccp needs to make lowsec safer by adding a police force"" crap. you seem to be proposing that concord hates all capital ships and supercapitals because they're generically ""overpowered"" and it should expand its areas operation into lowsec. well, i have news for you.1. you're talking out of your arse, as you have no idea how many of these mechanics that you complain about work. try living in lowsec before complaining about lowsec.2. you have no idea how capitals and supercapitals are balanced or imbalanced. currently, the only problem involving caps/supercaps is that a lot of lowsec fights end up with one side dropping supercarriers on the other side, obviously to the detriment of the goal of small-gangs and piracy. there are solutions to this; however, one of them is not some kind of vague nerf to capital ""overpoweredness.""3. concord only exists because ccp had to make highsec killings be penalized. it's a shame that you probably have the wrong reasoning associated with this, but unfortunately there's a character limit and explaining to you why ccp would make unauthorized highsec aggression have such serious penalties would exceed it. concord is not there to be your friend and savior. it is there to blow up the jerk who blew up you. it has no place killing capitals just because they exist in lowsec. even assuming for some reason that capitals don't belong in lowsec, ccp would be much better off simply preventing them from cynoing into it.also, your idea would mean chribba's veldnaught would have to get concordokken the next time he undocks in amarr because of where it is, not because of its actions. this is a fairly obvious indicator that your suggestion has some flaws in it.4. this is not star crap academy. this is eve. 5. as mentioned previously, this is eve. htfu, and try shooting someone before claiming to know how to adjust combat mechanics.sadly, i'm 99% certain already that my words will have no effect, aimed as they are towards delilah wild. as for the rest of you, hopefully you can gleam something of value from this. such as ""delilah wild is not someone who should be taken seriously when talking about combat."""

9/19/2010,"supported!i don't see how putting the bulges in the right place has anything to do with complete nudity or making eve an 18+ game. if a gallente exotic dancer is wearing a bikini then their anatomy should equate to the back story, end of.if people are calling for sexually explicit strip clubs then there is a separate issue that will exist irrespective of the dancers genitalia. i personally have no problem with 18+ areas such as you get in 2nd life but can only see that scenario being cost efficient for ccp if it attracts more subscribers, at that point you've got at ask if those are the sort of subscribers we want to attract to the game?as for futanari it would be good to see it expressed openly in gallente stations, it adds depth to racial differences and if anyone objects they can always play as an emotionally repressed god botherer."
9/19/2010,you do realize the exotic dancers are just pixels? toons? if you need that imagery buy a magazine you can keep open on the desk while you play the game.i have heard it's all the rage to play eve without your pants on anyways. :pfunny proposal -- i vote no.
9/19/2010,"yes to genderbending traps, absolutely yes to ending this hetronormative fascism.futanari!(no to nudity btw)"
9/19/2010,"hetero-normative gender stereotypes are an amarrian principle. if i had my way all the clothing and outfits in amarrian stations would be very gender specific and wearing clothes that did not match your gender and economical and social status would be punishable by fines or loss of standing. however cross dressing in gallente station would be common and otherwise not a big deal. you don't need nudity to add futanari to incarna i just put it in the thread as an optional term. yes a gallente stripper with a great body, nice boobs and a tasteful bulge would make the eve experience that much realer to me. fable handles sexuality in a way that parents are not afraid to buy the game for their child. in fable you can get married, have sex, get pregnant, get aids, and make decisions on contraceptives. yet they do it in a way that has no adult content.. if eve did something like this, where there was no actual nudity but there was however a clear text and visual indicator that the girl your looking at has both toys under the trunk then it would work."

9/19/2010,"it isn't supposed to eliminate 0.0 markets or market pvp.for starters, you need docking rights to get the stuff out of a non npc 0.0 station. the fact that there needs to be a max limit in the same way that there is a limit on corp contracts would not remove the markets totally.it would however give corps/alliances a way to distribute things like skill books without them being subject to market pvp etc...oh, and previous poster - i think that would be a bit hard to implement. what happens if you want to sell a ship the module is fitted to (or the ship itself that you got from corp/alliance store). being able to set an order for a one off or once per time interval will stop people abusing the system in much the same way."
9/19/2010,you can already make corporation and alliance contracts. any more of that and you will ruin 0.0 markets.
9/19/2010,"i have a better idea, or atleast a modification to this one.instead of a corp/alliance store, add somethign so when your putting something up on the market you can click a chekbox and set a discount to corp members and even another sepparate discount to alliance members,.... then when ppl form your corp/alliance look on the broker they will see that some items up for sale are highlighted green, and they will know someone from their corp/alliance put the item up on the market at a discount for you. and the listed price would then reflect that discount.also it would be nice if you could set a sepparate price modifier to selected corps/alliances and be able to charge them more (for example if you dont like them and dont want them buying your stuff or atleast not without paying out the nose for it).these items would be listed as red on the market.i give support for this ver of the idea. this way you wouldnt have to keep soem items off the general market inorder to sell just to corp/alliance mates,.. anyone can still buy but if they are from your alliance (or an non liked corp) they would pay the modified price."
9/19/2010,"so you would rather put them in a hangar and give access to everyone who might need it??? as someone in an au timezone, i often don't have someone online who has the roles.i repeat - this is not supposed to replace the whole market. it is supposed to allow a limited amount of items to be sold to corp/alliance under defined conditions."
9/19/2010,definately- might make things easier for the inventory nodes too.
9/19/2010,hi sec is dangerous enough to try to make a living in what your suggesting would mean that every and i mean every mission runner would then be ganked regardless if they are worth it or not kill or the lols ??.hulkageddon makes mining risky and sometimes unprofitable where expencive ships are totalled for the lolswhats next missiongeddon kill every mission runner you can find ?? would mean the death of eve imo.totally not supporting this idea hi sec is hi sec regardless if its dead space mission areas or not you gank players in hi sec expect to be ganked by the ultimate gankers in the game concord.

9/19/2010,necro'ing threads should result in temp. bans on these forums. >.>
9/19/2010,it use to be like that you know. i would have no problems going back to that if they reverse the scaning changes back to the old days and reverse the protection that dead space gave to scaning as well to the old days.pirats get to try and find mission sites and bears can omost just as safely mission in low sec as high sec again. i would have to go buy a dominix again and cheap fleet neut/fit it again for low sec. i like dominix becouse you dont need weapons o high slots realy. you can put nuets and cloaking in high put the needed drones for killing mission pluse jamming drones in drone bay. ya this old bear us to do alot of low sec missions in the old days. the cloaking normaly gets the job done of saving your ship becouse all the mission dps retargets there pvp ship but neuts and jaming drones can help alot too

9/19/2010,"tldr: people (collectively) need to know what it is that they can't do and what will happen if they do it. once the exploits are known, then enforcement can be much faster and more direct.currently, ccp's method of handling exploits seems to be lacking in several major areas that are essential for developing effective policies. for a policy to be effective, it must be clear, visible, and known to be enforced. currently eve exploit policy doesn't fit any of those criteria very well.currently, every individual person who discovers something they think is an exploit or bug is required to file a bug report and wait for a response. if they have found an exploitable bug then they can't tell anyone else in eve to stop doing it because they are not permitted to publish anything about exploits. this leads to every player in eve having the immediate defense of ""i thought it was working as intended"" for anything that they do. it would be unreasonable of ccp not to take that into account when determining penalties for tos violations.exploits must be published via the login screen and forums if ccp is able to detect their use via server logs or if the exploit is a long-term operation. if ccp is reasonably capable of confirming that a particular exploit has occurred then they need to publish those exploits and notify players that this action is not permitted. ccp shouldn't publish how to perform that exploit but simple notification of the effects will allow normal players to avoid using them.i've always felt that ccp's enforcement of exploits was far too lenient because players generally had little indication that a particular action was or was not classified as an exploit. on published exploits, better communication of minimum and maximum actions taken for violations would greatly improve the deterrent effect. if, for example, the first incident of an account exploiting a published bug resulted in a mandatory 2-month ban up to permanent banning or significant sp loss with subsequent violations having higher and higher minimum penalties until the minimum becomes a permanent account ban.summary:* communicate existing exploits to players* communicate significant minimum penalties for exploiting published bugs* communicate rapid escalation of penalties for accounts repeatedly utilizing published exploitsedit: a listing of bugs may also slightly reduce the number of petitions players open for ""bugs"" that are actually normal game mechanics."
9/19/2010,"if you're too stupid to recognize an obvious exploit when you see one without having it spelled out for you, you deserve to be punished.see above. assuming they were published, however: people who used the exploit anyway after being warned should receive a minimum penalty of permanent account closing.maybe one warning in cases where it's not clear an exploit was use purposely or repeatedly. otherwise, permanent account closing.summary: exploiters don't need special rights and protection, not supported."
9/19/2010,waiting weeks for a gm response to a petition or a reply is crazy. there needs to be a sense of urgency about petitions. there is also the need for a maximum time for a petition to go unsettled before being elevated to a higher gm. as it is i have been waiting for two and a half weeks for a petition to be settled.
9/19/2010,"what are the details of your proposal? what steps should ccp take to address this issue? what do you believe the maximum wait time should be?i'm actually going to contribute, here. in my opinion, there should be a set of restrictions on what sort of issues may be petitioned. frivolous petitions (of which i'm sure there are many) should be punishable by a week-long ban for the first offense, a month-long ban for the second offense, and a year-long ban for the third offense.i'd estimate this would slash the number of petitions by at least a third, and possibly even half or more."
9/19/2010,"good questions actually. an honest first response time of no more than 24 hours need to be in place. i understand the volume of petitions but its not like ccp cant make a system to at least tell you where you are in the queue. the other step they need to take is to clump petitions. petitioning a glitch? the system matches phrases and makes a single petition for the glitch, reply goes to everyone. or tells them to file it as a bug, which needs to be do able from in the petition system honestly.get another 24 hour max response time when elevating the petition. automatically elevates after x days (4-5) if the petition is not a bug report or not labeled as a non issue. which brings in labeling, how does ccp label petitions internally anyways? a dev-blog on the actual petition process would be an interesting read.in all no petition should take more than a couple of days tops to resolve. there must be a sense of urgency in responding to people. even a stern reprimand for being stupid is better than no response. why cant the system send canned responses for things like getting scammed? petition: i got scammed in jita! response: awareness and common sense are key skills in eve. it is your responsibility to closely examine any offers made to you. please refer to :link: for more. how hard is that?"

9/19/2010,"people have been grumbling about how much lowsec sucks for ages. the csms are trying to address that, and your first thought is to complicate matters unnecessarily by dragging vigilantes and bounty hunters into the equation?let them work on one clear issue at a time, please. they don't need everyone and his brother muddying the waters with his own personal vision of how things should proceed. also, hardly anyone gives a toss about vigilantes (meaning they're low-priority); the bounty system is a separate issue altogether, and should be treated as such."
9/19/2010,"there is no stated direction so it is not possible to change it even slightly, but:it goes without saying that if low-sec does get something like sovereignty for pirates, that the same is available to everyone else.the idea is to make it into the underbelly of society and that includes the hunters and vigilantes as far as i am concerned.we have some threads down yonder in f&i about possible scenarios. go give your input, some interesting visions so far."

9/19/2010,"while looking for something unrelated, i stumbled upon this devblog:"
9/19/2010,"i support anything that would bring the cost of t2 down.in 0.0 sec the value of a destroyed ship is important. the values effect a pvp pilot's win/loss percentages.value=hull cost+equip+mods+cargodestroying an expensive ship is a huge feather in your cap and each week's stats include the 5 most expensive ships killed.most pilots will fly with t1 rigs or no rigs at all when in a blob.t2 turrets are used-of course they do the best dps if your skills are maxed. t1 or named turrets are used more.as to support equip. some t2 is used-mwd, invul fields, damage controls-but again t1 or named are used more often.keeps the cost of losing your own ship down and your percentages up.not to mention that you have to replace so many ships and modules if you're active with pvp.this of course may be different when low sec ganking. high sec mission running would most likely be all t2.i personally put the blame on invention- my characters can invent and have invented but it's a real pain in the ass.you have to set up research agents for data cores but for the better research agents you have to invest in training the particular skills-if you want to invent a lot of different things you need a lot of different skills. your chance of success is horrible if you haven't trained each skill to level 4, use a t1 base item and the most expensive instructions.then you need to scan down sites for a chance at getting the right parts for an invented item build-or buy them for a whole lot of isk.you can invent without instructions (the top of the line give max runs but are very expensive if you need to buy them) but your bpc will have only 1 run.the biggest complaint here is having to make copies of your originals because for some odd reason you are not allowed to invent of a bpo.not to mention the fact that a new invented bp is just a copy.don't forget the trouble to find open copy and invention slots and the cost of setting up and running those slots. which does vary so shop around. you will most likely have to wait in line.the research for time and materials on your original also effects cost of invention build -again good luck on finding an open slot to research materials-time you can find.needless to say i invent rarely and only for my personal use not for mass marketing.all this makes t2 cost too much."
9/19/2010,at least allow the cargo rigging to effect all bays.
9/19/2010,"asarus atreyu> kinda, i guess you could view it as a booster for the ship.goose99> hell ya my macro has only been pullin 300 mil a day need to get back up to thet 3 bil a-day mark.ok sarcazm asside i think it would add a nice twist to the game and boost the economy win win!"
9/19/2010,"nope, this would be another necessity to have for any pvp pilot.both boosters and overloading are very similar to this idea, and each has its balancing side effect. i don'tt think another such mechanic is needed, definitely not as a basically free stat boost."
9/19/2010,.
9/19/2010,"no, horrible idea- so youre waiting at a gate to jump a target and you run out of fuel because you waited- and if you use just a little fuel and dont run out for hours, then the idea is eaven worse because everyone will just put fuel by default. every ship has fuel, ammo and drones, that would be the normon a similar note i did have an idea, i didnt think it was worth posting, so il post it here- ship overloadingyou get maybe a 10% boost on everything ship related, speed, agility, cap recharge, shield recharge and ship bonusesbut like any overload you take damage, hull damagethat would make active tanks (without damage controlls) more viable in pvp (i think)"
9/19/2010,"not supported in it's current outline.if a fuel tank can have a viable non-duplicating job or effect, sure i would support it depending on what it would accomplish.possibly a tool for a last ditch effort to escape a bubble or scram.it should not be an additional ship structure piece but a module for the low slots.it's size and weight would logically add to signature radius and be a detriment to speed."
9/19/2010,"not supported, cloaks work fine as they are, look at my proposal with the destroyer idea, much better idea."

9/19/2010,lol
9/19/2010,"cloaking is fine as it isa cloaky ship, specifically a frigate like a bomber wouldn't last two volleys toe to toe with a cruiser or bc unless it was rigged and tanked-then it would maybe be 3 volleys but the tanking would hamper it's dps.if a cloaked ship jumps off a gate into a bubble there are very effective ways to uncloak it.they make good scouts but while cloaked they can warp, but can't use mwd, or shoot. any modules/buffs that need to be active to work won't activate while cloaked.frigate on frigate is fun.10 bombers on 1 drake is funmostly single cloakers are scouts.keep an eye on your local and you'll be fine. don't rat by yourself with a nuet in system--basic stuff."
9/19/2010,[issue] players using local chat to determine if a hostile is potentially hunting them has no counter.

9/19/2010,"the year is 2010, eve has been around since 2003.this will not likely change.gb2wow already"
9/19/2010,"more 'eye candy'? i probably won't use it. i do agree it would look quite nice-for awhileso ok, it's client side (taking up the player computer's resources) and can be clicked off-still it's highly doubtful it will be used much outside mission running. too much going on in fleet fights with or without lag to have more stuff flying around. ever seen 3000 drones buzzing about?? plausible idea for high end computer systems, doing mission running-maybe even some low sec ganking. besides eve prides itself at being different to any other game and won't cookie cut effects, attributes and such from another game. if ccp want's something like this, it most likely will take quite a while before it would be implemented and would be way down on the to do list.ccp still isn't happy with their explosions yet!care should be taking adding things client side or server side. not everyone can afford hi end systems and probably most of the players have mid to lo end sytems not to mention the static systems in internet cafes people use.it's possible that only 30% of the players can run this game comfortably with all graphics settings at max.so if the idea is implemented but only 30% of the player base can or would use it-it becomes a losing proposition.if eve ever gets to the point that a customer needs to buy a whole new computer system just to play it, most of the current base may leave.let some other things get ironed out first and in the future i might support this idea."
9/19/2010,definite yes!
9/19/2010,the reduction of the belts by 80% would put things back in par with the old days before the updates which as everyone knows was a total nightmare coming on to find practically every system in hi sec gone to macroers.best not to mess with the current amounts in the roids as it gives players who either solo mine or mine in small groups i.e 2 or 3 personal accounts the chance to upgrade to larger better equipped ships and what the hell is with everyone wanting to shut down hi sec leave us alone stop picking on us care bears you dont live in hi sec we do.
9/19/2010,i can this about your idea. having recently moved out to null and having to scan down hidden belts it is a *****. if this is a way to cause more people to stop mining it would be very effective. for one the scanning interface is incredibly broken. you have no grid to help judge where your probes are positioned. also smaller things like ships are easier to scan out than a belt with rocks the size of a small moon. till scanning is fixed all this idea would cause is frustration not make mining anymore interesting.
9/19/2010,"i like the idea, but... any changes to the mining dynamic without careful consideration can cause a large decrease in output. this would have an adverse effect on item cost and production.08-1.0 rats=frigates05-07 rats=destroyers and frigatesretrievers and covetors should handle these ok. hulks would have no problem with them. players can tag team-1 guard and one miner.since every macro miner i've seen flees when they begin to take damage just infest more belts with a couple frigates more often. the macros may end up fleeing more than mining.too bad we couldn't warp disrupt (only warp disrupt) a macro miner without concord repercussions.i think we can get by without the cpu, power grid, and high slot buffs.but a plug in aimed at mining drone efficiency would be nice.i also believe all ice belts located in sec 05 or above should be scanned down."
9/19/2010,posted in wrong place brother but here is an idea:find a friend or corp mate with good standing to amarr. create a fleet and put him/her in it and have them approach and do the scanning. make sure you set rewards as shared.

9/19/2010,"enough trolling delilah, it's not entertaining and your ""la la la i can't hear you but i'll keep talking about you in the third person"" routine is the kind of childish level of trolling we expect from you. speaking of your continual trolling, figured out yet how to post with your pvp main? ya know, as long as you're suggesting fixes to the game it'd be nice to know you're not just trolling pvpers and you actually have a clue what you're talking about. figured out how to post with that pvp main, yet? of course delilah knows what she's talking about, i mean she loves pvp and has a pvp main account that, for some reason, she can't figure out how to post with. certainly there are very good reasons to hamstring capital and supercapital pilots from getting anywhere near the lowsec chokepoints that allow them to jump to/from nullsec. there are very, very good reasons why otsasai and the surrounding systems should be no-go systems for the northern coalition's capital fleet. very good reasons, surely. and surely she can explain this, once she figures out how to post with her pvp account (that really does exist, really!) as delilah is not a professional victim and a troll who's pretending to know about and/or like pvp, she knows that the easiest counter to supercaps on the field is to bait them out and counter them with a gank force. certainly. her argument is just a joke, she's having a laugh and satirizing the patheticness of whining 'bears. this is clearly misplaced. deliliah is not a professional victim who would be better off playing on a pve server and she understands that gate guns and security status loss is already a perfectly sufficient method to make low security space less severe than empire but still a place where aggression has to be carefully engaged in. clearly. deliliah is a hardened pvper. yes, on her forum trolling account she has ravaged a grand total of nine enemy ships (and lost 31). and yes her last kill was almost a year and a half ago and that was when she ninjad onto a kill while she was in a noob corp. but she's obviously got a pvp main (she just can't figure out how to post with it). we know this because she's talked about how much she loves pvp. it's a certainty. obviously ccp should look to such savage pvpers as deliliah wildest beasty killer mckillface when evaluating how to deal with the horrible problem of your enemies being able to bring bigger ships than you have. ccp must protect the professional victims, since they obviously cannot do it themselves. it's a tragedy. a tragedy, i tell you. there may be actual tears."
9/19/2010,ps. ccp should consider censoring this critique. it might offend a few griefers.
9/19/2010,"no no, first you need to log out, then you need to log in with the pvp main account of yours that exists (honest!). i can see how you'd mistake that for the rolleyes smiley, however. meanwhile, i see you're up to your old sophomoric wordgame tricks. now those who play a pvp game and aren't professional victims who need ccp to save them from having to play on a server that isn't a pve server are ""griefers"". heavens to betsy!"
9/19/2010,ps. ccp might want to consider censoring this too.
9/19/2010,"while your trolling is (naturally) off topic, the meat of the subject stands on its own and is germane to the topic.-those who do not pvp and, more to the point not only do not understand pvp but are actually hostile to it are the last people who should be giving advice on the pvp dynamics of a revamped lowsec. you've claimed before that you ""love pvp"". i contend otherwise. i contend that you are lying and trolling, and using your fictional ""love of pvp"" to cloak your anti-pvp hysteria, a facade you let slip when you refer to pvp as ""griefing"". i have, repeatedly, called on you to stop trolling and either admit you were lying or post with this pvp main that you claim exists. but it doesn't exist because you're trolling, and you can only respond by rolling your eyes, what with all your mighty 9 kills, the last of which was about a year and a half ago now. -along the same lines, you are trolling with your traditional anti-pvp crusade masked with a ""let's improve things for everybody!"" bait-and-switch. now you want to nerf the ability for thousands of players to ever get their billion+ isk assets out of nullsec close enough to highsec to refit and/or conveniently transfer items. lowsec can use some help, but not from people who want a pve game. they'd be happier playing a pve game, as there are many on the market."
9/19/2010,"the number of lowsec entities that can credibly threaten a supercap is vanishingly small, even allowing for batphoning."
9/19/2010,"the posts from the usual suspects are classic, and follow a well-worn pattern -- personal insults and empty assertions masquerading as argument. pointing this out won't stop it because some people always have to have the last word, and there is no social context to encourage responsible behaviour on their part. i'm hardly the first to point this out, nor the first to notice that such posts exemplify the definition of forum trolling. still, what motivates such an intense animus is a mystery to me. the intolerance, dogmatism and hostility are palpable. indeed, apart from noting these characteristics, there is little to nothing in such posts worthy of a response. ccp has been particularly active on this thread, censoring comments like this one, and by comparison, encouraging ad hominem attacks. perhaps pointing this out will get one or more of us banned from the forums. so be it. delilah wildfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
9/19/2010,"possibly true, but even if so, so what? if, let's say, lowsec residents were even weaker should we ban all armor hac fleets from lowsec, since they couldn't properly counter them? the fact that the tactic has a viable counter is what means that a nerf isn't necessary, although the professional victim crowd want a nerf because they still think it's ccp's job to make sure that all combat is ""fair"". i will admit, that is a hillarious bit of trolling. whining about foivas pointing out your were talking ignorantly about game mechanics or me pointing out that you were lying about your pvp main account (figured out how to post with it yet?) you've posted a personal insult about ""the usual suspects"" and tried to simply handwave away all the arguments that show your argument is full of **** with empty assertions since other than trolling, you've got nothing. posting a content-free whine about other posters just so that you can respond and have the last word, and complaining about how they have to have the last word is icing on the cake. high comedy. of course, responding to you and showing the holes in your argument isn't trolling, and why would it be? but your behavior, like lying about your pvp experience (figured out yet how to post with your pvp main account that really does exist?) or responding to people pointing out that your hatred of pvp is based on a lack of knowledge about game mechanics with snide babbling about ""griefers"" and such, while you ignore everything that's actually posted? that is trolling. why don't you try responding to the arguments rather than trolling the people making them, then? it's hardly rocket science. here are some: -you lack a basic understanding of lowsec mechanics and the situation is not one of unbearable ""imbalance"" but that some entities are able to drop supers on their enemies due to having more assets. -you lack a basic understanding of how 0.0 space interfaces with lowsec, and your proposed nerf to capitals and supercapitals would make logistics and staging locations almost impossible for anybody with a capital ship who'd need to use well-worn ports of call. -concord is there to punish aggression (not save people, at all) and the mere fact of a capital or super existing in lowsec is not aggression and not a valid cause to remove someone's ship, even if letting caps and supers into lowsec was a bad idea (it's not). -using star trek and muddled ""but in another scifi storyline..."" type of thinking to justify horrible changes like making low security into modified highsec where faction navies will respond and try to kill all aggressors misses the point and displays an ignorance of what makes eve unique (besides, there are already star trek games, some which are single player games so you can avoid pvp and those who engage in it, who you call ""griefers""). -eve is, deliberately, a darwinian struggle for territory, resources, ships, kills, etc... if the complaint is that some parties have more/bigger/better ships than you do, someone who understands eve will try to adapt and overcome. a professional victim who doesn't understand eve, and who would do better in a single player game and/or on a pve server will not have to worry about unfair fights, to which their reaction is to demand that ccp protect them from other players, playing the game as intended. ""my opponent has ships/tactics/numbers that i can't counter, ccp, save me!!!"" is the argument of a professional victim, not someone who plays eve and is confident in their ability to play the game"

9/20/2010,supporting the best idea i've ever seen here.
9/20/2010,great idea!i hope it'll work here in hungary 2!
9/20/2010,i wholeheartedly support this proposal.

9/20/2010,so i was flying my hookbill the other night.well it was about 4 weeks ago actually.caldari navy standard launchers x 3.caldari navy missiles ( all flavours ).caldari navy bcu in 1 of the lows.all missile skills at 5.cutting a long story short.i was kiting a daredevil.had him pointed ( disruptor ) and outside his scram / web range.looks like it should have been a win.kinetic missiles could not break his tank not even overheated.switched to explosivelost bonus and still could not break his tank.sigh.i'd like to know of a frigate hull that does more dps with lights if there is one.proof positive that bonuses on cmb's are bad.if the full bonus had been granted to piranaha's it would have been enough.but the low base damage of missiles compounded by the inferior bonus granted to non kin missiles make killing active tanks very difficult.
9/20/2010,"all ships have different damage type characteristics. may this be their resistances or the type of weapons these can fit. the kinetic damage bonus is simply a special bonus, which gives the game more complexity. changing it to a mere damage bonus reduces the complexity of the game.not supported."
9/20/2010,"i support this. caldari only receive the kinetic bonus, the hookbill is the only ship i know off, which has a more 'generic' boost, with 20% to kinetic and 10% to the remaining damage types.gallente get their drones buffed, independently from their 'origin'. a myrm pilot with bc4 will buff his drones with 40% more hp and damage, no matter if it's a hobgoblin or a hornet, which is a caldari drone.in my opinion a damage boost would even out the capabilities of caldari. it just doesn't make sense, that the race which is considered to be relying in missile spam, does not know how to handle anything else but kinetic missiles."
9/20/2010,"yes ccp please remove the learning skills asap. its a complete insanity that you have to spend a month training a skill which gives you no real gain except if you plan your skills years ahead. i have 2 mil sp in learning, and everytime i look at them i rage hard due to the time spent on training sh*t when i could have trained something fun. i spent months training learning skills w/o actually playing, cause i felt i had to in order to be able to enjoy the game. god. just remove the skills so no one else has to suffer through the same horrible experience as i did when i first started this game. please hurry up too."
9/20/2010,not supported! learning skills are fine as they are...
9/20/2010,seriously do not do this... just think about the future...what comes next... ???--> reduce the rank of capital ships to rank 5 and advanced spaceship command down to rank 2 ...and everything because people dont show patience...

9/20/2010,although i can understand that ccp is ultimately a business aimed to make money this is something that will hurt your standings with your valued customers.i for one have been playing this since inception so i would not appreciate the idea that some one can actually get to my levels of skills on multiple characters by using rl cash. yes the option is there for all of us to use but some of us actually do have rl to financially worry about and use this game as a means of escape not of more financial imprisonment.i personally detest this dea and hope ccp comes to it's senses that cash is good but loyalty is much better
9/20/2010,"tell you what, ccp. it's your game, you can kill it if you want. i'd be bummed because i think, even with the bugs, it's the best mmo ever. still though, if it gets to the point where only rich people's brats willing to shell out all their hundreds of dollars in allowance are able succeed in the game...i'll move on and do something else and you'll have to entertain those brats with something other than players (for i doubt i'll be alone).you're already competing with some major new deals coming out. if i have to pay to play and pay to be competitive it just won't be worth it anymore. you're already pushing the boundaries of my tolerance by requiring us to subscribe multiple times to have characters in different professions (and in fact you almost lost me at the start when i was trying to figure out what i wanted to play and wasn't able to test different things at the same time). now that i've played a while i'm actually starting a new account, have purchased plex to sell in game, etc... but there's a limit to how much i'm willing to budget to a game.it'd be a bummer to have to quit eve because the company behind it decided to get more money not by increasing subscriber base and fixing problems that make people go away, but my trying to wring ever more dollars out of the people remaining. it'd be a bummer but you can bet good money that every single one of us has a limit to the amount of crap we'll put up even for a game as good as eve.want to change the sp mechanic? i'd be the first to support it. i failed to get my gf (an avid mmo player) to bite into eve because of the forever wait to play. you can't even spend more time pushing the leveling faster. it kind of sucks to have a character that you have to brew for 6 months before it's ready to do anything interesting. so change it all you want, but don't make it cost extra to speed up the process. that's just being greedy."
9/20/2010,this
9/20/2010,"am i the only one who doesn't really see this as such a major issue? you can already buy plexes and buy a character with that isk that has loads of sp, how is this that much different?"
9/20/2010,because now there is a way to generate sp faster by throwing money at it.

9/20/2010,wtf ccp?????is blizzard buying you out? cuase this sounds like a blizz thing lol. cmon....no selling of anything that gives ingame advantages to one group of people over another.
9/20/2010,"it doesn't mean that further perpetuation of such things are good for the game.among other impacts, it widens the gap just that much more between newer players with not much isk or rl cash and longer-term players who have had time to grow their isk reserves. a slippery slope and a bad precedent, in my opinion.supporting t'amber...just say no to neural remaps for plex. unfortunately this proposal will not be old enough by sunday's meeting to raise it then, but i will raise it in the following meeting if no other csm beats me to it."

9/20/2010,wtf ccp???
9/20/2010,wtf ccp? no!
9/20/2010,"no ccp.. no. eve is not a hooker, and we're not its johns."
9/20/2010,wtf ccp!
9/20/2010,if they do the neural remap then they should do gtc's for t2 bpos otherwise they should stop being stupid
9/20/2010,wtf ccp !!!
9/20/2010,no paying for skill with isk. i'm already too far behind. and you're lucky to get my money as it is since i don't have a job.
9/20/2010,"seriously, how did they think this was a good idea?"
9/20/2010,wtf ccp !?
9/20/2010,"great idea, ccp should allow sp to be re-assigned for plex's too. great stuff ccp..you lot whine and whinge way to much, when you lot rage quit contract me all your stuff before you go play wow"
9/20/2010,"i agree, do not trade plex for remaps."
9/20/2010,signed
9/20/2010,well ccp if this happen then you reall dont give a **** about the main backbone of youre gamers. you have much more important things to fix like all the bugs we have and get the usual bs excuse from gm sorry but we see nothing wrong with youre account
9/20/2010,wtf ccp!
9/20/2010,wtf ccp!first cash for remap ....and than 30 m sps for 500 bucks?ccp got personal from second life?
9/20/2010,plex->character attributes flies in the face of a game that has been built around a time-based levelling paradigm.
9/20/2010,"wtf ccp.i just returned to eve recently and rushed into a completely stupid remap on one of my old alt characters, but i'd rather suffer through a year of sub-par sp than see plex for remaps.supported."
9/20/2010,it's all about the benjamins baby!
9/20/2010,no god damn way!!! way to late in the game to start this **** ccp.
9/20/2010,"-i saw something like this coming when they gave out the 100,000 skill point bonus for that long down time. -how hard could it be to sell 100,000 skill point plexes? - now extra remaps, ugh. -don't do it ccp."
9/20/2010,wtf ccp
9/20/2010,wtf ccp?
9/20/2010,"what the f%&k ccp?seriously, this idea is bull****."
9/20/2010,"wow, possibly the single dumbest thing someone could possibly implement. the only dumber thing would be walking in-station. seriously though ccp, please do not go through with this."
9/20/2010,lmao.agreed. please do not do this ccp.
9/20/2010,"plexes are bought and sold with isk. as such, i don't support this thread.-liang"
9/20/2010,and no!
9/20/2010,"this makes me and who knows how many other eve players believe ccp is heading in the direction of microtransactions, which are one thing: bad. oh, so very very bad."
9/20/2010,they are also brought into the game with real money.
9/20/2010,my good god. what is going on here. i mean if someone lost 74 plexes in ship could you imagine someone being able to remap literally every week in order to get into that titan.... i support my serbian leader.
9/20/2010,wtf ccp?!
9/20/2010,wtf ccp?
9/20/2010,"i strongly want plex gone. it's ridiculous that rmt is legalised by them. want a titan? well just get out your credit card. unfortunately too many people on the otherside of the transaction like the idea of playing eve for free. and plexes were cleverly marketed as a solution() to rmt before enough people realised it was akin to governments selling methadone in every corner shop to solve a ****** (edit: diamorphine) epidemic.but that's no reason not to resist further steps down this spiral, or it won't be long before subscription 2.0 is a reality. infact this change would basically be a mild version of subscription 2.0. pretty ironic that it was only a little over 2 years ago ccp joked about it to emphasise that eve didn't have a crappy pay model like other games (i'm posting with the forced-assumption this is actually true, cos right now i'm not believing it)"
9/20/2010,"supported.at the very least, missions that incur a standing loss with a high security faction due to ""combat - ship kill"" should not initiate the 4-hour timer nor incur a standings loss for declining it.if that's not practical, then remove ""combat - ship kill"" losses from targets in missions, or make the losses much smaller."
9/20/2010,"+1/signi have also stopped doing missions a long time ago after ive done the cosmos mission content which i enjoied a lot but i can do only once... plz add more common missions in that style including ""scanning"" hacking for example and stuff..."
9/20/2010,this.we are not the faction warfarers you are looking for...
9/20/2010,"the missions do suck, and are overly repetitive and predictable.however, any changes to them, such as l4's need to be done carefully. you can't make them harder without introducing more reward, and right now it's not a great idea to make l4's any more rewarding than they are now.of course the biggest improvement to missions should be allowing the placement of agents in 0.0 outposts. this should be a system upgrade option. you do that and you can have an entire alliance able to support itself with just a couple systems."
9/20/2010,"you're wrong, eve is a multiplayer game where other people can interfere with your playstyle. they can pee in ""your"" sandbox, so to speak. plus, eve is a mainly pvp sandbox game. pve only exists to support pvp, so if you're an isk farmer then you're playing eve wrong eveb though it's a sandbox."
9/20/2010,"eve would feel so much more refined if the camera drones didn't spontaneously change position when you jump or undock. this issue becomes a safety issue when you are in a pod. because the camera drone moves in so far that it takes a minute to zoom out far enough to see danger. and you have to do this every time you jump. loosing a battle in 0.0 this can get very annoying if you have to travel very far to get back to your ships. and if you fix this it would be nice to be able to anchor the drone so it turns with the ship... please?don't forget to check the ""support this topic"" if you like it people."
9/20/2010,"it's called an overview. it shows you everything on grid.also, i've never had this problem. it seems to stay zoomed out at a constant distance for me. i'm thinking this is either a bug you're experiencing or your client is having issues."
9/20/2010,"i do not see the need for an office in this proposal, but i support the idea on the basis of adding a corp/alliance visibility option to the market orders."
9/20/2010,"they actually started to do something like this for the empyrean age expansion (called a storefront) then they pulled it.i like the idea. you should be able to offer items for sale exclusively to your corp/alliance. such ""membership club stores"" exist in real life (ie: sam's club), and there is no reason why people who own space shouldn't be allowed to own their own market. if the market pvp'ers want to compete, the open market is still there, they will just have to price their crap fairly if they want sales."
9/20/2010,"i raised this proposal in the last csm meeting and it passed unanimously. the wiki for it is here. if you're interested, the voting record for csm5 is here."
9/20/2010,"yep, and in pos hanger too."
9/20/2010,"5 years ago you where lucky to encounter 1 capital ship in a fight, speed up to today and entire fleets consist of capital ships , and even more so there made up of carriers and supers. with the only viable counter being a bigger fleet of the same.to that end i suggest a new sub capital platform capable of taking on capitals directly , the capital contender the ship is simple , a tier 3 battleship hull that can field 4 large turrets and 1 x-large turret.what makes this ship different is that as a role bonus if its x-large turret fires at a capital class ship it does x20 damage and x40 for super capitals, reasoning could be a special launcher system that hyper accelerates the projectile causing massive damage to the thick hulls of capital ships while passing right through ( so causing less damage) the comparably paper thin armour of sub capitals.this would give a platform that could engage capital class ships while not creating an overpowered ship in high sec."
9/20/2010,they call them dreads.look it up.
9/20/2010,"after all the devastating feedback in f&i, it was definitely a good idea to move on to assembly hall...."
9/20/2010,i don't know where your coming from. to the best of my knowledge i answered all the question and made sure that none of the scenarios that where suggested could happen.for those who want to know this was the post
9/20/2010,pretty much this.
9/20/2010,"not supported at all.a) i'm not sure if it's possible in the game engine to give a bonus to firing at certain ship classes.b) this ship as you describe it is ridiculously overpowered. it does a full dread worth of dps to caps and 2 dreads to supercaps. nobody would ever bring anything else to a supercap fight and capitals would melt in seconds if these only required bs skills + xl weapons because you could fleet up hundreds of them.what you might be able to get away with is a sort of mini-dread bs for cap warfare using dread guns and increased dps (relative to ""normal"" dps-fit bses) but bs ehp. flesh out details on a new system before coming back to assembly hall with this. an anti-capital bs isn't an especially bad idea but the details here create something incredibly overpowered and may not even be possible. the assembly hall is intended for relatively complete ideas."
9/20/2010,"not supported - this ship would be op.what might be a better idea is looking at a t2-spec battlecruiser with one, single spinal-mounted xl cannon.but such a ship would be very vulnerable, only useful for cap/pos shoots and reliant on other ships for protection."
9/20/2010,posting in a ninja tear thread.
9/20/2010,"ok, i haven't made up my mind about the topic, but those are the cons i can think of:- when neuted, you still need to reactive them, which makes combat more active.- under neut, there's gaps in the time you can activate them, thereby lowering your ehp- in the case of drones, that also means you can't dispatch your drones to large distances until you've reactivated the items.- you can't activate modules while cloaked, so when decloaking, there's a gap under which you don't immediately gain full combat potential.- while the damage control is activatable in warp, i believe that's not the case for the drone control unit (more gaps)in essence, the reason one would want these items to become passive is exactly the reason they could be argued to stay active. one needs to pay attention and go through the trouble of activating them, one needs to ""do something"" to gain full combat potential.in these 2 cases, i wouldn't be in favour of increasing their cap requirement, but i would lean towards keeping them as they are.as a potential sidenote, but is probably not important, i used to purposefuly leave some hardeners/damage control inactivated to give the enemy the impression he could kill me then activated them before he could do so to give my other character some extra time to dish out damage before the ennemies decided to switch primary..."
9/20/2010,"i have noticed that there is no mention in all these proposals about putting increased effort into fixing bugs. im not tanking unbalanced items, like rockets, or deficiencies, like not being able to view fits on inactive ships, but programming errors. the csm likes to put proposals into one sentence stories, so what im an talking about could be stated like this:when a player jumps though a stargate, the client will not crash.when at a mission site, stations will not be big red blobs like this:"
9/20/2010,how is this a proposal? this is like saying [proposal] make pigs fly.
9/20/2010,"i support nothing ever going wrong ever anywhere in the world again.i also don't expect it to ever happen or ccp to become gods that can predict how their code will behave throughout the known world on every piece of hardware with all software that run alongside it, or how every single line of said code works with each other over the many years eve has been in development."
9/20/2010,"*jumps through a gate* oh look, my client didn't crash...that looks like an error on your pc's end, not on ccp's end. update your drivers, etc etc.do you mean something besides ""i don't want to hold my shift key down all the time"" with that? because really...are you holding the shift key that long?*sigh*, how about [proposal] lock troll threads before they startps: not supported"
9/20/2010,"seems we could never expect all the bugs to be killed, but surely things can be better than they are now. ive got many of those same bugs.supported."
9/20/2010,"ok there are a total of 6 varietys of turret based weapon in the eve universe , yet all of them are simple a use gun on ship button that fire of some sort of shot and then damage is applied. with the only difference being what type of damage and how far i can hit you. its old and could use some spicing up so to say.projectilesartillery  artillery no longer have an optimal range but have a fall off of well as far as you can see before a ship leaves grid, so at least 250 km. as artillery are nothing but a massive slug launcher i see no reason why if i shot at a target 200k away, why if my bullet hit it i would do no damage. in response to this range increase the fall off calculation would be changed to make it so that you simply hit more often the closer you are to the target while missing 3/4 of the time at max grid range with the targets speed being taken into account, you would hit a ship sitting still a lot more than if it was moving, to compensate for this artillery may need a damage boast auto cannons  auto cannons at current really dont seam to match there name sake, there simply a gun that fires every 10 seconds or so , so there more just a cannon. to me auto cannons are like common day assault rifles in vehicle/ship form, firing 1 or more bullets every seconds or so. that big tank thing in terminator 1 had what i consider auto cannons. as we cant simply have a actual shot every .35 seconds as both the severs and the eve community would hate me we would introduce constant damage . think of it like how we web some one when you activate your auto cannon against the target it gets a stat condition of +1 type x constant damage which will cause it to lose x hp every second with out having to call the server to do it. using 8 auto cannons would give you a +8 constant damage doing that much more, at a graphic point a hail of bullets would bombard the target shiplaserspulse lasers- to me pulse lasers are like star wars with the firing every few seconds, . again we would use the constant damage approach vs making every shot a single call to the serverbeam lasers- sound like they should be a constant beam vs. just a quick blast. again we would use the constant damage approach to get this to work but other wise its okhybridsrail gun- rail guns in most games (not mass effect) have always had 1 thing in common, they where big heavy weapons that fired shots insanely far and at high damage , but had a long cool down. that said increase the range and power of the rail gun but make its cool down time is longer and based on the total range of the shot (controlled by ammo) a shot that fires 40k will do the same damage as a shot that fires 240k but will be able to fire a lot faster due to reduced cool down of the guns.blaster- as if i recall correctly the best blasters out there cant hit beyond 10k (unskilled) i dont see why they cant be retuned for maximum targeting, that said all blasters gain a huge boast to there ability to hit ships and it only gets bigger the closer they get, this will give blasters there edge over the other weapon systems while still confining them to the own little circle of doom. and yes this means that bs equipped with blasters will be able to target sub bs sized ships but it also means that they have to be within 10k to do it , and if a frig cant out run a bs , there doing it wrong."
9/20/2010,"your constant damage idea won't work, because it still has to distribute all those calls, and distribute the damage ticks, and distribute the 'stop' ticks. even if it were to work, welcome to a whole new world of desynching."
9/20/2010,"the whole point of constant damage is that it doesn't need those calls , both client and server know that if the target is under the effect of say ""+3 5 damage"" that every second it will take 15 damage, when the ship dies or the damage stops there will be calls made but not any more than normal should so switch targets or get blown up yourself."
9/20/2010,"*epic facepalm*there is utterly no such thing as constant damage in eve online.i suggest you trash your proposal and take the time to study the mechanics of landing a hit.trust me... its a hell of alot more complicated than you think it is pal.i'll give you a hint.grab a bag of dice..... roll one for whether you hit or not... roll one for whether the shot actually does some damage or all damage or no damage.... roll one for resistance of damage types (one for each), roll one for tracking.... roll one for signature radius....roll one...get the message yet?welcome to eve online."
9/20/2010,"thinking a little to much in the box eh oh wellhave you stopped to consider that a direct shot is not the only way damage can be dealt to a ship in game. think about it using a warp disruptor as an example when you activate it it puts a status effect on the target that the server knows is there and so does the client, why could ccp not create a status effect that simple does x damage every second. i mean you can stack warp scrams on a ship this would be no different."
9/20/2010,moar dots! moar dots!
9/20/2010,"you call your idea thinking ""outside of the box""?do you even understand the concept of what you speak of?tell you what... lets get some pvp'ers in here and some ""yarr"" types in here and see what they say.and then will talk about your so called ""outside of the box"" concept which is in itself completely and utterly full of fail.by the way.... eve isn't halo.... its 3 dimensional space... combat involving a massive number of variables that range from your skills to the targets skills to the modules and then the various factors of speed and everything else in there.you continue to ignore those factors your going to get laughed out of here very quickly."
9/20/2010,"warp disruptors/scamblers don't work like that. they do not induce a ""status"" when activated... they put on ""points"" which can be countered via warp core stabs or inherent warp strengths (deep space transports, for example, have +2 warp ""strength"" allowing them to warp even if 2 disruptors or a single scram has been put on them).if an aggressor is disrupting/scramming a victim ship and is ecmed the point(s) will still stand until the module has completed its cycle. after that, the ""point(s)"" are lifted and the victim ship can merrily warp off.edit: not supported."
9/20/2010,"i seriously considered that and it was my first reaction too. however, there are stupid people that don't read things and ccp's primary purpose, as much as you might not like to think about it, is trying to run a business and turn a profit. accounts that are permabanned are almost certainly lost revenue. if this happens to someone and the account is significantly valuable to them, then they may seriously ragequit with their other accounts too leading to an even larger loss. repeated and/or persistent violations of tos agreements is a good reason to give up likely future earnings but one incident really isn't from ccp's perspective.honestly, stating any kind of minimum penalty for any exploits would be a better deterrent than what ccp has right now. the main issue i'd like to see changed here is for ccp to actually talk to the players about this process. right now, they seem to take the attitude that trying to ensure as few people as possible know about these issues is an effective method of dealing with it.i understand where you're coming from but i don't think it makes sense from their standpoint."
9/20/2010,half my problem with all of these discussions is that ccp often ignores exploits after they are found and leave them there until someone really does take advantage of them before they go and do anything about it. making it public is the only way it ever gets dealt with.monkeysphere\thread
9/20/2010,"/me supported.as a player i never know if something is an exploit or not and even when i think it might be an exploit, i cant look at a list of exploits somewhere to find out. i can only file a petition to find out and to be sure.i did that a lot in the past years and nearly always a gm told me, not its not an exploit, its normal game mechanics. i now found out more nice little game mechanics and as long nobody is telling me thats its an exploit and giving me a personal warning i will treat everything what i will find out and really is not an obvious exploit as normal game mechanics.using key macrosusing webbers on freightersusing mining crystals without rigsusing rigs inside ships without skillscorp hopping to avoid wardecsscams with blueprintcopiesusing trade mechanism for scamming peopleetc."
9/20/2010,"this is not an exploit, eve by iteself allow you to use ""macro"" keyes, (ctr + e/d for drones etc, hit esc and you'll find how to activate/change some them)not an exploit, you can web pretty much anything and will have the same effect. (would be an exploit if it was doable only with freighters) mining crystals dont require rigs...?(dunno)nothing wrong with changing your corp, you cant ban this.if you get scamed its your own fault, blindness and stupidity cant be banned. its the same thing like having a red in system and you keep doing that 10/10 plex with your x-type fitted tengu....market is free in eve, you can sell your staff at any price you want, nobody forced you to buy from them."
9/20/2010,"ccp's method of handling exploits seems to be:1. get a bug report from someone detailing it. ignore it.2. x corp/alliance/players take advantage of the exploit over time and make themselves silly rich.3. someone else discovers the exploit and goes public with it.4. ccp shoots the messenger and makes an example of the more egregious beneficiaries to cover up their own embarrassment and incompetence.they've done this over and over and over. t20, the ferrogel exploit, etc. what needs to happen is there needs to be a gm team that deals with exploit reporting exclusively who has the ability to grab resources immediately to investigate and patch them."
9/20/2010,"none of the items on your list are exploits. the only really questionable one is the corp hopping one, and the only time that becomes an exploit is if you disband the corp and then reform the same corp immediately. simply leaving one corp for another is not an exploit - even if it is a pansy-ass way out of a war dec."

9/20/2010,"fuel tank as low slot itemwhen equipped cap requirement of afterburner / microwarp is set to 0 but then requires ""fuel"" to run and overheating the propulsion module causes it to burn more fuel?"
9/20/2010,"well when your ship ran outa the performance fuel it would just start running at ""normal""thus kinda running as a booster for the ship."
9/20/2010,"first this is not a nerf cloaking thread, far from it , currently cloaking is tricky, on one hand it makes you invincible. on the other the ships that use it best are paper thin and 1 module can destroy any cloaked ship. that said read belowcurrently cloaking is a its either on or off attribute, you see me or you dont, and once you see me i cant cloak so generally pop. to this end i suggest a modification to both cloaking itself and the module. cloaking becomes a strength check vs yes or no. every cloaking device can produce x amount of field units per second with a ship requiring a certain amount of field strength to completely cloak. a ship is considered phasing if its trying to cloak but not fully cloaked, a phasing ship is still lockable and can be shot at but doing so only deal 10% of normal damage as well as reduces the fields strength by x.this will open up the market for faction cloaking devices and multiple meta levels eachthe second change comes in the form that cloaking devices are know script-able and you can have more than one fitted and active at a time-slave script  forces the cloak to pull data from a none scripted cloaking device in essence becoming a passive module that increases the field strength the other cloak produces every second.-gate script  causes a gate to partially misfire when you use a gate causing you to land between 50-100k away from the gate rather than in the gates 15k catch zone-overdrive script  requires at least 1 scripted and 1 none scripted cloak both of the convert ops class to be installed, this script causes the ship to enter the cloaked state as soon as possible after gate/portal jump. in essence players land in system using there own cloak vs jump cloak. the module this script is loaded into is considered passive like the slave scriptthis will have both pros and conspros -any cov-op ship is no longer guarantied dead if he jumps and some on on the other side has a auto targeter-cloak users can be even more sneaky-cloak users can attempt to cloak even when target locked , and by installing more cloaks with the slave script they can wincons-cloaking becomes more effective"
9/20/2010,"i find your ideas quite intriguing. where may i sign up for your newsletter?can't say this is bad or good, but certainly interesting."
9/20/2010,let me get this straight.your not wanting to nerf cloak.but now you've turned into some sort of shield/ewar hybird module and made it 5 to 10 times more complicated than it really is.
9/20/2010,"the cloaking device is very easy to figure out... and you fail to see it as it is.1: it's ability to completely make you invisible comes at a price:a: all of your ships modules are disabled and rendered inert for the duration of the cloak.b: you move at an penalized speed (not taking bonuses into account).c: you can't target quickly when you drop the cloak.d: if someone locks you before you cloak... the cloak is blocked.2: covert ops class ships can warp while cloaked. all others can't use warp drive.3: cloaked ships as stated before are completely unable to do anything but sit there and watch.a: they do show up in local... but that's only if its in ks (known space).b: covert ops cloaks are very tasking on cpu load... so any ship that fits one has to make room for it.c: most covert ops cloak ships (if not all) generally are not that great of a combat ship unless its a very special niche (ie: stealth bomber), and even then they typically do better in packs and not 1vs1 unless the pilot is very clever and typically they seek soft targets.4: cloaking is harmless unless -a: you get into the targets mind by making them utterly paranoid and just sit there.b: you fail to watch your six and don't have a wing-mate to keep you clear of pests.c: you fail to remember the most important rule in eve online... never...stop...moving.5: cloakers in a pvp context -a: typically are not what you call a solo wtfpwnmobile. they have to roll the dice on timing and their prey... and usually they only get the first kill... second and thirds are rare and only happen when your surrounded by idiots (obviously not the cloak-er in question)b: cloaking devices fail whenever they encounter an physical object within or at 2500 meters. this means that if they bump into anything at all... including a beacon... they are exposed.... drones... gate guns... etc.c: cloaking devices are not immune to damage... this means if someone uses an area effect weapon you will take damage. smart bombs and space bombs are very deadly. even though you may not be revealed... your going to take it in the shorts. (been there done that)cloaking devices have one purpose in mind.... stealth... thats it.to take it any further than that... is a total and complete waste of time.it's not supposed to be a i-win button... its not supposed to be made ""more effective"". it's not supposed to be something that expires... its just a simple on/off switch with a set of rules.rules that can easily be used to come up with very effective counter-strategies.eve online is a game of risk... not of easy wins."
9/20/2010,inappropriate contents removed. please stay on topic and discuss the contents of the op.
9/20/2010,"/not supportedwe already have different types of semi cloak.thats the small signature fitted unscannable ship. with the right eccm fitted ship you are also ""cloaked"", so i dont see any need for more cloaking types.but you have nice ideas and in fact they are interesting. but there is so much more important work to do then changing the way of cloaking, ccp shouldnt focus on that, imho."
9/20/2010,"i think a better way to deal with afk cloakers would be to start with a base chance of 100% immunity to scan decay over time that the ship stays in the system without dropping the cloak.decay rate: 15 minutes of 100% immunity to scan, then after that your chance to be scan increases by 10% every 5 minutes to the point that after sitting in a system without leaving it or deactivating and reactivating cloak you become visible at 1:05.this way would still make scouting possible, as would the use of cloaks for what they were intended for. in fact, sitting cloaked in local to ""grief"" the local population would still be possible (since to reset the timer all you have to do is decloak and recloak) but it would require you to be at the keyboard, because after 30 minutes or so you are likely going to be able to be probed out and killed.my problem isn't cloaking, it's that people are being rewarded for doing something that takes no effort, has no risk, and that they don't even have to be at the keyboard to do."
9/20/2010,supported if cloakers cant carry regular cyno- but gain +10% cloak ammount if carrying covert cyno
9/20/2010,"incorrect. not supported.you should just request a new module that phases ships to do what you essentially want and leave cloaks alone, they work as intended. the idea of fitting multiple cloaks makes no sense to me, there are few ships with a slot for a dedicated cloaking device the others are all weakened by the presence, adding a 2nd compounds the issue for a 'cloak' that might not even be complete. a phase shifter that has less requirements than a cloak and might even be a mid slot fit or low is a better option for your 'semi-cloak' state that can be decloaked via weapons fire, etc might actually fill a 'need' where a cloak won't."
9/20/2010,"i have seen a lot of cloaking threads and this one is kind of neat. it doesn't really address the pros and cons of cloaking itself, but they are cool ideas. why don't we just request that they require fuel to activate. possibly make it one of the racial isotopes. timers on it would have to be worked out and honestly i don't even want to try, but it shouldn't be nerfed ridiculously. cloaking should just be a bit more dynamic."
9/20/2010,"as i understand, once upon a time in eve, wrecks generated from npcs in missions, like npc wrecks elsewhere were owned by the top damage dealer.this is not the case nowdays, and hasn't been the case since i started playing at least. this introduces the (unintended?) side-effect of being able to create objects owned by a player not yourself for an exceedingly long amount of time.in light of missioner complaints about surprisingly long aggression extension, a natural result of property-based aggression rules in eve, i propose the following:revert npc in mission ownership mechanics to ownership by top damage dealer. ensure that triggered secondary loot cans (usually the mission objective drops) are still owned by the mission runner.pro:while the current state of aggression timer updating when your property being reaggressed is sufficent, i believe, it seems to be very counter-intutive, as things 'owned' by the aggressed player can be created with no interaction on this part. if the aggressed party is not present, new property owned by them should not be a viable thing to create. this would restore a good deal of predictability to aggression timers.con:'ownership' of loot could once again be stolen from the player that spawned a mission. also, a player could theoretically be tricked into aggressing themselves on, say, a deadspace invader, by instinctively aggressing a wreck which does not belong to them. if this is an issue, it could be mitigated by a non-ignorable warning dialog. those seem to have been popular to implement the last few expansions.constructive criticism appreciated. also, i cant seem to find the patch note that actually noted this change. if anyone knows which patchnote its in, i would appreciate enlightenment on that matter.edit: for clarity in my mention of 'agression timer updating', i mean the *display* of aggression timer that you see when you undock.z. :3"
9/20/2010,"aggression mechanics are fine, just give a button to refresh the aggro timer display.missioners don't need an unignorable modal dialog box when they shoot flashies, this would decrease pvp."
9/20/2010,"i agree; the npc wrecks should 'belong' to the person who has done the highest damage. it doesn't really make sense the way it is.or...how about make it so that the wrecks that contain no loot, belong to nobody and can be tractored by anybody? it makes no sense to me that i cannot tractor a wreck...the warning says it belongs to somebody else...but the stance on salvaging is that the salvage belongs to nobody, but the loot inside belongs to the owner of the mission. if that's so, why can't i tractor an empty wreck at least? the noctis with the tractor bonuses will not really be a viable ship to use for me...at least as i see it now."
9/20/2010,"i really really want this... it's so annoying going back through 20 processors and checking to make sure i created the routes for everything. even being sure i made all the routes, i still manage to miss some from time to time...."
9/20/2010,"a simple, yet immensely useful addition to the eve ui would be to add virtual desktop, like osx's ""spaces"" feature.it would allow you to set up 4 - 8 eve ""desktops"", and would allow you to assign a window to a specific ""space"" (a simple right-click on the titlebar could allow you to assign a window to a space).ctrl-arrow can switch between the virtual desktops (if you've used osx this is a great feature if you have millions of windows open).it would allow market research on one screen, fleet chat & pvp-centric windows in another, science & industry and pi screens in another, and one that you can have that is free of all windows. a small bar at the bottom can help visualize the different virtual screens & how many windows are in each, etc.i also would hope (read:expect) that we would be able to save to the eve server, rather than be per client. maybe it would be user-initiated save, but having all settings on the eve cloud would be great."
9/20/2010,"supported, but will probably never happen.i would love to have 2-3 monitors with the outer space view rendered in only one of them (rather than stretched across all, increasing gpu load immensely and causing misc. weirdness), with the other monitor(s) used solely for ui elements that normally crowd up the view on a single-monitor setup.we can dream. they're apparently working on something sort of similar now, except it requires windowed mode and increases the graphics rendering area substantially."
9/20/2010,"i would love multiple monitor support with custom layouts, but that's not exactly what i mean with this proposal.this proposal would not be dependent on monitor size or layout, but rather allow us to group windows, and quickly switch between them, with the space view behind each. it will effect ui windows only.for instance, if you have the market open, 5 info boxes, a market graph, and your email open, pressing ctrl-rightarrow will slide all of the current windows off the screen, and slide in the windows that are on this other screen. it is a way to quickly shift between tasks and fights the clutter.i don't like spreadsheets online, but there is so much information, it's difficult to display on only one screen, whether i'm on my 15"" macbook pro, or my triple-24""-monitor windows 7 workstation."

9/20/2010,"i found an issue when the bpo is in a container and you ""info"" it from a different system - you dont get to see the pe/me on the bpo. it shows it as if its a basic blueprint.anyone have this happen ot them?"
9/20/2010,"even the difference between bpc and bpo will kill the database, read the linked thread.but a fairly common response to this objection is add drag & drop to the s&i dialog. i.e., there is already a dialog box that lists these in a grid. it already has a ""copy yes/no"" column; i.e. no addition db lookup required; the eve client has already looked all that up before the grid is displayed. you have a nice list of your bpo/bpcs; you could now select and drag some to containers, hangars and cargo holds rather than doing a show info on hundreds of items. not the most elegant of solutions, but far more functional than what is shipping now. as an aside, i can not understand how an employee could have signed off on the existing system as suitable for shipping."

9/20/2010,"supportedhowever, i don't think it's gonna happen. it has been proposed a couple of times in the past years. ccps standpoint always was that, with the new database layout, a differentiation between bpos and bpcs was no longer possible. back then we simply wanted the ""old"" view of purple/blue and even that was said to be impossible for reasons concerning the database.i don't recall the precise explanation for it, see for yourself: bpo/bpc colorregards, lax"
9/20/2010,"i don't know about more info, but changing the icon would be good."
9/20/2010,"while i agree that cloaking needs a counter this is not it ( <-- notice not flame of doom) we have many piolets im my alliance who use all the cov-op style ships and they remain cloaked for hours at a time while actively watching a pos, trailing some one etc. having them decloak after an hour would be seriously bad news. again going in the right direction but not the right fix, ow and good on you for fighting the crowd of cloak security blank players who are threatened by any chance they could be found out."
9/20/2010,"if it is not the cloaky ship you fear so much as the fleet of super caps the cloaky ship can summon instantly, perhaps it is not cloaks that need to be changed so much as the cyno/jump process?"
9/20/2010,"honestly i'm not after destruction of the cloaky way, just the way people yell they arent combat ships and so gimped, yet can bring a massive combat force that isnt cloaky anywhere, and tbh recons really arent weak. so how would you change the cloaking system?"
9/20/2010,"not supported.the counter is other players working with eachother, and no cloaking doesn't make you invincible do some research before you spout off talking points of others or blindly believe them."
9/20/2010,"players docked in an outpost, or logged out of the game are similarly impervious to any counter. ccp please allow me to destroy ships that are docked or which have vanished after logging off"
9/20/2010,"i'm quite sure that you don't realize what we're writing about.i don't mean that you don't get it, only that you can't visualize it.there are ""sprites"" (that's what 2d props are called) already in missions. they are debris floating in space in nebula and other strange space conditions.you can have literally thousands of those in game -without impact- on performance... but with awesome effect on video quality.if you've ever played a combat flight simulator, it's like having your airplane eject shells and using an external camera. the immersion and awe of seeing your ship chew through ammo is just a little part of an immersive graphical experience, but important nonetheless.just multiply that for shield ricochets, and armor and hull chunks, and effects..win."
9/20/2010,i don't think this would solve the macrominer issue.1. they would just move to a static ice field.2. they would just accept a mission and mine all the ore that is usually in that field cause sometimes that is a lot of ore.3. scan a site - bm it - send macro miners there - done for the day.the other thing i see happening is the macro miners would still take out the regular fields - thus leaving nothing for the newbies.-just my thoughts.
9/20/2010,"pardon? more realistic?you realize that in our solar system, the first asteroid was discovered in 1801? that's 209 years ago.an interstellar civilization would be able to locate any asteroid belt(s) in a solar system with the equivalent of a toaster and tin foil. they tend to stay in the same place, too, so once found (which they could do with a telescope from 1850), they're found for good.""scanning down"" asteroid belts is not realistic, at all. they're as visible as most planets, moreso in some cases."
9/20/2010,"yes and no. as above, most of the pvp organisations in lowsec are comparatively small, and focused on sub-capital, or even sub-bs small gang/skirmish pvp and piracy. however, lowsec has an artificial restriction (no bubbles) that removes the single most effective way for a group of that kind to pin down a mothership. so even before you start thinking about how a 100-man organisation (with, say, 10-20 members online and active at any one time) can muster enough dps to kill something with 30-70 million ehp in the space of 15 minutes, you need to gather (at minimum) a force of multiple hics with logistics support, just to keep it tackled. the same organisation in nullsec could do the same job with a single dictor. it doesn't seem unreasonable to argue that if there are restrictions on the most viable counters available to smaller entities, there should be corresponding restrictions on the use or abilities of supercaps.*shrug*"

9/20/2010,"ophelia does a wonderful job explaining why some kind of control over caps and supercaps is necessary in low sec if it is to be revitalized for small group pvp. dovetails beautifully with the express purpose of my post about a layered response by npcs to the presence of these ships in this sector of space. as for finn's other concerns: 'lack an understanding of low sec mechanics'. ad hominem and empty assertion. 'lack of understanding of low sec interface with null sec'. ad hominem and empty assertion. 'concord is there to punish aggression'. descriptive, but sidesteps creative thinking about how concord and faction navies might be used to revitalize low sec. thinking creatively about how to revitalize low sec is the purpose of this thread. 'star trek muddle'. analogy and metaphor are basic to creative thinking. the definitive source on this from cognitive linguistics is lakoff, metaphors we live by (2003). also covered from a humanist perspective, e.g. english courses. 'respond and kill all aggressors'. selective reading and distortion. no one anywhere in this thread has proposed anything of the kind for caps or supercaps. balancing the layered response is a real issue, and deserves thoughtful consideration. 'eve as a darwinian struggle'. pvp fundamentalism, discussed in another thread, used to try and marginalize and discipline other points of view on eve. 'respond to the arguments'. sure, but only when the 'arguments' are more than rhetorical devices to restate dogma over and over. 'professional vicitm' and so on. insults and the like. more ad hominem. i make discriminating judgments about whose posts to respond to on these threads. most of us do. even when the points of view are very different, we enjoying reading what others have to say when it is said with reason and respect. i learn all sorts of things through these threads, and appreciate the insights that others have to share. i don't pretend to be a very old character, or one with a perfect understanding of all things eve. there are some kinds of posts, however, that i choose not to respond to directly. such posts are not made for dialogue or to share insights, but to advance dogmatic, intolerant and hostile points of view. these posts are usually characterized by a wealth of insults, insinuations, smears, distortions, selective readings, misquotes and so on. reason, evidence and civility are ignored or denigrated. such posts thrive on attention, and are often best ignored by the community. delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"

9/21/2010,"not supported. missiles always hit their target. missiles has max dps at all ""optimal"". missile turrets can not be disrupted. missile ships can use any type of damage (it is sweet to shoot exp against armor or em against shield)."
9/21/2010,"yes, but that doesn't always mean that they do damage.what about adding a thermal racial ya know... so you get therm and kinetic bonus? that way you still don't get everything, but it is more useable and it does fit in with hybrid damage which is caldari gun of choice."
9/21/2010,"i take it you dont use missiles much.what you say is not true at all.missiles do not do max damage at any range.missile damage is attenuated by a ship velocity at any range.outside of web range missile damage is reduced sharply because the target ship can maintain a much higher velocity.true missile ships can not be disrupted.but they can have there ammo distroyed midflight with defenders.yeah defenders lol , no one fits them , but that mainly due to 80% of the ships out there being gun boats.but still you have the option to use defenders if you so wish.it would be adequate to shoot em/exp if they were bonused fully which they are not.a hookbill has a 100% bonus to kin at level 5 cal frig.thats the equiv of 6 unbonused launchers.so the fight i was telling you about a few post ago was the equiv of.6 caldari navy standard launchers ( unbonused ) backed by a faction bcu.all missile skills at 5.and this setup does not have enough dps to break some frigate tanks.you think this is right ?damage type selection is critical to the success of missile boat tactics when solo due to the inheritly minimal dps of missile systems.even more so that with projectiles.restricting the bonus to only 1 type of ammo makes no sense."
9/21/2010,"im not sure the kinetic damage bonus is really the worst bit about caldari missile boats. even if you removed the kinetic bonus from say the caracal, its still going to need fitting mods to fit a tank, hams and a mwd. all the ships have individual problems that are worse than the kinetic bonus.rockets for example cant do full damage to a frigate without at least a web, this ruins far more caldari frigates than the kinetic damage bonus does."

9/21/2010,"certain things will make me deinstall a game instantly. one is the concept of what i like to call chizzling. when rl money will gain you a major advantage over other players, forcing you to purchase what ever product. and then a whole bunch of little fee's like .99cents for a new skin or $5.00 for extra cargo hold or $2.00 for this perk or that perk.sorry, the second i see that rear it's ugly head is the second i deinstall and stop playing mmorpgs till the ""old republic star wars mmorpg"" comes out. i'll play for like 6months and then get bored cause i can't loot the corpse, and stop playing mmorpg's all together.plex is about as far as i will allow a game to go. which i do not mind so much atleast the way eve works because ships tend to be the least important thing in this game.experience, who you know, sp, implant, ship, isk is about how important things stack up when it comes to pvp so a dude being able to buy implants and ships with plex i have no problem with. it's when they can remapp with plex that it starts to really effect things. for example i just recently remaped to hvy perception/willpower cause i want to power lvl everything that falls under those catagories like ships and gunnery. what would be sweet is to redeem a plex is once i'm finished with that remap again to focus on some other area. no this will get abused this will effect dramatically how this game is played.absolutly not. implement this and i will quit."
9/21/2010,ccp: do not want.seriously.

9/21/2010,bad idea
9/21/2010,"i sincerely doubt anyone is reading this far back, but here goes.ccp is trying to make extra money, hoping that more people will buy and consume plex to put rl isk into their coffers.the better way to do this would be to only allow people to pay rl money for the remap, not use an in-game item that it tied to the in-game fun economy. things are volatile enough now that the mineral basket is sinking with the insurance changes. let people with rl money use that money in a way outside the game economy, before a pilots license extension becomes perverted into something it shouldnt be.the best way to do this would be to focus on micro transaction in dust and focus on quality products with the fixes players are requesting in eve. people already pay every month to play a game that takes them away from real life stress and problems. if problems and stress get introduced into play time then people will go somewhere else.please remember ccp: if your business model gets so aggressive it stops repeat customers from having fun, then nobody wins.vod"

9/21/2010,"wtf ccp!this is a terrible idea.plex exists to hurt isk sellers, this is a ""good thing"" (tm)trading a plex for a remap is nothing more than an unabashed attempt to generate more revenue by allowing players to micromanage their skill growth by paying ccp more money.not only that, but the economic effects will be profound.the direct consequence is people buying more gtcs to use on remaps, generating more revenue for ccp. however(!), not everyone will buy gtcs for this, a great many will buy plex off the market and cash them in for these remaps, reducing the overall supply of plex (and isk!).the very real consequence of this effect will be to drive the price of plex up, and because of the perceived increase of value, more people will buy gtcs to convert into plex, generating still more revenue for ccp.--the net effect is the addition of yet another money/isk sink into the game. however one that spiderwebs into several other effects that compound that effect.--a personal message to ccp: we already pay a subscription to play this game. if you really cared about growing eve's long term revenues, you would fix the longstanding balance and interface issues that prevent long-term adoption. you want wow sized revenues? try reducing the barriers to entry and making the game more fun for solo and low sp players. this means getting rid of the damn learning skills. i shouldn't have to tell my friends that if they don't want to waste their time/money they have to spend the first month in a noob ship working on learning skills.taking 3 months to get & fit a ship that's actually worth flying & feels badass is way too long to keep the majority of gamers interested.</rant> -gabrienne(lord knows if i tried to string my customers along with a gimped service for the first year while having them pay full price for it... well i wouldn't have many customers for long.)"

9/21/2010,fixed. this is probably why they never consult you guys on a lot of stuff. they never know if your going to give feedback based on what is best for the eve community or what is best for your personal agenda. can't really blame them for not checking with you tbh.

9/21/2010,why would anyone even think about such a mechanic?
9/21/2010,wtf indeed
9/21/2010,supported. plex for remaps is a bad idea in principle.stuff like using plex for character transfers or portrait changes is fine - that's just an admin fee. but effectively paying to create sp... no.

9/21/2010,wtf?
9/21/2010,wtf?
9/21/2010,"i'm all for adding more uses for plexs, but i'm very concerned about the bypassing of in-game mechanics for such uses. the fact it also affects the speed of sp gains makes the issue especially distasteful. ccp know from learning skills how sensitive people are about sp, so they must have known how sensitive people are about any unfair advantages in that department. i guess it could be a lot worse, but i would rather we don't ever get to that point. as i said, more uses for plexs is a good thing and this is rather minor issue in itself, but it is troublesome, that they went straight to here knowing how players would react instead of trying less distasteful uses first. not the end of the world, but i don't like it and i'm worried were this might lead us."

9/21/2010,it boils down to this.if you are against using a plex to remap skills you are against anything bought and sold for isk that allows the increase of a players skill point gains or skill point total. this includes attribute implants and characters sold for isk since both allow a player to increase their skill point gain or skill point total for isk. and you can of course get isk by selling plexes.i believe a better solution to this would be the completion of a quest to give you an extra attribute remap. design it however you want. use your imagination. if you want involve a tradeable item giving isk some part in the remapping (which would more discretely involve plexes).p.s.ccp - we need less new content and more improvement of the game we have.

9/21/2010,"this is a step in a very bad direction. plex, character portrait swaps, character transfer fees/sales in game are all tied together and from that standpoint plex for remaps makes sense. wtf ccp?they want the money, it is that simple. rmt showed them like nearly every other mmo that customers are lazy and willing to put $$ for game benefits (game money) rather than do it in game by grinding, let someone else do it or hack another player's account to get that game money. ccp got plex to stop money from going in to rmt's pockets when it could have been going into their own, customers showed them they were willing to pay for isk so why shouldn't they oblige them and take the cash, the side benefit is they can/could 'stomp' the evil macroers 'ruining' the game.people want to sell their characters, well enter the character transfer fee, more $$ in ccp's pockets.people want to change their character portraits, enter the swap portraits option, for a fee.people will want just about anything and everything that throwing cash at will/can get them ccp might just oblige them. i think it is a bad idea but so is character transfer/selling/portrait swapping, as has been pointed out you can 'effectively gain sp' by buying plex, selling it, and buying a character thus you 'bought' a character. the argument is 'no that account was paid for over time and the cash went to ccp so it is okay' that is your rationalization the end result is someone was able to get something they couldn't get without waiting x months/years or benefited through the paying cash or just made that isk in game presumably paying for their account with cash, unless they didn't as many players have mastered the art of raking in billions and could easily fund several accounts for years.allowing plex to obtain neural remaps which don't add sp to your account, just allow you to train 'optimally' just as if you actually planned properly. the difference is you could then do it rapidly and 'gain' by getting the skills to 'fully fly and fit' a ship or race's ships/weapons faster than someone else who optimally trained ships/guns then waits for the remap to train support skills etc. the player not paying for a remap may 'have' to fill a year before being able to switch over and in that year may have to train for something they plan to use later like a carrier or just 'specialize' in weapons or the like.i support the proposal, the small group of people that screwed up a remap really should have a 2nd one as they would likely be new players/characters. the remaining people who 'screwed up' or made a stupid mistake should have read the warning before they accepted the remap, that is a really weak argument. the other aspect of this is it continues to widen the door for more micro transactions down the road, just as the character transfer fee and to a lesser extent the portrait swap did."
9/21/2010,pros: i could train stuff sooooo much faster with this.cons: this decreases the delayed satisfaction of skill training in an extreme way.
9/21/2010,"wtf ccp?the cool thing about plex being an ingame item was - you could only turn it in for 30days gametime. thats why the majority of players didnt have a problem with the hypothetical scenario of some rich noob purchasing a ton of plex and getting shinies/veteran chars etc. because he would pay for gametime of others (who would use the plex to extend their subscription).thats why plex was a brilliant idea as a measure to stomp rmt, while not going cash-shop.now you're about to change that and be no better than some f2p/cash-shop/pay2win grinder."

9/21/2010,"i like the idea of being able to fix an ""oops"" from my training plan (planned on 3 remaps in a year and a half based upon ""2 free"" then found out, right before the second one, that it's actually 1 free and 1 real/blocking remap so i've been running at slower training speeds than i planned on at this point) but that's something i've been dealing with. i don't like the idea of plex being used in this fashion. it doesn't fit the ""pilot license extension"" stated use of the item at all.if ccp wishes to make available additional remaps, simply assign an isk value to them and charge that fee in-game but do not use plex as the vehicle. leave that decision up to the player. it doesn't fit the name/purpose of plex in any way."

9/21/2010,what raging ret4rd at ccp proposed micro payments?whoever it is needs tar and feathers
9/21/2010,since i just posted this in the new gd thread on the topic i thought i would throw it out here as well.did anyone think that this is a good way to give incentive to move plexes around in space other then someone just being stupid. this is based on the assumption that you will need the plex in the station you want to complete the remap in.currently i will not support the angst that is currently around. i think that ccp wants to try this and see where it goes and we should see what happens.edit: clarityslade
9/21/2010,"yes the 'point' is to 'use up' more plexes period. if they get transported and the remaps can only happen at medical facilities for instance that is just a better way to get more plexes removed from the game thus spurring the purchase of more plexes to replace those not available in game if ccp continues to find new ways to let plexes leave the game through other account services, maybe extra jump clones, maybe improving security status, changing your name etc. actual plex sales/usage from this single feature aren't likely to have a huge impact, only a few who screwed up remapping, can't wait, or just have too much isk or lots of spare cash to blow would likely use it. i disagree about seeing where it goes because i 'see' it going to ccp opening up other 'services' for plex and the goal is to remove them from the game spurring more sales, which means more $, that motivation can lead to ruining the game."

9/21/2010,"interesting idea, but it does have a few flaws:1) eliminating all bugs from a program is a programmer's wet dream, in that it will never happen. yes, some bugs can be removed, and a few probably should be removed (like the warp tunnel leading askew from the ship direction), but these are minor in the grand scheme of things.2) ccp put out a bug-fix patch a while ago that sought to correct a monumental amount of bugs (about 100, iirc). do you know how much positive feedback they got from that? you could count the number on one hand and have fingers left over.if you're serious about this, you need to congratulate ccp when they correct bugs like this (most often bugs that the previous patch introduced). otherwise, you're only spitting into the wind.as the bugs in this game are mostly minor, i don't support this measure."
9/21/2010,"currently, when in siege you can only lock 2 targets, and your scan resolution is significantly reduced. i propose that one of those be changed. either increase the scan resolution when in siege so that it doesn't take a minute to lock a pos module, or allow up to atleast 5 targets locked at a time...if a super can have more than 2 targets locked and do twice the dps of a dread, then dreads should be able to lock more targets."
9/21/2010,"this make no sense at all.a mom cost as much as 10 fitted dreads (mom with decent fit that is roughly 20b)its way better than 10 dreads and it should be, its supposed to be anti-capital ship.a titan cost as much as 30++++ dreads. its way better than 30++++ dreads and as it is now, its supposed to be the best ship in eve (best in a way of capital firepower).none of the above ships can use triage/siege, therefore they dont get their dps increased significally.dreads can enter siege, but at a cost. reducing their scan ress and receiving a penalty on max locked targets is ballanced imo.p.s. comparing different ship classes is kinda stupid.... a logi can lock 10 targets while being a cruiser, that doesnt mean that battleships will be able to lock 12 targets..."

9/21/2010,pretty much. tweaking around the edges of dreadnoughts is a pointless exercise when the entire range of supercapitals post-dominion has made them little more than a lossmail waiting to happen.
9/21/2010,"i agree that some changes are needed to dreads and altering the scan resolution and lock penalties are something to look at. it's my view that to bring dreads back into fight, the siege mod needs to have basically nothing but positive effects. the only real drawback should be it being immobilized and that is a huge drawback these days. i'd also support dropping it to 5 minute cycles as with triage.so i'll support this though i don't think your idea is anywhere near enough."

9/21/2010,you know there is a 19 page topic with all ppl signing against the idea you just started. 19 pages in 24 hours...if you have time to make new topic like this i guess you also have time to read other topics in this form section
9/21/2010,-1 for reading comprehension.there are rumours ccp want to expand on microtransactions.there is a thread where a large number of people are expressing strong dissatisfaction for that idea.this is the thread that illustrates how many ccp customers support 
9/21/2010,"may i propose more addons?- uber-special ship: for a plex it's yours, it comes with 24 slots, boosts all weapons and it's so uber, you can even dualtank it. though the ship expires after 30 days (that won't interfere with the ingame balance).- jump pass to premium region (beverly nebula): don't be bothered by poor people anymore, by simply accessing the 'beverly hills' of new eden."
9/21/2010,i'd actually give this one an 8.5 for creativity.to the op: **** off.
9/21/2010,not supported. you should run your ideas through fi&d forum first. also this idea is terrible and the current system works fine imo.
9/21/2010,"current system is, has, and will continue to work fine. you don't seem to understand gun mechanics at all.if i shot a gun at your ship, the server takes into account the dmg mod, tracking, speed of your ship, speed of their ship, ammo type, transversal, distance, resistances, and undoubtedly several other factors us players don't even know about. constant dmg would be oversimplifying it.you're basically saying to give artillery 250km range across the board, and that they'll always hit regardless of tracking/range mods. have you ever pvped?you're also saying to make acs and lasers do full dmg for every single hit. hell no, if every ship in the game was doing eft numbers for dps, your tank wouldn't matter at all, you'd just disappear.rails do need a boost, but not 1000 dps at 240km boost.and also, lol at your blaster fix, i can tell that you're obviously an experienced pvper with infinite knowledge of game mechanics.gb2wow"
9/21/2010,"now, i would support a change for the graphics. auto cannons are always ""firing"" (only the animation changes, the server still calculates damage the same). beam lasers would stay solid on for 1/2 the cycle time then turn off again ""cooling down"" (again only a graphical change). pulse would flicker on and off for 1/2 the cycle time and would ""cool down"" for the other half (just a reminder, only the graphics change). artillery, rail guns, and blaster animation graphics would remain the same (although maybe make blasters and rail guns look more cool like artillery).blasters too need fixing, if it was up to me, i would give them amazing tracking so they can hit stuff within their optimal (especially for frigs, or maybe when i used blasters my skills just sucked) but leave the optimal the same."
9/21/2010,"if your acs fire every 10s, you're doing it wrong....-------------------------------------------------------your weapon values, are trash. no different values between small-med-large-xlarge guns. huge ranges that make no sense in this game. (blasters at 250km??? they're supposed to be ""shotgun"" damage guns at 0 range.)even if you remove ""optimal"" ranges and say you could therotically hit a ship at 250km away with blasters, there is no way to track it in order to actually hit it.... (blasters need buff but this is crap)please stop trying to make eveonline similar to other genre games. its unique and we like it"
9/21/2010,took 7 days to get a reply once elevated. this really demonstrates the need for some better in-house expectations for gm's
9/21/2010,"most of the proposals i've seen include anti-pirates in the mechanics as well. but yes, if for some reason this isn't included, it should be."
9/21/2010,"i am pretty sure there has been a change for the worse (from a pirate's perspective) with every expansion release. sentry guns only reach 60k, falcons could jam outside sentry gun range, there was no warp to zero, sentry guns did specific damage types, sentry guns didn't do as much base damage, the billboard could be blown up (dunno if it still can, but it used to have like a minute respawn timer), concord did not react as fast in hi-sec when traveling through with low security status (i used to fly a navy megathron from rens to amamake without getting tackled by concord, now i get insta-scramed in a frigate.slowly and slowly, the focus of lowsec has been shifting from a place for lulz to a place for carebears. the more carebears come to lowsec, the more they cry about the mechanics, and the more the mechanics get changed, in their favor.it is time to return lowsec to its roots. bring new life to piracy. give faction ships for fitting all of their mods (ie: ashimmu gets a boost for fitting all dark blood gear, gila boosted for fitting all dread guristas) make sentry guns do specific damage types according to race, etc."
9/21/2010,agreed
9/21/2010,"frankly, a lot of pirate boats need buffing.the phantasm is one of them, so... supported."
9/21/2010,"supported, as long as ccp gives the vigilant another two mids, 5000 armor, and 200 pg.it will be overpowered, but i believe ccp should give us one pro ship in exchange for the bull**** they've been giving us."
9/21/2010,"supporting.but what are you basing the increase in the capacitor level against (another ship, a shiny number pulled from your bum?)"
9/21/2010,"yep, it badly needs some love."
9/21/2010,the main phantasm problem is the inertia. you have the same inertia then some bs armor but you tank shield. it's completly stupid. the only possibility to use this ship it's like some static turret. don't move and try to shoot some body passing the gate.please ccp reduce the inertia by 2 of this ship also. now it's about a brick
9/21/2010,both.
9/21/2010,"i like the phantasm... for its looks. the tracking bonus isn't really quite up to the task of shooting tacklers and the damage bonus doesn't put it on par with hacs. so it really is more of a hangar novelty item, which is why they sell for less than a hac right now. only worthwhile faction cruiser right now is the cynabal. the gila is pretty nice also, but drones still need a bit of work to put that in the same ballpark as the cynabal. someone mention the vigilant. the vigilant doesn't even have the eye candy factor going for it like the phantasm. do people even build/fly those poor things?i would order the fixes: hybrid guns > phantasm > dronesi will support this as it would be fun to fly my phantasm in more than just a novelty situation."
9/21/2010,"you know, noone *****ed about the phantasm, ever. then, the pirate patch came where they boosted the other faction ships and reduced the phantasms' base shield amount. i don't recall it happening to the succubus, nor the nightmare. but the phantasm was able to get nearly 20k shield. a bit broken, imo. currently, the phantasm is ok. yea, it turns like a whale, and it could use an extra turret hardpoint; but hey, that's the price you pay for flying it. don't like it, don't fly it."
9/21/2010,"i suggest online tutoring in the following areashow to make an argument.reading comprehension.what a strawman argument is.i think this is something the eve-online player base can really benefit from. given certain player responses to some new ccp changes (the new sisi plex for remap system being the most obvious).some of my favourite quotes.""plex for isk is fair, since every player has the opportunity to do so, but plex for remap is not fair since it costs real life cash""""remap for plex? what next, buying ships and modules with real life cash?

9/21/2010,"i was sure someone had made a typo when they said the primae had a 1km3 pi bay, because it's so obviously stupid. 10km3 wouldn't obsolete haulers for the job, but it would at least make the ship usable. 1km3 is a sick joke."

9/21/2010,"since the devs don't play the game anymore, they have no way of knowing what's working and what's not without listening to feedback from players.thus, i suggest that they read the csm minutes and also skim assembly hall and features and ideas every so often.you can't blame them for not fixing blasters, exploration sites producing large t2 scanning rig bpc's, lag, etc. if they don't even know that these problems exist."
9/21/2010,"the devs do play(not all, but many), do read csm minutes, and do read the forums. they make a point of not commenting on csm forums unnecessarily, but they do look here. i wouldn't be surprised if there were at least a couple ccp alts posting here semi-regularly, for that matter."

9/21/2010,why didn't you tell them plex for increase in sp/hr was a bad idea?i thought you were supposed to represent the player base.
9/21/2010,"we found out at the same time you did, we didnt get any advance warning. however, we are discussing it atm and right now the csm is not in favour of the concept."
9/21/2010,"the point is that's not a unique objection. it's also hard to counter a 150 man rr battleship fleet cynoing in via titan bridge. or a 36 man bomber squad blackops'd in. or a 60 man armor hac fleet with 15 guardians. or... the fact that someone is able to bring more firepower than you to the table is not, at all, a reason for ccp to intervene. especially not as insanely as people like delilah have suggested with having concord respond to capital ships in 0.4 space. the most obvious counter to opponents bringing supercaps is to bring your own. or neut the hell out of them and bring dreads. or any of another swarm of possibilities. like i said, the first lowsec milf ever downed was killed before hic's were even introduced. balance is. fairness is not. ccp will not, (one hopes) ever decide that two pilots are unable to engage you solo since it is horribly ""unfair"". supercaps are balanced, and they can be killed. they simply represent the investment of roughly 20 billion isk in one place at one time, and they are supremely vulnerable to a half-competent counterstrike. that many lowsec entities are too small to mount an effective counter is their fault, as well, and not ccp's. it makes as much sense to say that instead of nerfing caps and supers, lowsec alliances should all be given 100 bots to even up numbers in case a bigger force attacks them. the answer to ""my opponent can bring more firepower than i can"" is never ""so ccp needs to save me."" that's a hodge podge of balance changes, nerfs, and outright mistakes on ccp's part where they caved to forum whiners and ruined valid mechanics. damps still haven't recovered properly, even on specialized boats like the 'razu. small gang pvp (which some claim nerfing supers is supposed to bring about) was virtually eliminated with the nano nerf. and so on. at the end of the day (and the beginning too), supers are not unbalanced. they can be more firepower than many small entities can handle, but that's hardly a reason to nerf supers rather than point out that small entities can't handle that kind of firepower, and that's okay. i also can't solo a properly fit t3 ship in a rifter. nerf t3?or, to put it another way: let's say that tomorrow more people want to be lowsec pirates, or someone charismatic attracts a large following and forms a lowsec alliance, or whatever. but there's now a 2,000 man lowsec alliance with plenty of dread pilots and good participation across a few time zones. all of a sudden, supers that drop of them get chewed up and eaten alive... but ccp did nothing. how can that possibly be, since it wasn't game mechanics functioning as intended and one group of people being outgunned by another, but a problem that absolutely necessitated ccp's intervention since small corps that can't bring numbers have to be boosted by ccp or else it's just not fair. ...right?"
9/21/2010,"delilah wild do you play eve online? i can see that you do have an account or you wouldnt be able to post. are you saying that caps and super caps need to be moderated in low sec? i am speechless.no.capital ships arent a problem in low sec space at all. capital ships do not stop people from using low sec, actually they are a reason to use low sec."
9/21/2010,no skillpoint remap unless ccp decides to remove the learning skills and are kind enough to let us us re-allocate them on whatever we want.no other sp remap as fotm will get a totally new meaning at that stage.
9/21/2010,bad idea. one core concept in eve is that choices have benefits and consequences. remap of sp expenditures removes that.
9/21/2010,"actually, maz's items from last meeting should be on the agenda this time. that said, after 2.5 years of bringing up issues it's not that weird for agenda's to get shorter."
9/21/2010,"this is less prevalent than it was a few months ago and there's nothing theoretical about it being an exploit. if ccp catches someone pulling alt-recycles, they'll nail that account.i tracked this recycling stuff a bit. the recyclers (many using trial accounts so they don't even pay for this) only nailed newer players so many veteran types never saw it -- simply put: vets park alts while the 'basics' are trained up and chars of a certain age are/were far less likely to be ganked than younger chars.a good deal of that backed off with some of the insurance changes and the like -- though it still happens, it's far less than it was (it could be backed off a bit more by removal of concord 'event' pay outs). 10 hours to train destroyers equates to 10 hours for a gank ship, but a destroyer flown by a ""fesh"" ganker doesn't have enough fire-power to knock down a skilled pilot -- even flying a small ship. it can take out a newer char's ship and those were 'primary' targets (retrievers were/are popular targets but so were almost every other kind of t1 'starting out' frigate/destroyer.) -- that kind of stunt.as for coming back after rebuilding sec status -- yeah it can be done but takes a couple days or so and that's their costs for doing this. i, and many others, find no problems with someone willing to actually pay for their 'griefer' fun with such time consuming efforts. eve isn't supposed to be safe but the griefer factor should always have costs/penalties associated with it and this ""1-2 days..."" that's an acceptable cost."
9/22/2010,black ops revamp making them useful. --submitted as priorityummm....errrr....hmmmmm.....errrrrr.might there be a wee bit of official feedback regarding this particular issue? please? i mean rockets and sansha capital pve are all fine updates i'm sure but it would be nice to know that something was forthcoming in order to sort the rather undeserved pre-nerf of this class of ships.sticky is as readers does
9/22/2010,"edit - plex for neural remapping added to the guy above me - from the way i understand it is as a priority on the huge list of back long changes this is moved towards the front of the list, which means after higher priority back log of changes then black ops will be changed. please read the posted dev blog and wiki page links for more information.please contact a member of the csm for more questions on this matter. also the csm have regular meetings infact twice a month iirc so if you have questions or concerns that need to be addressed please speak up in the jita speak center."
9/22/2010,"is it too much to ask for some feedback here?managing to fix rockets but ignore this? bit sad really. anyone from ccp or csm care to comment or has this ""priority csm issue"" been swept aside in favor of capital pve in the forthcoming update?"

9/22/2010,"not supported.learning skills are fine. you have to spend some time to get something back. if you don't want to train it, it is your loss if you play this game for a longer time.and the reason ""new players will stay with a higher chance"" is a bad reason, cause you have no proof. even if they stay, what will happen to them? they could think, hey eve is an easy game, i get what i want.eve is not an easy game. think one gm wrote it years ago: eve is a dark harsh place.it is easier for noobs at the beginning. they have the skill boost until 1.6 m sp and they can use neural remap two times. now you want to change learning skills. what is next? rank 12 skills? leadershipskills?please ccp do not change it."
9/22/2010,"i realize that the votes have been cast and the decision appears to be made. however, i have one question. and i beleive it to be a rather impotant question at that. will redistribution of sp be limited toon specific, or will this be account based in which the account is given any learning sp from any of the 1-3 toons on the account?if the learning skills go away, and ccp gives us up to the 5,376,000 skill points to redistribute as we feel fit, and its toon specific, i think that is fair and i am sure that anyone out there that has learned the full 5,376,000 skill points in learning can find a nice home for them. however, if this will not be toon specific, and all learning sp can be distributed from all three toons on the account to any one toon on the account, i have a major issue with that, as up to 16,128,000 sp can be diverted from three toons on the account to make one supertoon. if that is how the mechanic of redistribution will work, please let me know and run out to the character bazaar, and start bidding on characters that have nothing but learning sp maxed out. seriously, all sarcasim aside, i would like to know how this would be implemented. toon specific = good; we still keep every sp that we have earned. account based = not good, go back to the drawing board. make war. . . save the love for downtime / grammador"

9/22/2010,"initially i was against this idea. microtransactions seem to go against the general spirit of eve. plex has always been a grey area of rmt. some people love it, but some people hate it.the thing is, plex can already be used to achieve a similar effect - buy plex, sell for isk, purchase new character with skills you want.the difference here is that the plex is consumed to allow you to remap, which will produce another ""sink"" for plexes, thus being a driving factor for plex demand. end result: price of plex goes up, and/or supply of plex goes up (i.e. people buy more plex). ccp earning money is a good thing, imo. furthermore, a higher priced plex increases it's attractiveness over illegitimate rmt which plagues us so which is also a good thing.remaps are still available to those who can't afford plex irl - they can simply buy a plex off the market to get access to the same feature.however, i believe that if ccp does go ahead with this feature, they should draw the line here. plex should never be used as the only method to gain access to a certain feature of eve. neural remaps are currently available to everyone once a year.so a plex for a neural remap is ok in my book. plex for special mods/ships is not okay. plex for sp is already in the game in the form of character trades, so this wouldn't be as bad as people make it out to be (though plex for sp as a service would make rl isk->sp conversions easier, so if you are against character trades, you would also be against plex for sp).so i'm going to say: /not signedbut i'm all for getting ccp to discuss the topic with us first before they put it on tq though. i'm sure that my little drop in the bucket won't change the overwhelming support this thread has."

9/22/2010,giving an advantage to whoever has more rl capital is a bad idea.
9/22/2010,supporting the playerbase actually having to step in and point out where ccp is going wrong.
9/22/2010,"i don't see what the issue is myself. i know it sounds bad on paper, but at the same time, how often would someone want to remap anyway? i know i train my skills in blocks around my remap time. i could see maybe every six months coughing up a plex to remap, but i don't see the benefit some rich idiot receives by turning plex's into remaps a bunch of times.not to mention that if it's related to plex, than there's no more ""rl capital"" involved than before. i pay for my account with gtc's, so that's pretty much some guy buying carriers and **** using my in-game time in exchange for his rl cash. if i wanted to remap a little earlier, and bought a plex to do it, rather than buying it to get more playtime, so what? you could make the same argument that if i couldn't buy a plex to pay for my gametime, i wouldn't be able to train skills, and thus would suffer the same fate as if i couldn't get a remap."
9/22/2010,"f*** that.ccp - sort your head out and the next time you come up with an idea like this, try to imagine the look of horror across people's faces when they hear about it, shortly before they quit.this kind of real money advantage will cause such a massive loss of credibility and respect - you clearly have no idea."

9/22/2010,i really don't see the problem. while wealth (in game and out of) already brings all sorts of advantages i can't see this giving anyone any particularly unfair edge. all it means is that those who want to will be able to mix up their skill plans without the 12 month wait of training x/y skills instead of a/b skills at a lower rate. i respecced to int/mem a few months ago on my main and there's still plenty enough to keep me satisfied until my remap becomes available again. if you're too add/impatient to be able to stick to a skill plan then more fool you for wasting isk/cash on chopping and changing all the time and/or drunken rage remapping.

9/22/2010,"first, my main gripes about poss after having lived out of them for the past 8 months:1) no way to make someone have config starbase level abilities limited to just a single tower. if you have private poss, then a config starbase person needs to come to help them every single time they want to change something.2) not enough levels of access for structures. for example, to set access to an sma it must be either everyone, fuel tech, or config starbase. everyone is obviously not very limiting, and config starbase will typically be directors + 1-2 other people. so across an entire corp and all their poss, you only have 1 higher level permission you can use. 3) no way to make it easier to offline/unanchor structures without also allowing them the ability to completely offline the tower.4) requires config starbase to change reaction chains (at least t3 ones, not sure about t2). 5) pos shields will eject unmanned ships that show a ""pilot"" if the pos doesn't allow corp access and someone bounces from the shields. the pilot obviously knew the pw to get into the pos, so why are their ships getting ejected later? while its amusing finding free dreads floating in space 200km from a tower, i don't think its an intended mechanic.6) inability to anchor capital smas without sov. obviously, anchoring csaas should require sov, but why csmas? they are not just useful for supercaps. it'd be nice to be able to use a csma in w-space instead of anchoring 8 regular smas to hold caps, for example. some requested fixes:1) allow 1 character name to be added to an onlined pos. this person has config starbase equivalent power but only at that pos. this isn't a trivial change, so probably skip this one for now tbh.2) add 3-4 other groups that can be selected when determining access to structures. instead of a dropdown menu being corp, fuel tech, config starbase, it could have those 3 as well as 3-4 others. 3) break up the unanchor/offline permissions into 2 sets: the ability to unanchor/offline structures at a tower and the ability to unanchor/offline the tower itself.4) make it so you do not need config starbase to change t3 reaction chains. 5) don't eject unmanned ships from a pos, unless (perhaps) the pw is changed.6) please remove the sov requirement from csmas."
9/22/2010,"i have no idea how feasible this would be, but:it would be nice to be able to set the game to ""remember"" forcefeild passwords. ideally, cache all the passwords for each pos you visit, but even just having one persistent password saved through session changes, disconnects, etc until changed again would help."
9/22/2010,"my input on ""fuel pellets"".it obviously isnt quite as easy as ""just add a bpo for pellets and itll be fine"", considering the varying fuel requirements for different towers in different systems. to solve that though, i'd have a couple of ideas.1) the bpothe options here would be to either make four different bpos, one for each isotope, or one, while streamlining the isotopes into one type. that would however have a significant impact on ice mining and ice product economy, as it would mean all ice types produce the same kinds of stuff. i don't necessarily see it as a bad thing personally, but could understand anyone who does. it would simplify one small aspect of eve though, and would also create the option to cut down the four basic ice asteroid types to one.2) the fuel-pellet-itemas for the item itself, another problem that needs to be solved is that different poses munch through more fuel than others do (most significant difference there is obviously the pos size, but some faction towers also consume more or less than their normal counterparts. so, by that logic, one bpo producing one item wouldnt be enough for all poses, as the different components sometimes cant be divided into small enough parts to make poses use x amounts of pellets per hour and keep the current consumption ratio.one solution for this would be to treat fuel pellets like r.a.ms, faction- or mining crystals: make them take damage. x% per hour, once one item is consumed, the pos starts munching the next one.small edit: reprocessing the pellets should either not yield anything at all or an amount of stuff equal to ""what's left"" in the pellet, depending on damage taken, to avoid exploits. 3) starbase charterseven if isotopes were to be streamlined into one type, there'd still need to be five different bpos for poses in empire space and low/nullsec.couple of solutions here:a) get rid of starbase chartersb) dont include starbase charters into the bpo, add them separatelyc) streamline empire starbase charters. worse option as youd need one bpo with charters and one without them-my stuff, probably been proposed and discussed elsewhere already, but i didnt check.(not supporting cuz i cant twice :p)"
9/22/2010,"seriously...when you shoot someone with a torpedo, it makes a big flashy shockwave.but the shockwave is just eye candy, since torps only hurt the target.then you shoot someone with a bomb, and it makes a little spark. just a little puff.oh, and it kills everything in 15km.i wouldn't go so far as to say they should be completely swapped, since torps are used more often and should still look cool.but i would say that big aoe effects should accompany big aoe weapons. and smaller effects should accompany smaller weapons."

9/22/2010,"i support the part about being able to ""anchor the drone""...it's kind of annoying when orbiting really fast in a frigate"
9/22/2010,"i love the near complete and total lack of rp emphasis in eve.it's amazing!it's like ccp should just fire their entire fiction staff. stop wasting time and effort making up storylines, background history, or anything unrelated to ""i shoot you, i get your stuff"".i've actually had a similar thought when it comes to pov during transit.rather than watching your ship fly through planets and other solid objects, the ""camera drone"" watches the ship leave the grid. either using some sort of star trek ""there they go, poof!"" or a babylon 5/stargate hyperspace window. either way, when you warp off, the ship vanishes. then the camera zips ahead to the destination, and begins rendering the scene. this would hopefully help with all the lag issues, since your comp isn't focused on rendering everything between a and b (including the inside of every planet, moon, station, etc). the camera renders the destination, and then watches your ship exit hyperspace, or just fly into the grid.another thought, still along the lines of the hyperspace/st warp...instead of seeing all of space around you, including the inside of planets, as you warp from a to b...the tunnel effect we see should be made -much- more opaque.the ship goes to warp, and we are just left with a shimmering tunnel and our ship.then it unfolds as we approach the destination.again, i think it would help alleviate the strain of loading the destination grid, if it didn't have to think about every point in between."

9/22/2010,"after reading the discussion so far, i am leaning towards this proposal:""preserve the state of active, non-charge-using, non-projective modules (such as damage control, drone control, hardeners, etc) over player-commanded gate jumps.""this deals with the issue of buffing autopilot haulers in empire, and can probably be done by just having the client remember the state and send the commands to the server after a jump.question: should this be extended to cynos and bridging?the issue of whether or not to make damage control full passive should perhaps be mentioned but with a note that it should only be considered if it will have significant anti-lag benefits."
9/22/2010,"i would bet that ap is also client side and not server side. so from a server side standpoint you wouldnt really care if the ap or a player issued a jump command. and as pointed out before ... i often use ap to jump during laggy server conditions (right click start gate -> add as first waypoint -> hit ap button). i am quite sure many others do so aswell, so to save the commands being send to the server, you shouldnt differ between ap and non ap jump.and i mean it gets a positive side effect. suicide ganker get a new challenge. ;)given both are pretty common ways of moving in 0.0, where most of the laggy fights happen, i would say yes."
9/22/2010,"so the fact dreads cannot move for 10 minutes, have the mass of a planet, and can't track at all isn't enough? lol....why use a dread instead of a sc? perhaps because they cost way too much to use as much as dreads, they take way longer to train for than a dread, and you are stuck in it for the most part. dreads are quick and easy to train for, and relatively disposable. plus, sc's cant shoot a pos. as for your comparisons, a titan does about 2.5x the damage of a dread, sc's do about 10k dps (12k for the nyx), and moms actually have more ehp than titans if fit right. dreads are also meant for cap warfare, so you arguement of sc's being anti-capital is moot. dreads do less dps than a bs out of siege, and are complete **** in siege because of their restrictions. i'm not saying give it 1000 scan res and be able to lock 20 targets... i'm saying give it the scan res of a bs, or an unsieged dread, and be able to lock 5 targets... or just one of the two. they are pretty bad as it is because of the introduction of fb's and the insane hp buff the sc's got. dreads deserve some lovin too."
9/22/2010,"yeah this and what one other guy said, the others are just bitter vets who want end game toys. the only effect a dread could really get that would revitalize it is a 10% resist per lvl of weapon reconfig across the board to make it even remotely useful in today's game. wtf would anyone field them against sc or titan any day if this weren't true unless it was a sure kill time limiting, and you could guarantee extra supers weren't gonna drop on you.true story, 40 dreads vs 5 sc, my money's on the sc without 1 loss."
9/22/2010,"because of tackle problems, or in terms of pure combat stats? because those dreads combined have about 4x the dps and the same hp as the moms, and the only really special advantage of the moms in soft stats is the ecm burst, which doesn't work on dreads. the rr helps some, but it doesn't do much against 200k dps. assuming a steady stream of dictors to hold tackle, the moms would die like lemmings over a cliff. the advantage of moms is that player-for-player they kick the crap out of anything that isn't a supercap, and it'll always be easier to get 5 guys into fleet than 50. but isk-for-isk, dreads eat them alive."
9/22/2010,"assume scs commit: the scs would easily win the dps race .. whether it is without any losses on sc side is another matter, might lose one but would win the fight very decisively.the dreadnaught has been utterly obsoleted by the introduction of cheap sc's. after the last tweaks to sc manufacture costs the amount of sc's has sky-rocketed to a point where supply outstrips demand (ie. not enough people with skills).since nerfing sc's this early after boosting them makes no sense a buff to dread capabilities are very much in order i think.ps (edit): was a suggestion a few days ago in f&i about giving them a projected smartbomb type weapon (flak cannons). could revitalise them as a direct counter to the sc/carrier blobs we have been experiencing lately."
9/22/2010,"1 rr on a mothership can negate nearly 1 dread worth of firepower on another mothership because of the super high resist. 5 motherships can kill one dread in a range of 45sec - 1 min each.depending on exactly how you choose to start the fight, motherships can actually get well under a dread's tracking limit actually hurting their dps. a pulse fit revelation only tracks about 27m/s, a beam fit does about 16m/s per 10km.... so if you're inside of 10km, you can break tracking with full speed by nearly 3-5 times, and it becomes exponential as you half your distance. a lot of people really don't understand just how much that affects dps of dreads.and oh yeah, unless you have about 10 hics, motherships are free to warp out if needed, dreads are not. motherships hot dropping 40 dreads also have the ability to dictate range, meaning if they park at 80km, they can reduce a dreads dps by something like 30% initially... once fighter bombers get in range of the dreads, the moms can always move further away while not affecting their fighter bombers ability. so dread dps declines over time, while mothership dps is constant after a baseline of fb travel time. and oh yeah, here's the biggest thing beyond just that raw fight, you can choose to park motherships at 50, and addtionally deploy 5 triage carriers at 40km range behind the fight and with just those 5 regular capitals of difference, you've increased your ability substantially. if you attempted to do the same thing with any number of carriers assisting dreads, you project absolutely 0 more defensive ability while in siege.i could add more reasons, but quite honestly, those should be enough. fyi, standard fleet fit dread does about 4200 dps in siege with faction cr ammo... that's about 168,000 dps with 40 dreads, not 200,000. if you have nyxes, they can repair about 3800 dps per repairer, an aeon is about 5,500 dps per repairer. meaning 8x repairers negate between 8 or 10 dreads worth of dread damage. is the 5 v 40 rule 100% error proof, no... but then again, i don't expect scrubs to be the one's trying it.ironically, we just took a fight with 4 moms and 12ish carriers having about 4 titans and 4 moms + 20 dreads and 10 carriers and about 50 fleet, and it took around 5-8 minutes per kill... they kited dread range, carriers died first. there was 0 lag and we had approximately 60 dreads worth of firepower, yet managed to lose 4 carriers with titan and fleet bonuses even with rr assistance (ie stronger than typical dread tanks)... and oh yeah, the motherships were lol fit because they weren't expecting to get hot dropped, so they were anti fleet fit, not anti capital costing them probably 12mil ehp or more each."
9/22/2010,"agreed, though i'd wager you're not mounting 8x rr on each mom. five moms do 40k dps, a fairly typical trimark dread can tank 10k for three minutes with 2m ehp. so just over a minute per dread, except phoenixes will last closer to 2 minutes per. valid point, and a lot of it depends on layout. however, you should notice the sig radius on those moms, and how it affects the tracking calculations. dread guns have a sig resolution of 1000, moms have a sig radius closer to 12000. that gives dread guns a x12 tracking buff when shooting moms. a full-speed aeon goes 66 m/s, a beam revelation tracks at 0.00144, meaning that the aeon has to be within 4km to out-track the dread's guns. doable against one dread, sure, but against 40, the dreads will be too spread out for it to be physically possible. of course, which is why i posited a lot of dictor backup. in a direct unsupported fight, the dreads would never siege, both sides would just warp off at need, and nothing would die. yeah, but if the dreads drop the moms, then the moms won't clear the range until the fight is long over. so, assume a lr fit on the dreads and everyone staying in range the whole fight, seems fairest. if you're positing a triage support fleet, then i'll posit a battleship support fleet. whoops, moms are dealing 1k dps each now, because all their bombers are dead. cr dreads can break 6k, lr are about 4k. i just picked a number in the middle. and i have no idea where you got 5500/rep on an aeon, i have seven meta 14 hardeners and a dc ii on here(90.9% lowest resist), and see 4191/rep. let's take 40 rev vs 5 aeon. revs are fit cheap, 4k dps lr, 2m ehp, 10k tanked for 3 mins. aeons are fit pretty expensive, 8k dps, 2 reps for 7 mins and 1 rep thereafter, 54m ehp. dreads pop every 60 seconds. first dread's death kills 7.584m hp on a mom. second dread, 7.344. third, 7.104. 4-7, 6.864, 6.624, 6.384, 6.144, for a total of 48.048m damage dealt when the second reps turn off. the next minute deals 6.912m damage, which kills a mom at the same time as the eighth dread. dreads start dying every ~90 seconds now. six dreads die to kill the second mom, and they start lasting 140 seconds. the third mom takes maybe 5 dreads down, the fourth kills three, and the last mom kills one lonely dread before falling. seventeen dreads hold the field, at 75-80% efficiency."
9/22/2010,"hmm let's see, 5 spider tanking sc's vs 40 dreads that cannot receive remote reps of any kind?ever heard of the term ""aggregate firepower""? it's what you lose when you start bleeding ships. the dread group firepower will be max at the beginning, and dwindle down while likely nothing will happen to the sc's."
9/22/2010,"this and other things.your bs killing fighter bombers... it's not even close to mimicing what bs do to fighters. off the top of my head, fighter bombers have about 4x the hp of a fighter, meaning it takes much larger coordinated effort to start killing them. i remember hearing some fc tell me recently his fleet ****d fighter bombers for 45 minutes until the 10 sc he was facing finally ran out... then he conceeded, they just pulled them back and never launched the backup wave they have. it takes a long ****ing time to kill that many fb. some sc have fighters as backup, some only go fb... so any time i ever do hp calc for any type of fleet, i assume command ship is included. in today's eve, organized ops w/o command ship bonuses are rare in any normal instance where force isn't overwhelming, and even then, rare. so the aeon number is reflective of that. assuming mom's are going to stay in 50km range over the duration of a long fight just because you want them to so your numbers holds up makes about as much sense as the guy who say's lr bs will kill armor hacs that sit at 180km the entire fight. if you're the sc fc, you're job in a hairy situation like that is to minimize incoming damage in 1 way or another. if it means moving out to a further optimal point so dreads have to trade down ammo, you better damn well do it. like i said before, 5 vs 40 isn't for chumps, but then again, chumps aren't likely to take that on anyways. btw math wiz, if you have 5 moms and 1 is primary, the other 4 have 2 rr each = 8 total. ie 8 - 10 dreads of lost firepower... over the course of 10, you're killing another 10 dreads, so now you're down to 20 dreads of firepower. add in all the other defensive factors possible for moms, and you really start to see how that fight becomes winnable w/o taking a loss. would anyone with sense hot drop 40 pl dreads with 5 moms? no.would pl drop anyone in the prov block using 40 dreads with only 5 moms atm? maybe. is anything in eve this simple, never."
9/22/2010,"the only appropriate 'fix' for dreads (and to a lesser extent carriers and battleships) is removal or serious re-tuning of supercaps.supercaps have, quite literally, destroyed any effective use of caps and battleship hulls in large scale pvp. basically, anywhere a supercap can be, they will be, and any dreads or carriers on the scene must then gtfo or die (and even if they choose to gtfo they will take substantial losses). this is a gaping flaw in the whole scheme of nullsec (and lowsec) pvp. the supercaps were designed (obstensibly) with the idea they would be ultra-rare alliance assets which would never be seen in large numbers. now, we're seeing them in the hundreds and nullsec warfare in particular has stagnated to death because of it.tldr: remove (and refund) supercaps, leave dreads and carriers as they are."
9/22/2010,ive thought about this a little. but what if you made it to where dreads dont have to siege up thier bonuses somewhat to like where a titan is and trash the tracking so thier not effective against smaller than capital ships. take the siege module add it to the titan dd to be able to do a area of effect dd but without it do the one shot deal. the big problem is dreads when seige are like setting twinkeys in front of a overwieght person . as it is there isnt much that could really chase moms off. just a thought though.
9/22/2010,"what might be somewhat more interesting is give some of the small support ships a increased capability in killing fighters and bombers.say assault frigates (or destroyers) with webbing bonuses against drones/fighters/bombers, and if ehp is an issue perhaps a dps bonus as well.i would rather look at some of less utilized ships as a counter against sc damage, than just say we should remove sc's from the game.---however in saying all that, back to the op.it would be nice to have a slightly increased ability to dread targeting while in siege, even if its just obfuscate the primary target in cap fights."
9/22/2010,"i'm not sure that buffing underutilized ships to be sc ""counters"" really helps when scs are clearly taking over everything else's roles. i don't really see any choice but supercaps being nerfed, and hard.-liang"

9/22/2010,"oh. well then you're just a damb fool, and as you can see, no-one supports the idea of a cash shop. asking for one in a game you like makes about as much sense as asking your city council to zone the house at the end of your street as a crack-den."
9/22/2010,"so i assume this is some kind of satire on the plex for neural remaps thing right? if it is, pretty funny. if it's not, then this idea is obviously awful."
9/22/2010,"i generally don't mind ingame shops (though i personally never use them), but holy **** your examples are so dumb there's just no way anyone sane would support this. a real in-game shop inventory would look something like:rainbow engine trails (replaces default engine trails): $10rainbow laser crystals (replaces multifrequency): $10rainbow heavy missile (replaces scourge): $10rainbow explosion when my ship explodes (replaces normal explosion): $10etc.anything that gives any *real* advantage is generally a bad idea, and will lead to 1) everyone except the guys that spend a ton of cash quitting or 2) if bonuses are tradable broken economy. which then eventually leads to everyone botting so they earn cash to buy said bonuses from people selling them.either case is bad for the game.pretty much this."
9/22/2010,"satire has such nice conotations.if this thread stays near the top of the board with as much support as a pedophile managing a kindergarten, whilst the converse thread stays at the top and becomes the most supported idea in the assembly hall hopefully ccp will see some sense."
9/22/2010,"first off, people have been complaining for a long time about the learning skills making training too fast. also, we have remaps now, so choosing a race and stats in the beginning is meaningless beyond simple aesthetic purposes and starting area. attribute implants are cheap and easy to get, and thus add little to the game experience. you only think about them while training cybernetics, or for a few minutes after you die until you can get a new set.keeping all that in mind, i don't really see the point of even having an attribute system anymore. just set skill training speeds at somewhere around what 20-25 attribute points gets you now, and do away with the whole system.maybe keep the implant system with implants that only affect a single set of skills like spaceship command, electronics, etc., that go into a single slot number. that would make the implants more of an isk sink, by creating more turnover in the market. the people who hide in hi-sec amassing sp's with a full set of +5 implants won't have as many people whining about them, since they'd have to replace the implants occasionally just like pvp'ers."
9/22/2010,"i would like to see attributes actually effect skills aside from sp, like other rpgs. i've always felt attributes to be something you remap to power lvl skill groups for a while, that's it."
9/22/2010,"so your proposal is to, in effect, make eve less complex than it is now, and provide even fewer choices to the players in terms of customizing their own characters.no. no, sorry, i don't like that at all."
9/22/2010,"i don't like this idea. i wouldn't mind seeing attributes weighing a bit more in the balance though and rather not have them remapped with plex.simplification over improvement ? not supported, sorry."

9/22/2010,"what i'm suggesting changing is step 1 to ""receive bug report and let the whole population of eve players know about the bug and that they will be penalized for using it"" and #4 to ""ccp levies the minimum penalty that they had already committed themselves to via policy announcements to thousands of players"" (the first time) and hopefully next time it will only be 500 and then 100 the time after that.the specific exploit team is, i think, already in existence as the ""bughunters"" but they seem to be horribly understaffed. increasing staff would probably help them become more effective but it also costs money that ccp can't put into things more of the players encounters daily. imo bugs should be given much more dev time but apparently shiny new things are higher priority than cleaning the rust of and repainting."
9/22/2010,"hi guys n gals,i am very new to the forums so this may already have been raised.i have been thinking that with so many battles going on a simple way for a player to track visually would be for different factions to have different coloured explosions when their ships or structures blow up.this could be attributed to the different factions using different compounds in the manufacture of the items in question, or slightly different atmospheric factors in these structures.i personally find the explosions a bit dull compared to what could be achieved.please let me know if this is possible.thank-you."

9/22/2010,"that is quite possibly the dumbest thing i have ever heard. plex basically = $14.95. once someone has bought a plex ccp has made it's money. it's done. now lets say i used plex to buy something from the eve store that was worth $14.95. then i turn around and sell it for $13, thus undercutting ccp, and making that person not buy something from ccp. at this point, ccp still has it's money, someone else has my isk and my merchandise, no one got a month of free gametime, and i've made less money than ccp. ccp still wins in that scenario, especially when assuming someone else will have to buy a plex or pay a subscription fee to keep the account open that my original plex was supposed to have done."

9/22/2010,"if what you are saying is true about ccp not breathing a word to the csm about this, then this speaks volumes about how they feel about the csm. a facad is all the csm truly is. just some experiment to make the players think they have a say in things. i have always known the csm was pointless but deep down i was hoping i was wrong. that thread in assembly hall hit 20 pages or rage in 24 hrs. i can not think of another thread that has come close to that except maybe the carrier blog a few years ago.so what is the csm plans on this? what are you going to tell ccp that they can already read (and choose to not give a reply thus further adding to the rage i might add) for themselves?time to earn those free trips to iceland, free fan fests, free subscriptions and who knows what else, ehh csm???"
9/22/2010,"i dunno, putting something on sisi without asking the csm certainly doesn't seem like a big deal. especially something that doesn't really make much of a difference, just letting people remap more often instead of utilizing 1 year plans.now if the entirety of the csm thought it was a terrible idea and told ccp to please not put it in because it would ruin the game and were ignored, that'd be something else. but... is there really enough of a problem there to justify the csm picking this as a point to fight for? personally, i think its a good idea even though it'll make all my plex purchases a bit spendier."
9/22/2010,terrible idea.
9/22/2010,marconus did you read the recent csm blog?
9/22/2010,"i did.to be honest, it is very little that is being done considering the vast amount of things that need to be fixed. not the csm's fault really. every term there is probably fifty new things that ccp needs to fix. the players want it. the csm passes that along to ccp (which is silly because ccp reads the forums anyways so it's not like they don't know about it) like a middle man. then ccp fixes say... one, maybe two things. so after every term, the pile of things that need fixed gets bigger and bigger.but i guess the csm can only be a loud parrot for so long."
9/22/2010,"i like the style of your post -- sum at the top and explain afterwords. sound-bite types can see it up front, those that find it interesting can read the why.on the faction navy interventions -- i think that should work just like concord but no concord at all will show up. that way it's just replacing the logic used for concord with fn ships, which aren't immune and can be outrun but that will call for more ships to help out. so you get in, do the deed and run like hell or potentially face swarms of npc's that will overwhelm any force but which can be out-run and/or avoided. no 'impossible to avoid/defeat' junk, just regular faction type ships with a lot of support available if the fight keeps dragging on."

9/23/2010,"okay, here's the problem with that idea that tracking is not important: you can't do any dmg to ships you can't track.why does every person seem to believe that a boost to tracking on blasters will magically make them be able to hit smaller ships? my guess would be that they're used to the way other guns already have proportionally good tracking for the range they fight in, so they rightly think that better tracking on those guns would allow them to hit smaller ships too easily. my friends, blasters do not have this ""problem""--as most of you know, the closer a ship is, the greater their transversal velocity. so it will still be beyond blasters to reliably hit smaller ships any better than any of the other guns simply because the transversal velocity will be higher at the ranges the blasters can do anything in. particularly since they even have a hard time hitting ships of their own size currently.all i'm asking for with a tracking increase is to make blasters actually viable in the range they seem to be built to fight in. what's wrong with making them a tactically different kind of gun than the others? i.e. being actually able to hit ships well at a close range.that being said, it also needs a dps increase to make it worth the time to get in range. hell, why not even shorten the range somewhat even more just to make sure they have to be close range. i'd certainly sacrifice maybe 25% of the range for proportionally better tracking for it's range and a dps boost."

9/23/2010,"yeah, i don't see how removing learning skills and attribute implants is any different or better than what i proposed, which is scrapping attributes completely. if you get rid of those things, we'll be down to 6 numbers and remaps. that makes it nothing more than a system to discourage players from training skills in a more balanced manner, instead of training similar skills in year long blocks for min/maxing purposes. telling a new player they have to train 2 months of learning skills to get the best results, isn't that much different than telling them after those 2 months are over, they then need to train 6 months of int/mem fitting skills they don't need yet, in order to save that 2nd remap purely for ship and weapons training."
9/23/2010,learning skills are an admitted bad idea. burn them with fire and help retain more new players.
9/23/2010,"i would be 100% satisfied, because i could get my friends to play without using most of their trial not doing anything."
9/23/2010,"it does take away from the complexity. but is the complexity there for a reason? most games have the reason that behind training your skill is the foundation of attributes, as you know, such as intelligence, dexterity, etc. but those attributes don't allow you to train faster; rather, they allow you to perform your job my efficiently.that's not the case with learning skills, which only allow you to train skill points faster. that may have been the only thing that wasn't really thought out in this brilliant game, when implemented. an even larger problem, as mentioned in the original information, is that it makes getting people to stay with the game much harder. it already has a huge learning curve.this is what i propose as a solution: a modifier level 5 learning level. cut the max learning level to level 4, which would give the player the same maximum training speed as level 5. the last level (level 5) gives the player a 3% increase in whatever attribute is used for a particular job. for instance, if a primary attribute on a particular weapon is intelligence, then you would get a 3% increase in damage for having intelligence at level 5. the secondary attribute would add another 2%--if it were level 5 also--for a total modifier of 5%. and in order to make it something that would entice newer players to strive for w/o making the game unnecessarily hard in the beginning, is to double or triple the training time of that last level from where it is now. that way you have maximum training speed after level 4, and you don't have to train the modifier level until you are further into game play, while that last modifier level takes a really long time to train, and would be considered an elite skill for advanced players."
9/23/2010,"i'm all for a complex skill system that makes a player have to really think, plan, and make difficult choices, but the current learning skills do not do this. so, not exactly convincing rationale for keeping learnign skills as they are.want a genuinely complex, interesting, and fun skill system... make it have real specialization that can't be overcome with time and accumulation of more skill points. in order to be the best at x your going to have to sacrifice being suboptimal in either y or z. tie the ability to use some skills to faction standings, maybe for a few even regional sovereignty.learning skills as they are now are nothing more than a meaningless grind that new players if they're interested in taking the optimal path (most mmo gamers) are forced to train.remove them!"
9/23/2010,"ok,please i thought people in eve had common sense. just think about it, if ccp were to remove learning skills they would not give all people a certain amount of sp they will implement a set of maybe up to 100 scripts to tally apis that have a certain amount of sp in the learning skills category and refund that amount of sp to the characters that did train these and none to people who didn't. so it's basically win, win for people that did and lose, lose for people that didn't. that being said i am all in favour of removing learning skills since i trainede them and i would get my sp back so meh ******s can think they won't get is back and say not supported but for me, supported"
9/23/2010,"ccp if you are trolling us then this was a very successful troll. i really hope this isn't for real though. i love this game. the plex system is unique in itself. you can use the gtc to buy shinies, yes, but you are still on the same level pretty much because what matters are skillpoints. and the way you are going, you look as if you are going to start selling skill points and that will ruin the game."

9/23/2010,"over a two year period, you will gain no significant advantage over someone who planned their training in advance. the advantage will only be in the short term, being able to get into a t2 cruiser a couple of weeks earler due to having more, shorter neural remaps. there is a possibility for getting some advantage in terms of mem/int to per/wil to cha/wil, but over the course of a two year period that will amount to a week or so.the advantage is only in getting to fly a t2 ship sooner (or getting to use elite command centres sooner). players will not be building sp faster as a result of getting more frequent neural remaps.if sp building rate is the issue, you should petition for the removal of attribute implants, learning skills, neural remaps, character transfers, gtc to isk conversion and two spare character slots on an account."

9/23/2010,"i want to clarify the reason why most people are against plex for remaps, because most people who are for this don't understand or do not want to understand :the ability to remap with plex adds a form of wealth to the game ( a service that gives you more flexibility in gameplay ), this opposed to the current plex for gametime system where the wealth in the game is only redistributed between the players.so it is the current system of limited player rmt regulated by ccp versus the introduction of a microtransaction system, where one buys ingame benefits directly from ccp.i hope this helps and perhaps the op should clarify this in his post"

9/23/2010,"part ieve is gaining subscribers at a steady pace, and has been since it was released. that is of course very good and a standing ovation should be given to the developers who have been able to make a game feel so open and fresh for so many years.however,there is a small problem, and that is the amount of players who try the trial, get tricked by the unforgiving world of eve and decide never to play this game again. it doesnt take much for a player to decide to play something else if he has a bad start. there are a lot of games to choose from these days. my belief is that if someone was given a different experience during character creation and tutorial then it would take a lot more for him to actually give the game up. - what you want as a new player is defniately not a wall of text every time you open a new window. the information is not bad and should definitely be stored in a database of some kind, accessible in-game  but only at a players request.eve is very broad, and you dont really understand the awesomeness of eve with the current tutorials. there are so many things to do, but too much ruined by confusion. in this thread i would like to give my thoughts and suggestions of how to make improved tutorials, based on which profession you decide on during character creation. my visions of good tutorials are the kinds that make you feel very personally related to the characters and the environment around you.firstly a small revamp of the character creation system need to be made to make it easier for players to choose their path. character creation should be made during download/installation of the eve client. as the tutorials will be very customized with voice acting/cinematics it would be very unnecessary for other players who are not playing the tutorials to download all this extra data. (if you are an experienced player it should be possible to skip the tutorials all together, but you will have to select that during character creation as it will not be possible to cancel once you started  you will also miss the benefits the tutorials would give you). my most important suggestion would be to create small secure branch of systems in unknown space which is only accessible to newcomers. they would consist of 5 systems branched together and then a 6th system which will be where you complete the tutorial and move out to the real world of eve. i have added a drawing of an example of how the systems could look like  mind you, im not an artist!"
9/23/2010,"part iiyou will at this point specialize yourself in a profession as everyone deserted at this unknown part of space must contribute to the survival of the colony. the character creation has become a bit simplified as you did the first part of it during client installation (if possible). the idea is that you only choose race and clan at first, and at this point you will be making making the choice of which path to follow (if you want to become a fighting or industrial pilot). as always in eve this does not mean you cant swap paths later, its only to supply you with the correct tutorial and some starting skills.the tutorials will be a bit more interactive than they have been so far, showing you how the market works  for traders/manufacturers it will actually give tips and tricks on how to profit from the market, as a trader it is an important quest in your tutorial to put up buy and sell orders on the market in order to generate some profit. this will be a cut-off region of space so no-one else will have access to this market and the people at this remote location will not have access to any outside market. so the pilots here will only be able to get what the local market supplies  making it a lot more manageable at a first glance than wondering what all those thousands of modules do. there will be some ammunition, simple modules and a few t1 frigate blueprints available to get by completing certain missions. this will help players specializing in this type of game-play to get a good idea of what to do when they actually reach main-space. you will also meet the shady dealer sly that lives at his own little place a system down from the main hub. sly is supposed to supply you with a contract for some parts at 10.000 isk but will actually put it up for 100.000 isk in order to demonstrate ways other players will use to try to scam and trick you. nothing puts you off more in a new game than when you spent a long time getting your money up a bit, only to lose it all by a player whos playing dirty. i know you intended eve this way and i think its good to let people have that freedom, but there is nothing wrong with warning new players of common risks. (if you accept the contract without realizing, buck will compensate you but also let you know that he will not be there to help you next time, and your money will be gone).a specialized surrounding for the fighter pilot will be the hostile drone zone where some rogue drones that seem to have been made thousands of years ago with ancient technology have made a base of operations. these drones are some very mild and early stage of sleeper drones and have some remarkable similarities in looks. the reason they have stayed in that system seems to be because their ai has not figured out how to use a stargate yet. they often scout and scan the gate though as it often releases energy bursts. one mission in particular that will be helpful for future pvp pilots is where a friend of buck, by the name of duck (nah, im kidding - his name is warren) has sent out a distress call after being attacked by some drones. you will have to fit a remote armor repair unit, and actually use it or duck, i mean warren, will get blown to pieces. this will be a good lesson in how its possible for pilots to help each other out in battle.the main thing with all these missions is doing what i would have to say, have failed with in previous tutorials. introduce many important aspects of eve but in a small scale. the eve universe is huge and brilliant, but if you get it thrown in your face the moment you start the game then it will feel very overwhelming."
9/23/2010,"the final mission will be where buck contacts you and says he has detected an anomaly in a nearby system, and tells you to equip a probe launcher on your ship and follow him to investigate. you will now go to the exit system, which is also instanced.buck will teach you how to probe out anomalies, and you will detect a wormhole (which should be very easy to scan out, just to give players an idea of things that are possible). when you visit the scanned out wormhole, buck will start a conversation with you explaining that this might be your chance to get away from this unknown part of space. he will tell you that you need to investigate and also that you should bring with you anything important as you might need it. (basically its a one-way ticket.) when you enter the wormhole it will be time for another cinematic and how the wormhole collapses before buck manages to follow you in and voila! the real eve universe opens up to you.i have many more suggestions and ideas on how to implement this, but i wont bore you out with details on every single thought in my mind if you are not interested. i hope you understand and like the main idea that im trying to convey. thank you for taking your time in reading this."
9/23/2010,"i got my first ransom when i was a trial. i was only able to do this because eve has an open environment that uses very few non-player restrictions on where players can travel. i probably would have quit eve if it were like most mmo's where there's a starter area to ""shield"" newbies from the outside harshness."
9/23/2010,i personally am not looking for a store front in the sense of some other games as much as a way of being able to easily sell to your corp/alliance at a reduced/subsidised price with suitable mechanics to prevent abuse of this reduction/subsidy.
9/23/2010,the feature should probably be able to do both if they implement it right.
9/23/2010,"why make it ugly like the lp store? just make it another market you can access. just like the normal markets.perhaps to help with not ruining 0.0 markets, allow this feature freely in lo/hi sec. in 0.0, allow it only if you have sov. if you lost a station, lose sov, you lose your market."
9/23/2010,yes - i like that. linking it to sov would sort some of the issues out. and having a limit like contracts would sort out the rest i would hope.market or lp store would work for me - i'm not beholden to either especially...
9/23/2010,"there is currently still a limit on pos being launched and anchored in the same system.limits are:5 a day for an alliance1 day for a corp from what i remember this was put it place to stop tower spamming when pos were used for holding sovereignty.this as we now know has changed and yet the limit is still there.i understand this will only effect some people but i'm against random old bit of code that are set up to limit things, it can be very annoying.lastly some praise to gm huginn because he's awesome"
9/23/2010,ccp could always add the damage percentage in the item attributes like they should have done years ago. keeping that hidden really doesn't make a massive difference since most people run with spare crystals anyway.edit: even just adding something like a small icon somewhere on the crystal item's image would be leaps and bounds better than guessing at this point.
9/23/2010,"yes, yes, yes. i jump into that situation from time to time. don't see the rationale behind not allowing that./signed"
9/23/2010,the reason damaged items can't be traded is because of scammers. i don't see how this problem couldn't easily be fixed with the same warning popup you get when accepting a contract for fitted ships or containers in the first place.
9/23/2010,"i think in eve you could make interceptor battles 200 times more intense or any battle for that matter if you had a joystick option for ships making it so you can or cannot use a joystick for eve to manually fly your ship in space.one of the main reasons i bring something like this up is because i think alot of people are getting board with the same old warp in on target orbit at 15km drift out to 20km point shoot kill. the answer nooooo!!! this is too boarding for a game as imense and epic as eve we can have better and you guys can do better! using star wars movies as an example imagine how intense a 20vs20 man frigate/interceptor fight would be if every one was manually flying...this puts more skill on the individual rather than... did he click the correct orbit range?i was thinking of a 4 axis moving plan up and down with the nose of the ship and tilt left and tilt right of course i supose you could add some sort of rudder for quick turn arounds which would be cool but you could just integrate it into the left and right axis.i think you would have to make an in ship screen/view so people can get the real intense feeling of flying a space ship into combat seeing the flash from there guns and the burn of the missiles flying out or into there ship i believe this would make the game extremely more enjoyable by creating the real space dog fights.also im sure you can set your hot keys on the joystick to have a throttle and hot ""buttons"" for your warp scramble and guns as well.give it some thought thanks, gaijin mei, heretic army"
9/23/2010,you troll you
9/23/2010,imagine the lag in a 5v5.
9/23/2010,lagg could be an issue i suppose but think of how insane this would be
9/23/2010,"unsupported.no, lag would be an issue. eve can only run somewhat lag-free because it is amazingly efficient about the amount of data it sends to the server (only changes in direction/speed and activating modules). giving manual control to players will cause them to send velocity changes to the server far more often.anyway, since ship facing is irrelevant to everyone's ability to hit you then what would you gain by piloting manually (which you can already do by double-clicking a lot)?"
9/23/2010,granted lag would be an issue but if they could fix that then it would be awesome and yes your right the way your ship faces doesnt have to do with anything however if u have pvped alot you would see the relevance with this when it comes to lowering transversal and angular flying but aparently you dont know these things lol
9/23/2010,"you can already do that by double-clicking. joysticks are great for reaction time and precision but don't really give you any new options. if you change to a joystick method of control then you'll allow people more easily perform a spiraling approach rather than the current angled approaches (somewhat valuable in pvp but you can already do this with the orbit maneuver even if it is annoying to type in all those orbit distances) but i don't think that is worth the absolute necessity of sharding the server to turn it into more of a flight sim.i guess the best way to explain it to you is to break down exactly what eve client/server has to send now and what it would have to send after your changes.under the current system, you only need to talk to the server when you change something. flying in a straight line requires practically no bandwidth. orbiting requires practically no bandwith. an autocycling module requires only a hit/miss notification sent each cycle. etc.there is a reason that there aren't 100v100 dogfight flight sims. the amount of data is impossible to transfer to/from the server.instead of a single new vector, the server has to send data every few seconds as you move the joystick.turn -80%x, 20%yturn -75%x, 15%yturn 20%x, 0%yturn -30%x, 20%yturn -75%x, -10%yturn -80%x, 20%yusing a joystick will inevitably increase server bandwidth requirements significantly by increasing the number of course changes those pilots must use to fly their ship."
9/23/2010,"all right, the lag will kill the game, next ! indeed we could have the cokpit view ! that would be... ""wait for it"" awesome !!!"
9/23/2010,that indeed would be incedibly awome and would probably bring lots and lots of ppl into eve as there are many (afaik) that hate the way you fly ships in eve but yeah it would probably be extremely hard to make work on a eve scale maybe in 50 years or so it could be possible until then keep on dreaming
9/23/2010,"we do...your capsuleer is sitting in a pod full of goo, and sees exactly what we see trough the camera drones;"
9/23/2010,"allow players to choose specific modules to target and damage in addition to the current targeting system. the more damaged the module the more of a diminishing effect it will have. this would allow for more strategic combat in both pve and pvp. examples:your enemy's ship is faster than yours, you target and attack his propulsion. the more damaged it is the slower the ship will go.your enemy is dealing out more dps than you, you target his weapon modules and individually take them out. the more damaged the lower the dps / rate of fire.your enemy is using a shield booster / armor rep and is too much of a tank.your enemy is being remotely boosted by an ally not capable of doing any dps to you."
9/23/2010,"might be fun on supercaps, but completely impractical for anything smaller."
9/23/2010,"the 3 core focus spots for ships going into combat are their ability to hit decently, avoid damage and take damage. this suggestion seems to be aimed at gutting their ability to take damage which favors avoidance yet bigger ships have lousy agility/maneuverability to avoid being hit. if it is bypassing shields, they become fairly worthless.if it bypass armor, all armor tanks are worthless and many ships can't fit decent shield tank.if it bypasses hull then hull tanking/hull improvements become worthless.etc...hull tanking, which has been used in the past (though out of vogue now), may not be a ""first line"" bright choice but some folks actually fit healthy buffers there and those modules would be worthless due to this change. it would remove a ""surprise"" shock-value fitting option from the game.players specifically pick the modules for their ships based upon a precarious balance of performance and ability to take damage and this would drastically change that by making avoidance of being hit vastly superior to a ships ability to sustain damage. batches of frigates taking down caps/super caps by targeting their systems through the defenses? not good."
9/23/2010,"according to the incursion update release page, ""pilots can join public fleets and co-operate to destroy the sansha incursions and return the universe to normal, receiving wealthy bounties, earning loyalty rewards and high commendation.""make the bounties and loyalty points that result from destroying sansha fleets correspond to the security of the system that the event takes place in (and possibly null, but not highsec) so that you get more rewards if you take the risk of going out to lowsec.basically, highsec should have substantially lower rewards, lowsec should have substantially higher rewards. the content can either be the same (so that highsec carebears can still kill battleship fleets if they enjoy doing that without skewing risk vs. reward) or more difficult npc sansha fleets can spawn in lowsec only, but the rewards in highsec need to be minimal."
9/23/2010,"one flaw with the keep state idea:while this would work with bridge/cyno, it wouldnt work with gate jump, as you cant run modules under (gate) cloak."
9/23/2010,"so should we make people have to click to activate the armor platings (both energized version and the non-energized one) and shield resistance amps, while adding a slight cap use to them to get that effect as much as possible? no. just because it might in some niche scenarios be easier to kill someone if dc remains as it is doesn't mean that's the way it's supposed to be. if it was possible to fit and use a doomsday with a t1 frigate, would the fact that removing that ability would result in fewer dead ships be a valid argument for not doing so? again, no.the only reason damage control is active right now is that game mechanics didn't allow for it to be passive in the past. it's time to fix that now."
9/23/2010,"obviously, it would require the client (or perhaps the server) to remember the module state when the jump begins, and start the modules up again as soon as the player breaks cloak. it occurs to me while writing this that a cloak timeout perhaps should not activate the modules."
9/23/2010,"honestly, i'd be more in favor of making things like energized plating powered than dc's unpowered passives. if someone forgets to turn it on, that's their fault and plenty of folks i've met forget to turn mods on ""early"" during combat and that costs them. this recommendation may have some ""nice"" sounding arguments to it but the net effect is lazier, less active modes of operation of ships in combat and i really find that lame."

9/23/2010,"not trying to be a jerk here, but hear me out.having spent literally years in online rpg admin, i totally understand the following things:1) programming (i.e. adding features) creates bugs. it's unavoidable.2) tracking and squashing bugs takes time, effort, sometimes pure luck.3) players get bored/stale when new features aren't added.4) players can be the meanest bunch when their daily fix isn't available how they want, when they want.next, i am also absolutely flabbergasted by the way i see eve customers treat the dev/gm/pr teams. absolutely nuts. the customers' behavior blows me away - they instantly turn into 4-year-old brats who need a nap when any of the following happen:1) a downtime is a second longer than estimated/projected.2) a bugfix introduces another bug.3) a feature does not manifest itself exactly as the customer had hoped/thought/predicted.4) a freebie/promo is granted to the playerbase (go read the threads about the primae, if you've forgotten how absurd people can get over a freebie. ridiculous. what a bunch of children).reading some of these threads, especially ones begun by devs or notifications about dev blogs, would make you wonder why they even bother. seriously, the way the customers treat ccp's employees in some of these threads is mind-boggling. talk about a sense of entitlement! man.now. having said those two things, i hope you get the picture that i'm sympathetic towards those who spend huge chunks of their lives building, supporting, and maintaining games like eve. huge props for the thick skin in regards to the way the customers treat them, wow.but.eve is a commercial product (you see their ads all over the place). it is advertised and touted as a fully commercial product. it is 'official.' to declare something as publically released (i.e., not a beta, etc.) pretty much brags about a certain level of polish, finish, robustness. eve does not have that. to congratulate a dev team on squashing bugs in a beta? absolutely. but touting yourself as a released commercial product, never. when people are paying money for a product, they don't expect perfection of course (or shouldn't), but they should expect to receive a polished, fully-featured, stable, commercial product.finding and squashing bugs is what the devs get paid for; it's their actual job. i may be tickled pink and delighted to see a particular bug squashed, but to pat them on the back? forget it. i expect bugs to get squahsed; i pay to have bugs squashed.maybe if eve were in beta, sure."
9/23/2010,"i think salvager drones would be more useful than salvager ships. like mining drones they would spread out, gather and return.i would have a great use for those pesky pirates or mission npc's that suffered an ill-fate at my hand. the could also come to use in warfare, you know. clean up the dead, pick for valuables, etc. i would buy a few my self at a reasonable price. (2,000-50,000isk/unit)"
9/23/2010,why not salvager drones you ask?that's why.
9/23/2010,because then people would stop asking why the salvager drone skill is listed in the database.
9/23/2010,"because ccp's job is to make a good, profitable game, not make the game even easier for mission runners at the expense of everyone else. salvaging drones would destroy the ninja-salvaging profession, which would make eve less of a cold, dark and harsh world, and more of a happy candyland where everybody sings songs, holds hands, and runs missions together. i don't think many people want to play in this candyland."
9/23/2010,"because if you bothered to do a bit of reading before posting, salvage drones would cause a hefty increase in lag (according to ccp)."
9/23/2010,"more like ""wtf cargo hold?"" i want a tech 2 with scrap-metal compression and more cargohold. get it done."
9/23/2010,"i've never tried it, but bombers are about as hard to hit as cruisers and have ~25k ehp. so maybe a hac gang instead of battleships, whatever. a 20-hac gang has the firepower to kill about one bomber every 4 seconds, assuming the target broadcasts go through properly, so that's less than 7 minutes to strip the first rack of bombers off 5 sc. obviously that's heavily idealized circumstances, how many fb did he kill, and what did he lose in that period of time? what did his fleet look like? command ships on the moms up the rr close to 50% and the ehp by about 11m...but they also add 2k tank to the dreads and half a million ehp. the dreads go from dying in 60 seconds to dying in 90. if you run that through, then instead of the first mom dying at the same time as the eighth dread, it dies at the same time as the seventh dread. adding command ship bonuses across the board are actually worse for the moms, because their resists have far higher stacking penalties from all the extra hardeners and thus they gain less ehp relatively speaking. agreed, it's a simplification. dreads can maybe exit siege and mini-warp to close the range back down, but it seems unfair to assume one side is perma-bubbled and the other gets to use slings at will. remember though, if the fight starts at zero range, it will take the moms something like 13 minutes just to get out of the dread's optimal with multifrequency. by then you've already lost one mom, and a second is bleeding badly. i'm not a moron. i included that in my above numbers. without rr, there'd be 22 surviving dreads, not 17. of course. i'm just saying, at equal isk values, dreads are perfectly competitive with moms in a straight-up fight, and in terms of raw number they're actually significantly superior. the reason why moms are the gods of the battlefield is that isk isn't generally the limiting factor, pilot count is, and moms are vastly more pilot-efficient than dreads are. i'm not saying that they're not good - a proper fleet of moms is scary as ****. but they're not invincible."

9/23/2010,"liang, i just kitted up an excel sheet to analyze the numbers much more carefully than i did the first time around. i show 20 dreads surviving, killing the last mom at t=2795, which is pretty much in line with what i got the first time*. i can email you(or anyone else interested) a copy if you want to check my numbers. there's a couple minor kinks left, due to the handling of timestamps in discrete seconds(which it seems you didn't do), but they're pretty insignificant. the dread death times agree well, but i really have to wonder where you got your mom death times from. i get moms dying at t=473, 972, 1534, 2151, and 2798. care to email me your work? i'm curious now. * - the extra three dreads are seemingly because i used slightly pessimistic numbers about dread survivability the first time around. turns out that surviving 67 seconds instead of 60 actually makes a pretty big difference.edit: realized there's an easier way to show my work."
9/23/2010,"i notice a few things there:1. when the 4th sc dies, dreads can tank more then the dps put out by the remaining sc. in your spreadsheet, that results in their damage taken column going into the negative, which is ofc impossible...but at the same time, if your dread fit can tank 10k while only 8k is incomming, it's true that they can save up some cap and tank for longer instead. 2. dread cap. most of my dread experience come from the pl sniper dread fleets with a single repper, but your tank numbers require 2, and a quick look at eft seem to indicate that cap life for tank+guns is indeed about 3 minutes...however, moroses and revs use cap to fire their guns, so once they get primaried, they will not have full cap and will not be able to tank for quite as long.3. following #2, if a dread really use up all its cap, it may no longer be able to even shoot at all, so capped out dreads should reduce the dread fleets dps too.4. i don't think overheat is considered for either side. overheating the hardeners and crars on the scs should increase repping very significantly at the start of the fight, and quite a bit immedietly after each sc goes down aswell when the next sc get to overheat its hardeners (crars are already heated close to max ofc). in the same way, the dreads could heat their local reppers ~2 mins or so increasing tank by 30%. similarly to the crars, dreads can also overheat guns for a while at the start.what are the exact fits you're assuming for dreads and scs?"
9/23/2010,"if eve were played right in the optimal of a dread, with full cap, where armor reps cycled properly, while a sc sat at 0 speed within 58km range at all times, and dread pilots were as typically inclined to have max skills in all things dread related as sc pilots were. 10k dps tanked per second for a dread is really high btw. it's a lot closer to 4k. also, it's easy to cycle targeted items such as rr.... when an local rep get stuck, you're sorta ****ed til the game get's over itself.also, if you take your scenario where dreads dictated the fight by hotdropping the sc, your dreads just started at about 35% capacitor. that's a huge crippling factor."
9/23/2010,"yeah, i know. i figure it's an acceptable fudge, for the reasons you list. besides, by that point it doesn't matter much, the fight is over. valid points. however, changing the dread's tank duration to 2 minutes means that 19 dreads survive, instead of 20, so it doesn't matter too much. and for comparison, if you drop the dread tank to 4k cap-stable, then 9 dreads survive. this is a half-hour fight, overheating won't make too huge a difference. also, since it affects both sides roughly equally, i'm assuming it's a wash. revs:siege, 3x dual giga beam w/blood mf3x cap recharger ii, sensor booster ii2x capital repper, 2x heat sink ii, 2x eanm ii, damage control ii, cap power relay ii3x trimark i5x bouncer iiaeons: remote ecm burst, 2x capital rr, large neut, 2x large smartbomb5x cap recharger ii (i don't think most mom pilots are willing to spring for officer rechargers, which is why it only lasts 7 minutes with both reps running)damage control ii, 2x x-type explo hardeners, x-type em/therm/kin hardeners, 2x draclira's eanms (very expensive, but i figured i'd give them a solid advantage)5x trimark ii20x mixed bombers zero speed doesn't matter - moms are so immense that there's no conceivable tracking issues. if we assume that the moms clear the range asap from zero, then two moms are dead before they even leave mf optimal. and if we assume dread 4 and cap turret 4, then the dreads still do over 3500. not with a dual-rep tank. whether you want one depends on fleet size, of course. with 40 dreads it's not crazy, though you're into the territory where a third eanm or a third hs is quite arguable too. i went with the dual-rep setup because that's what i usually use, though the dread fleets i fly with are smaller. i assumed that any lag is a wash. i haven't played enough high-lag fights to really get a feel for which modules cycle best, but assuming autorepeat works properly it shouldn't matter too much, since pretty much everything just stays running until you cap out. also, this is a fight with perhaps 50 in local, lag shouldn't be too huge a problem at all. fair point, but that repairs fairly quick. even if we take one dread off the field while the rest cap up for a minute, assume 3500 dps per dread, and assume a 2-minute tank life - a fairly pessimistic set of assumptions - then we're left with 7 dreads holding the field. not decisive as victories go, but still massive isk efficiency and a clear enough victory to say that your ""5 sc win with no loss"" claim is obviously false. i mean yeah, if you drop your moms 100km from a pack of blaster moroses, sure. but assuming an engagement and not a turkey shoot, the dreads not only kill one mom, but actually hold the field. dreads are perfectly reasonable ships for the isk, they just take more numbers in fleet to do the job. that's something most groups prefer to avoid, but it's not a sign that they're unusable."
9/23/2010,"i can once i'm home, but i can't right now. the real clincher is how much rr happens at the beginning of the fight. if it starts at 10k dps repped per sc, then the dreads win with 11 dreads remaining. 10.5 and the scs win with 2 carriers remaining. it's really touch and go, and utterly ridiculous that 5 scs should even have a prayer of defeating 40 dreads in a stand up fight. -liang"
9/23/2010,"i lol'd a little bit at work to this, but then read the follow-up posts and yeah.. it's indicative of a serious problem that even this hypothetical is so shot full of doubt for the dreads that it won't hold water. i'm far more inclined to agree with liang's asessment of the encounters, the sc's clearly hold the cards regardless of what your premise is.on a related, and equally comical note: given 8 to 1 odds that would mean a sc fleet of epic porportions (the kind we're already seeing now and the kind of which will probably be common place in another year or less), 100 sc's... what then? 800 dreads? even if you're going to claim ""derp impossibul fix lag,"" i've definitely got to take issue with considering a single ship, wich currently does have the potential to be massed, getting those kinds of odds against a cap, to say nothing about how obsolete that makes everything else."
9/23/2010,wtf ccp ???
9/23/2010,empty thread now locked.
9/23/2010,"ok putting this idea out to the pod people.what we need is a new type of ship/module..one that can fit modules for bad intel. think of a ship that when a specific module is fitted appears on the scanner and overview as another ship type. so while your flying a frig, i have xx module running with xx script that makes my ship look like a xx on scanner/overview ..i think the tech 3 frigs would be the perfect fit for this type of module or maybe even tie it in to a sub-system. the idea is that while the ship is looking like another to sensors it is really quite useless in combat. the question is do you think that this would work? i think it would definatly change the game."
9/23/2010,0 supports... guess that means your epic fail.
9/23/2010,"do any of you actualy read the idea in full or just skill and make conclustions.apparently not , i said that they had the potential to not that they would always hit. oh yes here it is now i may have phrased that badly but this says that should you fire at a target that's 245k away three out of four times you are garentied to miss, then take speed into account reducing your odds further.ok where did you find that info cause its sure not from my post, at not one point in my op did i ever say make blasters have a 250k range i said make there tracking so good that if you managed to get into range of a enemy ship you where more than garentied to hit it , even frigs, but they should be able to outrun you. additionally i never said anything in status to the size of the weapons just the ammo that they use. so uriel please re frame from posting stuff like this as its showing off your iq level"
9/23/2010,fail post is fail
9/23/2010,"attributes don't make eve more complex. all they are is something for players to base their training schedule around. they don't add anything to the game other than knowing they exist. not training electronics because i remapped to train spaceship command doesn't add any entertainment or depth to the game. if you guys think a once a year decision between apples and oranges makes the game more fun or interesting, you're all idiots.i will give you that they used to add some depth to the game when you picked them at creation, and couldn't change them, but remaps made that meaningless. if remapping for plex goes into effect, than the decision making aspect is even more meaningless, and i'd say the system only exists at that point to make ccp extra cash."
9/23/2010,but i did it for you drake.
9/23/2010,hey.... i was pointing out that the proposal should be dropped regardless of translation.it's an obvious fail thread.you however are always epic win! ^_^;;;;(note to self: don't step into de's wormhole and get ganked because i likely got a bomb with my name on bound for my ship)

9/23/2010,"hello,csm members are doing a good job but ccp are using them to only react if there is a commercial pressure on the company.the financial pressure to gain more clients and paying material is more important thant the existing player base.more to come to pay more > few to go away that aren't anymore paying in real money.csm, please stay on track but avoid being the 'pressure release' instrument.in each company there is a 'i'm acting right' element.like the petrolleum company investing in green energy to save the planet.my personnal point of view for csm members is that your place is not with ccp, based on ccp way of working, but out of ccp acting as player lobby.i vote for the csm to be ccp independant, no more nda, no more meetingin iceland. go the 'syndicate' way. make requirements for players. freely publish players voices. organise outside ccp. that was the 'syndicate' organisation history too.but...it's a game. we pay for if you don't like it btw..stop paying and play an other.i decided that paying for this game orientation was no more fun on myside.yeay"
9/23/2010,"time to send in leave of absence requests to work, take unpaid days off, sacrifice family time to attend irc/summit meetings, time to face the player flames day in and day out, and time to roll eyes at yet another groupie who thinks that it's just fun and games to be on the council... eh marconus?seriously, no one can honestly look me in the eye and say with sincerity that the current csm has not bent over backwards to get the ball rolling on quite a few endeavors.it seems quite clear to me that when the csm requests the input from the community that the same people who are strangely absent in their feedback are the loudest critics.as for the plex for sp/hr.... it's not for sp/hr, it's for a neural remap. one more point:sisi is a test server for a reason. i highly doubt ccp tells the csm every little thing that gets changed on a daily basis."
9/23/2010,"black ops improvements are not on the list of csm items ccp has indicated they are working on, at least for the winter expansion."
9/23/2010,well thanks for the feedback.and thanks for nothing ccp.long live the sansha invasion and other pve-related stuff in a pvp-centric game i guess .quite disappointing.
9/23/2010,"fyi - i'm a blackops enthusiast, and i agree that they need work. unfortunately, there are more urgent things :/"
9/23/2010,"hello violentuk. sorry for the delay in responding. real life. fair question. actually, i haven't a settled opinion one way or the other. i understand the need to cyno in and out of null sec via low. i've scouted for some of these, and i wouldn't want to see that end. at the same time, some folks believe hot drops prevent all but cheap roaming blobs, and thus degrade small group pvp. since the idea behind this thread is how to revitalize low sec, in part through small group pvp, i'm taking that concern seriously. there is an interview on tenton with ccp lead designer, noah ward, that touches on whether supercaps are overpowered. he's not willing to say they are or they are not, which indicates to me that ccp is looking at this issue. at some point, they'll have to decide whether the use of supercaps and caps in low sec enhances or detracts from the space. i do like, however, the core of moar's idea of using faction navies in creative ways. his idea has promise for balancing certain game dynamics without the need for outright bans or nerfs. whether a layered, progressive response from npcs is justified or workable in this instance is something i'm reserving judgment on. i appreciate you asking the question, and i for one would be interested in more of your thoughts on the matter. cheers, delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
9/23/2010,"as you're a troll, i'm just going to point out that you finished with this nonsense hoping that your tldr post would hide the fact that you never actually answered the question. obviously you don't actually play any part of eve that you're so eager to nerf, just as obviously you don't actually pvp and yet you lie about how much you love pvp. also, as you've lied before, you did indeed say that not only do capitals need to be moderated in lowsec, but concord needs to utterly destroy those who cyno into the 'wrong' lowsec systems. otsasai is off limits to cap pilots in your fevered anti-pvp hysteria. saying you 'haven't decided one way or another' after you're the one who proposed it is... well, it's pretty much the general pattern of deception that you use. very seriously. what with all your pvp experience. on a mysterious account that you can't figure out how to post with, but exist, honest! of course, your comments above just display the general level of ignorance and bull**** that your arguments are based around. as you never pvp you don't understand even the basic dynamics of pvp. there are, literally, dozens of ways to roam that aren't neutralized by capitals. to say nothing of the fact that since you're a professional victim, the possibility to take control of your own game experience and not simply be a victim doesn't even occur to you. very, very basically and clearly: a capital/super hotdrop can be successfully counterattacked. your ""ayieee, i am powerless and a victim, ccp must save me!"" logic is antithetical to eve's dynamic of player-driven conflict. more of your standard dishonesty. anybody can click on the link and read it and see that your description is, to put it charitably, amusing. he specifically refused to say that they were overpowered but said that in general ccp is always looking at balance and gave fighter bombers as an example... and even then refused to say that they were overpowered. and none of that gets into your professional victim rhetoric about how you have to have ccp save you from supers. even if they change how fb's work, they can still drop on you and savage you with a swarm of any other drone. you misspelled ""his utterly unnecessary and counterproductive ideas to make lowsec into highsec-lite, even though players already have the entirety of highsec to play in, so that ccp can nerf pvpers. but again as dishonesty is my stock in trade, i'll just pretend that it's ""creative stuff"" and not a direct nerf to pvp in lowsec."" typos like that happen. yet more dishonesty. shockah. not only is there no need to ""balance"" lowsec, which is heavily stacked in the favor of defenders and against outlaws anyways, but the idea that having swarms of scrambling faction navy ships come in to break up any attack is somehow about ""balance"" is an utter absurdity. you pretend to be concerned about small-gang pvp but then you talk about how any small gang would be met by overwhelming faction navy firepower for having the audacity to initiate pvp in lowsec. yah, great call. i'm sure it came from your wealth of pvp experience in eve. what with scouting for capitals and such."
9/23/2010,sigh....
9/23/2010,"no no no, we've been over this before delilah, don't know why it's so hard for you to understand... the way to post with your pvp main account (that really and truly does exist, honest) is to sign out and then sign back in with that account, and then post with it. not the rolleyes smiley. it's understandable how you'd make that mistake, but having explained it to you i think you should be able to handle it. give it a try. post with that account since, as you're not trolling, it really does exist."
9/23/2010,"btw, folks following this and other low sec threads may want to read a new post by mynxee on her life in lowsec blog. entitled priority: low sec, she is creating an making low sec matter committee to revision and make proposals about revitalizing low sec. she stresses that this is a personal initiative, and not a csm or cpp project. sounds very cool, and with her organizational skills, i have no doubt they'll do a great job. cheers, delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
9/23/2010,"to answer all of the csm flames i have a few words.the csm is nothing. it's meaningless. the elected representatives are just players like you and i. they can ""tell"" ccp what to do no more than you or i can.getting angry at the csm for a ccp decision like getting angry at your class treasurer for the school district laying off the volleyball coach. it doesn't compute.being elected to the council is much like being elected ""class president"". the class president in no way runs the school, or the class, or in any way affects the operation, management or planning of the school. he's a puppet of the powers that be, just like his constituents. does the principal hold him in high esteem? yes. does the principal use the class president for public functions and to provide a more ""supportive"" face on assemblies and other student functions? yes. he is a public relations tool to give the appearance that the powers that be care about what the electing constituents think. the reality is, they don't. that much is apparent. ccp have a bunch of intellectuals on staff who are so convinced of their own superiority their reality check bounced on re-entry. with doctorates from mit, and lots of big words they like to impress their shareholders.... and we still keep paying them money to crash internet spaceships. it's a business, and that is our only real power, the power of demand. when enough people have canceled their accounts over issues like the font, and lag, and any number of other things.. eventually it will affect their bottom line. they will be forced to climb out of their ivory tower and actually do what people want, rather than what their design staff is telling them is more important.i can tell from what they've written in official statements that they have a ton of staffing redundancy. it took their web devs (10 of them) 6 months to crank out evegate, an app that (no kidding) a four man crew in india could have cranked out in about 3 weeks from spec to signoff. the app does very very little. i personally could have cranked it out in about a month, and that's going easy on myself.iceland has a really rough economy right now so they try to employ as many people as possible. unfortunately this makes for a very bureaucratic nightmare getting anything done. in the capitalist era, this nonsense won't provide for a very healthy future for the company. sure they run in an agile environment, and use all the buzzwords, and make people think they're all brilliant and godlike.. but in the end they get very very little done. and what gets done is usually buggy. this is not the fault of the csm. if you want to blame anything for ccp's lack of efficiency and utter disregard for its customers.. look no further than the economic plight their country is suffering. they're trying to do their part to stem the tide....with a game that has an interface that was obviously designed by an engineer and not a ui designer, and server software that while ground-breaking it was at one point.. right now it's barely breaking wind.i don't want to sound like i'm bashing eve though. we love our community that has been built around eve because we're all nerds who like generally the same stuff and can bond friendships that transcend all the bs that ccp pulls us through. the stunning graphics and pretty good sound with the sandbox environment.. makes the game a unique experience. any unique experience will always have an audience. we are that audience."
9/23/2010,"i know the csm brought up a few issues and i know that some of the things the csm asked for are going to be implemented, but i can't find what features were actually going to make the expansion from the csm discussion. the expansion notes are extremely ambiguous in this regard.as you may have seen, i'm a big backer of the font issues and i wanted to find out what actually made it."
9/23/2010,the csm blog has the information you're looking for.
9/23/2010,"i've always been more of a ""top"" guy myself, but hey.. everybody needs a bottom sometime."
9/23/2010,"heya, thought i'd throw this out here and let people who have the time for it work with it... why don't we have a fleet message of the day? like with other chatchannels when you join, you get a message the first thing that pops up with information about the channel/ops what not. if we had this for fleet (and i know about the fleetdescription already, but people are too stupid for that one) it would save a lot of time and allow fcs to lead more -> more pewpew -> more fun (and probably more lag but hey) just throwing it out there as i've not seen a single mention of it in the 5 years i've been playing."

9/23/2010,"to quote me again from the 2days old thread:the fleet finder already gives you the option to write up details about your fleet. people just need to *read* it before joining?and unlike an motd in fleet chat, you can always look up that information later as it doesnt scroll out."
9/24/2010,supported! pos improvement would be awesome!
9/24/2010,supporting this. i've been longing for some revamp of poses for quite a few years now...
9/24/2010,back to first page
9/24/2010,blasters have 2 major problems the way i see it.1 there mainly fitted by gallente nubs who dont know what the ships speed control is for ( controlling transversal ).&2 eft that tells them they get omgwtfbbqdps for fitting a magstab when a te would actually work much better in the real world.
9/24/2010,"too awesome to not support, really.it's ic.it's different, what other mmo would do this?c'mon ccp, show us the surprise in your space-suits and implement this in some fashion or another."
9/24/2010,yes
9/24/2010,"do this, ccp, so people can literally live off of eve."
9/24/2010,so you support nerfing the damage/rof bonuses on all minmatar ships unless there firing fusion ?
9/24/2010,"guns also have a major advantage over missiles, they do exactly the same damage at 10,000 km/s as they do at 0km/s as long as you use keep at range rather than orbit.missile users can not improve the quality of hits against a fast moving target."
9/24/2010,"yes.the analysis on the first page iirc.basically 25% bonused kin is better against t1 armor tankers than unbonused exp by 5 to 10%.against t1 shield tankers kin may actually be worse than unbonused em or 5% better than unbonused thermal.bonused kin is lovelly versus mini t2.pointless against caldari/gallente t2.and maybe equal to unbonused thermal v amarr t2.over the lifetime of a ship ( assuming the pilot has max hull skills for that ship ) and assuming the pilot fights optimally ( with the best ammo ) a 5% per level kin bonus will produce a dps increase of approx 8%this compares unfavourable withgun dpl bonuses , 25% more dpsgun rof bonuses , 33% more dpsdrone damage bonuses , 50% more dps"
9/24/2010,"no they dont, they have a bette chance of getting a excellant hit but its not a consistent damage, even at 0 transversal.edit. the fact you said 10,000km/s did you mean that turret ships do the same damage no matter what speed there own ship is going"
9/24/2010,"in a dogfight its only the difference in speed between the 2 ships that affects tracking and therefore gun damage.for example.in a situation where your target is doing 1,900 m/s and your doing 2,000 m/s guns will track really well and will deliver high damage.even though speed is high tracking is still low.if you were using missile , damage would be rubbish and there not much you can do about it if your kiting outside web range.speed is to missiles , what tracking/optimal is to guns."
9/24/2010,"thats a little narrow as for most ships to do that sort of spped your looking at mwd, which then blows the sig up, so for example say a vaga is kiting a drake, the vaga sticks his mwd on to keep his distance, he then gets murdered by the drakes superior dps at that range coupled with the vaga's sig bloom."
9/24/2010,"thats one example and about a narrow a definition as you could possible come up with.its also a worse case scenario ( vaga's being week to kin and low ehp ) which would actually be improved by this proposal.a drake pilot with em/therm/exp loaded - which would be more likelly if they were bonused would do less damage to a vaga in the initial stages of a fight.you might think that the drake is hurting you.but in no way are you taking full damage once your up to speed.in fact if your flying around in a vaga , your more likelly to be killed in a solo fight against another vaga or cynabal ( both gun boats ) than you are to be killed by a drake."
9/24/2010,"ok i only chose the vaga as you chose a high speed situation, the hml drake actually out dps a barrage loaded vaga past 15km in the parameters you outlined (keep at range). this is when shooting each other. the situation is the same with most bc and lower ships down to cruiser, against a hml drake, and with precision hml's loaded you do more than enough dps versus frigates.also i know when out in my drake that if i see a vaga on scan, im either going to kill it or force it to warp, same with vagacanes and pretty much anything that loads up long range ammo and tries to keep range, as i will hit them for exactly the same dps at 0km as i would at 50km, and that its more than most long range setup bcs can do at the same range due to there tracking and fall off."
9/24/2010,"kinetic damage bonus is the least of cmb's problems, as most have fitting issues. you give the caracal an omni damage bonus and it wont change teh fact that it severely gimps its fit to fit hams or hmls with a tank and mwd.also forgot to mention that guns are also affected by signature radius, maybe not as badly but they all are."
9/24/2010,"look at another situation.cerb v nanocane.speed will be similar in both ships.lets say for arguments sake that the nanocane is slightly faster so that range and tracking are not the issue.lets say there both doing around 1,400m/s for arguments sake.missiles from the cerb will have there damage attenuated by about 60-70%.nanocane will hit for full power and melt the cerb in about 20 seconds.there are all sorts of fight that happen.stating that missile are better because they have a range advantage is entirelly false.missile may be better if you cant keep up with your target ( cant control range )but guns are better when you can keep up with your target ( can control range )due to not being affected by speed and having much higher base dps."
9/24/2010,"all i have been trying to point out is getting rid of the kinetic bonus doesnt solve anything, if a nanocane comes across a cerberus, it a. has to catch it and b. even when it does i would fully expect it to kill the cerberus, same as i would fully expect it to kill any sniperhac.guns tracking are effected by speed hence why webs help tracking."
9/24/2010,"even if this was true it still wouldnt change it by giving the caldari missile boats an omni damage bonus as most cant fit the primary weapon systems of there type. those that can are aguably the best in there class, the drake.edit. sorry about the double posts"
9/24/2010,"it is true. i'm pretty sure your allready aware of the way missile damage is attenuated by speed , looking at the number of drakes you have killed with your dram changing kin to rof wouldnt change what ( sorry you say ""it"" ).i am not trying to change the difference between missiles and guns.read the op for why i think this would be a good change.basically bringing the value of hull bonuses more inline with the other races.8% extra dps for lvl5 is totally bogus."
9/24/2010,"i'm saying i want any torps on my hound to do the same kind of dps on my hound. so i want em torps to do the same damage as my explosive torps are doing now on my hound.and this isn't called nerfing, it's called boosting.the hound is locked to shoot explosive torps / explosive bombs if you want to do some dps / alpha. and it's the same with the drake and kinetic missiles.so if you want to have the same damage on other missiles to do the same damage as your kinetic missiles are doing now, then i want to have the same thing with my hound.i hope you understand now what i'm talking about.the drake alone shouldn't get special treatment."
9/24/2010,"well i dont know what op you read before posting here , but i never sugested any boost to the manticore , which would be the equiv ship to your hound.the drake alone is not the subject of this post.if you want to compare the drake to its mini equiv compare it to the cane.and if you really want to swap a 75% boost to exp for a 25% boost to rainbow on your hound , i say fair enough.but it should only affect you personally when you fly a hound.as i pretty much suspect everyone else would think that was a sucky trade off."
9/24/2010,your post is very difficult to understand.are you saying that you want to prohibit trial accounts from committing concordokken offenses?
9/24/2010,"uh. are you saying that people shouldn't be able to attack anyone in the trial period, and that those in the trial period shouldn't be able to attack anyone in high sec?-liang"
9/24/2010,"this is an interesting point, and if ccp indicates that they are considering dumping learning skills, i will recommend they think about the potential consequences. however, the effect may not be all that horrible, as most accounts have one toon with most of the learning skillpoints, and those points do represent roughly the same amount of training time no matter how they were distributed. also, most people would put the points into their mains."
9/24/2010,i like this ideal but i had level 4 skills before i had level 5 skills. belive it or not thoughs 2 points make a noticeable differnts. so i would not wish to lose them. you have 3% and 2% thats 5%. 5% over 10 levels worth of skill could be simply added as 0.5% each level and would make each level trained more usefull and mybe even fun too. this is hands down the best ideal i have seen to date. this is what i would do to make everyone happy or happyer.edit: 5% my be to much or to little so what ever is ok with max skills just spread it out over all 10 levels. you mite even or probly would wieght it out so you got better or more benift from the higher ranking learning skills too.edit2: another good ideal to make them usefull more then they are is adding them as preq. on some iteams or other skills. notable would be socal skills for trading/socal skills. int/memory for sciance i.e. i aways belive it's better to fix content then to remove it.
9/24/2010,"well that's a **** argument it won't help retention? why not no reasons given you are simply flaming and being annoying please save us the ""omgwtf this guys stupidly ******"" feeling we all get from reading comments made by people like you."
9/24/2010,supported.
9/24/2010,every player i have trained is still playing the game. once the players saw the benefit of investing time in learning skills and how it helps them in long term they were encouraged by it. i have never had anyone put off by learning skills not once.plenty of people really dont like reading your stupidly ******ed comments.
9/24/2010,"just think about all those noobs that come from games like wow where doing something grants immediate gratification those types of people don't want to spend the first month of the game training skills and seeing the reward 6 months later, they just want to actually play the game. ccp want a larger playerebase so they are helping the retention of former wowies and the like."
9/24/2010,way wrong move.
9/24/2010,"i don't see why not. there's no obligation for those who don't want to use it to ever do so, and for those who would, it means more $ for ccp.edit: to all those worrying about rl money affecting the game, it does already anyway, whether you realise it or not./ben"
9/24/2010,"agreed.i've only recently started playing, but i know well over a dozen players now with 4 or more alts to generate their isk and help their ""main"" fly efficiently. if that's not rl money (plex are paid for by newbs like me, so **** you if you think that's not money being spent) changing the game, then i don't know what is."
9/24/2010,microtransactions in eve is terrible idea.
9/24/2010,bad idea.
9/24/2010,**** microtransactions! wtf ccp?!!
9/24/2010,quoted for truth. i dont know any long term players that have not ether payed cash for plex to sale for isk or spent isk to buy plex in game for one or more accounts or for one or more months already. a remap here or there would be nice. i will be one of the ones that buys ingame plex for isk though.the only real down side of this is thta it will probly drive plex prices up for a spell.edit: as a side note and trader there are worse things to lose your isk in. at least with plex i ether make good isk or i have free mons of play time on hand

9/24/2010,going with the common response.wtf ccp!?
9/24/2010,"looking like ccp is now after cash and lost their way to improving the gameplay and content.terrible idea, in respect of gameplay. great idea to make a quick buck."
9/24/2010,supported. stupid idea ccp.
9/24/2010,"the last two years in eve have been kinda 'meh' for me. a lot of broken promises and a lot of broken features. the dominion expansion probably was the worst. i was looking forward to everything it promised about sov changes and it opening the door for more people to get into 0.0 without having to become part of power blocks or renting and such. it in fact did nothing like that, actually the opposite happened. so for you to say no one will quit is a foolish statement.this whole plex thing, first the introduction of plex to help curb the issue with the illegal buying of isk with real money. i thought it was a good idea, but it should have stopped there. then they introduced the ability for plex to be able to be moved around. the sole reason for this, and this alone, was so plex could be blown up. why? so it would be free money for ccp. thats it. the only reason. soon you will be able to use plex to get free attribute remaps.the reason someone does a remap is so they train faster. what next? use plex to buy faction gear?there are several critical reasons why i came to eve:1. one server, no chasing the population around.2. when i blow **** up, i can take it. or they can, but you get the idea. a players ship exploding has meaning.3. you can do anything. none of this class stuff where you are only allowed to use/fly certain things.4. aside from the monthly subscription fee, real money would not give a player an advantage over other players. the game is a cold, dark and unforgiving place. that is nice, but this aspect has always been the even playing field. it is where no matter who you are, no matter what you do, no matter where you are in the world. here, is where we all are equal.this reply is far longer than i had anticipated, but those four critical things is what brought me to the game. those four things is what has kept playing this game for over 5 years at probably 30+ hours a week. i promise you this. if this happens, then number four will no longer apply to this game.now you can sit there and argue that there is no better mmo out there like eve so i wont leave till your blue in the face. even if this is true, it does not mean i have to subscribe. you can also argue that there is no way to keep real life money from affecting the game, but that is no reason to throw in the towel and have the attitude, ""well, if i can't prevent world hunger, there is no reason to try.""tl;dr: this goes live, i promise you i will quit the game. so lick my nuts mr laalt. no you can't have my stuff."
9/24/2010,"really? because i'm pretty sure i could buy a trillion isk and a half-dozen 50m-100m sp pilots off the bazaar if i were willing to spend enough money... probably not all at once, mind you.true, most people don't have $60,000 to spend on a game about internet spaceships, but some do. and it doesn't have to be to that extent."
9/24/2010,"no remaps for plex please.having remap once a year is huge advantage allready over the previous system where you had to custom tailor you toon from beginning to specific courier.you allready can go and buy highskilled toons from bazaar if you got the isk, so we dont really need plex for remaps anyways."

9/24/2010,wtf ccp??
9/24/2010,"updated the op, so there's less timing confusion."
9/24/2010,"oh man, these would be awesome."
9/24/2010,these are all great ideas and are dearly needed. the one idea i'm a little unsure about is the fuel pellet concept but it's not a bad approach.
9/24/2010,amazing ideas all. thumbs up.
9/24/2010,"definetly needed improvments.as someone that runs pos in highsec, limitations of pos are clear. structure management is pain, not to mention managing right to have those managed. control distances of stuctures, need to manually go and move stuff from hanger to manufacturing array, etc... come on we have drone technology nowdays, cant drones shuttle that stuff automaticly in pos? or can we atleast get links tehcnology that we have for reactions/moonmining? so assembly array can ask materials from hanger and deliver finished stuff to same hanger or different hanger, depending how you link them up.and definetly add those hours in fuel warnings. now i need to use my own simple php script for that."
9/24/2010,"the worst thing about a pos is if you have access to an sma you can take any ship in there. we need to either password ships, or give everyone an individual hangar rather than for instance the 7 tabs in a corp hangar.it is so easy for a corp member to steal anything if living in a wh as my corp does...... to my mind that is the most important thing to fix"
9/24/2010,"yeah, more roles, or indeed the ability to make roles and assign them different sections of pos to mess around with on your own would be awesome. also, please limit them to a per pos set and, for the love of god, give us some security in the sma other than assigning people a slot in a nearby cha to store their ships in..."
9/24/2010,"oh hey, support for myself!"
9/24/2010,another bomber pilot supporting aesthetically well oriented idea.
9/24/2010,"in terms of an fx and graphics buff i'd like to see the following;* randomized impact points over a model's hulla miss is a miss - so the damn beam should miss. not hit the exact same spot as if it was a wrecking shot. i'd also like to see differentiated impact effects for applied damage types and what they're hitting. shields should fizz and pop in a bubble around the ship, armor should flex and glow as it redirects the impact energy, and structure should flash and explode as it gets destroyed. * damage skinsas a ship gets more beat up, the hull should look like its taking damage. scratches appear on the paintwork and when things get really bad, superstructure jutting out. damage skins already exist for some models even - when you kill a supercap, you get a hulk. this would go well with-* wrecks that look like the ships they were from.bigger ships = more bits. want the melted cap consoles? look in the reactor section of the that apocalypse... want targeting computers? look in the upper section of the scorpion hull that broke off over there....much more varied and interesting than tractor. salvage. fail. fail. fail... conductive polymer fffuuuuuu~* sentry dronesi would actually like to see them shooting. not a tiny hint of a sparkle. i want to see bouncers spitting out tracer rounds, gardes mashing things at close range with their blaster plasma and wardens throwing rail slugs out to extreme ranges. not a badly scaled plane with a dumb texture map that shows up on the screen as a barely noticeable twinkle.* clouds, nebula effectslook awful, and just plain annoying. i'm sure there are better systems than using an oversized sprite for this effect by now.* more and varied props - increased interactivitycan we start being able to blow chunks out of asteroids and derelict stations now? how about live stations... how about watching that pos fracture and fly apart in a more physically correct manner rather than a big dumb boom.* warping through planetsmake a ship's warp trajectory follow a 3-point spline that avoids any celestial objects. instead of warping through a planet or station, the ship would follow an elegant curve. hell, if you wanted to be really clever you could even introduce some minor orbital mechanics (gravity etc.) to alter the warp speed slightly... more tactical options open up.* railgunslook weedy* blasterslook a bit weedy* did i mention railguns and blasters look weedy?* stations and capshipstextures are starting to look dated there, too"
9/24/2010,yes eve needs a real tutorial made new and from ground up it should warn people about hazards and it should include the faq's from all the hep channels and all that not as a wall of text everyone clicks away and then wonders what to do and how the hell to even move your ship....
9/24/2010,"i guess you missed the part where people are allowed to skip the tutorial if they so choose?there are twenty-year-old text muds  sandbox-y, skill-based, hardcore muds that make eve look like a repository for simpletons and chimps by comparison  that have tutorial areas.i support this idea. maybe it is theme-park-like, but it's worth a try."
9/24/2010,"the whole purpose of mmo's is the m part, multiplayer. if you want a single-player tutorial, then gtfo back to wow.i joined this game in 2007, the tutorial back then was utter garbage compared to what it is now. i learned almost all i know about eve from my first ceo (who, incidentally, i've flown with now for 4yrs). the point of the sandbox mmo is to encourage these types of interactions between older players and the new, incoming generation. this bolsters continued recruitment and training of new players by older corporations made up of ~bitter vets~ as well as the amazing thing known as ""human interaction.""as well, there is an enormous wealth of information on the game that is less than a google search away. the eve wiki has a great deal of articles that delve into the complexities of the game, and e-uni has some amazing learning videos on youtube.if anything, the tutorials only need to stress the importance of human interaction to being successful in the eve environment, not hold people's hands."
9/24/2010,"lykouleon:i think you misunderstood me, i did not state that i wanted the tutorial to be single player. in fact the starting cluster will be where every new player starts so it's going to be pretty crowded i think. the only thing i stated was that i wanted the starting and exit system to be instanced. but that was only for conveinience, and to remove the possibility of having multiple bucks at the same spot doing the same thing with 50 different players. of course this could be remade in a dead-space sort of way like other missions. you say that you joined in 2007 and have been active since then, thats great - i joined in the end of 2005 and have been playing back & forth. one thing to remember is that eve is a lot bigger and complex than it was a few years ago. not saying it wasnt complex then, but 2007 would have been the revelations expansion pack, and a lot more content has been added since then.i agree with you, eve has a lot of good information websites that are great for learning the game. however, it is not going to be read by anyone unless they are introduced to it in an interesting way. you need to make players want to read more information, and you can only achieve that by catching their interest in the first place.and its not like i'm suggesting they should be in this cluster for ages, i would say 7-10 days for an average player and maybe half of that if you like to play a lot. just to be able to breath for awhile and learn the basics before you get swarmed with thousands of different modules that goes for thousands of different playing styles."
9/24/2010,"lets face it, pi sucks. the idea is great, the interface sucks horribly. why? because you have to click several hundred times each time a deposit is exhuasted and the extractors need renewal.it is quite simple to fix this. simply add a drag box feature so multiple extractors can be selected and configured at the same time. it will not completely fix the pi interface, but i believe it will make pi much more manageable."

9/24/2010,signed
9/24/2010,"i like this. for most people of normal income any more than 2 characters doesn't make a whole lot of sense, since it's beyond most people's ability to operate 3+ clients at once and the majority of people (myself included) probably aren't to paying another $11-15 a month just for a training account.i pay for two accounts at the moment and won't go any higher than that... but ccp would be able to wring more money out of me if they did this, at no real cost to their bottom line.unless i get fed up with supercaps online bull**** and quit when none of it is fixed in incursion, of course."
9/24/2010,"i'm not sure i'd support this. i have a fantasy of eve without alts, but this would need massive gameplay changes.thus, i'm not fond of anything encouraging or simplifying the creation of alts.oh wai... i'm an alt too..."
9/24/2010,"i don't understand why you can only train one char to begin with. well, i can understand the financial reasons behind them, but why not just have one slot per account then?i have three slots, but not being able to train the other ones simultanously discourages me to use them all.some might make an argument relating with character sellers, but i'd rather be able to train 3 chars then to buy one.buying chars is for ""the rich"" anyhow. now training multiple chars is too."
9/24/2010,"supported.i can see how simple logic might lead people to the conclusion that ccp is losing money here. but think of the money they'd gain.simple economics, there would be some players that choose to use 1 or 2 (or 3) plexs on an account when they wouldn't purchase another account if that was the only option. they were at the margin, and they demand plex. they either buy it with cash or isk. either way, ccp gets money (and arguably more money than the other situation, the one we are in now, where your only choice is to buy another account)."
9/24/2010,"problem i have with ccp or anyone making this excuse (not saying that you specifically are) is that it is ccp's own fault if someone gets scammed for crystals. ccp never really decided to add a legitimately decent system for damaged/un-damaged crystals. plus ccp prides eve for having a system that allows for scamming and most of the playerbase understands that they can and probably will get scammed. it's not like eve would be an entirely different game if they allowed damaged crystals to be contracted tomorrow without adding a system showing that crystals are damaged.also, do people really make contracts where crystals are the main possession for trade? most pirate crystals can be bought/sold from the market iirc."
9/24/2010,"aside from the logistical issues caused by the extra data being transferred, it doesn't fit in with the eve shiptypes anyway. true, interceptors can move quickly and almost seem like fighters, but they're still large ships. all of the pilot-able ships in eve are stylized and made to function like navy ships, rather than as combat fighter craft. even the smallest ships are naval vessels. even if you added joystick functionality, they wouldn't fly like fighters. they'd continue to fly like frigates, battleships, etc. and won't respond with the sort of precision that a joystick would suggest."
9/24/2010,"well, true for the pod but a view for the crew so... i mean an inside view will be really cool to watch dogfights"
9/24/2010,"hiits seems that when ppl talk about pilots that dont do pvp they get the term carebear stuck to their name.wouldnt it be a much nicer too use the term fuzzy wuzzyregards, the lemmingswarm"
9/24/2010,asking ccp to change culture of rpg/mmo's is a complete waste of their time.your better off trolling somewhere else.and if you don't like the terminology... then don't act like it or ignore it.
9/24/2010,"a few years ago, the devs were talking about such a targeting system. they'd like this implemented, the first hp boost to the ships were aimed at providing longer fights partially for this project. (sorry, i'm too tired to find any valid link about that, as it was called ""subsystem targeting"", and since the release of t3, you get a ****load of results when you google it - but other old enough vets could confirm this)they still haven't found any suitable implementation yet, as nothing was to be heard about it for quite some time now.i support this idea for the core concept and remind the devs about it, but it needs some serious and thorough examination to prevent it from becoming some formal ""disable mobility, disable tanking, gank"" tryptic."
9/24/2010,"the last 3 people i have spoken to who have tried eve all said the same thing.well they didnt say the same thing exactly , but the gist of it was the same in each instance.they tried the game but found it too complicated and therefore gave up.eve allready has too many rules, and too many variable in combat.making eve even more complicated may be a bonus to older players to help keep the game interesting but it will also starve the game of new blood.also attacking prop/cap/targetting is the job of speciallist ships and modules.if you can do the same with dps they become rather pointless."
9/24/2010,"problem is, on a super cap, you don't want to destroy any modules, as the loot drop from a dead titan pays for the entire fleet op. less modules mean less loot. if you could shoot, say, a dramiel's mwd, then i could see a reason to target a module."
9/24/2010,"erm, this would increase the amount of information being sent and received by the server = more lag = bad."
9/24/2010,"i've been playing eve for only a few months now but i enjoy it from the previous dungeon-grinding game i used to play (you know what i'm talking about). i am, however, disappointed in the incentives for getting another person to play the game. sure 30 days is great and all, but that's kind of expected in a mmo now. not too long ago one of the other game companies released a recruit a friend bonus which gives triple experience for 90 days between 2 accounts. i'm sure ccp could think up something equivalent to this (50-100% skill training bonus for x days). anyway that's just my 2 cents."
9/24/2010,so you want to start a new rmt racket?oh please.... go back to wow where you came from.i'm seriously getting sick and tired of these noobs who think they can just bully their way into easy street.
9/24/2010,"no, that it has become 'standard' isn't good enough of a reason to accelerate training in a game where you don't gain the training based on how long you play the game ie every jump you make nets you 100 skill points. the only thing close in eve would be to double your bounties or something but seriously a free month for getting another player to signup is enough."
9/24/2010,"wow, the anger. i guess opinions aren't appreciated if they aren't about fixing lag or the ui. how am i bullying anyone again? i don't remember making any threats about quitting or pointless things like that."
9/24/2010,"don't play coy with us... it's very obvious what your up to.obvious stealth troll is obviouslet me break it down real easy for you.a: every time a foolish proposal such as yours (a repeat of the same old stupid whine) is made its done so from a number of obvious faults: lack of experience and they think they are experts on the subject already, lack of time put in and too lazy and tired of waiting while the majority of the population who have played eve far longer than you have (2 years plus here) who have put in many many days of training to get where they are don't take kindly to some noob who walks up here and thinks they deserve better by taking short cuts, didn't bother to research the subject before blowing said mouth off.b: didn't bother to take into account just how unique eve online is and then borrowing from an obvious game of which you came from (wow very likely) and then start equating things from it such as speed of xp gathering.c: ignoring experience by not talking to other pilots and getting input from them before broaching the idea.d: ignoring other failed posts in the past of the same subject matter and obviously discounting the volatile nature of daring to ask such a question.and last but not least... the most obvious fail point of them all!e: by invoking such an idea.... what's to stop a gang of guys from getting individual email accounts and then inviting them all together to start up a new racket...wait a few months... then sell the chars back at tons of money (or isk for that matter).rmt is something ccp want's to stop... not make worse.not that i don't mind seeing a total noob of an idiot buy a char with a dread/carrier/rorqual show up in low sec to get his butt blown up repeatedly... the point is still valid... some of us like the fact we invested many months of training to fly that nice shiny ship and mods... only to see a noob such as yourself invite a few friends to play eve and then suddenly you gain a ton of sp's with very very little effort.anger?your underestimating that anger.eve chars are like finely crafted pieces of wood... some of us are not so good as others... but all have one thing in common... it takes time... and i don't like it when someone gets ahead due to wealth that i don't possess or sheer social power thanks to an exploit that you propose.you didn't make a threat but your idea is the largest threat of them all.if you can't stand the time it takes to get anywhere in the game... then leave.the free 30 days bonus for getting someone to subscribe is wroth it imho.to change that is a total waste of time as its all to easy to get enough isk to buy a plex as it is.it's bad enough that ccp is toying with the idea to use plex to exchange for neural remaps... and that's ****ed alot of pilots off.gee i wonder why... maybe its due to the fact that some of us put a little time and effort into the game than most lazy noobs eh?"
9/24/2010,i'm fairly confident they already said they were doing this.
9/24/2010,"""[...]in all areas of space, high sec, low sec and zero sec, with the appropriate reward multipliers depending on where it is of course.[...]""dev-blog"
9/24/2010,if it's anything like missions then highsec fleets will pay too much and lowsec and nullsec ones too little. ccp needs to promise the people who play its game that it will do a better job at balancing risk vs reward this time.
9/24/2010,and incursion in high sec should never ever in any case be able to out isk lvl 4 missions because if that happens i guess we all can imagine what will happen then....no one will go to low sec even if it gives 4 times more reward....
9/24/2010,"why cant you just let them implement the feature first before you start complaining about what a crappy job they have done?they promise to balance highsec/lowsec/nullsec rewards. should they fail you have every right to complain about it afterwards but now... all you're basically doing is threaten the designers ""if you don't get it right this time i will [insert generic idle threat here]""i'm sure ccp is well aware of the stream of complaints they'll receive should the balancing not please the customers.just relax and let them do their work =)lax"
9/24/2010,imho if it reduces lag by a noticeable amount make it passive if not keep it active as it keeps a bit of variety
9/24/2010,thumbs up
9/24/2010,"devs claimed we had x amount of volume to fly to in system y when they talked about removing deep safspots.now i would like to propose that they actyally allow us to fly in all that volume in space.pick a direction, any direction. set warp distance, you get there +- few %. and hit warp.catch: no further then 20au from most distance object in solarsystem, measured from central star. as far as i know thats the same limit you can still make bookmarks fro safespots."
9/24/2010,"this feature already existed, during the begining of the game, a double click anywhere in space made you warp and drained your capacitor empty.can't remember why they removed this feature, but it was with rmr expansion, if i remember right.the limitation is now to 10au from the farest celestial of star.o7"
9/24/2010,making kills off a gate or station even harder to get?
9/24/2010,i do agree with the fact that it would make it possible to insta warp out of the gate cloak or from the station undock even without special bookmarksthus i would suggest to add a warp calibration timer of like 5-20 seconds and it also could empty all cap even if you don't warp at max rangealso i could even imagine a cool down after a free warp so it gets kind of impractical in direct combatand makes it easier for probers to get lock on someone warping randomly around the system.
9/24/2010,fully supported. i cant understand why this isn't possible now. possibly because it would make the artificial space barrier setup by ccp that more apparent.
9/24/2010,"supported in principle.another possibility is that a player can push a button, type in a set of destination coordinates, and if the coordinates are valid, then the ship needs to align to warp to the destination, and then stay aligned for 20 seconds before it can enter warp. being bumped out of alignment resets the timer."
9/24/2010,"plus 1 for hybrid rebalance. i can't use any other weapon system and it sucks. like someone said above, should i invest the 70+ days for lasers/projectiles? should i have too at all? each weapon system should/needs to be balanced to the other ones. a solution needs to be found."
9/24/2010,i want hybirds fixed to but i myself cant think of a good way to rebalance them with out making some hybird ships op. i mainly fly bs class ships it's been a very long time over 2 years or more that i fly anything smaller. so i know most hybird bs's come up lacking in some major way or another. but one mybe two will become op with most of the stuff i can think of.

9/24/2010,"there has not been a single council yet that has not had its work over shadowed by scandal and failure since its inception. so sorry if by looking at the history of the csm has turned me from, ""golly gee, those csm sure are my eheroes and are a true representation of the eve community!"" to, ""wow. for all that hype, they sure are ineffective.""/me looks the poster alt in the eye.i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your csm heroes are ineffective. either thru their own device, ccp's failure to properly get them the right tools to do the job, or a combination of both. an insane, i mean insane amount of players never come to the forums. never.the csm is ineffective. there is no arguing that. until they are able to represent the player base they never will be. i do not care if all of them spend 90 hours a week working their fingers to the bone. until ccp implements in game tools/whatever, that puts the csm more in tune with them (an in game browser window does not count ), they never will be remotely close to it.don't give me that crap because i didn't post in that thread it means i don't know what i am talking about. that thread got to fourteen pages over a week in assembly hall. i do not know how many are second post don't care. the thread on the plex in regards to plex allowing attribute remap hit twenty pages in twenty four hours or less. there is a reason why people have given up on the csm and the issues people have raised. they have voiced their opinion and have seen what happens. nothing happens or very little.seriously, 419 post on what should have been a major thread for a game that has a subscription base of what... 350 thousand give or take? what percentage of the player base is that? it is closer to 0% than 1%. that has got to be the most pathetic participation level i have ever heard of in regards to anything that has ever taken place in the history of... well,... anything. the only reason to remap your attributes is to train faster, thus having better skill points trained per hour. stop spinning things.so you are saying that it never crossed any ccp's mind that something like this would be highly controversial? don't be so naive to think they never thought about it. ccp knew what the csm would have said and chose not to run it by them to get some feedback. if ccp truly did not know this change would have negative reaction from the csm or the player base, well then that just shows you how out of touch they are with the csm. this is about money. which, from a business point of view, is a good move for the short term.the ultimate bottom line is the csm will always be pointless if there is no connection between the players and them in game."
9/24/2010,"ever think they (ccp) may have just put it straight on the test server so they could make sure the code works correctly, you know kinda like testing it?i think the csm is a useful tool, you just have to accept that its on ccps terms not ours. i'd rather have the gradually evolving and more effective csm we have now to give my feedback to and have it taken seriously than the old ways of 90 page forum threadnaughts full of trolling and off topic whining that get ignored. at the end of the day ccp choose what feedback to listen to and what proposals to implement so *****ing at the csm and claiming they're useless because ccp chose to do something you dont like without telling the csm first is ****ing stupid. how could they complain about something they werent told was going to happen, you expect them to be ****ing psychic or something?. its not their fault that ccps communication skills are on occasion a massive pile of ass."
9/24/2010,"oh, so just put it on the test server with no intentions to implement it? you know, just for the hell of it? what are you smoking man?at last, you finally are starting to see the problem ehh? without a real, in game mechanic that can properly connect the csm to the player base (in game web browser does not count), the csm or ccp will never come remotely close to being in touch with the player base. right now, the only real input they have is:- subscription paid: i like this!- unsubscribe: i don't like this!that is the only thing they have. that and the fraction of a fraction of the player base that post on the forums. that is a joke as far as ccp or csm being in tune with the player base. there needs to be some simple in game tool. something that is easy to use and very user friendly that can be managed by ccp and csm. something that is not a hassle to try and provide feedback and opinions on current issues. something that has up to date eve news and such things. a little tiny box and news column on the log in screen that they will see only once and delaying them from logging into the game is not cutting it.ccp, the csm have been tasked with the equivalent of climbing mt. everest in the 20th century and the equipment you have given them is a nail file, three feet of twine, mini pin-ball machine with no pin-ball and a plaid shirt with one sleeve missing to do it.so in closing, like i have said before, and i still stand by it. all csm counsels along with this one, are ineffective to do the job they need to do. the only time players have voiced the most opinions about something (and it still was a laughable turnout in comparison to the number of subscribers) was when it comes time to vote for the csm. at which point the candidates go to every major trade hub and spam convo and local trying to get votes. the csm should not have to spam local and spam convo every day about everything that needs to be addressed to get an even fraction of player feed back.now does any of this makes sense or am i being crazy here?"
9/24/2010,"there is csm public channel and evemail. both of those give direct access to csms. if you have something else in mind more ambitious than that, by all means share your ideas--maybe as a proposal in the assembly hall so csm can champion it if it seems feasible. don't forget that csm is a community endeavor. so in my view, there is some obligation on the part of the community to step up and participate/contribute in meaningful ways.i didn't--and don't--do that. ever. so please don't group all of us in a blanket statement describing behaviors that we don't all engage in."
9/24/2010,"this is my main. feel free to contact my ceo, join #excellence on irc and compare my hostmask with the other people who come and go regularly, or ask herschel (who has also been quite active in the csm threads, even ran twice for it!). but hey, believe what you will :tinfoil:maybe previous csm iterations have had growing pains. would you attribute the actions of one as speaking for the future? i hope not. with change comes uncertainty and hesitation. it's only through determination and hard work that your concerns can be quashed. it takes time and it takes patience. it's not an excuse. no, i'm not happy about the crap that has done down before either but i'm not giving up that easily.so the challenge you've just identified is very simple: increasing player feedback/participation. you're quick to dismiss csm efforts as ineffective: have you put any thought into suggestions on what you believe would increase feedback?what would you prefer? ccp and the csm have posted quite clearly what's upcoming; would you be willing to give them a chance to prove to us that what has been described will now happen? yes, there have been challenges in the past to get ccp to listen and act. that was then. they're moving forward; will you join the celebration or sit on the sidelines moping?why not? we're here to have a debate. it only seems appropriate that criticism is matched with answers. i haven't implied that those who don't post know nothing; those are your words. what bothers me is that those who cry loudest are strangely absent when the call for help goes out. there must be a logical reason beyond ""because nothing will happen"". i believe dierdra commented that discussion is under way with ccp to determine what is happening, and he also clearly indicated that the csm does not support the idea. it's a four day old issue; are you unwilling to give time to hear back from ccp before abandoning hope? call a spade a spade, not a sharp instrument with which to dig. in other words, the issue is the ability to use a plex for remaps, which have a secondary effect. it's hard enough following the changes as it is; sorry if keeping the facts straight is construed as ""spinning"". it's obfuscation and manipulation that leads to spinning my friend. i dislike when others choose to say things which are untrue. if you're going to argue, then argue the truth. of course it's controversial... of course the csm wouldn't support it, and of course they wouldn't be told. that's my assumption, however, as it is yours. again, wait for ccp's official comment on it. we all know that silence would speak the loudest; shall we see what happens?join csm public, in-game. there you go."
9/24/2010,"been there and done that. that channel is a ghost town. most i ever saw in it was twenty people give or take at its peak. hell, lets be super generous here. lets say there was fifty people in it at all times! the average users logged in is about thirty thousand! what percentage of thirty thousand is fifty people?again, not the right tool to do the job needed. it is ineffective is an understatement.i have already described what is needed. you can't honestly tell me that paltry player made channel and mailing list is an accurate in game tool to be in tune with the players? please, let any csm current or past tell me that that, meets the needs just fine???if that was the case, then i apologize for generalizing you. the only think i remember the most during that time was local spaming and convos spamming linking personal websites about each candidate and asking for votes. you didn't apparently, but a majority of the candidates did no? as annoying as it was, that time is the most interaction with the csm the whole time. what was the percentage of active accounts that voted based on total active subscriptions at that time? anyone know?"
9/24/2010,"you walk up to a panel. there is a red button. above the button is a label that says, ""sandwich"". you push the button and a little door opens and an empty plate is inside. the door closes. you push the button again, and the door opens. again, an empty plate. you repeat this process three more times. every time is is the same empty plate.now your friend walks in and sees the panel with the red button. he then asks you, ""so if i push this red button, a sandwich comes out the little door right?""what do you tell your friend will happen when he pushes the button based on your experience with it?of course but i am sure the csm has said to ccp's face a slew of ideas on what they need. there has also been several times before me people have mentioned it.i clicked the link and saw the thread and wondered when this thread was made and how did i miss it. i am being honest here. i consider myself somewhat of a forum warrior, not as 1337 as others of course. i simply don't know how i missed it. maybe because when i did look at assembly hall, at that time it was buried below the front page. many people who read the forums never go past the first page in a thread, much less the second. you can call me lazy if you want, but for someone like me who reads and post the forums missed it, what does that tell you about the majority of the eve community? take the player base, then take the small percentage of those who go to the forums, then take that percentage and get another percentage of those who frequently visit assembly hall, then take a percentage of that for those who by chance, happen to see that thread at that time on the first page. this reply is getting long but you get the idea. that in combination with some other factors probably is why there is such are see why it got such little feed back on a thread nope. there should have been a dev blog that was release before this hit the test server and players find out on their own.your starting to lose me here but this is basically what the change means: if i got the real money, i can have a max attribute character the entire time it is training. in every category. in every skill."
9/24/2010,"the thing is marconus as far as i can see your entire beef is based on the issue of poor communication from ccp correct?at teh risk of repeating myself you do realise thats something the csm has absolutely no control over or ability to influence?. all they can do is draw attention to it when they feel it is lacking, which is something they've been doing repeatedly on every occasion its become a serious issue. its then up to ccp to make the adjustments so flaming out on the csm seems really pointless.yes the issues with communication do mean the csm isnt as effective as it otherwise could be but that doesnt make them useless, they do the best they can with the tools they have."
9/24/2010,"can ye high and mighty csm tools please wake the **** up and realize rage against the new plex system is a complete waste of your time? did you consider that some players don't pay for a dozen accounts or plex as many accounts, but might pay for a remapping service instead? what harm is this doing to you the bitter vet? none. what harm is it doing to them, the noob with more dollars than sense? none. people with money will train faster?they already do it with extra accounts. this is not new.so please, whenever you feel the need to beat ccp over the head for this, take a deep breath... count the number of alts you have... then post about one of the hundred thousand more relavent issues to this game that you should be supporting, you prats!"
9/24/2010,"totally agree here. ccp doesn't give a rat's ass what the csm says, in the end.yeah, we considered it, and rightly dismissed it as idiotic and game-breaking.this makes it so that someone who is rich irl can just buy a crapton of plexes to train faster than everyone else. while one of the primary determinants in this game is player skill rather than character skill, accelerated training times for people who are richer irl rather than skilled at this game would pretty much ruin everything. want to fly a supercarrier but it'll take a year to train all the skills for it? buy some plexes. want to fly a pimped marauder with level 5 pulse laser specialization and cloaking 5? buy some plexes. see above.don't confuse the two concepts, oh logic god. that's training two different characters at once. both of those characters gain exp at pretty much the same rate. buying a plex and using it to remap one makes it gain skillpoints faster. same goes for straight up skillpoint acceleration. here's the fundamental part where you and i disagree: skillpoint acceleration for rl cash ruins the game."
9/24/2010,the initial response was fine despite being disappointing.your response is annoying and pointless. do you really feel that sansha capitals ships are more urgent?go away.
9/24/2010,csm did not request sansha capitals and argued strongly against a new pve feature at the summit (requesting that ccp spend more time on fixing various things).everything csm requested from ccp is on the wiki.
9/24/2010,"yeah thats fine td.i am fully capable of reading...and was quite satisifed if not thrilled with the update.dierdra doing some ""postin for the sake of postin"" added nothing and by suggesting the ""urgent things"" were perhaps in he/she/its hands to influence annoyed the **** out of me.anyway....never mind. no point beating head against ccp wall of goof when 90+ thread of ""commitment to excellence"" and various other issues are ignored in favor of pve content in a pvp-centric game.oh wait...new ship class...salvager. yeah. whatever. all that artist time, coding time, dev time, test time (one hopes) devoted to some crappy pve ship that already has a cheap useful counterpart ingame (i.e. dessies...since those are ignored too lol) as opposed to the short amount of time and resources required to simply reduce the amount of fuel consumed by the bobs portal so it doesn't require a hauler? and maybe a slight increase in jump range?seriously....who do ccp think they are fooling here? bleah. pointless rant over. enjoy your new pve content."
9/24/2010,"if it's any consolation, i know how you feel. pretty much there, myself. i've had that black ops thread bookmarked and have been watching it for a long time, trying to decide best next move as regards it. yeah, sure, black ops got a tiny bit of love a long time ago (presumably in response to this csm issue) but i'm with you that they need a bit more love in order to be able to justify their cost and be most effective. thanks for pushing this issue forward into the attention sphere again. with everything that is going on + rl, it's easy for things to slip through the cracks. after i get my making low sec matter project kick-off stuff done this weekend, i'll spend some time reviewing that thread and talk with other csms about possible next steps to get some attention on black ops again.alas, i see you're no longer in veto. man, i hardly got to know ya."
9/24/2010,"low sec is dire. wormholes on the other hand are what make eve unpredictable, enjoyable, and fun.but the point of this particular thread was simply to highlight a long ignored issue dealing with what can be described as ""end-game"" content for those pewpew pilots that cordially detest capital proliferation and are more interested in enhancing the abilities of small groups to play on an equal footing where skill>blob.and the utter stupidity of having a ship as skill intensive as a bobs requiring a damned hauler alt to fuel the covert bridge when a titan can cheerfully bridge hundreds of blobby f1-f8 headrolling bs across rather large distances by comparison without similar logistic support is just wrong...and easily/quickly fixed if ccp would make the effort to do so. ccp has dropped the ball. end of.**edit**forgot to say enjoy veto. plenty of fine pilots there.also...want a simple solution to nullsec? get rid of it. make all current losec into appropriate region npc nullsec, get rid of stupid sentry's and the hand-holding 15-minute sin bin, and provide the same pve possibilities and spawns that nullsec residents currently have (obviously minus the sov-boosting junk).yeah you have probably heard the above before...and all the phoney-lolpirates worried about the implants in their head will **** right off to high sec crying and whining..but anything else is just patching over a rather silly training wheel that has no place in the game anymore.have fun.**edit**haha congrats on lifting ""oldest veto pilot"" by a country mile"
9/24/2010,"yeah, must admit, wormholes are my favorite feature of eve.ha as for ""oldest by a country mile""...that's your fault. it was only a hop, skip, and a jump before you left, mister."
9/24/2010,"actually there's a lot that wasn't said by dierdra that would probably change your mind a bit (and i'll probably catch some crap for posting about it) but without that 'insider' info, their post does read a bit like ""posting to post""...dierdra is a director of the 'blob noob corp' eve uni. most members last about 2-7 months then move on into player corporations across all aspects of eve game play. some, like me, last a year or more and have some decent skills. we help out with various things but there are few classes available for characters our ""age""/sp level.there are roughly a hundred of us ""yearling"" types around (like 1500 members or so total -- it fluctuates a bit -- so we're a ""fraction"" of the corporation)...'the fan' didn't mention that about 2 months ago they started bringing in guest lecturers on black ops hot-drops and have been working at arranging practice runs for those of us with the skills to do these things. many didn't/don't have the skills for this so adjusted their training plans ""to catch the next class"". the topic sparked a lot of interest by many of us more senior types.the community support for this issue is thin. you're ticked at the priority being towards 'more popular' fixes but backing more popular fixes is what a csm is supposed to do -- irrespective of their own wants. dierdra is working on getting more players active with this area which, in turn, will increase support for the issue, which can/will raise it's priority. not as a csm but as a player/director of a corporation, interacting with other players in-game.as i said at the start, i'll probably catch some flack for talking about this in a public forum but i figured you should get a bit more info before assessing them as just 'posting to post' -- they've been working on this issue for months and will be a few more months helping train on the tactics associated with the use of black ops ships while convincing others of their potential.ps: if you think this is 'sucking up' you don't know the uni. i'll be lucky not to end up in 1 officer's corpse collection for talking out of turn like this. (one has 2 full station containers of corpses -- we don't ask why nor what he does with all those corpses... incarna might have a macabre aspect to it.)"
9/24/2010,delilah wild it is clear to me that you have little pvp/low sec experience. i can see that you are attempting to arbitrate a problem you perceive exists because you see people complaining about a common theme.there is reason that low sec attracts attention. it is simply lack of use. balance is not the issue. the possibility of hot drops is known to all but the most naive of cap pilots. it is an understandable risk. i have personally haven't seen small gang pvp deterred by capital ships. my experience is that low sec is still the place to go for small gang warfare. super caps overpowered? they might be although im personally not going to leap onto that bandwagon. i feel that when the dreadnoughts tracking was nerfed ccp removed the main weapon that could be used to counter super capital fleets. i feel that this was a mistake. despite what you may feel super capitals arent actually that common in low sec. the super capital issue is more relevant to 0.0 where their use directly impacts the major alliances.finnagain zero can you just calm down?
9/24/2010,"hello again violentuk, perhaps a tad more experience than you think. that said, i'm floating ideas and not trying to arbitrate anything. that is what this thread is about. you may be right about the caps and supercaps, and i'll keep an open mind on the issue. cheers, delilahfriendsofeve.wordpress.com"
9/24/2010,"figured out how to post with that ""experienced, lowsec pvp alt"" yet? because it really does exist, right? right?oh, and: allow me to cut that noise a bit early. delilah's pretty much constant trolling should be called out. if you want to pretend that there's something not ""calm"" about calmly pointing out any of the times where delilah (yet again) trolls in order to argue for ways to nerf pvp, that's your call. but don't fool yourself. she's not accidentally arguing to nerf pvp because people happen to be talking about it. she's arguing for the professional victim party so that ccp can nerf pvp (which is ""griefing"" in her narrative) and pretending to be a pvper in order to sell her trolling. don't believe me? one of her favorite trolls on this subject is to suggest a drastic nerf for pvp (like her above suggestion that any capitals in 0.4 space should be concorded), then claim that it's not about nerfing pvp but ""balancing"" the game and ""making it better for everybody"" and then she pretends to be all about pvping, herself. do you think she's ever going to post with that pvp account? because she has 9 kills on the one she trolls with, and the last kill was about a year and a half ago. if you think i'm overreacting, maybe you can find that pvp account of hers? or admit that, yah, she's trolling."
9/24/2010,"i have to tell you, belloch, i think you have a real future as a motivational speaker..."
9/24/2010,"so i've been a member of the csm 1 1/2 times. i ran based on this position. the csm does at least three very important things and is expected to do something it will never succeed at doing.what the csm does very well.1. the csm is the players oversight organizations when major in game scandals occur. they can speak to ccp under nda and examine evidence provided by ccp to make sure there is never another ccp employee involved scandal ever again. they are intended to keep ccp ""honest"". some folks might say that ccp could just ""bake"" what they show the csm but i maintain the csm's job would be to ask the tough questions of ccp to make sure everything is handled on the ""up and up"". so far the csm has shown it can be very effective in this role.2. the csm can be a ""sounding board"". when ccp is thinking about features they can spend time with the csm to get detailed feedback about potential new ideas. if the ideas really seem to be a poor fit for the future of eve the csm can change ccp's mind. in at least one case i know of the csm kept a very questionable feature from ever being part of eve. the csm is also able to interact with ccp in an open manner where anything can be discussed (because of the nda) to ""brainstorm"". this is very valuable to the players in eve, because in theory the players have elected csm members that would ""think"" like the players that elected them do.3. the csm can be thought leaders. the csm during their interactions and conversations with ccp can affect the way ccp is thinking about taking eve into the future. the csm can absolutely change how ccp evolves eve with their direct interactions with the developers and designers of eve. these interactions often can happen outside the ""formal"" csm sessions and can happen over a meal or a beer in iceland. basically the csm gets facetime with the developers and designers that players never get. during those interactions the csm can help evolve eve in the directions that represents the views of the csm support base.what the csm is not ever going to be good at.the csm will never be the eve feature fairies. i hate the current focus on very specific issue or game design elements from the forums to ccp to become a ""feature"" in a backlog. that has failed and will continue to fail. i'd make the case that every ""feature"" someone claims got into the feature backlog from the csm would have made it there anyways.why would i say this? simple, eve has dozens of folks that work full time on the future of eve. they have information and visions in place that have been in place for some time. they are professional game developers and designers. it is their job to ""design"" eve. they read the forums and the csm isn't adding any value bring a feature idea from the forums to ccp. sadly, i think the csm has shot themselves in the foot and reduced their credibility by making it seem that this ""read the forums and be the feature fairies of eve"" their primary purpose. this is why it seems like the csm has had no real affect on the planned features in eve. csm need to think ""big picture"".simply put, the csm is excellent at keeping ccp ""honest"" when scandals occur. i also think they can be fantastic at helping direct the future direction of eve by having ""bigger picture"" discussions and brainstorming sessions with the devlopers and designers of eve. it's true that occasionly the csm might find some ""low hanging fruit"" specific game changes that can get put in the pipeline, but to focus on detailed new features or very specific changes in the way eve currently works if a waste the csm's and ccp's time.ccp has full time designers already with strong visions for the future of eve that know how eve is built. they can be swayed but the intertia of the details of their plans can't be overcome in 3 day meetings a couple times a year and a spreadsheet or two of 3 line feature requests from a player organization.issler"
9/24/2010,"if they aren't contributing to content, there is little reason to travel to iceland (other than it provides an incentive to convince players to join csm).i kind of like the idea of csm helping ccp identify which issues are most important to players. i agree though, pre-csm, ccp often successfully data mined the forums for some good features/issues/solutions."
9/24/2010,"until the perception of lowsec being fair certitude of loss is gotten rid of, nothing will really change. a bar of gold in the bottom of a vat of acid... you aren't finding many that'll try and grab for it no matter how much you feel it's worth -- the idea of the loss will outweigh the potential gains.lowsec already has some rather sizable advantages pve wise over highsec -- people just aren't into the downside of trying for those benefits.figure out how to change the belief that lowsec is just too dangerous and folks will go there. until then... that bar of gold in the bottom of a vat of acid comes to mind -- people believe it's just too dangerous and such beliefs will be hard to change."
9/24/2010,im not convinced that the perceived problem with low sec is really a problem with low sec itself. low sec should feel like a dangerous or possibly foolhardy venture for someone who doesnt know what to expect. for players with experience in low sec they are aware of what the risks are and what to expect. low sec is balanced in my opinion. why do people feel that the risk is too great? here is where i fear the problem may be outside of low sec space. this may sound like an insanely obvious comment but if you are not in low sec space you are either in 0.0 or high sec right? one possibility is that you may be in high sec space trying your best to earn enough isk for a shiny new ship? for many pilots it will take many many hours to earn enough isk for a ship to go to low sec. every high sec nerf that reduces pilots income will affect the next available opportunity for many pilots to go to low sec. i really dont feel that nerfing high security space is going to work at all. if anything a high sec income boost could potentially make ships more affordable to lose and potentially increase the likelihood of players taking what they feel is a risk in low sec. now we all know that it isnt quite as simple as that. pilots that are risk adverse will continue to be risk adverse. perhaps not in all cases but for many. im sure there are pilots out there who would love to go to low sec but they feel that the isk loss to them would be simply too high to risk before they have had time to fully understand what to expect.so am i suggesting a possible remedy for this situation? no. i would like people to consider what could cause players not to risk a low sec venture.
9/24/2010,"i don't remember being in the same corp as you, and your name doesn't even ring a bell. maybe you are that type of player that people quickly forget."
9/24/2010,"yes it does. but making 250 people read it before they ask the bloody question in fleetchat has been proved over and over again as impossible. shouldn't be that hard to code so that the motd and the fleetfinder advert are the same, no?"
9/24/2010,or you just point them to the fleet finder when they ask? after a while they will learn it. (hopefully)
9/25/2010,it's stupid how long this has been being asked for and that it's still not announced.
9/25/2010,/signedthis needs to be recognized.
9/25/2010,"personally, i think to be in line with other covert-style ships, blops should get a bonus to their racial ewar instead of useless things like velocity and agility, along with other improvements (less mass, for one, reduced fuel use, longer range (supposed to go behind enemy lines, not two jumps away...), actual t2 resists, better fitting, etc.)the widow is fine, for bonuses at least, but it would make sense to give the sin a point range bonus, the panther a web range bonus, and the redeemer a neut transfer bonus. this would be consistent with the other covert/recon ships for each race.it's a bit silly to compare tanking and offensive ability to their t1 counterparts, since blops ships aren't meant to be effective in straight-up combat, but they need a serious boost to mobility, fitting, and bonuses."
9/25/2010,supported. i still dream of courier contracts in which you can offer transport space on a route which others can fill up until a certain deadline.
9/25/2010,csm should deffinetly look into this!
9/25/2010,"hmm... altho this is a joke thread it highlights an interesting question: how much sexualized content eve needs, if at all. from the incarna pix the art department has clearly chosen to not avoid emphasizing gender features and ""exotic"" clothing. i wouldn't mind nudity at all (hell, i'm all for making this game 18+), but i don't know how the game would benefit from it. sure, scifi red light districts realism and all, maybe pixel ****, but then what? its definitely not the feature that would make eve complete. also, we don't know how much content we'll get with incarna, but it would be hilarious in a bad way if all we had in stations were stores, bars and strip clubs/brothels.ah yes, and about futa: there are dozens of other (and more frequent) sexual orientations, so i don't get why that is the (only) one you're pushing, other than your probable personal interest for it."
9/25/2010,this
9/25/2010,props for sticking it out dav. good luck with your proposal.
9/25/2010,"i support this topic. as other have stated, since gallente gets a damage bonus no matter what ammo is loaded along with minmatar and amarr, the caldari deserve to get a straight missile bonus regardless of the damage type since this is their main weapon type. keep the damage bonuses for the other races in the game though."
9/25/2010,"i know you not trying to cahnge missiles to something more like guns, i actually said changing the missile kinetic bonus to something else wont improve any of the bad caldari missile boats as they still wont be able to fit there weapons, a tank and mwd(for example the caracal wont be improved really as you cant fit hams or hmls with a tank and mwd without several fitting mods)"
9/25/2010,<<the 5% to kinetic missile damage per skill level damage bonus that applys to the following ships is a poor bonus and should be replaced with a 5% per level damage or 5% per level r.o.f. bonus like the other races get on there ships.>>totally support this topic and i feel that the proposed replacement bonuses are fair.
9/25/2010,"i think the game needs a way to remap your skill!!i don't know if this has been up yet by anyone, i only got threw about 5 pages of this section of the forums.you can limit it to once a year and make it cost a lot of money, not to mention the loss of skill books already learned and the purchase of the new ones would make you really have to think hard about it.i think it would help old players as well as the new ones.it would help new players who get a few months into the game fix some of the mistakes they made when they didn't know what they were doing. and some of the older players who just want to switch up game play styles ( fly different races, switch roles to a more pvp game play from an industrial or w/e)i think it might take the sting out of changes that happen to your race that don't turn out to be so good. instead of being stuck with it for a year or 2 till the problem gets looked at and addressed. the option to switch these things could cut down on a lot of the omg!! fix my race posts. and help the guys at ccp spot problems when they see everyone switching from certain races to others.i think the more customizations you can do to your character ( without having to retrain for a year or two)is a great idea and keeps things fresh and fun.lets people play the game the way they want to.i know it would be really hard to implement, and a lot of work but if we start rumbling about it now and don't let the issue die i could see it happening.good thing to run on for any of you guys up for re-election. you'd get my vote and many others i'd guess."
9/25/2010,"no we really dont need that, instant training for the current fotm wont help the game."
9/25/2010,"this has been suggested several times before. oddly enough, each one suggesting seems to think that this is the first time such an idea has ever been brought up.responses are fairly routine by now.no, no instant re-spec for fotm for you."
9/25/2010,"loling at all the fossils in here with 3-4 accounts saying this will somehow turn the eve into wow.being free from any defined career path is one of the main things that separate eve from lesser mmos. being able to compete with far older and more experienced characters is another.learning skills and attributes in general encourage specialization and have led to our current situation of having every min-maxing grognard in eve thinking it necessary to have a zillion accounts to experience every nuance eve has to offer.furthermore, learning skills only serve to broaden the already massive rift between old and new players, who have no hope of catching up anyway, regardless of learning skills.specialization is for insects. learning skills run against the spirit of eve."
9/25/2010,"part 1 of 2.there have been several threads regarding learning skills. most have included some very good arguments both for their removal and for their being left in the game.this post does not concern itself with either opinion camp. it is a consideration of the following:if ccp believes that the 'potential new player perception' of the learning skills mechanic discourages new players, and if ccp wishes to address that perception directly, here is a possible method. this method focuses on the actual problem. the problem is not the learning skill system. the problem is the waiting time that new players perceive is necessary to become competent players.i assign no ""right"" or ""wrong"" to the perception. the purpose of this post is not to judge, but to suggest a solution. the solution is called ""taking them out, by leaving them in"".premises, based upon previous threads and from reading ccp dev blogs about resource allocation:(1) the method should not involve a huge commitment of programmer resources. ccp has already indicated that they have many teams working on many other items. therefore, it should involve existing mechanics and tech, as much as possible.(2) the method should not reduce player choice or force players into a ""cookie cutter"" or ""one way to win"" mode.(3) new players should be encouraged to become knowledgable about skill choices before they have invested a huge amount of time or skillpoints.(4) simple removal of the learning skill system might be considered by many players of longtime duration to have a high impact on the benefits that they accrued by investing time and skill points in the old system. new players should not just get something ""for free"" that older ones did not.suggestion, if ccp is considering doing this at all:(1) on the inception date of the new ""patch"", all players currently playing eve online will receive a device capable of adding skill points (not time, but points) to skills. ccp already has such a device as evidenced by the 100 000 sp ""skill stick"". the amount will be discussed below. it is up to the csm and ccp to decide whether this will be one stick per account, or one stick per trained character on the account.(2) starting immediately after this event, any new character in eve that ""graduates"" from the full set of instructional tutorials put in place by ccp, will then receive an identical ""skill stick"". the hope is that experiencing all of the tutorials will at least give completely new players some ideas of the very many possibilities for careers, income and entertainment in eve. there are already ""graduation"" flags in the game, so this should not be hard to flag either. a new tutorial, explaining the significance of the learning skills, is recommended.(3) the current learning skill system will be left in place exactly as it is.the ""free"" skill point amount is suggested to be around 3 000 000 (3 million) sp. the player is still completely free as to how and where the points are spent. the choice will then be: whether to make an immediate entry into one or more skill paths, or whether to spend some or all of the points on learning skills. the decisions and the potential for ""right"" or ""wrong"" choices will still be there. but for those new players that feel that they do not wish to lag behind over the long term, they may make the decision to favour learning skills instead of immediate gain. or, they may decide to favour immediate gain instead, in one quick decision.(continued in part 2.)"
9/25/2010,"part 2 of 2.in other words, this suggestion does not change the fundamental game mechanic at all, but removes the initial ""play time lag""-- if, and only if, the player wishes to take learning skills.rationale: 3 000 000 sp is not enough to ""max out"" all the learning skills, but it is enough to complete a large portion of them. the possible outcomes will then be:(1) existing player with maximum learning skills: 3 000 000 sp to spend on current plan or ""off-plan"" skills.(2) existing player with some, but not all learning skills. apportion the points as above, or use some to further your learning skills, if you now think that is worthwhile.(3) existing player with no learning skills, or new player with none: decide if you wish to increase your long term learning rate, or have a fair number of immediately useful skills, or a combination of the two-- just like everyone else had to decide before.there is, of course, still a ""negative impact"" for people that maximized their learning skills early on-- 3 000 000 sp are not as impressive if you already have 60 000 000, whereas they seem like a gift of the aesir if you have very few sp. however, it should be noted that the ""younger"" folks still have exactly the same conundrum as the ""older"" ones did. they can get into that shiny ship and maybe have a couple of income skills, or they can get the learning out of the way, but not have the instant gratification.at that point, it becomes a choice, not whether or not to play eve, but how to play it. the entry barrier is gone, but not the decision.this suggestion could be tweaked and massaged a number of ways (including throwing it out entirely), but if there actually is a problem with a ""learning skills barrier"", then it is my hope that this suggestion addresses the problem without being unduly hurtful to any particular camp in the game, either the ""haves"" or the ""have-nots"".it is not my intent to preach or to be hurtful, but simply to suggest what i hope is a ""clean"" and simple method, if ccp is actually considering the change. if they are not, i have wasted my time and, more sadly, yours, reader-- in which case, sorry."
9/25/2010,i'd like to use this feature.however everytime i did i'd feel i was cheating and breaking the game by paying cash for skillpoints.
9/25/2010,"strongly against this feature.if ccp feels remaps need to be more frequent, then do so, do not attach it to plex.on the other hand, if there was a ""plex for my favourite bug/feature/peeve getting development time"" program..."
9/25/2010,wtf ccp?
9/25/2010,:ccp:
9/25/2010,"i'm not afraid to say it but, money has never been a problem with me. people use money to gain an advantage in real life all the time. there is no reason it should be any different in a game. i am looking forward to training faster no mater what skill i pick.hate me if you want but just because you were lazy in life should not bring me down to you level in a game. if you think that this gives rich people an advantage then i have this to say:get a real job then losers!"
9/25/2010,"plex for 100% training speed bonus please!btw i don't want to compete with you by money for a game, loser.because real life losers always spend alots of money in game to gain the confidence they can't get from real life."
9/25/2010,i dont like anything exchange with 30d plex
9/25/2010,"not supported. i can see why some people might want to oppose this idea as a point of principle, but this is only a very small step towards a micro-transaction enviroment and has very little direct effect on gameplay. compared to the other advantages already on offer to people who want to trade $ for isk via plex, this is very minor. the only people at a (very slight) disadvantage here are those who can't spare enough isk or $ for extra plex, and who don't have 1 year skill plans.in fact, i would quite like to see the use of plex extended to cover more account services - character transfer, portrait swap - not to mention pizza."
9/25/2010,"anyone feells happy how ccp is shooting it-self in the foot , for a short term gains ?"
9/25/2010,i support this man !
9/25/2010,"wtf ccp?!stop trying to slip things like this past the players, ffs."
9/25/2010,i don't want allow plex's for extra neural remaps.
9/25/2010,no to remap for plex instantly!but support remap for free by every six months!!!
9/25/2010,rmt
9/25/2010,"i'd have to agree there, unfortunately. it's definitely a move in the wrong direction in an attempt to create more revenue from the game."
9/25/2010,"exactly.before this change: player buys plex from ccp, player trades plex for isk to buy shinies / character / whatever. ultimately, someone uses the plex for gametime. end result: ccp has to offer 1 month of game time, no matter who gets the plex in the end.after this change: player buys plex from ccp, uses it for a remap. end result: ccp does not have to offer 1 month of game time. economy now has an endless plex sink. broken economy.wtf ccp?"
9/25/2010,"amazing isn't it.... it's like that department is run by someone that can talk bull**** really well.his fanfest video showed his ability to ignore the outside would and dictate his unique view.how he managed to convince them to go in the complete wrong direction, and then managed to ignore everyone when they pointed at the glaring mistakes...... and is still employed..... that guys got it made!actually the funniest part is how when deciding on the 300 limit they did an sql query to tell them,""how many players have over 300 contacts?"" and found that ""this will only effect 1% of players"".they then decided that 1% with over 300 contacts was inconsequential and those 1% wouldn't matter.did they not also read the 1% rule when they were looking into social networks? 1% are the content creators, the hubs, these people with their large contact were key.now with contacts mattering so little and no one needing very many of them, surely no one needs to categoise their contacts. it's almost ******ed thinking."
9/25/2010,"you make a good case.the control tower should definitely present an interface to interact with all the anchored modules at the pos. territory control and resource exploitation is so core to eve's gameplay. the task of controlling poses should be welcomed, not abhorred.more roles. more roles. more roles."
9/25/2010,"well, ccp can always make another skill for that (that should require anchoring v ... or starbase defence management v )"
9/25/2010,"i have updated the opening post to list most of the suggestions made so far. my current plan is to continue this discussion for another 2 weeks or so, then we will do a prioritization crowdsourcing, followed by a csm proposal at the end of october.my thanks to everyone who has contributed so far."
9/25/2010,"another thing that should be easy to implement: on the processes > production screen (where you see moon reactions), create an indicator that says ""everything linked properly"" or ""reactor output not linked"". with the linking interface as it is (it could use a redesign tbh, but that's way more work), this is sometimes not so easy to tell when you are running multiple reactions and mining from the same pos."

9/25/2010,"recently i lost a ship in what could be said was a noobish move. noobish or not, a game mechanic was used that i had never seen before and was defiantly not intended to be used as a combat tactic in game.i set up a ship in jita and undock. grab a bait can for a tank test, and eventually the guy starts into me. i tank it for a bit and the guy sends a fleet inv. i accept to chat with him (this was the noobish bit) and we chat while he shoots me. after a bit he starts nueting me and his corp mate in a vindi undocks and shoots me as well. i tank for a bit then click dock. nothing happened?? i check no aggro, i click dock again still with nothing happening. i spam dock a bit then die.turns out the baiting toon had been swapping my fleet position repeatedly to constantly update my session change timer and keep me stuck outside the station.the fleet mechanics where never meant to stop a person from docking during combat. the ""smack talk"" function is always there after joining fleet but was certainly not made to allow someone to move you from spot to spot in a fleet to stop you from ever docking; which is exactly what was done to me.the ""smack talk"" function works as session change timer as far as i understand it. the point of session change timer as im aware is to stop players from becoming stuck. this guy used it specifically to get me stuck. the fleet position change was certainly never meant to be a game mechanic to be used by someone trying to kill you by keeping you undocked. isnt that the very definition of an exploit? to use a game mechanic that was never meant for a certain use to gain an advantage???i was told since i joined fleet there will be no action taken by ccp. regardless of whether or not i joined fleet, a game is being used in a way that was deffo not intended.thoughts / comments please"
9/25/2010,"yes, i'd call it an exploit. but it's easy to avoid, so no biggie.ofc the whole session timer concept should be reworked, but thats something different..."
9/25/2010,"quoting for when he edits it after people make fun of him... can we get this moved to c&p mods, please. thanks"
9/25/2010,"exploit is an exploit and theres no excuses for it. ccp lately seems to see their own product as ""perfect"" i guess. unfortunatelly its not.... if mechanics is used for other purposes then original then they should react - and this is typical situation tbh."
9/25/2010,"changing your position in fleet is a session change. that it keeps you from docking or leaving fleet is unfortunate, but i wouldnt call that exploit.but i have to ask you something ... why do you need to join a fleet for a simple 1v1?really .... that is the embarrassing part."
9/25/2010,"there are serious issues in your initial recount here.1: your in jita pulling your little test. (how seriously noob are you to do that in the games most heavily trafficked system? for crying out loud go to perimeter or something)2: you accepted a fleet invite from someone attacking you.3: every time you do something in the game that changes ""status"" you get a session change (duh).conclusion - is this an exploit?first off an exploit is intentionally game breaking mechanic to abuse something.secondly... what happened here you started and you enabled.lastly... other than the obvious fact that the guy was intentionally keeping you pinned down... you where doomed regardless.now you want to talk exploits? how about an ""invisible"" aggression timer that continues to get added on without any warning or prior knowledge? that's an exploit.what you did... you did so with full knowledge of doing so.epic fail man.... man up and move on.ain't gonna get anything here."
9/25/2010,if you spent more time reading what i wrote instead of smacking and crying about your own ship blowing up you might have a better idea of what happened here bud
9/25/2010,"i think there are two issues here:1) op actions were consistently stupid so his ship got blown up.2) this use of session mechanics is an exploitwhich lead to two conclusions1) if op petitioned for his ship to be returned, petition should be denied2) future use of this mechanic should be deemed an exploit and followed by banning.just my $0.02, ymmomv."
9/25/2010,if you had read what i said you'd figure it out.you had every conceivable visual warning/cue possible.the mechanics did exactly what they where supposed to do.in my case they didn't... and even ccp admitted that... and have done so many times... they just refuse to fix the several year old bug for some damn reason that even evades everyone else here.it's well documented...psssst - if you trigger an aggro your supposed to get 2 things - an aggression timer and an warning pop up when docked... i received neither. do your homework... prove me wrong smarty pants. stop being noob and use that head on your shoulders for once. because your obviously missing the point. i knew exactly what i was getting into... and the timers should have kept updating endlessly constantly reminding me that i started something that could bite me in the ass... instead i got no timer... not even a blip of a warning at 30 minutes into the aggro timer (which is 15 mins by default).think before you act pal... welcome to eve online.was it dirty? yeah... but i seriously doubt its an exploit... maybe underhanded but most people wouldn't even do what you did to begin with.
9/25/2010,"now, what aries did was stupid but thats how you learn etc etc.using the fleet to keep him from docking is an exploitation of the feature (which is meant to configure your fleet setup).i think this exploit is one of those gray shades between white an black... basically it comes down to wether or not you want to ""win ugly"". since this exploit is so easily avoided you can't blame ccp for focusing on bigger problems. my guess is that they will never regard this as an exploit nor prosecute it accordingly.regards, lax"
9/25/2010,"change this issue to ""make session change timers shorter and reduce the number of them"", i would support it."
9/25/2010,"its a dirty move, yea, but an exploit...no so much.you can just as easily smack in a private channel instead of joining a fleet. tbh, it's your own damn fault for not watching your session timers, not ccp's."
9/25/2010,"in no way this is an exploit, joining a fleet, leaving one or changing your position causes the standard session change timer. any competent fc is aware of this and asks people before moving them around so that they won't get stuck on a gate. of course, if the fc wishes so, he can use it in the opposite way - to prevent people from jumping/docking. if you are so stupid as to join a stranger's fleet.in exactly the same way, the fc could execute a fleetwarp and warp you off into their gang.solution: leave fleet, wait out the session timer, dock."
9/25/2010,"+1, i would be buying ~3 plex/month for this. but i won't spend anything at all on transfer/retransfer/account bull****. ccp would make money on this, and its less useful/powerful than having a second account.-liang"
9/25/2010,"i was all set up to say ""lol, no""but this is actually not a bad idea. no more unbalancing than existing mechanics, a lot more user friendly.could, if badly marketed, leave a bad taste in new placers mouths - those players who still think you should be able, by default, to skill up all three slots at once.(can you gain xp on three characters in the same account at once in any other mmo?)overall, supported."
9/25/2010,"reading comprehension bro, this would do the opposite.currently the only way to have two characters training in tandem is an alternate account. this idea would mean you could train two characters but only use one at a time... meaning people unwilling to pay for another account might be willing pay a little more to be able to train and industry character or something on their main account."
9/25/2010,"tl;dr: create a new option under graphics settings to completely remove all subcapital ship models, in an effort to help players with low-end hardware experience fleet battles more smoothly.i think i have posted this idea on the forums before, but i have not seen it formalized in its own thread. the basic premise is simple: in fleet engagements, positional awareness is vital. you stray away from your logistics, or wander too close to the enemy fleet, and you are dead. however, in large fights, even players using high-end hardware are having problems viewing the battlefield at a suitable zoom range. the two usually offered pieces of advice to increase your framerate are either to zoom all the way in on your ship, or zoom as far out as possible. both eliminate any sort of positional awareness.eve currently has several options to change the graphic details, trading visual quality for performance. however, there is quite a lot of these settings, and changing them around every time before and after a fight (which requires a restert of the eve client) can be quite annoying. ideally, players want to enjoy the high-quality graphics eve is famous for during day-to-day actions, but also an option to get as high performance as possible in fleet fights.the proposal:create a checkbox in the graphic options to ""remove ship models"", to make the models not render at all. i am guessing that rendering ship models and associated effects takes up the majority of computer time during a fleet fight. these models also have to be loaded into various caches, which could be used for more useful things. rendering just the ship brackets in space should be much faster. (note: my background is in cs and computer graphics, i would like to think i know what i am talking about.)details:this option should affect ships, drones, containers, wrecks, missiles, and ship-based effects. turret effects and missile effects (not the missile models themselves) should stay, as it is very important to see who is shooting who in a fight. i think that large models (such as capital ships, starbases, stations, asteroids, etc.) should be unaffected. those are usually not as common, and hiding these would decrease situational awareness, having exactly the opposite effect to this proposal.not displaying any ship models at all would also mean that all the other craphics settings (texture, model, hdr quality, etc.) could very well stay at high seting, because there would not be anywhere as many objects rendered on the screen at the same time. this would lead to this setting being usable much more easily than the current one.in typical fleet engagements, the player's camera is zoomed too far out to appreciate the visual quality of ship models anyway. targetting is executed using the overview or broadcasts, and situational awareness is obtained by looking at ship brackets.of course i know that this would do nothing to counter ""the lag"", which is a server-side problem. but with the recent fixes put in place by ccp, this is becoming less and less common in medium-sized engagements, especially on reinforced nodes. client-side issues and dropping framerates are becoming comparatively a bigger issue.especially for specialized ships, such as logistics or interceptors, being able to assess the situation and react quickly are crucial for their role. and for all practical purposes, looking at colored brackets in space is equal to viewing all the ship models.possible negative impact:none. players who wish to see the ship models at all times could simply ignore this option."
9/25/2010,supporting my own proposal.
9/25/2010,supported.
9/25/2010,"good idea. i fight off brackets, and in large fights i'm not interested in looking at the high quality rendering of my target's hull.edit: forgot to click the support button the first time."
9/25/2010,"in general terms the negative impact of any feature that allows a player to downgrade graphics for pvp performance is that due to the competitive nature of pvp, pretty much everyone feels compelled to use that feature.so, the question becomes how low a bar do we wish to set in terms to graphics to performance? personally not even rendering ship models is too low for my tastes, so i can't support your proposal."
9/25/2010,eve is not a fps or twitch player skill based game. if you're worried about the performance of right clicking and turning on some mods and waiting then you need a new computer with or without this.supported.
9/25/2010,"i'll support. this primarily affects the number of remote-rep targets, currently limited at 4. mostly a factor in c6."
9/25/2010,"this right here is ******ed. for a tier 3 a ""siege module"" of sorts is not a bad idea, but it should not stop the ship completely. then that relatively fragile battleship just became a sitting duck that can easily be insta popped by any dread thats already in seige. some speed penalty is acceptable, say 50%.this would give the ""dread breaker"" fit tier 3 battleships a new tactic. they would have to microwarpdrive in close, then activate their assault module to ensure the capitals guns cant track them. this in turn drastically increases the need for capital fleets to run with heavy support. turning relatively capital only battles into classless brawls."
9/25/2010,"along with everyone else here, the idea as presented is horrible, but the core concept could, with some work, be worthwhile.a subcap capital-destroyer would be nice - if it worked like stealth bombers in that it requires a gang to be effective, and it is fairly weak against other targets.rework the concept based on the feedback here and resubmit, op."
9/25/2010,"i think ccp prefers to call them ""the majority of our customers"" or""our largest revenue stream"".remembering that at all times when contemplating game changes may be helpful."
9/25/2010,"depends on what you mean by ""modules"". if ""modules"" are the actual mods on a ship, then you're correct. if ""modules"" are meant in the same sense as station services - i.e., you have ""propulsion"", ""offensive"", ""defensive"", ""electronics"", ""engineering"" and such - then it might make more sense. also, why would shooting a dram's mwd be useful? if you can't hit the ship, why would you be able to hit a specific part of the ship? and if you can hit it, why aren't you just killing the stupid little bugger instead of messing around with its speed mod?"
9/25/2010,"i concur with herschel... this isn't ""master of orion""- while this strategy would be great for a turn-based strategy game, it really has no place in eve. not supported..."
9/25/2010,i have recently had an unhappy love affair and don't see why anybody else should have a good time.not supported.
9/25/2010,"its possible, but would need to be done carefully to prevent too much imbalance.if it was implemented it would be best if it served as a way of allowing smaller ships to influence larger battles, otherwise it would just be another toy for supercaps - admittedly a kind of 'quick draw' situation where titans were targeting each others' doomsday devices and the fastest locker doomsdayed the other's doomsday before it could fire would be entertaining, but i suspect it would get dumb pretty fast.i'd suggest only capital and supercapital ships having targetable subsystems, and that systems could only be damaged by a weapon system 3 sizes smaller than that of the target vessel. in other words, ""xl"" capital ships would only be vulnerable to subsystem targeting from small sized guns/drones/missiles, and ""xxl"" supercapitals subsystems would only be vulnerable to small and medium weapon attacks. this could either be determined by signature or a hardcoded restriction, whichever works best."
9/25/2010,"as it is now the only reason that people eject is to prevent losing skills when losing a tech iii ship. i propose a new skill called ejection that would allow your pod to quickly move away from your ship in a random direction (6km/level) if you should manually eject from your ship.this skill would allow some escape mechanism for getting out of a bubble in 0.0, but the great speed for that short time (maybe 1.2 seconds in total) would make the pod take longer to warp creating some risk for interceptors or other fast tackle catching your pod.of course the skill would need a different button for regular disembarking if for some reason you do need to get out and not be 30km away from your ship.skill:ejection+ intelligence- perception2x skillprerequisites:evasive maneuvering vnavigation v"
9/25/2010,"totally false. i can recall all sorts of fun occasions where people have ejected from their ships for other reasons, whereas i don't think i've ever seen a t3 ejection. the proposal is weird, not very good design, and adds ui clutter for no good purpose. not supported."
9/25/2010,"remember, the buddy account offer gets used for alt accounts more often than it gets used for actual friends. and you can activate a buddy account with nothing but a plex. do you really want to create a state of affairs where people can pay game currency to get a boost that massive to their stats? first rule of eve game design - whatever you create, players will abuse as hard as it can possibly be abused. keep that in mind when you make proposals."
9/25/2010,"no.any change that lets a player get an advantage for out-of-game actions is bad. the posts above are a good example why it wouldn't work. even if you somehow made it so that it cannot be abused, it would unbalance the game."
9/25/2010,"start a trial account, buy a plex, get faster skill training? hell yeah.by that, of course, i mean no.and to be a bit more constructive: the buddy rewards don't mean anything as long as you don't actually have to invite a friend (= new customer) to the game. if the rewards were any more significant (= any better than the price of one plex), people could just send invites to themselves over and over to exploit the mechanic (see above)."
9/25/2010,"n/tok, i suppose i should write something here. whilst ccp is tweaking the numbers on rockets for sisi testing would it be too much to ask that they make some corresponding adjustments to hams? hams are somewhat overlooked compared to rockets because of fewer hulls using them - only the sacrilege is a dedicated ham platform - but they have problems of their own nonetheless. like rockets, they give up a great deal of range (compared to heavy missiles) to gain a modest eft-dps increase, and then in practise have trouble effectively applying that eft-dps to their target. more than that, the grid requirements of hams make them unattractive options compared to heavies.the fact that sacrileges often fit unbonused heavy missile launchers rather than hams (although it seems nobody flies sacs these days anyway) and that ham caracals and cerberus' (and to some extent ham drakes) are mythical creatures never witnessed by man is surely a sign that something is wrong here?"

9/25/2010,"what he's trying to say is that the dps on ham's was nerfed awhile back against smaller than bs-sized targets. the problem is that there's not much of a role for the few ham boats out there if their weapons are designed to damage bs+ targets, since exchanging fire with bs isn't something hac gangs usually do unless they are just ganking ratters or blobbing smaller fleets. so while it may look good in eft, ships like the sacrilege take about a 50% damage hit against same sized targets unless they use tp's. it's basically like they're shooting little short range cruise missiles.the range i have no issue with. they work well on the cerb with it's range bonus, and the sacrilege is mobile enough to get close enough to use them."

9/25/2010,"imagine mining operations in low sec with scouts, guards and hit and run style of mining.after downtime on randomly belts in low sec appears rich ores like arkonor or bistot. like faction spawns of npcs, but a bit often. not too much amount of ore  maybe enough for 1-2 hours of mining depends of effort. if depleted, or after next downtime appears in different system. to prevent large alliances from claiming those systems.this issue force people to scout low sec belts and do something there (now they are dead place). also give miners opportunity to mine on enemy ground with good risk/revard value and with some adrenaline. guarding miners could be also profitable profession.please comment if you like the idea!"

9/25/2010,"hrm, from the school of all ""pirates are ""griefers"". just one of those coincidences. think about that for a moment. really, think about it. if true, that means that delilah decided a long time ago to troll the forums (she had been doing the same song and dance for ank quite some time ago) and decided to insulate herself from possible ganking with an alt. to the point of creating a fake blog for her alt to use in order to try to **** people off and draw attention only to that alt. because she figured, ahead of time, that she would **** off ""countless"" people who'd want to pod her. that's quite a dedication to trolling with malice aforethought, and it is of course your suggestion. i just think she's lying about having a pvp main. of course, the reason why delilah should post with the imaginary pvp main she has is because she's constantly trolling about how much she likes pvp (while wanting to nerf the hell out of it) or how much she values capitals (while wanting to nerf the hell out of them) or how much she enjoys combat in lowsec (while wanting to nerf the hell out of lowsec, combat in lowsec and combat in general). obviously she doesn't understand those issues and is using her alleged pvp account as a cloak to hide behind. it's bog standard concern trolling. so she should either post with her pvp account if it actually exists, or admit that she doesn't have one and is just looking for ways to nerf pvp. and none of your ""ayieee, people could gank her!"" nonsense. no, not even if you try to sell bull**** as ice cream and suggest that anybody who doesn't want a cone crammed full of it is being stupid. (not that ""buy my bull**** cone and like it, or you are stupid!"" isn't an effective and intelligent tactic, mind)a pvper has nothing, at all, to fear from people coming to pvp with them. that's the point of it. the very idea that, yikes, a pvper has to hide their identity lest people come to shoot at them? well, to put it gently, it kinda misses the point. and while i'm at it, sport: my stupid enough? his stupid enough? her stupid enough. their stupid enough? the word you're looking for is ""you're"", a contraction of ""you"" and ""are"" and not ""your"", which is possessive. just, ya know, as long as you're alleging stupidity you should be writing on a 9th grade level, minimum.now don't say i've never done nothin' for ya."

9/25/2010,"relentless trolling delilah, and really obvious. and still your silly ""i can't heaaaaaaaaaaaar you, lalalala, i am going to talk about you in the third person!"" trolling. grow up. more of your standard trolling, go figure. the fact that you obviously never pvp shows that the ""homework"" has been done as i caught you in your lie. you, yet again, making **** up to troll is hardly a rebuttal. to say nothing of the obviousness of your lie. you do something in pvp (which you engage in all the time, honest!) that neither involves tackle, nor dps, nor remote repping, nor combat probing. and, of course, why almost 100% of the ships you've lost are frigates except for an obviously pvp (but failfit) scorp that you also lost. in other words, you do not pvp.and of course you're trolling, which is why you can only make vague noises about how, of course you pvp. it's just in a super seeekrit role that nobody knows about. and, why, anybody who expects you to actually show up on a killmail because you were involved in a fight is all about epeen (and probably a griefer, ayieeee!)."
9/25/2010,if you took a look at finns killboard stats you would be able to tell that he would know exactly what roles you can assume in pvp. finn has amassed 1458 kills with a success ratio of 48:1. to me and im fairly sure many who may read this post it is you delilah that havent done your homework.i have no problem with you posting your ideas on these forums and i applaud your relaxed attitude but you cant expect to be able to pull off i am a pvper to experienced combat veterans.
9/25/2010,"hello violentuk, finn's stats are impressive, and i hope my character will do as well in time. even so, they are as irrelevant as mine to his ad hominem arguments. the real issue, and the one that has him so exercised, is a different interpretation of eve's past and future. the rhetorical claim that i am masking a hatred of pvp by pretending to like pvp is simply one of his canards. cheers, delilah"
9/25/2010,"actually it's a bit higher. my api verified kills with razor go back to mid 2008 and they've a few more. they don't include any combat i got into during the first two years i was playing eve and battleclinic is, unfortunately, somewhat spotty. in any case, yes, i've flown just about every type of subcap ship from logis to command ships to fleet battleships to bombers to ceptors to hac's to dictors to... i'm used to how small gang, large fleet and capital ships brawls work. which is part of why i object to nonsense delilah is trying to sell on that count.the problem isn't merely the ideas (they are, in the main, very very bad ideas, but that's besides the point). it's the trolling and dishonesty that's used to sell them. it's one thing to say that you want to nerf lowsec pvp because you don't like pvp, but it's quite another thing to say that you want to stick it to pvpers in order to ""balance"" the game and you know what you're talking about because you're a pvper. it's a pattern across many arguments. nor is faux-civility a beneficial cloak, either, if it's a troll. and, more to the point, it's rather poor faux civility. her talk about how pvpers are ""griefers"" is just a step down from the mentally ill rhetoric that typified the disgraced and happily-departed ank, of whom delilah was a rabid defender. delivering poison with a smile isn't true hospitality, and her used-car-salesman-smile while accusing ank's critics of slander, even when they were quoting ank's own words, was just more of the same. the fact of the matter, trolling aside, is that delilah's ideas are horrible precisely because she doesn't understand how pvp works or even the fact that eve is a pvp game (when faced with that fact, she resorts to a pattern of trolling whereby she pretends that people who know eve is a pvp game are ""fumdamentalists"".) that these bad ideas are, consistently, cast using dishonesty and from a rather disgusting position of white-knighting about how horrible ""griefers"" are in their ""fundamentalism"" since eve is just a ""cosmos"", well... the whole ""and i'm a pvper!"" is just icing on the cake.p.s. delilah, stop trolling. what's it going to take? an ad hominem argument is one that seeks to address an inconsequential personal detail about a person to debunk their argument. it is, properly, a non sequitor. pointing out that you are ignorant of pvp, and thus you're offering an uninformed opinion that displays a basic ignorance of game mechanics and therefore makes basic errors, that's not an ad hom. pointing out that you have a near ank-level hatred of pvpers in a pvp game, and that colors your every suggestion about combat in eve, informing and forming the substance of many of your errors, is not an ad hom. pointing out that you do hate pvpers, you are a liar when you claim to like and engage in pvp, and you are using your trolling about how much you like pvp to cloak your arguments for nerfing pvp is a fact. not an ad hom.pointing out that your point of view fundamentally misses the basic dynamics of eve, that because you rage against eve being a pvp game and see yourself as a perpetual victim who has to be saved by ccp, that because you view the very game style ccp deliberately set up as ""grief play"" shows that the view of eve you have is toxic, ignorant, and antithetical to the functioning of the single best persistent pvp mmo ever created.an ad hom argument would be that your avatar looks silly so your argument sucks."
9/25/2010,"the csm definitely should be contributing to content, but i think its a waste of time to have them focused on ""lets make the ship speed indicator green"" level of disucssion. they should be engaging ccp in broader terms, for example where low sec could evolve, and doing that with ""big piture"" ideas and brainstorming. they should also be representing the players regrding the relative importance or lack there of when considering what attention should be given existing in game elements.i think the csm can be very effective at ""nagging"" ccp about thigs that just didn't work as represented. nul sec sov changes are an example of something that failed completely at achieving one of the main goals, which is to say ""get the little guy"" out in the badlands. it might eventually be that but not until treaties are in place, so for example the csm could be nagging ccp about the priority to get that new game mechanic done.issler"

9/25/2010,"violentuk's point is a good one. i remember worrying about losing ships when i first started in sharuveil. its wasn't the loss of the ships per se, but how to replace them. a few people were very kind in helping to support me in those early days. eve u has a superb ship replacement policy, so when i joined i stopped worrying about ship replacements. as a complementary point, i also recall being disappointed with the brevity of the engagements, which reduced the overall fun. even when one lost ships in low sec, having a longer time to have fun in the engagements would be appealing. don't know if anything could be done about that without impacting every ship and many tactics. still, its an interesting thought experiment. cheers, delilah"

9/26/2010,"i like this proposal and the idea of simplifying the universe for newbie pilots in their first hours, but the problem with your proposal is, that it is stuffed with words like ""singeplayer"", or ""instanced"" which let most eve people shiver.i would introduce this as a kind of simulation inside the starting stations. a new player would so to speak play eve while playing eve (awesome sentence ). the simulation would start with the basic features and interface and then add everything else in the training process, maybe similar to your explanations. it would be like another universe with own market, own wallet, maybe another set of starting skills and stuff like that.but of course every new player could anytime leave the simulation and undock in the real world as soon as he feels like it. and when he is ready to continue the tutorial simulation he docks somewhere and enters it again."
9/26/2010,"as you didn't bother to read the rest of the sentence i'm go treat you like a troll/r*tard from now on.skothen: i don't think i said single player once in my whole text. i always said that i wanted there to beother players to interact with as thats the whole point with a mmorpg and eve in particular. i just don'tthink it benefits anyone to have a new player getting harassed by people who have been playing for 5 years,the first time he logs in. i don't really see the difference of starting at a deadspace complex than a instancedsystem tbh. you're going to be alone there no matter what. i would also like to add that, while your idea of a simulation to train players isn't bad its just - don'ttake this the wrong way uninteresting. why would anyone want to play something that ""pretends"" tohappen in a game. you need to get the feeling of being stranded in there, the oh **** i must work together (or against)with these people to be able to get myself out of here! everything you do in your first hour must seem relevant to therest of the game, the bigger picture so to speak."
9/26/2010,"by having no barriers between the new and the old the new players are forced to harden up and learn the in's and out's of the game in order to ""survive.""a good example of this comes from a thread [posted awhile back] where a career mission runner posted a thread raging about how people had probed out his mission site, flipped one of his wrecks, and ""tricked"" him into engaging with his mission ship. it was an otherwise ordinary emorage post (with similarly ordinary responses) until he posted back saying that he had not bothered to learn the mechanics of pvp because he didn't want to know anything about pvp.had missions or high-sec been ""instanced"" and ""forced"" contact not been possible this person would have remained ignorant of a large part of the mechanics that make up the game. through this rather ""unfortunate"" event he learned that he had to understand the aggression mechanics in order to stay ""safe"" (this is of course assuming that he didn't quit eve altogether).the difference is that there is a chance that you can be probed out in a deadspace complex and be forced to ""interact with"" another player. an ""instanced"" system, in the eyes of many here, is where there is no chance of ""forced"" interaction, for better or worse, and is thus akin to ""hand holding"" which is very much against the ethos of eve.wait... so you want an ""instanced"" environment where newbies can learn the mechanics of the game without the risks of running into a vet/older player and yet you turn around and say that newbies need to have the feeling that they have been ""stranded"" and ""must work together""? i have trouble following that line of logic as a ""safe"" system for newbies will hardly give that feeling.overall... i do agree that the tutorials are dumb and need to be looked at (again). perhaps something where the autopilot will take over and perform an action just once in order to show you how to do certain things... but i can see this as being a coding nightmare for the devs and raises a few possibilities for exploits. but i digress.this smacks of a korean mmo style ""intro"" and i cannot support this on principle alone.not supported."

9/26/2010,scouts would die of joy.
9/26/2010,*insert a whine about the ui here*
9/26/2010,"this isn't an exploit, it's just intelligent use of game mechanics. it's not like you're going to fall for the same trick again, after all. it's sneaky as hell, and i'll certainly keep it in my bag of tricks for future engagements, but it's perfectly within the realm of intended mechanics."
9/26/2010,does this also prevent someone from jumping through a wh?
9/26/2010,not an exploit.
9/26/2010,"personally i would say this is exploit.becouse if this is just intelligence use of game mechanics, then ccp better reinstate all those banned accounts from that mon material reaction fiasko that forced ccp to do some changes how they handle things.since game mechanic allows in that case too, it clearly was inttelligence use of game mechanics. maybe op should actyally petition this upto senior gm level to get definitive answer."
9/26/2010,"the mistake the op did was to accept the fleet invite. if the op have had any experience with fleets he would know that by accepting a fleet invite gives you 30 sec session timer.if the op had known this, this would never happen.so, this is not an exploit and have never been it either. it's a big noobish mistake by a player that didn't know how fleet mechanics works.like me, i haven't done empire wars in like 4 years before i joined mbalm. and i was pretty much clueless on how all of those empire aggroing things was working. but thanks to experienced players in our corps that have exaplained most things to me.so i'm aware of pretty much everything now.the best thing you ever can do in empire, is to be smart. if your not smart, your gonna lose alot of isk."
9/26/2010,"ccp should add liquid ozone as allowable ship cargo in the ship maintenance array. ammunition was allowed in the cargo specifically because it's something every ship has, and it's not typically something people like to haul long distances, so allowing it in the sma is not very abusable. i believe liquid ozone also falls under this category, because its uses are largely limited to cyno fuel and pos fuel- and people generally only haul liquid ozone alone only as cyno fuel.having to go through a bunch of liquid ozone cargo bs with your cyno frigates is really annoying"

9/26/2010,yes.how would this be different to scamming with bpcs/bpos?
9/26/2010,"while i could see selecting 'reprocess' on a whole unpacked cargo container as useful for recycling a bunch of items at once, i can't imagine that i am the only one who uses cargo cans in hangar to organize equipment. if you're not paying attention and select-all the hangar contents to reprocess your meta-0 junk, it includes those cans, and will happily reprocess it...so, basically, an unpacked cargo can and its contents shouldn't be allowed as valid targets for reprocessing."
9/26/2010,"itt stupid people do stupid things.in all seriousness though, it would be nice to see a specific warning, ie; ""you are about reprocess a cargo container. all contents will be destroyed"""
9/26/2010,a pop-up warning would work.(i'm normally careful about recycling... but just one mental slip can ruin your whole day...)
9/26/2010,"supported, either to entirely disallow or give a warning."
9/26/2010,it should only be possible to reprocess empty containers
9/26/2010,this.
9/26/2010,supported.it's not particularly funny to find the two cans you don't want to reprocess between the 600 different modules you acquired over a few months of mission running.
9/26/2010,"unless you're zoomed in very close (which no one is during fleet battles), ships are practically invisible unless you have brackets turned on. they're a waste of rendering resources at that scale."
9/26/2010,seems like a good idea to me.
9/26/2010,"you do realize though, that not the models but the brackets are what creates most of the client side lag? there's a reason everyone tells you to switch off brackets.i guess it also depends on your machine, but for myself i can say that turning on brackets slows my machine down to a slide show, where as turned off brackets speed everything up to 30-40 fps again.thus for me it has always been bad software engineering rather than a ****ty computer. because, seriously, why are the overview and the brackets slowing down my game and not the models (and the aaaawesome sensor booster effect that you see so rarely )?edit: supporting the proposal with this exception: fix the lag created by brackets. i find it awful to fix a broken feature by adding a feature to fix said broken feature."
9/26/2010,"^^ thisi tested having brackets on and off during the battle for d-g earlier this year. i run typically with all settings on high, hdr enabled, and all effects on. my fps was knocked from my usual 80-100 in space to a grueling 20-30fps. however, in most low-fighting situations (such as undocking from jita 4-4), my fps doesn't take a hit regardless of having brackets on or off.without brackets or models, you're essentially playing a point-and-click excel spreadsheet...and wheres the fun in that?"
9/26/2010,"you heard that right but it was not a wreck it was by wreath! how about special hud tags for minmatar ships saying ""this is not a wreck""."
9/26/2010,i support this as an april fool's day gag.
9/26/2010,sounds good to me!
9/26/2010,"many cruisers can lock more then 5 targets, for example recons and logistics, 2 roles that t3s are supposed to fill, can handle 10."
9/26/2010,"then where can i find your proposal criticizing that the t3 can lock as far as bs, can have a higher sensor strength than bs, can reach the same dps, the same tank, but at the same timer are more agile and faster, can track better, can be refitted to evade bubbles and warping cloaked and have t2 resists?giving t3 cruisers the stats of battleships but denying them locking any more but 5 targets is nothing but ridiculous. although +1 target would already make me happy enough."
9/26/2010,"this is exactly correct. the type of ship that would use a joystick might be the drones, which are effectively piloted by the computer."
9/26/2010,"right now if you put guns on a target that is dying, due to some timing issues, your guns end up going on the next target instead of your intended target. this csm proposal is to change the client so that if you put guns on a target, or if the last target died the same time you pressed f1-f8, to not set the guns at all, and possibly put up some notice to the player so they know it was because the target died and that they can try again.this is to prevent issues like shooting friendlies, as there is currently no mechanic to differentiate friendly locks from hostile ones.right now there is only one workaround, and that is to lock an additional hostile or neutral target in the right order so that when your guns go to them accidentally, they don't cause serious problems. but sometimes that's not an option."
9/26/2010,"f***** supported here, had a fleet engament yesterday, my domi neuter, a widoow (black ops) and a drake, totally cost for all around 1.3bil. not that you need to now that lol, anyway lol. we took on a domi and mega, i neuted out the domi and mega in the first 30second, they're sitting ducks... we get the mega down to 10% armor or around that, and rr comes along, fkk, we lost the drake, i nearly lost my domi, i went 5% struct and the widow just managed to escape!! we could have lost all of those ships due to 1 just 1 rr!!! this is ridiculous, its our flippin war... wt vs wt not us vs 40,000 pilot. and even more stupid, people niow hire players for this support for high sec wars... stop this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

9/26/2010,"ctrl + click on broadcasts to lock target.pretty simple really, having to right click is really annoying tbh."
9/26/2010,as far as i know you already can. you just can't do it for broadcast history.
9/26/2010,"as you may or may not be aware, the kronos is fairly widely regarded as the least useful (in pve) of the 4 marauders. primarily, this is due to the non-feasibility of blasters, and the underwhelming power of railguns.the bonuses on the ship indicate that the original intent was to have a blaster fit; to this intent i would suggest that the stasis web bonus be dropped in favor of an optimal or falloff bonus to hybrids, extending effective range of blasters to approximately 40k before the dps drop is ridiculous.downsides: this may make a fairly ridiculous sniping platform with railguns; this is balanced in pvp by the low sensor strength of marauders making them ridiculously easy for a decent ecm pilot to remove them from the dps equation."
9/26/2010,"oops, supporting my own post :)"
9/26/2010,"i have to point out that with reguard to your augrment the same can be said for the paladin as it to has the stasis web bonous just like the kronos.i would support 10%-15% per lvl bonus to the effectiveness of tracking computers, for the kronos. where as give the paladin a stasis web range bonous of 10%-15% per lvl insted of the stasis web speed reduction bonous that both ships curently have. that would make them more in line with the rest of the marauders."
9/26/2010,"i agree - the paladin isn't hindered nearly as much by it's near-useless bonus, but in both cases, the ship is helped greatly by a change."
9/26/2010,"the webbing bonuses makes sense especially with rails, so you can hit close orbiting ships (angel or merc missions).not supported."
9/26/2010,the web bonus also doubly applies to the use of blasters.double not supported
9/26/2010,"the webbing bonus does make sense with rails - but rails are not what the other bonuses seem to suggest as primary weapon system on the kronos (it seems to suggest blasters).the blasters do enjoy the web bonus, but it seems to me they'd be better off with a range bonus so that you don't have to be at ridiculously short range to apply dps, which is the problem that makes the vargur invariably better than the kronos for missions.and don't argue ""but but pvp"" because the low sensor strength makes marauders a reasonably bad choice in pvp."
9/26/2010,enough people use marauder in pvp. you just need to be prepared to handle ecm.still not supported.
9/26/2010,many of those who use a marauder in pvp doesn't really cares about the low sensor strenght. they pvp in hopes of not meeting a falcon or someone with ecm drones.or they will in some cases have a falcon alt them self so they can jam the falcon that will jam the kronos or other marauders.i know some guys that use a kronos in pvp with high success ratio.the kronos is perfectly fine as it is now.
9/26/2010,"i don't know why the original design called for one jump clone per station only, but we're long past the time period when jump clones were shiny new things, and now this particular restriction is just annoying. removing it, and allowing us to keep multiple jump clones in a station will be more convenient for players."
9/26/2010,assembly hall -> jump clones
9/26/2010,awesome. that was the guy that originally requested me to raise the issue in the first place. i must have lost his thread. thanks.
9/26/2010,its apparently by design that the eve patcher closes all instances of eve instead of the one that is getting patched. is it really that hard to close only the patching instance of eve? this is really annoying on patch day with multiple clients and multiple accounts.
9/26/2010,some of us use junction points to avoid duplicating the entire client install. in that instance not closing all clients would be a very bad thing.
9/26/2010,"oh this is interesting, i've never heard of junction points before. i'm totally making use of this. nevermind this ah issue then"
9/26/2010,"proposal would give some reason for people to eject to save their pod, as is, i hear recommendations are against it as it prevents you from warping away quickly enough.interesting idea, given it guarantees you will lose your ship, however, i suggest that it does not have any penalty which makes it easier to catch your pod, and perhaps has a longer range to make it unlikely to be possible - in exchange the pirates are getting to *keep* your ship and 100% of the modules. (assuming they stop firing before it explodes.)would provide interesting interaction options if implemented - supported."
9/26/2010,"and this is the most ridiculous thing i have seen in a long time. i love how blizzard (you can say it's wow btw) nullified any ""achievements"" that other players made without those buddy invites."
9/26/2010,"the range on javs was ridiculous (iirc depending a bit on if it were rockets, hams or torps). when i get 40km range on my blasters with null you may have your old range back for javs."
9/26/2010,this is a stupid thread. there's nothing the damn matter with hams.ham sacrilege - problem is sacrilegeham caracal/cerb - problem is pgham drake - problem is ???
9/26/2010,"ham sacriledge - problem is the people who have no fing clue how to fly close range ships.hams are some awesome **** if you use them right. missile users just aren't accustom to that style of fighting i think.javs could use about a 10km boost in range. right now, they really do suffer from their slow travel time. the drift effect usually makes what is 30km range really only about 25km range."
9/26/2010,i usually just bring javs to annoy people who try to kite me in warp disruptor range. but in general that ammo is nerfed too hard compared to barrage and scorch.
9/26/2010,"what's that got to do with the topic? you can already do exactly what you describe, although the effective range of ham's makes it a failfit for anything but a gank. the op isn't complaining about the range, he's complaining about the fact that a cruiser-sized weapon isn't designed to hit cruisers."
9/26/2010,"i'm pretty sure hams do good damage to cruisers. if you're too dumb to fit a scram and probably even a web, that's not the weapon system's fault.just because you're too scared to miss a killmail or two because you can't fit a disruptor, or you're so afraid to lose your ship that you have to fit an extra shield extender/invul, doesn't mean the weapon system is broken.at least your terribly broken hams do some sort of damage to frigates too. i demand a 200% tracking increase for projectiles, because i can't shoot an orbiting frig.ninja edit: oh and on that note, sorry for saying 650 rather than 850. hams on drakes are broken enough (in game balance terms). i thought i exaggerated well enough, but hey."
9/26/2010,"i would support a javelin range boost and maybe a 5% pg use reduction but other than that i think they're fine personally, you can get some brilliant paper dps which can be made a reality with javs and tps. just look at ham legions, only way to fit a legionnot supporting"
9/26/2010,"i have no idea about this as i don't do pi, but if this is true it shouldn't be hard to fix."
9/26/2010,never had this problem- wtz puts me right next to it every time with no bounce.
9/26/2010,i really like this
9/26/2010,"the only thing that could doing hit and run mining in low sec would be spawning some ""very dense"" or ""pure"" asteroid there that can be only mined with a new class of t1 mining frigate.the asteroid spawning should be a random intervals, not a dt.for example spawning 0-2 asteroids in each belt with 100 m3 of a new mineral that would yield 1000 units of zydrine but that require the use of a ""high frequency mining laser"" or some other mumbo jumbo, a laser that can be used only on dedicated ships. that way the miner would be in and out from the belt with a high frequency and killing him would require some decent planning. having a regular 0.0 asteroids will do little. the time needed to gather enough mineral to refine is relatively long, making them easy targets."
9/26/2010,"spawning more ore at downtime would only benefit people in the right timezones to pick it up. for everyone else (and this includes the majority of eve population), doing this would have little to no effect, as any extra roids would be gone by the time they get there.gravimetric sites already fulfill this role perfectly."
9/26/2010,"its not quite as illogical as you might think. first off the number of accounts you have is effectively irrelevant given they all train at the same speed, all it does is give you more sets to chose from rather than expanding the set you have. as an example lets take 2 identical accounts, all variables being equal under the current system they will always train at the same rate no matter what actions the owners take. now lets add unlimited attribute remaps, possible through plex for remaps, to one of those accounts, they still have the same equal variables but one account can train faster than the other simply through being able to constantly optimise itself for whatever skill is being trained.thats why i agree with foivos that plex for remaps is a bad idea, it upsets a mechanic at the very heart of the skill system, the mechanic that all things being equal two accounts train at the same speed.but anyway enough of my rambling."
9/26/2010,"under those circumstances the player (not to be confused with account, since we're well beyond the false supposition that players generally have one account) recieves the same benefit at the exact same price. the only variable left out of the equation is the necessity to fill in pre-requisite skills that more than one account may hold already.since we are already well aware of the time this takes (and subsequent number of plex or monthy payments incurred) for alts to develope into their designated roles, why then are we arguing the semantics of how this is bad/diffirent?i cannot see any negative to this system which does not already exist via rampant alts who already exist. two accounts train at the same theoretical speed, but that does not work in practice. even if you remove the implant and learning skill variables you are still left with proper remap allocation and skill training order to optomize sp gains over the year. this is something an alt can take full advantage of because you already have other character(s) to amuse yourself with. so again, at the most basic level:buy another account = $ = can do more things in less timebuy plex and remap = $ = can do more things in less timethe only diffirence being, no matter how skilled one character is, it wont be able to fly two ships at once, so the alternate account user still wins in the long-run."
9/26/2010,"i'm not sure which horse you believe me to be riding, or why this would be a knee jerk reaction. i posted an assembly thread post, gave everyone the information that i thought they needed (which includes much more arguments against the proposal and for this new system) and then left the vote up to player's judgement. to me the purpose of the assembly hall is to post proposals and to get peoples opinions so that they can be represented faily by those csm who work in this manner. a good proposal if neccessary will show both for and against arguments so that voters may consider each side, and although the proposal is not neutral due to the topic being against something, it is well balanced. the cons were expanded in this particular proposal due to some feedback from players who didn't fully understand the ones that were there, and clarity was needed.ie. ""people can buy characters with isk"" is not inherently unfair as before plex everyone had equal oppurtunity to do so - and as such this is actually covered under the ""real money trading happens regardless"" and ""people with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage already"" arguments.-t'amber"
9/26/2010,"that may be true but the main reason i think people are worried about this is because its skirting perilously close to the whole cash for skill points issue that flared up a while back, accelerated training by using plex to me looks like pretty much the same thing. you may well be right and it ends up making no difference but the issue is such a hot button topic with such serious implications that i believe its better to just stay the hell away from it as much as possible."
9/26/2010,"for me, the most basic level is the plex mechanic, not character sales or alts. before plex everyone had equal chance to buy and or sell characters. -t'amber"
9/26/2010,"you seem intelligent enough to realize that you made it blantly obvious people should oppose this, prior to giving any compelling debate on the subject. you clearly failed to sit down for one second and rationalize anything based on present game mechanics and the plex system status quo. you want anyone to believe you're leaving this up to the players' judgement? then try leaving your own bias out. you are purposefully trying to seperate the plex to remap proposition from the pre-existing $ - plex - character relationship(s) that already exist, when there is no reasonable way to do so. the only reason i can find for this position is that you, as a representative of many players who support their accounts with plex bough via in-game isk, do not want another use for plex because that would upset your constituents trying to support many accounts in this manner.so, kindly stop blowing smoke up our collective asses and have out with your agenda and actual reasoning. the ""oh but, players will get an advantage,"" shtick is a rather obvious load of bs."
9/26/2010,"""hrm, from the school of all ""pirates are ""griefers"". just one of those coincidences.""hmmm, i think you need to look again and not make assumptions."

9/26/2010,"tbh i think that it's important to start with the logic for any proposed change and then see if it might impact the availability of targets. after all, we could always just make it so that any gate had a random chance to take someone to the system next door, or tama. putting more people into lowsec will be a good thing, but it shouldn't be the only thing that we're getting at. bounties, in particular, are notoriously open to abuse and would, very quickly, simply turn into a revenue stream for any outlaw with a noob corp alt. transferable kill rights might work a bit better, especially if they're coupled with a built in 'locator agent' style service.i still think that boosting the faction warfare system and allowing lowsec residents to 'claim space' and get advantages from that will be the way to go, ultimately, to improve the game and lowsec as a consequence. give players something to fight over other than simple kills and hunting ground, and lowsec might see more use. potentially, at least. because in the final analysis, what matters it that people are ready and willing to pvp, or at least risk pvp. with the number of people who break into a cold sweat over the possibility of ""griefing"", it's unfortunately not the totality of the eve playerbase. nope, i was correct as folks can see from clicking on the link. but interesting how quick you went from ""of course delilah isn't posting with her actual pvp main (which really does exist!) and only an idiot would expect her to!"" to ""so, erm, let's change the subject."""

9/27/2010,"at first, i wasn't going to bother logging in to support this (despite the fact it's the most amusing thread i've seen in a long time), since the csm is a ""serious"" institution. after reading the meeting minutes, i made up my mind.this thread illustrates perfectly what is wrong with with the current game development, and to see it being treated in such a fashion is absolutely horrible. i don't think anyone's seriously suggesting we should be able to order pizza through eve by using plexes, or that development time should be used to enable such a feature (though it would make for an interesting promotion gimmick). i do give people posting here the benefit of doubt and enough credit to assume that most of them don't want to order pizza (via plex), but are making fun of a messed up dev. cycle that introduces new, bug-ridden content that sees little love afterwards. and then, plexes are suddenly supposed to become a backdoor to do micro-transactions.there's faction warfare, there's our for all intents and purposes disabled address book, there's still socket closed issues for n<U+FFFD> people, every once in a while the same amount of players can't even launch the game after a patch, and if you look through this forum section alone, i'm sure you'll stumble over... uhm... one or two more? yes?supporting this ridiculous notion and bringing it to ccp's attention might've been a wake-up call when it comes to customer preferences. but i guess it's easier to pretend you have more important stuff to do."
9/27/2010,"speak for yourself. i'd totally order pizza for plex.yep, ccp isn't giving pi some lovin in the next patch. nope. not at all. -liang"
9/27/2010,"i guess there is a negative example for everything. selective quoting also helps to win the interwebs, i heard. that way, the one example of ccp investing substantial time into further developing a somewhat unpolished feature (and writing a dev blog about it, to make sure people have something to point to when the topic comes up again - which it always does, sooner or later) is in no way connected to the four examples i already mentioned of where it is unfortunately not happening to the degree of producing a noticeable effect (and of course there are countless more). almost like it didn't happen. (by the way, this is where i would insert a smiley that rolls its eyes if i was just a tad cooler.)that doesn't mean i don't appreciate what is being done to improve the game. when i read rockets were finally being fixed, i rubbed my eyes and was very, very happy. but how long did that take to happen, how many threads and players spending time asking, pleading, crying? and why wasn't that a priority over adding new shiney featurez that ended up breaking other parts of the game when introduced?as much as i like eve and think ccp is awesome for creating it and keeping it running, they do sometimes have their priorities wrong. that they're planning to introduce backdoor micro-transactions with plexes is a step in the wrong direction.ordering pizza for plexes wouldn't even be a bad thing (albeit slightly ******ed, mind) as it doesn't have much of an impact on the game itself, except driving plex prices up. but it serves perfectly to illustrate the ridiculous scope of it all."
9/27/2010,"your first post here went on a long tirade about what was wrong with current game development at ccp - how they would introduce a less than stellar feature and then leave it to languish. so i pointed out a feature that directly contradicted you that was in the current game development cycle. you think that past features should be iterated on - we get that. hell, maybe we even agree. but they can't all be iterated on now.and while i don't see eye to eye with you on the 'microtransactions', i'll let that alone.-liang"
9/27/2010,"make the cost exponential per sp (ex. 1 sp remap = 1 isk, 2 sp remap = 4 isk, 3 sp remap = 9, 4 sp remap = 16 isk) and only be able to do it once a year"
9/27/2010,"the rate at which ships, weapons, and modules are re-balanced in eve is more or less on a yearly/bi-yearly schedule. that means that when a certain race has fotm ships it will stay that way for a loooooooooong time. ergo, this will only be to the benefit of the mins/maxers out there who wish to fly ""the best"" ships (granted, what is or is not ""the best"" is purely a subjective thing... mostly...).as far as cost goes... 100 mil is [for the most part] chump change for those players out there who have a lot of sp. and 10 million sp is a lot to toy around with (perfect support skills, cruiser 5, maybe bs 5, and then some). you could fiddle with the cost of it, but then you'd potentially be shortchanging the ""newbie players"" that you are aiming this for.my first post here was mostly a sarcastic jab... i can only see a homogenization of what ships people fly if this were to be implemented.live with the skills you train, for better or worse. you never know, they might someday be useful.not supported."
9/27/2010,not supported. you make a choice as to what you train for and should live with it.
9/27/2010,"wrong!at max learning skills, you have a total of 96.8 with an average of 19.36 per attribute.if someone who remaps to get max learning on each skill they will train as if they have 121 total skill points with an average of 24.2 per attribute.they will train faster than you. so it essentally means real life money = faster skill training.but with ccp keeping quite and they fully programed the feature already, there is no stopping this plex to train faster feature. oh well."
9/27/2010,"the big deal is that under the current system, nothing is generated when you sell plexes. all the rewards (i.e. isk) you receive for trading a plex to someone were brought into the game through proper channels, and then given to you. if plexes could be directly traded for a remap, that would essentially generate a reward in-game for real life money."
9/27/2010,"wrong.you can put a maximum of 15 points into any attribute for a remap. regardless of how often you remap, you can only put 15 points into any attribute. if you do put 15 points into one attribute, you'll only have enough points left to put 9 into a second attribute.creative shuffling of neural remaps will allow someone to plot an optimum training plan to fly a battleship a week earlier, with the skill training plan over 2 years evening out with someone who stayed the patient course training all the int/mem skills in one block, then remapped to per/wil. for each different optimal plan, add another year for the break even: if you want to do a cha/wil for leadership and trade skills, add an extra year to the one-per-year remapping plan, and you'll break even. the person who buys neural remaps is not buying sp faster than you, they're just buying access to skills (and thus equipment or activities) earlier in their training plan than someone who isn't purchasing extra remaps.the extra points added by implants and learning skills are irrelevant to the discussion of neural remaps."
9/27/2010,"i think this proposal is blowing this way out of proportion. i don't see any valid reason to be against plex for neural remapping except that it could open the door to a cash shop which i would most definitely be against. besides that, this proposal has no merit imo.not supported."
9/27/2010,"two thumbs up. stop ccp now from even getting near the slippery slope.besides that, putting it on sisi then not commenting on it anywhere is like trolling the players:like it's deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting the players. trolls of this nature are disruptive and do not contribute to the sense of community we want for our forums."
9/27/2010,correct.you contradict yourself. you truly do not have a grasp on how this works. you honestly think some who can remap a often as they want will not complete a year or two year skill plan faster than someone who can only remap once a year? you entire argument is hinging on a skill plan that uses the same two attributes the whole year. no one does that.i would not say that because both amplified the difference between someone who remap once a year and someone with unlimited remap.
9/27/2010,"don't go down this road ccp. you're one of the few companies that has the integrity to stand by your playerbase and not screw them. go down this road and you'll be just like every other mmo company out there, and you definately will not get any more of my money."
9/27/2010,wtf ccp!
9/27/2010,not supported.added functionality of plex wouldn't be anything but good. read my discussion in the linked thread.

9/27/2010,another sane human being... in my eve?
9/27/2010,wtf ccp!
9/27/2010,"ok, this is fairly simple. 5 people are selling 1-2 units each of item x. you want 7. prices are 750, 800, 899, 900, 950right now if you put up an order for x at 1000/u, you fill all the above orders immediately, but pay 1000/u instead of their sell order price. this obviously sucks, but so does making 5 separate buys.simply put, it should auto-fill sell orders at sell-order price if they are under your buy, at least for immediate orders. as it stands it's just a ui hindrance."
9/27/2010,"the same thing happens with sell orders iirc.if you sell for 3000and there were buy orders for 5000 , 4000 , 3500 then you only get 3000 per unit.it seems that the price paid on matches comes from the most recent order whether that be buy or sell.changing it to the oldest order may make more sense."
9/27/2010,"this isn't an issue, it's a lack of understanding of how the market works. if you treat the market more like a commodities trading center than a supermarket, this actually makes sense.person x has agreed to sell widget a for no less than 800 isk.you say, i want widget a, and i'll pay exactly 1,000 isk.the system looks through the commodities for sale and based on those criteria, you buy person x's widget at the price you agreed to pay, 1,000 isk.if you're making a buy order, you're obviously on the market screen already. check the sell orders for prices lower than what you to pay, right click, click buy item, enter a quantity, and viola, you've paid what they were asking and you didn't have to create multiple buy orders at all.actually you get the highest price available in the system you are selling from. check the range of the buy order before you try and sell something. most of the really high paying ones are only system or station wide (in my experience)."
9/27/2010,"as it stands i can't go to the lowest sell order and type the number i want, it will only give me the amount they're selling (although thankfully it won't charge me for more).going through a bunch of sell orders is just a pain in the butt and a waste of time.if it (as you say) works for sell orders, why shouldn't it work for buys?supporting my own post."
9/27/2010,"real men buy out the bottom 15 orders all at once, paying the highest price for everything so they can do it in one operation having said that, good idea, supported if it can be done without a significant impact on server load."
9/27/2010,"as the title says, just a small suggestion to make colored bars & arrows on targets based oncorp/alliance/standings. so you're always sure you are repairing/damaging the right guy :) (neuts and rats will be kept the way they are, only for player controlled ships)edit: this will of course be for fleets/militias as well.little screeny of an example of how it could look like:please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
9/27/2010,"hey, pretty good idea. should be fairly easy to implement, too.supported!"
9/27/2010,supported for ui enhancement.looks easy enough to do and helpful to boot!

9/27/2010,"i do definately not want a safe environment for new players. eve is not safe - it would be completly stupid to trick them that it was. one of those systems should even be 0.0 so they can kill each other there (as only frigates/cruisers) will be allowed it gives them a pretty equal chance.i just want the new players to not feel so overwhelmed when they start playing, a small goal to reach that you don't have to fly20 jumps to reach using autopilot. also, old players in eve are *******s - i want to give them a fair chance before they encounter them (sorry if i destroy your weekendfun in harassing new players). also i dont want the rest of high-sec to change, just the first week of playing - there is a big difference."

9/27/2010,"ehh, there is already too much stuff on the right-click menu. maybe make another drop down menu off it that would allow you to bookmark and be able to move useless things (like lock target, seriously who uses it?) onto that menu to make more space."

9/27/2010,"very this. i hate having to buy station containers just so i can figure out how much i can contract to my jf char.. it wouldn't be too bad, but then you can't delete them for 2 weeks and assets window gets all ****ted up."
9/27/2010,what's a toon? like a cartoon? how did a cartoon switch your fleet position?
9/27/2010,1) you took a can from someone you didn't know. (in jita no less)2) accepted a gang invite from someone you didnt know. 3) didnt notice the session timer until it was to late.not an exploit. you just fcked up. welcome to eve.
9/27/2010,quoting for hillarity.
9/27/2010,"to be deemed an exploit, criteria one is that it is a bug. this is not a bug, but the way the fleet system works. i admit, i would never have thought of using the fleet system this way, but that doesn't automatically make it an exploit, unless the code itself is doing something unintended. it sounds to me like everything worked the way it was intended and designed to work - he just used that design against you.of course, the only way to get a definitive answer on ""is this an exploit"" is to file a petition, and see what ccp says."
9/27/2010,tell me something i don't know about pvp / fleet mechanics now?
9/27/2010,most certainly not an exploit. if you don't want to be locked out of dock ... don't join a gang/fleet.last thing we need are shorter timers so that there's even more station hugging.
9/27/2010,"how is this not an exploit? someone is clearly using a mechanic for something that is unintended and doesn't belong into the context of the game.it's not really a bug, still it's exploitable. was the moon-mineral thingie not an exploit, because it was just as possible and within the game mechanics as this? or the wormhole exploit? the ecm burst-aggressing of ships in forcefields (because, ofc, that's not an exploit too)?bumping someone off a station or neutral rring is one thing, forcing session timers upon someone else is something lots different.i can imagine just fine how almost anyone in this thread would ragepost on the forum too if he lost his ship that way.and lol at the guys saying ""then don't join a fleet"". it's like replying ""gb2wow"".edit: i'm not shouting for a fix or anything, but just like someone said, this is in the very dark grey area of exploit or not."
9/27/2010,"when did inviting players to fleet and moving players around in a fleet to other squads being an exploit?. if the op is so stupid to accept a fleet invite from someone that is red to him, then he deserve to die in a big ass fire for his stupidity.ofc, if there had been a way to get the players into the fleet without letting them accept it them self, it would be an exploit, but hey, he accepted the fleet invite him self. it's his own stupidity.everyone with some kind of brain would understand that by accepting a fleet invite will get you a 30 sec session timer automaticly. so if the op had known this, do you think he would have joined the fleet then?it's all about understanding game / fleet mechanics here."
9/27/2010,"nightmarexgo back to school and learn to read bud... then read my post again.he changed my squad possion from member, to squad leader, and back to member (wash rinse and repeat) i didnt die from the initial timer. try to keep up.ill also add that i took a can from a 1 man corp... thats right, a 1 man corp. figure it out guys. i would have added that at the beginning but this post is about something i had never seen, not something people already know is an exploit."
9/27/2010,and you still had been stupid enough to join a fleet. there is no finger pointing. look into a mirror and you found who is responsible for your ship loss.p.s.: whining here would not solve the issue at all. you would need to file a petition to get an answer if this is marked an exploit or not. but i guess from your whining you havent done that so far.
9/27/2010,"ammo and charges are allowed so you can carry a combat ready ship. that's one of the intended uses of an sma. an itty 5 with rigs and expanders can hold over 96k liquid ozone. carrying that much cargo in an sma is not an intended use. it is the very reason the change to sma's was made. roll back the change completely, or leave as is. an exception for one item is pandering to a very small part of the playerbase."
9/27/2010,"this was added to forcibly encourage people to use rorquals and later jf's when they were introduced. not only is there is no need for it anymore, but it doesn't prevent people using carriers to import minerals compressed as torps and such.the ideal solution of course is to allow any ship with any cargo inside an sma provided it is not over a set limit (i.e. 1000m3)."
9/27/2010,"i like that 1km3 idea too. i dont know if ccp wants to change how it works, but i think ill add that as an alternate possibility instead of using a whitelist for items. because people often put weird stuff in their ships like exotic dancers and bongs, and if they have to store their ships in a carrier the lovely ladies are left out in the cold.liquid ozone is not really compressible, and if you want to carry a lot of it as pos fuel in a carrier you still have to make a jf jump to carry all the other pos fuels too. so i dont really see a whole lot of carriers gearing up to haul liquid ozo in mass because of this, and if they do, its still really inefficient."
9/27/2010,"when are you at an sma where there is not a cha right next to you? they're the slightly more blocky ugly thing floating in space next to the huge ugly stick. i hear told they have a bit of room in them.sarcasm aside, allowing ships with charges in them, this makes sense. you want to be able to respond to an enemy potentially before they jump through and having your different ammo types already prepared is a good thing. this also applies to extra ships brought into battle by a carrier. but for the liquid ozone, how hard is it to keep some spare in the cha and spend 1 minute to pop it in your bay.i see where you were going with this but i just can't give it support."
9/27/2010,"with respect to your first item in the list, afaik, it already allows this, provided your intended target is on the same grid as you are and your intended target is not in warp.2nd item, dunno if that would be helpfull, maybe on short engaments3rd itenm, could be usefull4th item i have no problem with"
9/27/2010,"this has already been raised with the exception of the remove when killed option. i assume you mean is in a pod, because being podded reverts them to the off grid state.i'd rather the watch list didn't autoremove people and the ship type column option would make it unnecessary."

9/27/2010,"i keep trying to think of reasons why this shouldn't be implemented, but i can't. i will say that i'm not sure why you would ever have two ""for-real"" characters on the same account, rather than starting a new account every time you want to train a new character (or to receive a character purchased from the bazaar)... but even so, that's no reason not to implement this.so, supported."
9/27/2010,"crap! i have to hesitantly support this i guess. my biggest problem with this is the fact that i currently have three accounts with all three slots used on each and i actually use all nine of those characters. if this were implemented, i would most likely go broke."
9/27/2010,make it more easy and less expensive.if you start training on the 2nd char cut the training points of each char by 50%.

9/27/2010,"instead of adding this option, add a tiny 2d squares do not kill my client button. see supreme commander for examples. adding support anyway because some people have ****ty computers and this might help them."
9/27/2010,"i see your point - with this in effect, even players on high-ennd machines who would like to enjoy the visuals could feel ""forced"" to remove them in favor of better performance. however, i do not think this will be a large issue, as a current-day computer can easily handle small to medium scale engagements even running fluently at full details. in large fleets (which are what this proposal is aimed to help with), you have better things to do than enjoy shiny spaceship models.i agree with the last point, brackets shouldn't slow the game down as much as they do now. however, i have no issues when i turn off brackets for drones, even if i leave all the other brackets off. (meaning, the performance with brackets on or off is roughly the same, and the thing that matters is the number of ships on the field.) flying with brackets completely off is nearly impossible, because you lose all positional information. the ship models are too small to be visible from the usual zoom ranges, and there is no way to tell a friend from a foe.thanks for the support and for comments so far."
9/27/2010,"although your suggestion is logical, i doubt that ccp will even consider it.just imagine headlines of all major mmo related web sites:""ccp's newest graphic engine expansion includes removal of ships."""
9/27/2010,"supported, this would be very useful."

9/27/2010,"hello!i would like the option to set a system destination for fleet, for example if i want my fleet to go to null sec to kill some scrubs i could type in, say, p3en-e solar system into the chat box, link it, and then right click. as fleet boss or fleet commander though, there could be a new option ""set destination for fleet."" there could also be similar options for squad and wing commanders, just in case you want one wing or squad to go somewhere else, though someone in the fc spot could override those directions, and a fleet boss would override the fc. the route generated for the fleet would also be according to the fc/wc/sc settings, which are prefer low sec, high sec, or shortest, and override a squad member's preferences in that way.if this has already been suggested, please show me the earlier thread and i will discuss it in there."

9/27/2010,why?
9/27/2010,"no they dont. highsec missions have been nerved already enough. the only way i would agree is, if you have to grind so long for the ganking that you need as long as your victim to recover. ganking a 2.5 bisk ship would mean shooting rats in low sec for that value (about 2500-5000 times). play your game in the regions that are provided for that and let the highsec missioners play their game. other then that crying for ganking support by not getting concorded, makes you worse then the meanest carebear. accept eve for what it evolved into or quit. its as easy as that."

9/27/2010,"this is a fantastic way to counter supercap proliferation.1) all supercaps have shootable subsystems which affect them as they take damage:electronics (affects lock range and scan res)engineering (affects capacitor)navigation (affects align time eventually disables jump drive)defensive (disables local and remote repair modules+gang links)offensive (interferes with drone control and hi-slot modules)2) only certain ship classes can lock these subsystems:t1 frigatesassault frigates (oh look, a role for them!)tech 2 / tier 3 sniping bs (finally i can have a t2 rokh)3) subsystems cannot be remote repaired, but are made of shield and renegerate after a certain period.4) supercaps can fit new modules to increase subsystem resistance/regeneration at the cost of missing out on their usual modules.5) a refinement to the broadcast system , allowing fc's to broadcast a given subsystem target for fleet memebers in the relevant ships to focus on. this all combines to provide a viable role for new players in 0.0 combat, opportunity to give new roles to abandoned ship classes/weapons, and makes super capitals vulnerable to something besides simply having more supercaps.ccp could even incoporate this into the new player experience, rookie pilots doing their part to take down multi-billion isk behemoths. after a few training missions disabling sub-systems on npc capitals they will be ready to take on real ones in 0.0"

9/27/2010,"you'll notice on the propsal that it mentions character sales and seperated from selling plex, with no other dialogue.the only problem i have with character sales is plex - as stated above, everyone had equal oppurtunities and choices to trade chars before plex. -t'amber"
9/27/2010,"calm down, and take a deep breath. then reconsider your logic, fall of your horse and maybe read what i've written and then think rationally.people obviously have a problem with this system, as you can see the reactions from players already. what would you have rather had, that we discuss this after it was implimented in game? can you seriously discount so many players opinions so quickly or are you all consumed by your logic ? this is what the csm and alternates are supposed to do - represent the players, get their opinions and get them to vote. why not go and post a counter proposal written for this feature and include all your logic and arguments for it for people to consider.i haven't used plex recently, and my issue is with where it could lead, not so much with the benefits you could possibly get. if i'd wanted to make it completely biased i'd not have included or added the cons, once i've seen all the evidence for and against i will vote and make my decision based on all the arguments and what everyone has said and feels. the issues that i have with plex are outweighed by the benefits of having them ingame (such as helping to slow down rmt)and as yet i don't see why remapping needs to be done with plex - why not do it with isk, or tie it to an existing completely ingame mechanic? -t'amber"
9/27/2010,how much money would ccp be able to put in their pocket with that kind of mechanic?
9/27/2010,"right, so we're both being irrational? ""people,"" did not write anything, by in large, but ""signed, wtf ccp!11"" in response to this issue. i interpret this as group-think and herd mentality given the amount of uproar you suggested in your own posting. i do, freely, discount any players opinion if it makes no logical sense. if someone told you that buying regular unleaded was a terrible trajedy, but buying premium gasoline was perfectly legitimate, what would you say? i'd say ""you're not being logical."" i agree, what you should be doing as csm is presenting arguments, facts, and attempting to justify opinions of the devs with those of the players, but you didn't do that here. you took a clearly stated position from the very title. you didn't open anything for debate, you merely opened the topic with a suggestion that it be disapproved of and mocked. this is extremely poor form on your part. fristly, i'm aware that you have used plex recently, but thank you. secondly, in what way was your post unbiased? are we going to argue semantics of just ""how biased is biased?"" the issue you are trying to create is one that already exists. that was the point i made. there is no appreciable benefit to this system over the old method of more alt accounts. you can argue that this is some intangible line being crossed by expanding micro-transactions, but you cannot pretend that the system for rl cash being turned into in-game advantages does not already exist."
9/27/2010,"first, nobody's unbiased, and stop creating the straw-man argument that t'amber should be. she represents the interests of the majority of players by her very nature as a member of the csm. second, stop equating popular support with a mindless horde mentality. people have posted valid reasons both on this thread and on many others as to why plex for sp/remaps is a bad idea. third, pics or t'amber using plex recently didn't happen."
9/27/2010,"representatives of the public should not present their own -personal- bias. wether or not they have one is their own business. niether of you have a psychic link to the ""majority,"" of players. hell, the majority of eve does not even read the forums and they certainly do not have anything to do with the csm. i'm asking for a factual discussion of what seperates the current plex system, mutli-account playstyle, and pre-existing game mechanics from this new proposal to cause any negative consequence as a result of it's launch. there have not been many arguments to this effect. what there have been are a high number of ""wtf,"" ""signed,"" -insert rediculous hyperbole-, posts that have been in large part parrots of an obviously popular figure's opinion(s). you have been no diffirent.so, i encourage you to debate the facts as they are, rather than try to take some kind of false ""majority,"" high-ground. the sooner you, t'amber, or anyone else is willing to have that discussion, the better.i've made it abundantly clear that the so-called ""major"" advantage this offers characters is in-reality a miniscule bump in training speed over what one can already achieve by training delegation over multipul characters/accounts. i've also made it clear that the correlation between money to spend on plex and appreciable benefit in-game already exists in many ways. i would like to debate the efficacy of these arguments rather than the statistics of one's supposed constituency and the supposed opinions of csm members that i have not even seen to post on the matter yet."
9/27/2010,"you're doing a couple different things at once, which is pretty impressive. you confuse bias with opinion. bias implies she has some sort of malevolent tendency to present an intentionally wrong view of things. t'amber does not. second, you make the case that she is presenting only her own opinions. judging by the 25+ page thread in assembly hall, she is not alone in thinking that plex for sp/remaps is stupid.oh i'm sorry, i must've missed the part where you had access to the precise statistics about this. while nobody has a psychic link to the minds of the majority of players (and nobody's said anything about one before now) what is out there suggests that you are in fact talking out of your cloacal cavity.pass whatever you're smoking this way, please--i'd like to try some.so, in your opinion, something must be stupid if a lot of people agree about it. okay.i thought that's what this thread and the threads i linked were about. preeeeeetty sure. but i could be wrong. those threads could, in fact, be about corynebacterium sepsis.you've made it abundantly clear that you have no intention of changing your views based on facts, logic, and any other outside stimuli short of a scantily clad exotic dancer. that's about it.welcome to eve. it's a cold, harsh universe, and having fifteen bucks won't fix your mistakes."
9/27/2010,"the debate about who has a finger on the pulse of the eve-playing public is just sad folivos. i'm debating the issue and saying that you do not have statistics. nowhere did i claim to have the support of popular opinon. and a 20+ flame thread about a sisi change? well now, hold the presses, i've never seen that in all my years... get back to me when you're ready to talk about the plex issue at hand and not debate mythical statistics and support based on a glorified troll thread. you've offered absolutely nothing here but strawmen of your own. and pre-cluding any discussion with ""but you won't change your mind,"" is the worst kind of cop-out.welcome to eve -by ccp- where my irl cash already gives me a license to print isk and as many training alts as i want. so keep on trolling if you like, it will keep this post bumped and perhaps someone with the intellect to give a meaninful discourse on the matter will emerge.so when this goes live, can i have you stuff?"
9/27/2010,u mad bro?
9/27/2010,"if i'm mad, can i have your stuff?"
9/27/2010,"1) you're still trying to change the subject rather than admitting you were wrong when you tried to defend the fact that a 9-kill account is, dishonestly, being represented as a pvp main. 2) this is really off topic and people can look at the linked thread anyways to see that, as per the op, ""bullies"" (aka ""griefers"") were defined not as people trying to get other to leave the game, but almost anybody who wardec'd someone else who didn't want to be dec'd. or how you thought it would be a good idea if corps could just pay concord to be wardec proof. or where you alleged that it was ""hard corp [sic] griefers"" who were the ones telling others to htfu. perhaps how you defined ""griefers"" not as those trying to drive other people out of the game, but people who'd farm corps who respond to a wardec by paying a ransom."
9/27/2010,"daool is correct. if one looks back through the usual suspects comments on ankgate, pvp fundamentalism, or this discussion of low sec, misrepresentation is their stock and trade. no amount of reasoning will change that. you can't make the irrational reasonable. even so, far more read these threads than the few forum griefers who try to shout the loudest. they may not contribute to these debates, but they can see such posts for what they are -- dogmatic, intolerant and hostile.a bitter screed will follow this post, of course, now that i have my very own, personal stalker. that is all to the good, as far as i am concerned, as it drives the point home. cheers, delilah"
9/27/2010,don't let the thread hit your ass on the way out.
9/27/2010,"unfortunately i think that was just petulance, not a ""you won't have me to kick around anymore!"" mmm hmmmm. figured out yet how you spend all that time ""pvping"" and yet somehow not flying a combat prober, tackler, dps ship, logi... same old, same old. people talk facts, you make vague handwaving gestures about ""misrepresentation"" and then, just-so-happen to be unable to discuss specifics. just like ank's own words were ""smears"". just like everybody who plays a pvp game is a ""fundamentalist"" and people who point out how full of it you are are ""griefers"". loltrolling? you sling insults and bull****, and then preemptively hop up on the cross moaning about how people might say something mean, and ""grief"" you? heh, toss out the bait and then complain that you may have gotten some bites on that bait. anyways, get down off the cross, it's going to be winter soon and we'll need the wood. you seem to have the same sort of mental issues that ank did. now you think anybody is ""stalking"" you? is the cia spying on you through your dental filling, too? two bits of advice: first, you're not important enough for anybody to care about enough to follow you (and of course there's the fact that nobody actually is following you and it's your own crazy paranoia, that anybody can check by looking at the threads you post in and who posts in them with you). and second, when you start seeing a grand conspiracy of griefing stalkers when people simply point out your bull****, you need to up your dosage."
9/27/2010,"not sure where i tried to change the subject. i simply answered to a particular point.as for delilah, my statement was ""any such pvp toon"" as i assumed she wouldn't be silly enough to point out obvious missrepresentations and trolling from a main (oh......hang on.......that's probbably just what i'm doing - if so then so be it although i've never made any statements of any pvp knowledge, quite the opposite in fact though slowly learning).as for the liked thread, you again missrepresent it (pattern much ). you say ""a good idea if corps could just pay concord to be wardec proof"" when wardec proof was not, never has been, and never would be my position. the position was merely to allow for the real life aspect of where money has supposedly allowed concord to look one way to allow a war, that it should also provide the possibility of them looking back again. and also don't assume a statement made that certain features be implemented are done out of a desire to use them (never paid to avoid a war yet and never will, nor docked up nor run from). not everyone posts only in self interest."
9/27/2010,"the point where you went from absurdly defending delilah's lies about her being a pvper to distorting your comments in another thread and trying to keep the conversation on that point instead. perhaps how you still refuse to admit that delilah's claims about being a pvper were obviously false. glad to clear that up for you. as the one trolling and making misrepresentations is delilah (and now you, go figure) you don't have much of a point. of course, yet again, you're attempting to change the subject from the fact that delilah was lying when she claimed that she pvp's and loves it. but nice paranoia there. a pvper has to be very careful about posting on the forums lest... people pvp with them!!! which would be bad!!! ayieeee!stalkers!!! indeed, pattern exactly. someone points out something that's going on, a few of the usual suspects furiously wave their hands while shouting ""look over there!"" nothing was misrepresented, and i already linked to the thread, so folks can see you're not telling the truth. for instance, you just lied about something where i can quote the original thread. let me guess, your own words are a ""misrepresentation"" of your own words, and i'm ""griefing"" you. yes? are you also afraid of stalkers?"
9/27/2010,"right, because for all we know eve's main problem is always having not enough (new) content as opposed to stability, bugfixes and gameplay issues..."
9/27/2010,"uhm, priority can be low or high. funny you would be assuming that the csm would be asking new stuff to be made a high priority instead of pushing to lower the priority as compared to what's alread in eve that could use some ""luvin' (tm)"".the point is the csm should be providing that sort of feedback.issler"
9/27/2010,now i feel like wanting pizza :/
9/27/2010,you do realize that all of you who voted no for the pizza are not get re-elected right?
9/27/2010,"what you don't know is that we checked with ccp and the reply was ""implementing pizza delivery would halt all development on eve"".the reason for this is that ccp devs, as part of their campaign for excellence, would insist on exhaustive testing of the pizza delivery mechanics, to ensure that they, and the toppings, were properly balanced. given the number of possible pizza permutations (even if we exclude pineapple as just plain wrong), it would take years to properly test, and would cause a tripling of the coronary disease rates in iceland.after much internal debate, most of us realized that the vast majority of eve players have already demonstrated the ability to overpay for bad, cold pizza, and so the feature wasn't really needed."
9/27/2010,"only me and deidra vaal had the pepperonis to stand up to the health food lobby and vote for what we believe in. and what we believe in, is pizza. for we know what is in the hearts of the players. what is in their hearts, are in their stomach. this csm has exposed itself as corrupt and compromising, that it will bend to any smallest pressure, like so many congresses and home owner's associations. no pizza for you, eve players, for the csm majority has ruled instead, ""let them eat cake"". also, condemning pineapple users as ""wrong"" is plain racist and not acceptable in a family friendly institution such as eve online.also i lolled"

9/28/2010,"mea culpa... post was intended for the other thread before (and i was informed after i posted it that the thread is locked).no - i don't think that trialists should be blocked from doing anything that would result in concord retaliation. what i think is, that ccp should do something about it. there are many players who obviously know much more about the concepts. i also have no idea how many trialists go directly into the lowsec/pirate business. i think not too many genuine one (trial account is not always the same as a fresh new player to the game, but if you have longer plans with an account, you can pay for it right away!).suicide ganking should ruin one's career - but if you can do it without actually paying for an account, you don't care at all. of course it's not easy to answer what should be permited for trial accounts - but then - even now you can't fly industrial ship! i bet more ppl would rather fly indy than doing suicide ganks. so even making all players invulnerable to trial accounts should work. you can still kill trialist - and you'll be punished. trialist can still do other kinds of crime - steal stuff or shoot a gate. ;-) but he just can't do the suicide for profit - without any real punishment. one nonpaying ""customer"" is ruining game for paying one. if someone pays and decides to suicide me... ok, here i am. ;-)"
9/28/2010,"i'm not contradicting myself. over a 2 year period, the person sticking to 1 remap to switch from int/mem to per/wil will achieve the same training goals as the person switching infinitely many times between int/mem and per/wil remaps.at present we have no option but to use the same remap for 12 months. if you plan carefully, you can prepare a more-than-a-year plan involving just your int/mem skills (electronics, engineering, science for starters) and a more-than-a-year plan involving just your per/wil skills (spaceship command, t2 ships, weapons).just because you aren't using a 15+9 remap for one specific set of skills for 12 months doesn't mean noone is doing it. you are a sample size of 1, in a population of over 300k. a sensible person will realise that after basic ship flying skills are taken care of, many support skills and learning skills fall into the same int/mem skill plan: cap, shield, cpu, pg, ewar, targeting, etc. so once you can fly a basic ship, spend a year focussing on support skills.the addition of learning skills and implants diminishes the impact of a neural remap on sp/hr. the people who will lose the most when comparing one remap per year versus remaps on demand are those people who refuse to train learning skills or use implants. a remap in this instance can add 200% to the sp/hr acquisition. once you add learning skills and implants the difference in sp/hr acquisition is reduced to ~50%.where an infinite-remap character will get an advantage is on training plans that involve switching between more attribute plans than total years spent training. thus switching frequently between int/mem and per/wil gives an advantage in the 2-year timeframe, at the end of which the 1-remap-per-year player will have caught up. switching between int/mem, per/wil and cha/wil gives an advantage in the 3-year timeframe, so you could be flying a command ship before your friend. by the end of 3 years your friend will catch up and eventually be flying that command ship with the same skills, for far less isk or rl money spent on remaps.if one was to use plex for remaps over the course of a year to squeeze into a command ship faster, one would spend about a billion isk on remaps. it might be cheaper in the long run to simply buy a character off the bazaar with the appropriate skills already in place.some people are money-rich, others are time-rich. on the one hand, we complain that money-rich people will gain an advantage by buying remaps or characters. on the other hand we complain that the time-rich people are running missions all day so they must be macros.let's be clear about one thing: you don't have to be money- or time-rich in real life to be isk rich in eve. selling remaps for plex simply means those with the smarts can build their isk fortunes and gain a temporary advantage over other players in the short to medium term."
9/28/2010,"don<U+FFFD>t introduce this f... microtransactions in eve! i stopped playing every mmo who do this and try to extract some extra bucks from me, the end.. they got nothing from me"

9/28/2010,"neural remaps via plex has little to no affect so this proposal is simple a waste of time. t'amber has exaggerated the effect and thus caused everyone to blindly give thumbs up. i suggest you all do your own research before following some loud mouth csm member. she doesn't even have all the details, yet is raging about it.not supported!"

9/28/2010,"the proteus electronics subsystem the cpu-eg at present offers:+1 low and +3 mid slots+360 cpu with an extra 5% per skill level65 km targeting range and a scan res of 225 (before skills) with a sensor strength of 17i have been eft warrior'ing like mad trying to place this subsystem with a combination of other however i have found it completely redundant. one of the other three other subsystems is always a better choice for what role you would like to fill. if you want an un-probable command ship, use a dissolution sequencer for the sensor strength bonus. if you want to pve explore use the emergent locus analyser and the friction extension processor gives you long range warp disruption/scramble capabilities. none of the fits i've been looking at require the ammount of cpu the cpu-eg offers and all the subsystems offer +1 low and +3 mid slots.i think this subsystem needs a dramatic redesign to something useful or an entirely different subsystem. i'd like to discuss what these could be and the possible implications of such changes.i think the first change should be that the cpu-eg should give +4 (maybe even +5) midslots instead of +1 low and +3 mid.this would give players who are designing a proteus fit who really want another mid slot an option.another change could be that the cpu-eg also offers +50 mbit drone bandwidth and +50m3 drone bay. this would give the proteus, when combined with the drone offensive subsystems, that magic 125 mbit drone bandwidth.so what are some of the implications of these changes?well the pve aspect first.potentially you could have a passive shield tanked proteus with a defence efficiency of roughly 600-650 with 570 dps using 3x 250mm failgun ii's. you're also left with a 3 utility high slots. (t2 fitted)another pve fit would offer an active armour tank with a de of 450 and 630 dps with blasters, dual webs and an ab perma running. also with 2 utility highs.(t2 fitted)pvp possibilities.the shield gank would offer 830 dps and 86.8k ehp (give or take depending on how you like to fit) with 5x neutrons and 4 ogre ii's with only a warp disruptor/scrambler. (web/more tank would be possible if the cpu-eg offered +5 mids)an armour buffer tanked pure drone boat would offer 730 dps and 109k ehp. hardly out of this world performance. you'd also have 3 utility highs that you'd struggle to fill with anything power hungry.an armour buffered gank boat would offer 870 dps with 113.6k ehp (t2 fit) with a spare mid for dual point/web/eccm/sebo. hardly utterly mental.does anyone else have any suggestions or can see something glaringly wrong with this idea and yes i know that you could potentially get 150 mbit bandwidth with this but that would only be useful if this subsystem let you also fit a drone control unit, which to be honest, isn't that mad either."

9/28/2010,im sorry some people have ruined you forum reading experience. i can see you problem and i for one will make sure that the alliance im a member of will know of this problem and behave in the future. if you encounter further problems please contact me in game and ill make sure the space police are in their ships and ready to give you and hand. you might want to get a hold of the forum police and have them investigate. yours truly.rastino cryptonym sleepers
9/28/2010,"this thread was doomed from the start, so to speak ;-)honestly, there are funny comments and there are totally useless comments. i think an anthropologist should have a look at this behaviour, cos this is how people start behaving when they don't have to fear any consequences... i go as far as saying that most people who write such useless comments to get some attention online would never dare to do a similar thing in public - just because it would ruin your reputation... now online your reputation is of no concerner 'cos you can always make a new account right? :-/just not enough intergrity out there.my opinion ;-)regards, lax"
9/28/2010,u mad bro?
9/28/2010,"no, he came off more as amused then anything else."
9/28/2010,ahhh cool are you the linguistic professor then? im so confused right now.
9/28/2010,as am i. want to be confused together over a bottle of good whine at my place later?
9/28/2010,right now this upgrade is worthless. no one uses it. time to make a change.level1 - will create a wormhole to a random system2 - will create a wormhole to a random system in a specified region3 - will create a wormhole to a random system in a specified constellation4 - will create a wormhole to a specific system5 - will create a wormhole to a specific planet or belta lot of alliances have worked hard to clean filth from their regions. it is about time they got something to keep hitting the fools no matter if they hide on the other side of eve.
9/28/2010,haven't you been banned yet?
9/28/2010,"quite often. also non-corp members can't see inside or take from cha's. if i want to launch a cyno ship for another alliance member i need to **** around with launching a can, change overview settings to find it and put ozone inside. and that's assuming the can appeared in transfer range of my ship - they quite often don't for larger capitals.about as hard as keeping ammo in a cha. it's an extra and entirely unecessary mechanic that only serves to waste time and complicate matters. it needs to go."
9/28/2010,what's that? the dissenting cry of someone who's never owned or operated a carrier for anything beyond missions?shut up
9/28/2010,"also agree. lo is used to fuel jump bridges as well, so most of my ships have a quantity on lo in the cargohold as well. that, and the cyhoships end up being a real pain with having to manually remove lo before putting a ship in an sma (and remembering to take the lo again afterwards)"
9/28/2010,"there are many people who deactivates their accounts for a period of time for various reasons, then returns back to the game. as we all know the skill points that could have been gained in this period lost forever, and there are many characters with high character age and low sp level out there. my proposal is to allow paying for the past months unpaid subscription fee for gaining those ungotten skill points. please read the following q & a for understanding the scoop of this proposal better. what is the benefit of this proposal? ccp will get paid for the months the account was deactive, and hopefully it will encourage more people to return and stay around longer. also if any active player deactivated his account for couple months in the past, he will be able to match his sp level to his character age. how is this system will work? deactivated (unpaid) months between the account deactivation, and reactivation dates will be calculated and the player will pay regular subscription fee for these months either using plex or out of game payment methods (ccp's choice). once paid, the minimum amount of sp a player can earn for the given months will become available to the player. please note that player will not be getting any learning skills or implement bonuses, only the base skill points without any modifications. since implementing this system into the client would be difficult, it can be accessed through eveonline web site , under account management. player will still be required to buy all the missing skill books before those skill becoming available to him over the webpage, and he wont be able to assign any sp to a skill unless all the prerequisites of it are already filled. nobody will be allowed to gain skill points higher than his character's age allows. also this system will not be available for trial accounts, which means if a person opened a trial account but never paid first months fee+activation fee a year ago, he wont be able to use this service. what about the people who stayed online and played eve. isn't this unfair? people who stayed and played eve will still have many advantages compared to this. first of all, since this system will not allow any sp modifiers, the amount of sp a 2 years old character can gain will always be lower than other 2 years old characters who remained active due to affects of learning skills and implants. besides if a player didn't pay for last one years fees, he will be paying 179.4 (14.95x12) only for the skill points, while the player remained active got a chance to actually play and enjoy the game, he made more isk, made new friends, and gained experience at the top of the skill points. this system will barely allow old characters to come closer to the active characters of same age, but he will never be able to match or exceed them. doesn't this system encourage character farming? people can just open an account, suspend it, and pay for all the skill points couple years later without bothering themselves with skill training que. if this is the concern, ccp can limit this service to credit cards and can bring one credit card can be used only for one account rule. since an average number of credit cards each person owns is limited, this would stop people trying to abuse system at bigger scales. thank you for reading this proposal. i am looking forward to hear your comments."
9/28/2010,absolutely not supported... having active skill training is part of the privilege of an active subscription; ghost training was killed some patches ago for this very reason. it would ultimately hurt player balance and ccp's bottom line.
9/28/2010,"this, tbh.it will encourage character farming, no matter how you slice it. ""character for sale: 25 million unspent skill points!!""no thank you."
9/28/2010,"nope.we're all now dumber having read this proposal. i award you no support, and may god have mercy on your soul."
9/28/2010,"one of the main problems of this proposal: how many sp/hour do you use for the equation?who says your char wouldnt have lost sp to podding when you had actively played.that said ... not supported. you didnt play, you have no sp."
9/28/2010,"ok, you may not want to let the sligthest advantage you have to go as an old, and active player, even though it wouldn't take anything away from you, and could have brought you more skillful players to play the game with. but it can bring good amount of income to ccp's wallet , which may translate into better development, and it may encourage more people to return the game as well, if they are willing the cover their unpaid months.anyway, it is a proposal, thank you for reading, and responding to it."
9/28/2010,"i was wondering if there is a way to see someones afk on the alliance potriat and corp potrait so then i can place my self on afk status so people know i,m away from the keyboard ."
9/28/2010,"should be interesting to have a ""light"" carrier with the only purpose to provide small roaming gangs new ship when some member are destroyed.when i say light i mean cheap and with (of course) limited capacity something the size of a bs hp / manoeuvrability wise and same price, with very limited number of high slot and a little cargo and a rather big hangar but nothing excesive i would say a hangar that could contain 4 frigate sized ship or 2 destroyer sized or 1 cruiser sizedthis way in roaming gang when somebody see his ship destroyed instead of being nulltoo ****ed of because he's in a pod and now he can't follow the gang anymore and must go back in a station x or xx jump away to get a new ship (if it's worth it to come back....), the light carrier could jetisson a new fitted frigate ""ready to use"" and then he could continue to have fun"
9/28/2010,"oh sweet, some developer must have traveled back in time and implemented this while we weren't looking!i think it's called an orca!"
9/28/2010,"read again, or eventually read more than the title if u can"
9/28/2010,why does it need a new ship when a real carrier with cloak can do that job just fine?
9/28/2010,"my guess is they want to be able to use jump gates, not cynos, and the price tag of the carrier doesn't meet the ""cheap"" request in the op.that said, the orca does already do what you want - unless you're roaming in battlecruisers, in which case pony up the cash for an actual carrier and deal with it.not supported."
9/28/2010,"orca cost 300+ m and is very slow i want something more able to follow the quick roaming fleet not something that will slow it an orca 400k hangar can hold near 15 fitted frigate, me i want (to lower the price) something like say 100k to put 4-5 frigate in itorca can do the job for a fleet of like 50+ guy the ship i want would be for team of 10 guys or such"
9/28/2010,"lol, you want something that can carry multiple ships and should be able to follow a fast roaming gang? you dont really notice that this cant work?even a bs would fall behind after 2-3 jumps of burning. so the first ship you would mostlikely loose is the ship with all your spare ships.that said ... a carrier seems to be the better alternative. it can jump directly to your position and bypassing all gate camps. once the carrier gave you the ships it cloaks up/logs off and you can continue your roam.and i forgot to mention ... the plan with the orca would work differently:1. scout orca with cloak to a good strategic point in your roaming area (e.g. through wormholes)2. orca cloaks up/logs off in a safespot.3. when ever you need replacement ships you log in the orca.it helps if you scout the system to be sure you dont log the orca into a trap."
9/28/2010,seriously buy a carrier and have it cynoed in at a safe system or stop complaining that the guys you try to hunt kille some of your ships thereby ruining you perfect roaming gang.in short. harden the **** up!ps. the use of an orca work fine in wh
9/28/2010,i saw these on the internet earlier today and i thought you lot might find them interesting for new ship designs....
9/28/2010,"tbh, scrap the watch list, it only adds clutter to the interface that is already bad.everyone on overview that is in your gang has hp bar columns. problem solved. that way you can sort it however you want, apply tabs/filters/whatever. use ctrl+click to lock etc."
9/28/2010,"the issue with this, is i can't filter the overview to show the fcs ship, the scouts (even off-grid!), and all the shield logistics. in other words, not nearly precise enough filtering for what is the watchlist supposed to do."
9/28/2010,"true, i forgot about having people on list to warp to and such stuff. scrap my idea then :p"
9/28/2010,i think this is exactly the right idea.
9/28/2010,"it would be awesome to have this information in a column option like speed/transversal, you could add to you overview, would obsolete the watchlist for my small-gang needs! signed!"
9/28/2010,as it stands right now going thru jump bridges requires liquid ozone. that is fair and all but to carry around all that requires far too much space and is a logistical pain in the rear. i propose a remote liquid ozone module that goes in the high slot. this module will allow the jump bridge to sincronize with what you have in a hanger in the same region and remove the liquid ozone from there instead. to help balance this it would require 10-15% more liquid ozone to activate the bridge. possible roles to take it from a corp hanger would also be welcome.
9/28/2010,gtfo.
9/28/2010,"as it stands right now alot of people are trapped with their caps lock on, consuming alot of internets. that requires far too much space and is a huge pain in the butt. :di propose a remote caps lock module that goes in your pocket. this module will allow friendly players to synchronize with other peoples posting and reduce the caps in there. :das balance it would require 10-15% more pro posting to activate. possible other uses could also include remote emoticon reduction."
9/28/2010,when your idea is stupid you have to use bold caps lock to get your point across!!!!!!underlining may also help in the future!!!
9/28/2010,"your proposal sounds reasonable, but it doesn't make sense from the position of ccp - as was indicated it removes the commitment of the player to keep paying for the account once a desirable training level is reached. the %-based training of alts is nice, but still significantly affects the game mechanics of the game. if anything, what i would imagine to happen - if ccp decided to do so - would be to give each account 100% skill point allocation. either via each billing cycle or through some other mechanism allow the player to divide that percentage among each of the three slots. so, i can either train 3 pilots on a single account at 33.3% speed, 1 pilot at 100%, and so on. i think this would encourage the use of multiple accounts since it satisfies our needs as subscribers to know that we're achieving multiple goals. i have about 7-8 pilots, some dedicated, some not. its perfectly possible for me to consolidate to reduce the number of accounts i need to run, but if i could distribute out some allocation of training speed it would certainly make keeping that extra account a bit more desirable."
9/28/2010,i would train my jump freighter alt to do market stuff like i should have from the start. i would likely also get interceptors just for the sake of making instant warps. also maybe get the nav skills up a bit...
9/28/2010,**** yesthere has to be a better way than having to repack all amarr ships
9/28/2010,"this, but only for unpacked containers. containers that have not been assembled should not generate the warning as they cannot possibly contain items."
9/28/2010,"definately multiple clones per station.regarding the timer, imo make it depend on distance jumped."
9/28/2010,"what people are forgetting though is that even if eve supported this, there's about a second of background lag in this game at all times, which would either make flying on a joystick a nightmare, or in case client prediction was implemented, teleports around the grid if the ship was fast enough.thus, in eve this is not possible, even if there were no bandwidth issues."
9/28/2010,"agreed. i will then proceed to buy 500 accounts, train them all to drakes and apoc and solo own eve. awwwww yeah."
9/28/2010,"actually had this discussion in corp the other day. several ideas that were mentioned would be having specialized drones - ""suicide bombers"" for lack of a better phrase, that would be extremely expensive, effective only against caps, and require full use of the ships drone bays. alternatively would be to have a dedicated ship class that is basically a very expensive suicide ""bomb ship"" that detonates against on the capital ship. the pilot would most likely lose the ship and sent back to their clone or allow a special cap mod that allows pilots to relaunch for the cap ship. the balance would be in the ratio of isk required to build up a fleet of these drones and/or ships versus the cost to build the cap, and set such that the use of these new mechanisms isn't a catch all solution to capital engagements but only utilized when the strategic nature of the op is of the utmost importance that the sacrifice is willing to be made."
9/28/2010,"the yield for these exploration sites are very low, and the tech 2 bpcs are mostly useless. i suggest tripling the salvage loot and replacing the bpcs with something better, perhaps tech 2 ship bpcs."
9/28/2010,this has already been passed by the csm and will be one of the issues presented to ccp ahead of the december summit.
9/28/2010,"please don't conflate the concepts of ""pve player"" and ""carebear"". there are any number of hisec pvp corps who class as ""carebear"" since their playstyle involves very little (or at least easily quantifiable) risk such as the corps who only wardec industrialist corps in order to pad their killboards with a few hulk or hauler kills.mission runners, industrialists, inventors, market players - very few of these are actually carebears so much as income support for nullsec/lowsec pvp mains.carebears are the players who are risk-averse and will only engage in pvp when the outcome is predictable (and ideally, profitable)."
9/28/2010,gb2wowkthxbai
9/28/2010,would be a good option
9/28/2010,"or have two target lists, one for ""things i want to shoot"" the other for ""things"". in fact, the ""things i want to shoot"" list would be a queue instead.so you'd target ""things"", then add ""things i want to shoot"" to the ""shoot it"" queue. then liang's daisy-cutter approach will work just fine, as will the rr bs gang's ""rep some things but blow up other things"" approach.a simpler version would be to allow dragging targets within the target list, so your rr targets will always be the last things you end up shooting."
9/28/2010,"you may want to have your hand-eye coordination checked, there is some space between the ""reply to topic"" and ""new topic"" links."
9/28/2010,"no...and really, why would rr not be usable. you are receiving something from another source that is not impacted..."
9/28/2010,"problem, officer?"
9/28/2010,pros: there won't be a new ccp mechanic that allows some players to benefit more ingame than otherscons: real money trading happens regardlesspeople with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage alreadyccp has more plex to sellpeople can buy characters with iskthis feature could possibly help fixing skill messups and lazynessmaybe you read it again.-t'amber
9/28/2010,"and this is the part where you explain why this is 'new,' when i've been saying the same benefits already exist through diffirent avenues.if i give you a dollar and the next week i gave you four quarters, are you going to ask me why i'm giving you something 'new?' you're talking about two diffirent systems performing the same functional role and i have no idea how you can patently seperate the two without explanation."
9/28/2010,"players can always mine more, rat more, run more missions, whatever. the ability to make isk via plex is not a different type of activity than making isk any other way, it just differs in the specifics. being able to pay for remaps, however, is 100% different from the other methods available (e.g. shut up and wait a year)."
9/28/2010,"yes, but you do get a remap on each alt every year, and aside from the first year or so there's hardly a reason to remap additional times in the year-long period since you can cluster like-attribute skills."
9/28/2010,"remaps are always useful, and clustering has its limits. want to train up to dread v with racial capital gun v and all the jump skills to v? it's much more efficient to remap before each bunch of skills, otherwise your year's remap is only for the average of all the skills rather than one set. either that or you can nerf your training potential and only train a specific primary attribute and leave lots of neat stuff till the next year."
9/28/2010,"or you can plan for dread 5, capital weapon whatever 5, jump skills 5 before you create the character, and optimise the plan for the 1 remap per year plus free remap. the length of that training plan means you'll be wandering around in frigates with maxed out jump capabilities long before you can fly the jump capable ships.all the additional remap option buys is the ability to fly the dread earlier, catch up on support skills later.it will still take you just as long to get all those skills trained up, you just get to fly the dread with below-par skillset sooner."
9/28/2010,read it again.if you read under the cons is quite specifically states that people with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage already.-t'amber
9/28/2010,"you clearly have very little experience in programming, working with code cranked out by a ""four man crew in india"" or interfacing new technologies to legacy applications. the dev blogs stated quite explicitly that evegate was a proof of concept, where most of the work was done by their api development team to allow evegate to actually function as an interface into the eve game.i have had experience with code cranked out by a ""four man crew in india"" and i've had experience fixing code whipped up by some self-taught perl, ruby and python programmers in ""about a month"". in all cases, simply getting the code to be reliable, portable and maintainable took more effort than was expended by the original authors.the csm is not meaningless: they are now counted as stakeholders by ccp, to the point that changes proposed by csm have been incorporated into the game (because the change was on a list prepared by csm), even if one of the pending changes was accompanied by a ccp dev blog complaining about csm stealing their thunder ;)just that one devblog invalidates all of belloch's bellyaching about csm being a meaningless pr stunt.ps: yes, we're still waiting for that announced csm-instigated change to make it into the game (or rather, waiting for it to be acknowledged in patch notes)."
9/28/2010,"it seems like this csm is working hard for some good goals. not criticizing but realistically the csm does not represent what is best for the players: they represent what is best for the players engaged enough to vote. (87% did not vote. average voter age was over two years when the average subscriber does not last past 7 months.) nor does csm represent what is best for ccp or the game; i suspect ccp's shareholders would be better served by more efforts on the new player experience; lowering the learning cliff and retaining more subscribers. but there is no constituency for that among players and especially players who vote.you make a good point that a collection of buffs shouted out from the forums does not make a coherent development strategy. i see the value of csm to provide a sanity check that the designers are still connected to the customer base. some companies fail because they are bad; other fail because they are quite successful, use their success to validate their decisions and grow out of touch with their customers. the minutes seemed to show some surprise from ccp regarding player perception of excellence. it would be very nice if each release, ccp fixed most of what players consider most important bugs. and regardless of what thematic plans the developers have for rockets or eafs or incursions, there are things like fonts, the pi click fest, the pos/corp/s&i user interface ... that could be prioritized and fixed. i am not saying they should use focus groups and usability labs like non-game or large game software companies do. but it so easy for developers or players who have been playing for five years to not understand the frustrations - be they the grind of large alliance logistics or the confusion of newer players with some of the mechanics. hell, it's hard to prevent them from launching into 2006 stories of walking to school in the snow uphill both ways.the csm can provide ccp some filtered feedback on these sort of issues."
9/28/2010,"in my work on the csm, while obviously i carefully consider the opinions of the players engaged enough to spend time posting on ah and emailing (""the squeaky pod gets the lube""), i also try and consider the effects on the silent majority, and on new players in particular. my impression is that i am not the only csm who does this.i have consistently argued that improving the npe and making it easier for noobs to get hooked on our drug of choice is just smart business for ccp, and in the long-term interests of existing players. that is one reason that i sponsored the learning skills and the ui low-hanging-fruit proposals. i made one brief stab at crowdsourcing a set of npe tweaks earlier in the summer, but there was no response; i will probably try to do it again after incursion hits.while being an expert focus-group is a part of what csm does (though how expert we are is matter of personal opinion!), our primary focus is as an advocate for the players. realistically, the more input we get from the player base, the better we can do this job."
9/28/2010,"more players is good for existing players. eve's biggest strength is the social interaction, so the more people in the game, the more fun everyone is having (assuming the nodes don't go boom). more than any other mmo, eve puts a focus on working together with other players, which is why i'm amazed this element of the game is conspicuously lacking in the tutorial/npe."
9/28/2010,"does a subscriber who drops out of the game drop out because the game is just that broken, or because flying a speck around in a huge black field shooting at other specks just isn't their idea of fun gameplay? perhaps they don't like the grind and the amount of actual work that has to be done to progress in this game?does a subscriber who has been playing for over two years have a better understanding of the spirit, mechanics and fault of this game?does it make sense that the csm does, in fact, represent the player community since those who don't vote are obviously either happy enough with the game as it is, or wish to remain unhappy with the game because they enjoy being miserable (all those people who go to great lengths to proclaim how they're not voting because they don't believe the csm will achieve anything). how do you represent a playerbase who is already content with playing the game warts and all, and are content to accept whatever changes ccp implements?the 13% of the players who did vote consist of individuals who care enough about the game to want to have a part in determining the game's future, or of alliance goons who were ordered to vote their particular candidate in so the alliance could play the metagame of introducing new features beneficial to that alliance (such as trading the billions of isk they have lying around from their moongoo profits for pizza).yes, it's hard for players who are familiar with the game to identify with the frustrations of new players who are just coming to grips with the idea that you don't actually fly your ship in space. by the same token, it's hard for players who are familiar with any game to identify with the frustrations of new players coming to grips with complicated rule sets which make the game more interesting such as, for example, four ones beats four kings in poker.this is why the rookie help and npc starter corp channels are essential tools in the new player experience, along with the excellent tutorials that have been set up through the career agents."

9/29/2010,"why not give the new players the learning skills pre-trained to level 4. this should give enough training speed to make the starting easy, but not remove the question 'should i train a learning skill to l5 and gain benefits in the future, or should i go with a more immediate skill?'.also, the older players, who already trained them the hard way should receive the equivalent sp back (+a little bonus? [optional]) and the isk for the advanced books (which might not matter for a 2 year old char, but will make a difference for a 3 months old one).also, not supporting the original proposition, but the need to do something about the learning skills."

9/29/2010,"i agree that the proteus is a good ship. what i am saying is that the cpu-eg subsystem is completely useless. i am also offering something that could be done to change that. this is a discussion about this subsystem, not other ships."
9/29/2010,well the proteus already out tanks and out dps's all other gallente ships of equal size so i don't think that would do so much also the proteus costs 5 times more..
9/29/2010,"of the t3's, the proteus is my pick for pvp. it's got it all really, dps, tank and a 20km scram if you want it. the cpu subsystem is indeed rather crap. i've got a full rack of neutron ii's on mine and i'm going a little nuts with cpu usage and i've still got plenty left. that's the way it should be for any t3 ship of course given their price tag, but it also means the cpu subsystem is a bit pointless.i would like to see it changed to something more useful. giving it a drone component would be overpowered however. it's already the gankiest brawler t3, giving it the ability to use 5x mediums or 4+ heavies with any configuration using it just makes it stomp all over the others. and it's already superior. i think a better option is simply replacing it with a scan resolution subsystem like the legion has. it doesn't add tank or dps, just speeds up lock time. i suppose you could make it have +1 mid, -1 low compared to the other electronic subsystems.all that said, the legion needs a look first. the 10% cap usage per level bonus on all legion offensive subsystems needs to be replaced with a useful bonus. the whole reason the legion has such laughable dps is due entirely to it's complete lack of a damage bonus on half of it's offensive subsystems and the other half getting effectively only 2 damage bonuses instead of 3. this applies to many amarr ships however, the maller also needs that bonus changed to 5% rof or damage. so it's not exactly a problem unique to the legion."
9/29/2010,"while the maps refuse to show it, outer ring is dominated by player alliances. by the looks of it, it's between it alliance and ev0ke (hereby referred to as they).and by adding -yet another- bpo, and a skillbook, which is only available in 1 of 2 ore stations... ccp is further lining they're pockets.- they truck in bpo and books, selling in jita for huge profits.- they camp all the gates, collecting bpo and books from anyone foolish enough to try and sneak them out, selling in jita for even larger profits (no cost to them after all).- they are already making tons of money off the other bpo.so... how about ore (having once been a gallente organization) establish some field offices in gallente high sec. it's been long enough, i don't think they're in any danger of being reclaimed by the gallente federation.rp blah blah blahput some more offices up, particularly in places we can get to, without dying several times over in the attempt."
9/29/2010,"use a cov ops or preferably a t3 with interdiction nullifier and covert ops subsystem.make insta undock at station you want to buy it (hint: do it before the expansion). buy stuff, undock, use insta to get rid of possible bubble camps. that is also why a t3 is handy. after that just travel back. if really paranoid, make sure you got a black ops in system (you need a cov ops/recon to get it there via covert cyno), after using insta undock go to the black ops, let him bridge you back."
9/29/2010,i was wondering about this my self. how do you justify doing what they are? i support the op.
9/29/2010,"right, or...go to xyz system in essence/sinq, and buy it."
9/29/2010,this is cute. if you want to have fun ... look at the distribution of technetium moons and wonder why nanotransistors are just going up in price since the change from dysp/prom. ;)
9/29/2010,loli think you're looking for this thread.
9/29/2010,not really ... but i found it funny that you whine about a few skill books compared to billions from technetium moons. =)
9/29/2010,"billions in moon goobillions in bpo sales (noctis, covetor, rorq...)whatevertroll score: 1/10sorry!"
9/29/2010,"is it really that hard to go there on your own and buy it yourself?also here's a hint: buy more than one, and sell some for those sick high profits!"
9/29/2010,1. how many blueprints/skill books do you need to sell to make a few billions?2. everyone with a bit preparation can easily acquire the blueprints/skill books and haul them to empire. (as mentioned in the post #2 already)i would highly doubt that those stations are camped 23/7. (well maybe the first few days after the patch)so the accessibility is not really hindered.but keep your conspiration theories coming.p.s.: i think i would make the run with a covert ops + redeemer. 6000 m^3 redeemer can hold a lot of blueprints/skill books and bypass most gate camps.
9/29/2010,"spelling police! they fought and died for cloud ring, why should they not be allowed to profit? you want convenience, pay the price."
9/29/2010,"oh, so fight in a fleet battle or two.then guaranteed trillions in profit for the rest of your gaming career.got it!"
9/29/2010,"so getting rid of the other afk isk making moons worked pretty well but you just made a new bottle neck that is getting worse and worse 80% up in price over 3 months.my solution for this would be to open wormholes for moon mining, its already proved that pos take downs do happen, and it would generate more good fights if there was a reason to fight over your pos rather than go i don't care any way!"
9/29/2010,the problem with wh moon ming is that there are too many wh moons making them mine able would totally crash the market and t2 ships would cost probably less than t1 ones lol
9/29/2010,"there arent enough moons in wormholes to do that. doing this would finally open the mining of worthwhile moons to people with less than 10k allies. i dont see any reason not to do it.however at the same time, it is not exactly a fix. the issue is a completely fixed supply for the worthwhile moon minerals, hell it might even drop with increased demand due to being more time in reinforced, with an ever increase in demand. that is just a terrible idea."
9/29/2010,right now fail alliances that are mad because they can't hold a single system are purposly targeting easy prey by hot dropping super capitals on them. this is game breaking and needs to be curbed now.i propose that super capitals can only jump to a super capital cyno generator. this means of course that a new module needs to be introduced.super capital cyno generator:pg: 750cpu: 250base liquid ozone usage: 1000slot: high slotcapital cyno generator can only be fit on a battle cruiser or larger ship. each level of cyno theory reduces the liquid ozone consumption by 50.now if someone really wants to drop a super capital they need to really commit something instead of doing ultra risk free pvp. not sure about the fitting requirement on pg and cpu but it should be up there so a ship that fits the cyno has to commit a large portion of its resources to fill the role.
9/29/2010,"risk free pvp you say dropping a multibillion isk ship onto random people who might have friends with more supercapitals risk free pvp? i agree something needs to be done but your so full of c*** that i could swore you came out of your mom's a**.btw ban cromo effect for severe trolling, support linked thread and ban him"

9/29/2010,inviting people to gang only to exploit the mechanics like gang warping them to a sun or other celestrial because they lack the skill to kill them using normal mechanics has long been needed to be changed.supporting.

9/29/2010,"the idiot accepted a fleet invite from somebody who was killing him. everyone knows that when you join a fleet, you can't dock for 30 seconds. it's also common knowledge that every time your position in a fleet changes, you also can't dock for the same amount of time.if you are that dumb, to give some one who is actively attacking you the power to prevent you from using a station or star gate, you deserve what you got.hell, you might as well join his one man corp so he can shoot you on sight.edit: the only thing that was exploited was your own stupidity, op"

9/29/2010,"please give your definition of ""griefing"" and attach your ""story"" that prompted this thread so we may laug-- err... compare notes.no, seriously... what most mmos consider ""griefing"" may not be what eve considers ""greifing."""
9/29/2010,"in this game, ""griefing"" pretty much means taking extraordinary measures to abuse and/or harass a player or players over an extended period of time. ccp most likely decides whether or not an activity qualifies as griefing on a case-by-case basis.you have to try really hard for what you're doing to be considered ""griefing,"" though. frankly, it's a bad term to use in the eula, since ccp allows many actions that are griefing according to the standard definition of the word."
9/29/2010,"dear csm,something has to be done about the amount of help neutral pilots can give to other pilots of corporations at war. corporations declare war on other corps so they can pvp in hi-sec, which is fine, except they use their neutral alts in battle to repair themselves. these neutral pilots can't be attacked because concorde will intervene and they can't be made a war target because they are a member of an npc corporation. it gives anyone with the money to buy multiple accounts an unfair advantage.i recommend that any pilot who aids a corp member at war during a skirmish in any way that increases the fighting abilities of that ship be temporarily flagged as a war target for the opposing corporation.let me know what you think.thanks,strato"
9/29/2010,i think you're either stupid or trolling.try reading up on combat mechanics before posting again.
9/29/2010,"with remote repping this is already the case. as soon as someone rrs your enemy they will turn flashy and become fair game. not sure about other remote ""buffing"" modules (tracking enhancers and such). i do know that having a neutral command ship with active links will not be flagged.of course, if you do attack the [now hostile] neutral you won't get very far as rring does not constitute as ""aggression"" and they can simply dock up or jump through a stargate whenever they want to (i.e. when their tank starts to fail).this is the cause of many a proposal here in the assembly hall as well as the features and ideas discussion board (the proposals more or less saying that rring should constitute ""aggression"" to prevent nasty docking/gate games and such). the matter has yet to be resolved.edit: and none of the above is considered an exploit... just an fyi."
9/29/2010,apparently it is tooooo hard for new alliances to get into 0.0. so i guess they need a crutch to get those baby feet into the pool.change the anchoring and onlining time for an alliance that is less that 30 days old by 25%. that way they are not too cowardly and will make an attempt in 0.0.now there is no more excuses on why people still cower in high sec too scared for real pvp.

9/29/2010,definite quality of life improvement for cyno ships.
9/29/2010,"the fact that non-corp members cannot pull out of a cha is not the issue and adding liquid ozone to the list of appropriate items to be stored in a ships cargo while in an sma is not the answer. i will refer back to a previous example with the rigged iteron being packed with lo. that's not an intended mechanic and would serve to shrink eve even further. you would have an extra 30k worth of fuel to jump very far distances very quickly. i think that logistics should be tough to manage and if you need more fuel to get where you are going then you should invest in black ops and transport ships.as to me not using my carrier outside of missions, well i don't run missions and i most certainly don't use them for anomalies or complexes. but that doesn't really have any bearing on the discussion.ccp changed this mechanic for a reason that i happen to agree with and while it may make life easier, this change is not necessary."
9/29/2010,"no one is trying to do this. there is even a post above asking for the limit to be changed to a set 1k m3 instead of using an arbitrary whitelist of items. actually i think you might just be trolling - no one sane would suggest the use of black ops bs and transports to move ozone.i think the most ironic part is that people still use carriers + iterons to import minerals compressed as citadel torps. ccp's mechanic does not prevent that at all, yet it's exactly what it was introduced to stop."
9/29/2010,"there are much better options available if you use a jf, fyi"
9/29/2010,"well i guess where i live in crazy-land it's not insane to use transports to move fuel.i'm not trolling and my ideas aren't completely unhinged. i would just rather not see lo in sma's. there is a fuel bay inside of carriers specifically for the purpose of holding fuel, and if you are staging caps at a pos then you better have a cha there.and just because there is one ""exploitable"" mechanic by bringing in torps and melting them does not mean we need another one."
9/29/2010,"is it just me, or all the supporters from goonswarm? edit: well, all exept me one problem i have is that people will just cyno 50 supercarriers on your 5 man bs gang from fuel stashes in pos, wait, people are already doing that.actually, i see no reason to not allow lo inside smas, its put them in there or just leave a ton of iteron 5s inside the pos's bubble shield and cuase lag."
9/29/2010,i even thought there were some people dislike it.
9/29/2010,true!sorry didn't see the last post
9/29/2010,"hi,currently if there is something for selling 5999.99 isk and something for 6000 you will always get the ""cheaper"" item. i think the only reason for that is the server load you would have if you can choose the seller of your choice. if i click the 6000er item and want to buy it the guy with the 5999.99 sells his item to you for 6000. this imo destroys the market i think. i want to be able to choose of whom i buy my stuff.oh btw. for me its not the 0.01 game which sucks. the people who do the 0.01 are imo more feasible cause they dont't destroy the market prices. the guys who go from 359,000.00 to 159,000.00 cause market prices crashes."
9/29/2010,"translation: selling isk is too hard now because i have to fly to the ass end of the universe to find a station to buy that unit of tritanium for two billion isk. make it so i can do it from the comfort of jita plox.thank you, but no."
9/29/2010,"what is this babble?open the market, and shop for item x.when you see one you like, look over to the --> right of the price tag, and it'll show you where that item is located.then you buy it, and it will appear in that location, waiting for you.if you're talking about placing buy orders and having people in odd places, then limit your order to a few jumps, or to a specific station."
9/29/2010,no its not about bringing stuff to jita. i havent seen this post:
9/29/2010,"that's a bit more clear, but still...if you are making a buy order, which will sit for 89days waiting to be completely filled, then you get to specify how far out you are willing to travel for goods. if you select just that station, then you will only be buying products located in that station. if you select the whole region, then anyone could sell you stuff from anywhere in the region.if you are talking about real time shopping for items, then just make sure to choose the items that are located where you want them to be. if someone is selling an item for 750, but it's deep in camped 0.0 space, and someone else is selling the same thing for 900 in jita... you have to decide. do you want to pay extra for the safety, or pay less and risk dying?"
9/29/2010,"what possible reason (other than insanity) could you have for wanting to pay more than is necessary for something? afaik, the situation the op describes only happens when multiple sellers are in the same station."

9/29/2010,so with the amount of super capitals these days being fielded and with most alliances able to field 10+ super capitals at a time it has come to the point where keeping 10+ super capitals pinned down by hics and dictors has become nearly impossible so my idea is a capital interdictor which can create a 75km bubble so basically covering a battlefield.so why so large a bubble well when you jump in caps they literally bump everywhere so having such a large bubble will prevent a lot of them being bumped out of the bubble. also i would like to see these ships be able to survive a direct doomsdayamarr capital interdictor5 high slots (4 guns 1 capital point)4 midslots7 low slotscaldari capital interdictor6 high slots (5 launchers 1 capital point)6 mid slots4 low slotsgallente capital interdictor5 high slots (4 guns 1 capital point)5 mid slots6 low slotsminmatar capital interdictor5 high slots (4 guns 1 capital point)6 mid slots5 low slotsbonus for all these ships should be 10% bonus to the armor or shield hit points and 5% reduction in cap usage of the capital point module
9/29/2010,how will this survive 10 doomsdays and 350k dps (and the 30 heavy neuts attached to it)?introducing new (super) caps is completely stupid in the current state of supercap fleet sizes. fix moms/titans (including their log off timers tbh) and bring the paper/scissor/rock concept back in. because right now one part is really missing.
9/29/2010,does not need to survive 10 when most alliances would field at least 10 of them so even if it could survive 3 dds it would be good also its not a supercapital just a standard capital

9/29/2010,"since last expansion there is this bug when u hit jump on a gate. for some kind of reson it gives a session change timer while it isnt needed. this happends in random situations where there are none or 100 people in system where u jump from and to. this bug become only more worse when the load on one of the two systems is more heavier. in example because there is a fleet there. the session change timer makes u wait from 4 sec upto traffic control message (20 sec?). why am i posting here and not filling a bug report? apperantly bug reports are slow and devs are actualy reading this section carefully. there is nothing more annoying than gettting jump after jump the timer. it interrups fleetfights (form 10 to 200 people) and splitting up gangs. this is a bug that makes people think this game is broken.please hot-fix this bug, i am sure it is connected to other lag related issue's."

9/29/2010,"the underlined part proves that csm is a pile of junk. anyone i know was pleased and excited about the upcoming incursions. you obviously don't represent the players of eve anymore. since ankhe left this sad bunch, you became totally useless. i hope ccp removes the csm soon and uses the money for more meaningful things, such as the designing of a second beer ship for oveur. @topic: i agree, the black ops desperately need an improvement. my favourite suggestion is a star map navigation without cynos and the need of cyno alts (chose destination on the star map and the ship will land at a random point in that system (or next to the sun))."
9/29/2010,get the flying **** out of here. seriously. anke did not leave....it was removed due to nda violations and being a general useless ****.and take your ridiculous bobs idea elsewhere as well. re: somewhat coherent eve-uni dude commentary.....while i respect eve-uni and have often steered lost pilots to uni doors....just leave this one alone eh? white-knighting where its not needed and inappropriate just gets you flamed.
9/29/2010,"i disagree totally and if you'll read on i will explain.the csm have raised a huge amount of player requested changes to ccp over the last 2 years. some are pve, some are pvp, others are quality of life.so when we heard that ccp had already committed to producing yet another new game mechanic instead of fixing the existing but broken ones we had a duty to stand up for what the players had requested. this isn't a pve vs pvp issue, even ankh was arguing for dev time to be spent on improving the existing mechanics instead of creating new ones. the overall mood was that ccp have a history of implementing half finished new shiny content which is never completed and is left to rot (epic arcs, fw, cosmos, new sov etc).that isn't to say that the feature will not be good, just that the csm were united in pushing for the existing mechanics to be fixed as requested by the players.i don't like this idea at all, having to sneak a covert cyno fitted ship into the destination system is about the only real limitation on bridging right now.yes they are short range which could be looked at (but can be worked around by bridging to a closer staging system) and the bs themselves could do with a bit more hp but we are now seeing people frontlining remote rep black ops groups.i would quite like to see all blockade runners gain a second highslot and the ability to fit a covert cyno which would enhance their use as a fuel tender. also allowing people to drop fuel into (but not be able to take from) the black ops fuel bay would be good."
9/29/2010,i am starting to wish i had never started this thread because of the sheer amount of annoyance generated. mr daze....by your logic a titan should be tethered to a ****ing freighter to do what it does .fuel tenders. jesus ***** ****ing christ.you know...its a good thing that ccp pretty much ignores lolcsm suggestions and the general public at large **edit**while i really enjoy eve....and still pay via sub to support the devs....just want you dudes at ccp to be aware that i will not be remotely interested in emo-douche vampires online. just thought i'd mention that in case you were totally losing focus and interest in eve.....sometimes the bird in hand is better than the two in the bush you will never catch eh?
9/29/2010,"i'm not comparing titans to black ops, but even so a titan does need other ships to fuel it up at some point, but it does have a far larger fuel bay for various reasons ccp decided the bo bridge should use fuel and if you want to go roaming with a bo gang you have to make allowances for that. if you can make a case for that restriction to be removed without making them op then feel free to make it, i'm happy to discuss bo ships because i am one of those supposedly rare people who fly them lots.my suggestion above assumes that fuel will remain a requirement and that the fuel bay will never be big enough for some gangs. i'm certainly not happy that i need an industrial char following the gang around, but it does seem fair considering i can light a covert cyno and bridge into any 0.0 or lowsec system i like without being detected or cyno jammed.as i said, happy to discuss various ideas and there are a couple of proposals in the backlog so it should get addressed at some point..."
9/29/2010,"tl;dr: retain 'flavour' of lowsec leaving mechanics unchanged, increase target density and likelihood of pvp encounter off empire gates by normalising population densities in the three types of space.that's actually not a bad synopsis, apart from the first and last parts. and the latter part of the middle could use work. my suggestion would indeed turn low security space into a lower-security version of high security space. thank you for clarifying this for those who might've joined us late or otherwise missed my post.apropos of nothing, i did a pre- dt tour of genesis lowsec with this toon.other than a couple of half-hearted gatecamps on the empire/lowsec interface, i saw not a single soul. not one. in 9 jumps. now, granted i'm not a grizzled veteran with a list of killmails as long as my arm, but i think this lends weight to the assertion that lowsec (in genesis, in my tz) is a howling wasteland. a hive of wasted cycles and rack space.also, when did they take the guns off billboards? anyway:i've done some more thinking, and suspect that i've a solution that should please everyone: normalise the number of high/low/0.0 systems (exc. inaccessible bits of null, obv) to maintain the same population density in each of the three. maybe also bin gate guns? since you can kinda permatank them, they don't really achieve much of anything beyond irritating people.lowsec retains its unique flavour, and benefits from a higher target density. simultaneously, (comparitively) crowded space would get more systems. lowsec mechanics are unchanged.higher target density in lowsec.greater chance of a pvp encounter, either roaming or camping.come to think of it, get rid of all the lowsec mins, too. that way, we won't get threads constantly cropping up where carebears clamour for wholesale changes to lowsec that favour them at the expense of everyone else.run the normalisation on a monthly basis (so if more toons migrate to/from [space name], [space name] grows/shrinks to keep the population density about the same).i think that everyone's now happy. pvp'ers who don't want to get involved in null get bigger fights more often. empire carebears don't get an excuse to visit null, get blown up and jump on the forums to complain. 0.0 just keeps trucking. also: the line in my original about concord-ing sc was only written because i was thinking about sc farming of faction navy drops. it wasn't and isn't my intent to have sc's declared persona non grata in lowsec.eta: don't like my suggestions? omg, sowoti. as i said the first time, lowsec and every toon in it can biomass/emoquit for all i care. i'm just making suggestions to salvage wasted space."
9/29/2010,"no, my description of your original proposal was 100% accurate. your new proposal is worse, however. to begin with, population density isn't determined by the number of systems, nor is population density, in and of itself, a goal. gate guns also eliminate the utility of ultrafast tackle landing the first point. but the point remains that 'normalizing' systems accomplishes nothing. if people aren't using n lowsec systems now, they're not going to use n+3 or n-5. the issue isn't the number of systems. to say nothing of the utterly nonsensical mechanics you're proposing. what, established systems are going to be removed from regions? the pos's, assets, etc... will just have to transition/be lost/whatever? new systems will just spring up, randomly? you were also looking into the wrong patch of lowsec. check areas of high fw concentration of pipes like from purjola to the drone regions. the fact that you'll find people there is a good hint as to the direction lowsec can take. people not using space is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. it's not a problem. trying to 'solve' something that's not a problem isn't a path that's worth taking. making lowsec space into something that's worth holding is one issue, artificially trying to balance populations, just because, is quite another."
9/29/2010,there is something you need to remember about low sec. its not just what you can or cant do its how you play. it is true that most -10 players will spend the majority of time in low sec systems but others wont stay there 23/7. many other players will go to low sec to do something but the return to high sec for other activities or just simply dock up in a station and go afk. what i am trying to say is the low sec may seem less used than it may be. i personally rarely dock up in low sec i will usually head back to high sec for that.take high sec for example. you can pop your head into a high sec system and you might see 120 in system. a quick tour of the stations you will find that 80 or more of them are docked. im not just talking about trade hubs. keep moving around systems and often you will see the same thing. low sec doesnt quite work the same way.
9/29/2010,"this is very true. a lot of corps, particularly ones in the factional militias, will spend most of the time in high sec and only venture out for roams. doesnt mean they dont have an effect on lowsec though."
9/29/2010,"it also shows the nature of the beast. in lowsec there's often not a reason to put down stakes and claim a patch of dirt, other than to temporarily camp a gate (or hunt belts) to get some targets before a bigger force notices you and tries to farm you. unless and until there's a reason for people to set up shop in lowsec and park there for a while, there's really no change that we'll see. the best we can do is to herd targets into pirates' guns by forcing people to travel through lowsec, but that's an artificial and kluged solution. if, however, there was an actual point to holding lowsec space (say, fw participants who 'claim space' in lowsec earn discounts on pos operation costs and earn loyalty points, or what have you. pirates earn the right to fire on anybody who enters a system without taking sec status loss. drug manufacture clouds are moved from isolated pockets of nullsec to lowsec, etc...) then there might be an actual reason for corps to make a claim to space in lowsec. because, after all, if people aren't willing to value the space and fight for it, you're not really going to increase the number of people who want to be there and be fighting."
9/30/2010,+1 to this idea
9/30/2010,"good god, yes! been living out of a pos for over a year, and damn those things are annoying."
9/30/2010,"ok, i've completely skilled for this ship now. you can go ahead and remove the nerfs ccp.thanks for waiting!!!!"
9/30/2010,yes.fonts from russian translation look much better for me (the only reason i'm using russian ui). unfortunately they keep on translating stuff and i have to use english ui.
9/30/2010,"i dont get an agression timer for activating a local rep why should remote rep give an agression timer ?pvp should not be without risk.highsec wardec allready provide the safest pvp environment in game.easy assesment of enemy forces , concord providing protection from non war targets.no chance of getting hotdropped.no chance of getting bubbled and podded.right now neutral rr is one of the few way a defender can turn the tide on an attacker in high sec.sorry but i can not support your ""i want perfectly predictable pvp"" proposal.repping is repping whether remote or local and should not give an agression flag.i really hope ccp do not start designing pvp to accomadate the lowest common denominator the way they did with pve."
9/30/2010,yep.
9/30/2010,great list of improvements. fully supported.
9/30/2010,great idea!
9/30/2010,"convenience? in my eve? surely not.supported, though"
9/30/2010,"oh yes, please please please! this would be epic!"
9/30/2010,... thought this proposal sounded familiar. still supporting.
9/30/2010,"ok..i see lots of you made your bed now lie in it replies.. that's cool i can respect that. but again i was kinda looking for a way to retain some people who after a few months of playing the game come to the conclusion after really starting to understand the complexity of this game, that they want to head in a different direction. i'd rather try to keep them happy then watch them leave. my main arguement is that you can be really useful with a few million well placed skill points, and you could also be next to useless with 5 million poorly placed skill points. one time only skill remap with say a 2 million sp cap for the newer players would be helpful. after all it might take sometime for a new player to find their way into a decent corp with the vast knowledge base that the player owned corp can provide. being able to re-mold these new guys and set them down the right path and make them more useful and able to contribute in a meaningful fashion, i think would go along way to keeping them in the game. i say let them get into the game a little deeper before we lay the ungodly smack down on them. there will be plenty of time to watch them suffer later...lol"
9/30/2010,"i say this every time someone proposes this (or the whole let us buy skill points thing). and the reason is not ""that's the way it's always been"". the reason is that, quite simply, unlike other games like wow, in eve the choices you make have consequences - more importantly, they are persistent consequences and they follow you throughout your eve-life.and that's the way it should be."
9/30/2010,"there's another good reason not to implement anything like this.if you could redistribute your sp on a regular basis, you could simply learn high rank skills with maximized efficiency (like [racial] carrier/dreadnought etc).and then, once a year, simply push your points where you need them.i think this would be an unfair disadvantage to people who can't afford those skills..."
9/30/2010,"yeah, it would be cool to introduce this mechanic.ccp is all about correcting your (noob) mistakes, as evident in the neural remap mechanic that was introduced a while ago.although, make it come with a steep cost, or limit it to low-sp characters.like, a character that has less than 5 000 000 spor, only redistribute a percentage of your total spor, let you redistribute at will, although skills cost 30% more when you train them by respec. since sp really is one of the few things in eve that's hard to regenerate, that cost alone would deter many people from swapping all over the place, at least in the more expensive skills department."
9/30/2010,not sure if i heard correctly but i think plex were being used to remap as well as give game time on the test server.i may be wrong but it's worth a look into
9/30/2010,"if you're trying to target someone as you come out of warp / as they come out of warp / as they undock, you're often going to be spamming control click at them on the overview.problem is, this makes you approach them, because it registers as a double click, which isn't always what you want.suggestion: make holding now any shortcut key (including the new ones that were introduced on sisi to warp, orbit, align, etc) disable the double click to approach feature."
9/30/2010,"massive support for this, capslock is even needed for this occasion.cant tell you how many times ive been kiting a gang and then targetted a tackle burning towards me using ctrl click on the overview and then bloody turning around and approach them not wanting to."
9/30/2010,i think it was a good idea to implement them but for new players it is surely better when they start with learnings at lv4 so that they can conzentrate on there playing style. sry for my poor english
9/30/2010,"this is exactly my and many others concern.like some other poster said :""this is microtransactions, opening pandora's box tbh"""
9/30/2010,"there are a few main things i've heard from the wtf ccp this is bs side of the story, and i'll answer each of them here.1. it's an unfair advantage to players with rl money.ever since plex, players with rl money can buy isk, and isk has always been an advantage in eve. implants, expensive ships / mods, you name it.moreover, this is hardly an advantage. if anything, it can compensate for your lack of planning / common sense (ie you didn't optimize your training and train skills that require one attribute for one year, then skills that require another for the next year).2. it's a slippery slope.the slippery slope argument is a fallacy.you can't not want something on the basis that it might later lead to something else you don't want.you would be right if you could prove that accepting this will have as a direct, unstoppable consequence the introduction of plex for sp. but you can't. there's nothing to show that it won't just be plex for remap and nothing else.3. microtransactions.this is true.up to now, for every 15 dollars that ccp received, someone would get a month of gameplay, whereas with this, they will receive 15 dollars without giving a month of gameplay to someone in return.in that sense it is a ""micropayment"".that doesn't mean it's a bad idea.you can't just brandish the word micropayment as some evil that will ruin eve.there's nothing wrong with ccp selling other services than gametime, and they already do it. character transfers, portrait changes, corp logo changes. but more importantly: alt accounts.selling an alt account is not selling gametime. you're not getting an extra month by buying an alt account, you're buying the ability to train double the skills during a month of gametime you already have. and there is virtually no difference b/e having perfect manufacturing and sniper hac skills on one char and having them on two different chars, except that having them on two different chars lets you move them / use them independently and simultaneously, which is handy.in that sense, there already is something much much closer to plex for sp, and nobody seems to be too angry about it.if there's anything i've missed, please tell me."

9/30/2010,oh dear lord....no.
9/30/2010,"its not nearly the huge philosophical threshold being crossed that people are making it$ is already huge alternative in gaining game advantage in far greater ways. the advantage does not shatter existing character creation methodsan extra 10% or so in speed keeps character creation 90% the same  hardly enough to change strategy drastically. (explanations below) the new advantage offered is also available through game play by earning isk as opposed to requiring real money like a portrait change or the $20 fee youd pay to transfer a character.pretty much already plex = advantage . game play -> plex or rl $ -> plexi like to earn isk. trading is fun for me . ill be at over 100 billion isk 18 months in despite having used isk to pay for my  i might even pay to play the game just to trade. i wouldnt pay real money for more than 1 account thoughrather spend the money on my kids than be that self indulgent. extra game play != rl $ for me because i wouldnt make the choice to pay extra $ for extra accounts .all of the advantages that can come from using $ can also come from playing longer.if the ccp proposal were to only allow $ to get the remap advantage only people people paying extra would get that advantage and, id have some problem with that at least it would be a change.our player abilities within the game are the sum of all my characters on all my accounts. having a cloakie alt running dual boxed on the other side of the gate is a huge advantage . being able to use a 2 million sp character simalaltaneus ly is worth far more than an extra 2 million sp on a 25 million character.having trader/cloaky/cyno alt in almost each region makes me a lot more isk , can be very efficient time wise, and has large pvp advantages as well.sure, sometimes there is an advantage to having more skills: on one character 12 4 million sp characters dont add up to a nyx pilot , but lets face it there too most super-cap pilots are peoples alts either groomed by spending an extra 15$ a month or bought with isk earned in the game . (or groomed with plex earned in game or bought with real $ converted to isk)what types of ships you have in your hanger is a major game dynamic. flying more expensive ships can be an advantage.often paid for as it is with $ by pvpers . essentially that also means a game option to pay rl $ to avoid a part of the game that some find less fun.so, the long and short of it is.  using isk to buy remaps (plex = 350 million isk) really only changes one thing, it provides a very limited situational alternative to the character bazaar if a specific abilty is wanted in 10 to 30% less time training, depedning on how wrong they were specced at the start.i agree that it slightly alters a role play type of issue. i get the point about characters have historiesand have taken real time and human efforts to groom .. . but the change is only slight there: many characters for sale are already factory bred never having left hanger until they reach hulk, or 5-5 learning, or cap-ship ablities and have no real history. id also really dislike instant characters for all the reasons people listed earlier in this threadnaught . but characters would still take time to groom, but a training plan could go about 20% quicker maximum  but in all reality, if any player had been making even the most basic use of the existing remap mechanisms, the advantage would probably be less than 10%. thats hardly shattering the existing role play character development pattern.from a role play perpsective, giving people a bit of and edge to hold on to a character that they blew a remap on rather than trading/buying a different one to get to a ship sooner is probably has some positives too ideally from a rp perspective the person behind the chracter stays the sam"
9/30/2010,"in your absolutely worst case scenario.with no implants and no changes ever in base attributes and perfect changes by the person paying for remaps  the person paying more would train the same stuff in 80% of the time it took mr. no change..however. ive tried it on evemon . set up any logical training cue for over a year.and youll find that by optimizing attributes once at the very beginning and never changing the attributes again, you will save 10% . choose 5 years worth of skills even and find an optimum at the beginning. the skill attributes applied are not evenly distributed perception and intelligence are far overrepresented as primary attributes. with one initial change to mr. half-a-clue the difference goes from 24.2/19.36 to more like 24.2/21.29 mr. moneybags is training at 88% only saving 12 days/ 100 now. butis money bags really going to be on the ball enough to remap more than once a weekany time theres a minor change between a prerequisite and following skill ? i gotta think hed slip up a bit only from laziness even if cost was no object. say out of the 1.9 percent delta he got it 90% perfect. that would knock off basically the .2 from 24.2 but still be highly ambitious. with those changes to 21.29/24 its only looking 11 days out of 100.but, theres still more to the story. implants. lets just assume a low common denominator of basic +3 implants. we go to 24.29/27 . basically 90% 10 days per 100 saved by mr moneybags over mr. half a clue.if mr. half-a-clue had closer to a full clue and used his first couple remaps to his advantage he could definitely save 3 extra days out of those 10 per 100 . mr money bags would have something like a 7% advantage over mr. has-a-clue hardly a game breaker in a game where people with 8 months of play (or even a few months as a scout or something) play along side people with 3 years of training/play.i really doubt that mr money bags would be smart enough to pull it off, and if mr. has-a-clue sold some overpriced stuff to mr. moneybags, hed have enough to buy a extra remap every 6 months and probably cut mr money bags actually achieved advantage to a couple days per 100.mr. money bags might use his money in the game for a big advantage, but the really big advantages would come from multiple accounts, fancy ships bought with $>plex>isk and character purchases. hes not going to get far ahead of someone smart with a couple weeks a year extra training.while thats certainly an advantage its hardly an unworkable advantage .differences in sps are hardly game breaking or it would be impossible for people whod played 7 months to play along side people playing for years."

9/30/2010,"i disagree that this subsystem giving extra drones would be overpowered. remember, you're sacrificing that long range scrambler and blaster damage/tank for an extra mid and 120 extra dps, all be it drone dps which can be easily removed. also, the remaining 60% of your dps is with blasters and as we all know, unless you're holding the target by the throat with your bare hands sticking out of your pod window, you're not in range. maybe 50 mbit/50m3 is too much (drop it to 25/25 perhaps) but i'm still gonna stick to my original idea of additional drones.i agree that the legion is somewhat lacking but i haven't tried fiddling with that ship yet. i might have a poke around at some point."
9/30/2010,it would be nice if the drone system would actually be useful. right now it's not much better than a myrm.
9/30/2010,"some effects in eve are extremly annoying. they look terrible and also impair the lucidity in bigger engagements. for my understanding this is the case with especially sensor boosters, but also tracking computers, eccms etc. in fact all effects which add a disturbing ""aura"" of light around your ship. of course the client allows to disable effects, but this affects simply too much. there are some effects which are important to see in fights...like doomsdays, hictor bubbles or other tackling effects. it would be helpful to either remove those ""auras"" or add a seperate option to deactivate them without disabling all other effects.here is one example how it looks like in fleet-battles. its also bad for older graphics hardware."
9/30/2010,this. the things don't even pay attention to me telling them to go away when i shut off effects before a fight.
9/30/2010,no. whines like this are why we lost glorious engine trails. get a better rig.

9/30/2010,"well... they could create an optional background application. very small, low memory. that periodically checks for updates and downloads and install updates in the background when the player is not playing. especially during expansion updates because those tend to be very large.also, making updates available before expansions finish deployment for those with slower connections."

9/30/2010,"you'd only see your own bookmarks, so you'd only be able to grief yourself."
9/30/2010,weekly bump for attention.
9/30/2010,"i have personally anchored 5 poses in the same system at the same time myself, only minutes apart. what limits are you speaking of?"
9/30/2010,i wanted to propose a non log out when we switch characters with in our account. i have to log all the way out to switch to my alts . i propose a character screen that doesnt require a log out. now i know that 2 diffrent accounts require this but a main with 2 alts should be a faster switch. i hope to get supported for this.ty
9/30/2010,"i am simply proposing that the csm ask ccp to look at the current role and balance of dreadnaughts in eve.the are multiple threads discussing the issue. hp boost for caps threadbalance for dreadsnag needs more dpsnot all of these threads necessarily directly discuss the issues of dreads in the op but dreads and their roles and problems eventually come up.this is not to discuss or argue about super carriers. this is simply to acknowledge that dreads currently, are screwed. their roles are filled by something else or just non existent, or just plain not worth the isk to fill to the role. if you would like the csm to push for a review of dreadnaughts as they are in the current game, please support. (also i will be happy to add any other relevant threads to the list)."
9/30/2010,i would leave out the chic proposal. it is crap and not much related to dreads at all.
9/30/2010,done.
9/30/2010,id love to see a feature where offlined pos's will unanchor or become unaffiliated with the corp that launched them. make people take care of there stuff or lose it
9/30/2010,"i've had a few thoughts when it comes to abandoned pos.1) make them burn charters to stay anchored. charters represent factional parking permits. so occupying a moon, whether online or not, means that parking space is used. if they run out of charters, they unanchor*.or2) do away with charters, and instead charge a fee like office rent. if a corp can't afford it, or the corp ceases to exist, the pos rent goes unpaid and unanchors*.*for those who would say simply having the pos unanchor in place is unfair to the owners... replace ""unanchor"" with ""impounded"". the pos and all modules are confiscated, and stored at the station where the corp's hq is located. they have to pay a hefty fee for each item to be released from impound."
9/30/2010,"if it s abandoned you can wardec them and blow it up.chances are it is not abandoned, and you are just too new to know how things work around here.this is not a new topic."
9/30/2010,think your missing the point.blowing up pos's is boring i want to steal them. if i leave my car unatended with the alarm off it might not be there when i get back
9/30/2010,174 offline towers in lonetrek alone....list of towers in lonetrek
9/30/2010,"ahahahaha... i thank op for the laugh. i will be redirecting c&p readers shortly.to be just a bit constructive i will say, that in my oppinion this is not an exploit, but a very clever use of fleet mechanics. my reasoning for this not being an exploit is that it's never possible to force anybody into a fleet.if this is exploiting so is the cnr > raven contract scam.ed: typo"
9/30/2010,"not an exploit. the op would've been able to see that there was a constant session change in the fleet management window if he'd bothered to have it open, either by seeing his fleet position being altered or by the small timer icon on the top right."
9/30/2010,in eve are no exploids thats an random feature
9/30/2010,this is much of an exploit as apamming a dying ship with convo invites to prevent the pod from getting away...oh wait...
9/30/2010,"i like all the people calling this an exploit. i think ccp should deem stupidity an exploit and mass ban people like the op, for the betterment of eve."
9/30/2010,"i'm pretty sure it was both stupid and dangerous, and that you can't count."
9/30/2010,"dude, that's not an exploit. that is you not making smart decisions.(joining his fleet)"
9/30/2010,"first time posting on the forums, so it goes without saying it's also my first time posting in the assembly hall.... so, sorry if i've missed stuff...essentially, i like the idea of evegate. it's a cool idea that i can communicate and interact with my corp/alliance/general eve buddies from anywhere that i have a browser.... however, there seems to be very little reason to do so. i can check my mail, and that's about it. basically, what we have is a poor man's facebook, but for eve (as we all know from the nickname ""spacebook"") so let's look to facebook for some of the things that cause people to use it.... alright, so the modern facebook is a nightmare filled with unwanted friend/event/group/app/etc invites... but what about the original facebook that was strictly a communication tool?how about starting with simple things - like a chat service that's integrated with eve? (imagine corp chat being accessible from evegate, as well as private chats!) i know that would get me logging into evegate a lot more.or even more simple.... how about the option to receive email alerts for things like events and evemail? that way we would at least know when we'd find something interesting if we checked evegate...just a few ideas kicking around. i'm sure others can come up with better ones, but as i didn't see anything in the hall i thought i'd start the ball rolling.cheers!~namy"
9/30/2010,"look i no this gets emo rage touted everytime somthing goes wrong, but i have to say, in the real world if a company cant manage its down times effectivly and get them up and running after essentail maintenance within their own set times frames then said company would be in serious trouble.i would like to put it to the csm that ccp is far to rapped up in abitary deadlines stemming from its own general failures in the last few years. i would like to put forward these points:1) ccp should be made in some manor (as deemed by the csm) to be held more accountable to its client base (ie game ussrs). we pay for this game, yes we choose to, but ccp has adopted a very 'our way or no way' attitude to customer relations. in the long run this will loose player base support and could impact on the game we know and love2) ccp are wrapped up in so many arbitary projects and time scales it consistently finds it impossible to complete any of them a) on time b) in a manor that is fit for purpose.i would site the recent lag monstor and the latest patch as examples. ccp failed to listen to its player base for too long when we told them about the lag in fleet ops. the first month or so of eves response was not far of the oft touted line 'there are no bugs in eve, only features'. when ccp did finally get around to dealing with it their response was too slow and undermanned - it still is imho. ccp has not devoted enough resources to it (coz they are busy with other 'priority' projects - eg dust and ambulation) which is resulting in a poor gaming expereince for many. their latest patch is a clasic example, it took hours longer than expected due to what can only be assumed to be a rush to get it deployed without proper v&v processes to ensure its smooth transition, and even after a failed deployment that could not keep to timescales eve is now riddled with more glitches and bugs than it was 12 hours ago before the patch.with reference to the twice yearly new content deployments. am i the only one that would quite happily say to ccp 'look foget all new content in 2011, just concentrate on fixing the game you have'? it has been becoming more and more apparent that new deployments are not fit for purpose at the time of deployment and commonly result in a wave of addition bugs that need to be fixed. again it seems that ccp's drive to get 2 new deployments of new content each year is resulting in performance/reliability issues for the game itself.in review, csm please:1) make ccp acountable for poor customer service and response and more acountable to us - ccp's clients.2) get ccp to stop rushing to meet deadlines it seems unable to meet, whether patch deployment, patch instalation, or new content deployment. its resulting in a gradually diminishing gaming experience.3) get ccp to stop focusing on new in game/out of game content and just get whats there now to work properly - even at the expense of delays or cancelations of new contnet and deployments4) stop ccp from wasting time and resources on dust and ambulation and fix whats out there now.please csm, this is not emo rage - this is a problem, and while many people might defend ccp, if you did a straw poll of new content vs fix whats there, i think ccp and csm may well be supprised with the results!"
9/30/2010,since all his and drake draconis' posts following chromo's are either utterly ******ed trolling and absolutely annoying to read or a clear troll with no purpose other than to allow him to link to his thread in the assembly hall calling for a ban of chromo i would like to propose to ban him and drake dracons alongside chromo so that the assembly hall has three ******s less to read about.discuss.
9/30/2010,what is this i don't even
9/30/2010,is this what you are blabbering on about?
9/30/2010,just reported your thread. enjoy your ban
9/30/2010,"can someone with a brain, decent looks, and a higher education please respond to my query? it makes no sense at all to not allow moon mining in wormhole space. thanks,strato"
9/30/2010,"i was the first poster. also, it makes perfect sense not to allow it. c1s through c4s would pretty much be free cash machines."
9/30/2010,so i guess ccp has no brains.....they are fugly....and have no higher education to speak of.cause they said no.go away troll and stay in your dank dark hole.
9/30/2010,well because wh space are relatively secure compared to true 0.0if you can tell my how it would be possible to cyno a cap. fleet in and kill a heavily defended moon mining pos please do so. you dont pay for sov. in a wh either so all in all it would be a relatively safe cash cow. if you would like to have the isk from moon mining become a sov. holding alliance in 0.0 and defend your space. earn the moon you want to make isk from but of cause you would have to do some pvp to defend your space not like in carebear 0.0 (wh space)
9/30/2010,"allow moon mining, but only give the wh moons crap minerals. no r32/r64 to make bajilions of isk for little effort, just a bit to offset the fuel costs. or, even better, create something entirely new to be mined from wh moons."
9/30/2010,"translation : you cant have any moons , when you show up near one moon my 200 titan fleet will insta kill you it is my gold and mine alone so gtfo ."
9/30/2010,"there are several smaller alliances without big cap. fleets that have moons, they can mine. they are often pets of bigger alliances or someone that have shown their worth in combat, and been given space by a big power block or actually been strong enough to take the space themselves. your corp. could also join a space holding alliance and over time prove yourself, so the alliance will give your corp. moons. the fact is that the alliances/corps. that actually have moons, have mostly earned them in some way or another. if you want something in eve earn or take it!"
9/30/2010,no.
9/30/2010,"in eve griefing is a feature, not a problem. get over it."
9/30/2010,"heads up op if i find you i'm suicide bombing you in a disco bs. loss is a part of the game, don't be a pubbie and deal with it."
9/30/2010,"i wondering if there is a way to see on the potraits in allaince /corp window when someone goes afk , like command/afk.... then i or you woulnd need to waste our time trying to talk to somebody online but afk , plus i be able to set my self afk . (without having to click and read someone bio ).thank you"
9/30/2010,"no, unfortunately there isn't, and this doesn't belong in the assembly hall. for future reference, questions like this should go into either general discussion or new citizens q&a."
9/30/2010,"now if he wants to start a proposal for an afk indicator, he could fix the title and op. but thats more lag, and more lag = bad.but i think it would be good, i hate talking to someone just to never see a reply...."
9/30/2010,"turn on timestamps...then you will be able to tell when that person spoke last.if you're replying to something they said hours ago, chances are they're gone."
9/30/2010,"well ive had this idea for a while that this weapon should have several difrent uses, its supposed to be the ultimate weapon out there so i think it should be possible to have difrent uses so here are a few i came up withtargeted script: dd is as it is nowaoe script: dd do something like 50k damage over a large area like 200km around titan, a weapon against drones and small ships.shield disrupt script: a emp burst that takes out an amount of shield that and stops shield recharge for 5min. sensorburst script: decloaks everything in system, cloak can be initiated again on the normal recloak timers.energynova script: neutralizing cap for an amount of time say 30 sec any ship on grid gets neutralized.gravity script: when activated it webs everything on grid for 60% speed, lasts 1minjust a few ideas i had, what do people think?"
9/30/2010,i think they are terrible ideas and you should feel bad for writing them down.
9/30/2010,i think this will go well considering the reasons why ccp changed the dd from aoe to targeted weapon. please next time read up on why things where changed in the first place.
9/30/2010,"i think they need to change the name from ""doomsday"" to ""death ray"".it used to be aoe pain to all on grid. now it's pain to a single target."
9/30/2010,thanks shah. i appreciate the lesson.
9/30/2010,"not yet anyway and yes, they do get 'flagged' for a whole 15 minutes which would be more than enough time to kill them if remote support affected docking ability the thread is superfluous as the neutral-rr issue has been brought up a billion times already and the csm are well aware of it as is ccp i reckon."
9/30/2010,difficult issue to balance..there is nothing inherently wrong with using nuet reps..its just a bit lacking in risk!
9/30/2010,"do you get ganked much?keep posting on the forums like an ass , people remember asshats like you, and i am pretty sure you will never be able to undock without someone trying to pod you."
9/30/2010,and people report me for trolling
9/30/2010,i'm a bloody major carebear and even i am starting to want to shoot him. lol
9/30/2010,"proposal, implement a block feature on the forums.screw it, i'll report him."
9/30/2010,i personally hate fowl language and would like to see some sort of filters incorporated into the chat channels.this would also make the game more family orientated.sorry if this has already been proposed.....
9/30/2010,"i'm really not that fond of birds clogging up my chat channels either, but as they are apparently paying subscribers...sorry, i had to do that. the word you are apparently looking for is foul, not fowl.that aside, be mature and ignore the parts you don't like. it's pretty much what the rest of us do."

9/30/2010,"im sure this is not the first or last time that this topic has been discussed, however i see no talk of it getting any better or in the pipeline of fixes.it is easy to complain about things that are missing or redundant in eve but let it be said that eve is the best mmorpg around and ccp have and continue to do a great job, so thanks for that!but, back to the topic at hand. we (eve players) need alliance hangers and offices. now! and it is well over due. given the amount of time and development spent on endeavours to expand the game (such as incarna), i fail to see why this has not been fix yet!lets ask the question which would you prefer? being able to walk around stations in an internet spaceship game or having access to alliance assets?pos fuel/modsmining materials/mods/itemslabs/assembly arrays alliance ships/ship replacementfleet loadoutsfleet loot/mods these are just a few reasons why alliance hangers and offices are so important to the game. alongside this would be logs of who, what and when items were removed or placed in all hangers and ship maintenance arrays.if im not mistaken alliance members have access to ship maintenance arrays should the pos owner allow it. please explain to me why this cannot be extended to the alliance hangers (perhaps a new pos item).again i could be wrong but most if not all alliances have a central base of operations (more than one if that said alliance holds a lot of sov). alliance offices would enable access to the alliance hangers and can be managed using a similar ui to the corporation management window. from such ui the alliance leader you can now allow which corps has limited or full access and what level of management is required at a corporation level to access the alliance hangers.and finally logs! the logs are there, somewhere in the giant void that is the eve online database. lets make them exportable. evehq would be a great interface for hanger/asset logs, or perhaps in a similar way to character management page on the eve online main website. i dont know how but there must be a way!in closing, ccp we understand the importance of creating additional revenue streams by expanding on what is already a great game. however there are things we want and things we need (such is life).if i am not the only one who feels like corp/alliance management tools needs work or i need an education in (know your place *****) please post herei look forward to a friendly if not frank discussion.mike"
9/30/2010,"see, the problem is that you cited a thread started by cromo effect."
9/30/2010,"if it ****es you off, report it.works for me."
9/30/2010,"yes, when i repackage a ship i normally have other mods in my hanger that i don't want to repackage too (like damaged drones) and it is frustrating to unselect everyone of those by hand."
9/30/2010,wormhole space is supposed to be random you moron.....not predictable.not supported.this is why ---> why cromo shouldn't be allowed to post.
9/30/2010,"i've been reflexively against this sort of thing. i was against plex when they first came.but ya know, i'm just not seeing why this particular thing is so nightmarish.an rough equivalent would be selling a plex and then getting implants with the money. the effect obviously wouldn't be as pronounced, depending, but the principle is pretty much the same.as it stands, someone can sell x number of plex, buy some hugely skilled character and be rolling around with 100 million skillpoints. no problem. and yes, of course it's a problem, but it was sort of hobson's choice for ccp and i'd rather have them be in control of the whole thing than shady rmt people from uzbekistan.i just don't think this is the end of the world. anything like this should be carefully analyzed, however, because it would be very easy to turn the game into a pay-per-click korean mmo. depending on how the whole microtransaction thing works out for them this could be financially seductive for ccp as well."
9/30/2010,a true politician.
9/30/2010,somebody sold you a bitter vet status symbol and told you it was a 'specialised' 'endgame' ship. sorry for your loss.
9/30/2010,i probably deserved that barb
9/30/2010,this would encourage suicide by killing with alts
9/30/2010,"bounty schemes of all sorts are infinitely open to abuse; any time you can be both the victim and the killer, and make isk off of it, players will find a way to game the system. transferable kill rights (that you can post on contracts) might help, but who knows."
